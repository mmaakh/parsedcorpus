Parsing [sent. 1 len. 37]: Great Expectations by Charles Dickens Chapter I My father 's family name being Pirrip , and my Christian name Philip , my infant tongue could make of both names nothing longer or more explicit than Pip .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 14]: So , I called myself Pip , and came to be called Pip .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 30]: I give Pirrip as my father 's family name , on the authority of his tombstone and my sister , -- Mrs. Joe Gargery , who married the blacksmith .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 47]: As I never saw my father or my mother , and never saw any likeness of either of them -LRB- for their days were long before the days of photographs -RRB- , my first fancies regarding what they were like were unreasonably derived from their tombstones .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 31]: The shape of the letters on my father 's , gave me an odd idea that he was a square , stout , dark man , with curly black hair .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 31]: From the character and turn of the inscription , `` Also Georgiana Wife of the Above , '' I drew a childish conclusion that my mother was freckled and sickly .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 94]: To five little stone lozenges , each about a foot and a half long , which were arranged in a neat row beside their grave , and were sacred to the memory of five little brothers of mine , -- who gave up trying to get a living , exceedingly early in that universal struggle , -- I am indebted for a belief I religiously entertained that they had all been born on their backs with their hands in their trousers-pockets , and had never taken them out in this state of existence .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 24]: Ours was the marsh country , down by the river , within , as the river wound , twenty miles of the sea .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 27]: My first most vivid and broad impression of the identity of things seems to me to have been gained on a memorable raw afternoon towards evening .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 144]: At such a time I found out for certain that this bleak place overgrown with nettles was the churchyard ; and that Philip Pirrip , late of this parish , and also Georgiana wife of the above , were dead and buried ; and that Alexander , Bartholomew , Abraham , Tobias , and Roger , infant children of the aforesaid , were also dead and buried ; and that the dark flat wilderness beyond the churchyard , intersected with dikes and mounds and gates , with scattered cattle feeding on it , was the marshes ; and that the low leaden line beyond was the river ; and that the distant savage lair from which the wind was rushing was the sea ; and that the small bundle of shivers growing afraid of it all and beginning to cry , was Pip .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 6]: `` Hold your noise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 22]: cried a terrible voice , as a man started up from among the graves at the side of the church porch .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 16]: `` Keep still , you little devil , or I 'll cut your throat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 17]: A fearful man , all in coarse gray , with a great iron on his leg .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 21]: A man with no hat , and with broken shoes , and with an old rag tied round his head .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 61]: A man who had been soaked in water , and smothered in mud , and lamed by stones , and cut by flints , and stung by nettles , and torn by briars ; who limped , and shivered , and glared , and growled ; and whose teeth chattered in his head as he seized me by the chin .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 14]: Do n't cut my throat , sir , '' I pleaded in terror .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 10]: `` Pray do n't do it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 7]: `` Tell us your name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 4]: `` Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 6]: `` Pip , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 13]: `` Once more , '' said the man , staring at me .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 6]: `` Give it mouth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 3]: `` Pip .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 5]: Pip , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 12]: `` Show us where you live , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 7]: `` Pint out the place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 26]: I pointed to where our village lay , on the flat in-shore among the alder-trees and pollards , a mile or more from the church .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 21]: The man , after looking at me for a moment , turned me upside down , and emptied my pockets .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 11]: There was nothing in them but a piece of bread .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 62]: When the church came to itself , -- for he was so sudden and strong that he made it go head over heels before me , and I saw the steeple under my feet , -- when the church came to itself , I say , I was seated on a high tombstone , trembling while he ate the bread ravenously .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 24]: `` You young dog , '' said the man , licking his lips , `` what fat cheeks you ha ' got . ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 21]: I believe they were fat , though I was at that time undersized for my years , and not strong .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 37]: `` Darn me if I could n't eat em , '' said the man , with a threatening shake of his head , `` and if I ha n't half a mind to ` t ! ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 39]: I earnestly expressed my hope that he would n't , and held tighter to the tombstone on which he had put me ; partly , to keep myself upon it ; partly , to keep myself from crying .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 6]: `` Now lookee here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 7]: `` Where 's your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 6]: `` There , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 16]: He started , made a short run , and stopped and looked over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 6]: `` There , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 4]: I timidly explained .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 4]: `` Also Georgiana .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 6]: That 's my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 6]: said he , coming back .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 11]: `` And is that your father alonger your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir , '' said I ; `` him too ; late of this parish . ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 6]: he muttered then , considering .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 27]: `` Who d'ye live with , -- supposin ' you 're kindly let to live , which I ha n't made up my mind about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 23]: `` My sister , sir , -- Mrs. Joe Gargery , -- wife of Joe Gargery , the blacksmith , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 6]: `` Blacksmith , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 7]: And looked down at his leg .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 56]: After darkly looking at his leg and me several times , he came closer to my tombstone , took me by both arms , and tilted me back as far as he could hold me ; so that his eyes looked most powerfully down into mine , and mine looked most helplessly up into his .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 22]: `` Now lookee here , '' he said , `` the question being whether you 're to be let to live .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 8]: You know what a file is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 9]: `` And you know what wittles is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 24]: After each question he tilted me over a little more , so as to give me a greater sense of helplessness and danger .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 8]: `` You get me a file . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 5]: He tilted me again .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 8]: `` And you get me wittles . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 5]: He tilted me again .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 9]: `` You bring 'em both to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 5]: He tilted me again .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 12]: `` Or I 'll have your heart and liver out . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 5]: He tilted me again .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 49]: I was dreadfully frightened , and so giddy that I clung to him with both hands , and said , `` If you would kindly please to let me keep upright , sir , perhaps I should n't be sick , and perhaps I could attend more . ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 20]: He gave me a most tremendous dip and roll , so that the church jumped over its own weathercock .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 44]: Then , he held me by the arms , in an upright position on the top of the stone , and went on in these fearful terms : -- `` You bring me , to-morrow morning early , that file and them wittles .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 14]: You bring the lot to me , at that old Battery over yonder .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 41]: You do it , and you never dare to say a word or dare to make a sign concerning your having seen such a person as me , or any person sumever , and you shall be let to live .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 36]: You fail , or you go from my words in any partickler , no matter how small it is , and your heart and your liver shall be tore out , roasted , and ate .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 14]: Now , I ai n't alone , as you may think I am .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 20]: There 's a young man hid with me , in comparison with which young man I am a Angel .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 9]: That young man hears the words I speak .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 27]: That young man has a secret way pecooliar to himself , of getting at a boy , and at his heart , and at his liver .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 17]: It is in wain for a boy to attempt to hide himself from that young man .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 51]: A boy may lock his door , may be warm in bed , may tuck himself up , may draw the clothes over his head , may think himself comfortable and safe , but that young man will softly creep and creep his way to him and tear him open .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 20]: I am a keeping that young man from harming of you at the present moment , with great difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 15]: I find it wery hard to hold that young man off of your inside .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 8]: Now , what do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 38]: I said that I would get him the file , and I would get him what broken bits of food I could , and I would come to him at the Battery , early in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 12]: `` Say Lord strike you dead if you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 10]: I said so , and he took me down .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 28]: `` Now , '' he pursued , `` you remember what you 've undertook , and you remember that young man , and you get home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 10]: `` Goo-good night , sir , '' I faltered .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 6]: `` Much of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 12]: said he , glancing about him over the cold wet flat .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 8]: `` I wish I was a frog .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 5]: Or a eel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 35]: At the same time , he hugged his shuddering body in both his arms , -- clasping himself , as if to hold himself together , -- and limped towards the low church wall .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 61]: As I saw him go , picking his way among the nettles , and among the brambles that bound the green mounds , he looked in my young eyes as if he were eluding the hands of the dead people , stretching up cautiously out of their graves , to get a twist upon his ankle and pull him in .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 33]: When he came to the low church wall , he got over it , like a man whose legs were numbed and stiff , and then turned round to look for me .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 22]: When I saw him turning , I set my face towards home , and made the best use of my legs .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 58]: But presently I looked over my shoulder , and saw him going on again towards the river , still hugging himself in both arms , and picking his way with his sore feet among the great stones dropped into the marshes here and there , for stepping-places when the rains were heavy or the tide was in .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 55]: The marshes were just a long black horizontal line then , as I stopped to look after him ; and the river was just another horizontal line , not nearly so broad nor yet so black ; and the sky was just a row of long angry red lines and dense black lines intermixed .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 77]: On the edge of the river I could faintly make out the only two black things in all the prospect that seemed to be standing upright ; one of these was the beacon by which the sailors steered , -- like an unhooped cask upon a pole , -- an ugly thing when you were near it ; the other , a gibbet , with some chains hanging to it which had once held a pirate .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 32]: The man was limping on towards this latter , as if he were the pirate come to life , and come down , and going back to hook himself up again .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 33]: It gave me a terrible turn when I thought so ; and as I saw the cattle lifting their heads to gaze after him , I wondered whether they thought so too .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 18]: I looked all round for the horrible young man , and could see no signs of him .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 13]: But now I was frightened again , and ran home without stopping .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 40]: Chapter II My sister , Mrs. Joe Gargery , was more than twenty years older than I , and had established a great reputation with herself and the neighbors because she had brought me up `` by hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 58]: Having at that time to find out for myself what the expression meant , and knowing her to have a hard and heavy hand , and to be much in the habit of laying it upon her husband as well as upon me , I supposed that Joe Gargery and I were both brought up by hand .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 28]: She was not a good-looking woman , my sister ; and I had a general impression that she must have made Joe Gargery marry her by hand .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 41]: Joe was a fair man , with curls of flaxen hair on each side of his smooth face , and with eyes of such a very undecided blue that they seemed to have somehow got mixed with their own whites .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 29]: He was a mild , good-natured , sweet-tempered , easy-going , foolish , dear fellow , -- a sort of Hercules in strength , and also in weakness .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 39]: My sister , Mrs. Joe , with black hair and eyes , had such a prevailing redness of skin that I sometimes used to wonder whether it was possible she washed herself with a nutmeg-grater instead of soap .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 41]: She was tall and bony , and almost always wore a coarse apron , fastened over her figure behind with two loops , and having a square impregnable bib in front , that was stuck full of pins and needles .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 24]: She made it a powerful merit in herself , and a strong reproach against Joe , that she wore this apron so much .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 40]: Though I really see no reason why she should have worn it at all ; or why , if she did wear it at all , she should not have taken it off , every day of her life .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 32]: Joe 's forge adjoined our house , which was a wooden house , as many of the dwellings in our country were , -- most of them , at that time .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 23]: When I ran home from the churchyard , the forge was shut up , and Joe was sitting alone in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 43]: Joe and I being fellow-sufferers , and having confidences as such , Joe imparted a confidence to me , the moment I raised the latch of the door and peeped in at him opposite to it , sitting in the chimney corner .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 16]: `` Mrs. Joe has been out a dozen times , looking for you , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 14]: And she 's out now , making it a baker 's dozen . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 5]: `` Is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 23]: `` Yes , Pip , '' said Joe ; `` and what 's worse , she 's got Tickler with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 26]: At this dismal intelligence , I twisted the only button on my waistcoat round and round , and looked in great depression at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 17]: Tickler was a wax-ended piece of cane , worn smooth by collision with my tickled frame .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 28]: `` She sot down , '' said Joe , `` and she got up , and she made a grab at Tickler , and she Ram-paged out .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 35]: That 's what she did , '' said Joe , slowly clearing the fire between the lower bars with the poker , and looking at it ; `` she Ram-paged out , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 10]: `` Has she been gone long , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 19]: I always treated him as a larger species of child , and as no more than my equal .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 32]: `` Well , '' said Joe , glancing up at the Dutch clock , `` she 's been on the Ram-page , this last spell , about five minutes , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 5]: She 's a coming !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 16]: Get behind the door , old chap , and have the jack-towel betwixt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 5]: I took the advice .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 32]: My sister , Mrs. Joe , throwing the door wide open , and finding an obstruction behind it , immediately divined the cause , and applied Tickler to its further investigation .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 46]: She concluded by throwing me -- I often served as a connubial missile -- at Joe , who , glad to get hold of me on any terms , passed me on into the chimney and quietly fenced me up there with his great leg .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 11]: `` Where have you been , you young monkey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 8]: said Mrs. Joe , stamping her foot .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 43]: `` Tell me directly what you 've been doing to wear me away with fret and fright and worrit , or I 'd have you out of that corner if you was fifty Pips , and he was five hundred Gargerys . ''
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 22]: `` I have only been to the churchyard , '' said I , from my stool , crying and rubbing myself .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 4]: `` Churchyard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 4]: repeated my sister .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 21]: `` If it war n't for me you 'd have been to the churchyard long ago , and stayed there .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 8]: Who brought you up by hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 22]: `` You did , '' said I. `` And why did I do it , I should like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 4]: exclaimed my sister .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 10]: I whimpered , `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 6]: `` I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 4]: said my sister .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 8]: `` I 'd never do it again !
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 4]: I know that .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 18]: I may truly say I 've never had this apron of mine off since born you were .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 22]: It 's bad enough to be a blacksmith 's wife -LRB- and him a Gargery -RRB- without being your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 14]: My thoughts strayed from that question as I looked disconsolately at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 47]: For the fugitive out on the marshes with the ironed leg , the mysterious young man , the file , the food , and the dreadful pledge I was under to commit a larceny on those sheltering premises , rose before me in the avenging coals .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 10]: said Mrs. Joe , restoring Tickler to his station .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 5]: `` Churchyard , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 10]: You may well say churchyard , you two . ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 15]: One of us , by the by , had not said it at all .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 29]: `` You 'll drive me to the churchyard betwixt you , one of these days , and O , a pr-r-recious pair you 'd be without me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 46]: As she applied herself to set the tea-things , Joe peeped down at me over his leg , as if he were mentally casting me and himself up , and calculating what kind of pair we practically should make , under the grievous circumstances foreshadowed .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 32]: After that , he sat feeling his right-side flaxen curls and whisker , and following Mrs. Joe about with his blue eyes , as his manner always was at squally times .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 19]: My sister had a trenchant way of cutting our bread and butter for us , that never varied .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 40]: First , with her left hand she jammed the loaf hard and fast against her bib , -- where it sometimes got a pin into it , and sometimes a needle , which we afterwards got into our mouths .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 58]: Then she took some butter -LRB- not too much -RRB- on a knife and spread it on the loaf , in an apothecary kind of way , as if she were making a plaster , -- using both sides of the knife with a slapping dexterity , and trimming and moulding the butter off round the crust .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 54]: Then , she gave the knife a final smart wipe on the edge of the plaster , and then sawed a very thick round off the loaf : which she finally , before separating from the loaf , hewed into two halves , of which Joe got one , and I the other .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 17]: On the present occasion , though I was hungry , I dared not eat my slice .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 24]: I felt that I must have something in reserve for my dreadful acquaintance , and his ally the still more dreadful young man .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 26]: I knew Mrs. Joe 's housekeeping to be of the strictest kind , and that my larcenous researches might find nothing available in the safe .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 18]: Therefore I resolved to put my hunk of bread and butter down the leg of my trousers .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 18]: The effort of resolution necessary to the achievement of this purpose I found to be quite awful .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 30]: It was as if I had to make up my mind to leap from the top of a high house , or plunge into a great depth of water .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 12]: And it was made the more difficult by the unconscious Joe .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 52]: In our already-mentioned freemasonry as fellow-sufferers , and in his good-natured companionship with me , it was our evening habit to compare the way we bit through our slices , by silently holding them up to each other 's admiration now and then , -- which stimulated us to new exertions .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 53]: To-night , Joe several times invited me , by the display of his fast diminishing slice , to enter upon our usual friendly competition ; but he found me , each time , with my yellow mug of tea on one knee , and my untouched bread and butter on the other .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 32]: At last , I desperately considered that the thing I contemplated must be done , and that it had best be done in the least improbable manner consistent with the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 24]: I took advantage of a moment when Joe had just looked at me , and got my bread and butter down my leg .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 34]: Joe was evidently made uncomfortable by what he supposed to be my loss of appetite , and took a thoughtful bite out of his slice , which he did n't seem to enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 29]: He turned it about in his mouth much longer than usual , pondering over it a good deal , and after all gulped it down like a pill .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 42]: He was about to take another bite , and had just got his head on one side for a good purchase on it , when his eye fell on me , and he saw that my bread and butter was gone .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 29]: The wonder and consternation with which Joe stopped on the threshold of his bite and stared at me , were too evident to escape my sister 's observation .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 12]: said she , smartly , as she put down her cup .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 8]: `` I say , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 13]: muttered Joe , shaking his head at me in very serious remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 6]: `` Pip , old chap !
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 7]: You 'll do yourself a mischief .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 5]: It 'll stick somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 10]: You ca n't have chawed it , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 9]: repeated my sister , more sharply than before .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 28]: `` If you can cough any trifle on it up , Pip , I 'd recommend you to do it , '' said Joe , all aghast .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 14]: `` Manners is manners , but still your elth 's your elth . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 49]: By this time , my sister was quite desperate , so she pounced on Joe , and , taking him by the two whiskers , knocked his head for a little while against the wall behind him , while I sat in the corner , looking guiltily on .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 29]: `` Now , perhaps you 'll mention what 's the matter , '' said my sister , out of breath , `` you staring great stuck pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 21]: Joe looked at her in a helpless way , then took a helpless bite , and looked at me again .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 57]: `` You know , Pip , '' said Joe , solemnly , with his last bite in his cheek , and speaking in a confidential voice , as if we two were quite alone , `` you and me is always friends , and I 'd be the last to tell upon you , any time .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 33]: But such a -- '' he moved his chair and looked about the floor between us , and then again at me -- `` such a most oncommon Bolt as that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 10]: `` Been bolting his food , has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 4]: cried my sister .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 78]: `` You know , old chap , '' said Joe , looking at me , and not at Mrs. Joe , with his bite still in his cheek , `` I Bolted , myself , when I was your age -- frequent -- and as a boy I 've been among a many Bolters ; but I never see your Bolting equal yet , Pip , and it 's a mercy you ai n't Bolted dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 33]: My sister made a dive at me , and fished me up by the hair , saying nothing more than the awful words , `` You come along and be dosed . ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 38]: Some medical beast had revived Tar-water in those days as a fine medicine , and Mrs. Joe always kept a supply of it in the cupboard ; having a belief in its virtues correspondent to its nastiness .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 34]: At the best of times , so much of this elixir was administered to me as a choice restorative , that I was conscious of going about , smelling like a new fence .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 48]: On this particular evening the urgency of my case demanded a pint of this mixture , which was poured down my throat , for my greater comfort , while Mrs. Joe held my head under her arm , as a boot would be held in a bootjack .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 41]: Joe got off with half a pint ; but was made to swallow that -LRB- much to his disturbance , as he sat slowly munching and meditating before the fire -RRB- , `` because he had had a turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 21]: Judging from myself , I should say he certainly had a turn afterwards , if he had had none before .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 49]: Conscience is a dreadful thing when it accuses man or boy ; but when , in the case of a boy , that secret burden co-operates with another secret burden down the leg of his trousers , it is -LRB- as I can testify -RRB- a great punishment .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 74]: The guilty knowledge that I was going to rob Mrs. Joe -- I never thought I was going to rob Joe , for I never thought of any of the housekeeping property as his -- united to the necessity of always keeping one hand on my bread and butter as I sat , or when I was ordered about the kitchen on any small errand , almost drove me out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 55]: Then , as the marsh winds made the fire glow and flare , I thought I heard the voice outside , of the man with the iron on his leg who had sworn me to secrecy , declaring that he could n't and would n't starve until to-morrow , but must be fed now .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 54]: At other times , I thought , What if the young man who was with so much difficulty restrained from imbruing his hands in me should yield to a constitutional impatience , or should mistake the time , and should think himself accredited to my heart and liver to-night , instead of to-morrow !
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 18]: If ever anybody 's hair stood on end with terror , mine must have done so then .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 9]: But , perhaps , nobody 's ever did ?
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 29]: It was Christmas Eve , and I had to stir the pudding for next day , with a copper-stick , from seven to eight by the Dutch clock .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 47]: I tried it with the load upon my leg -LRB- and that made me think afresh of the man with the load on his leg -RRB- , and found the tendency of exercise to bring the bread and butter out at my ankle , quite unmanageable .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 17]: Happily I slipped away , and deposited that part of my conscience in my garret bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 4]: `` Hark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 36]: said I , when I had done my stirring , and was taking a final warm in the chimney corner before being sent up to bed ; `` was that great guns , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 8]: `` There 's another conwict off . ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 9]: `` What does that mean , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 19]: said I. Mrs. Joe , who always took explanations upon herself , said , snappishly , `` Escaped .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 3]: Escaped . ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 6]: Administering the definition like Tar-water .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 31]: While Mrs. Joe sat with her head bending over her needlework , I put my mouth into the forms of saying to Joe , `` What 's a convict ? ''
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 31]: Joe put his mouth into the forms of returning such a highly elaborate answer , that I could make out nothing of it but the single word `` Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 19]: `` There was a conwict off last night , '' said Joe , aloud , `` after sunset-gun .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 7]: And they fired warning of him .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 12]: And now it appears they 're firing warning of another . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 6]: `` Who 's firing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 26]: said I. `` Drat that boy , '' interposed my sister , frowning at me over her work , `` what a questioner he is .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 13]: Ask no questions , and you 'll be told no lies . ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 28]: It was not very polite to herself , I thought , to imply that I should be told lies by her even if I did ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 10]: But she never was polite unless there was company .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 39]: At this point Joe greatly augmented my curiosity by taking the utmost pains to open his mouth very wide , and to put it into the form of a word that looked to me like `` sulks . ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 23]: Therefore , I naturally pointed to Mrs. Joe , and put my mouth into the form of saying , `` her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 32]: But Joe would n't hear of that , at all , and again opened his mouth very wide , and shook the form of a most emphatic word out of it .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 9]: But I could make nothing of the word .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 34]: `` Mrs. Joe , '' said I , as a last resort , `` I should like to know -- if you would n't much mind -- where the firing comes from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 7]: `` Lord bless the boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: exclaimed my sister , as if she did n't quite mean that but rather the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 6]: `` From the Hulks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 4]: `` Oh-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 7]: said I , looking at Joe .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 4]: `` Hulks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 21]: Joe gave a reproachful cough , as much as to say , `` Well , I told you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 9]: `` And please , what 's Hulks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 12]: said I. `` That 's the way with this boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 20]: exclaimed my sister , pointing me out with her needle and thread , and shaking her head at me .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 15]: `` Answer him one question , and he 'll ask you a dozen directly .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 12]: Hulks are prison-ships , right ` cross th ' meshes . ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 12]: We always used that name for marshes , in our country .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 17]: `` I wonder who 's put into prison-ships , and why they 're put there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 13]: said I , in a general way , and with quiet desperation .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 12]: It was too much for Mrs. Joe , who immediately rose .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 29]: `` I tell you what , young fellow , '' said she , `` I did n't bring you up by hand to badger people 's lives out .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 14]: It would be blame to me and not praise , if I had .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 33]: People are put in the Hulks because they murder , and because they rob , and forge , and do all sorts of bad ; and they always begin by asking questions .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 9]: Now , you get along to bed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 64]: I was never allowed a candle to light me to bed , and , as I went up stairs in the dark , with my head tingling , -- from Mrs. Joe 's thimble having played the tambourine upon it , to accompany her last words , -- I felt fearfully sensible of the great convenience that the hulks were handy for me .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 8]: I was clearly on my way there .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 16]: I had begun by asking questions , and I was going to rob Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 29]: Since that time , which is far enough away now , I have often thought that few people know what secrecy there is in the young under terror .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 13]: No matter how unreasonable the terror , so that it be terror .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 85]: I was in mortal terror of the young man who wanted my heart and liver ; I was in mortal terror of my interlocutor with the iron leg ; I was in mortal terror of myself , from whom an awful promise had been extracted ; I had no hope of deliverance through my all-powerful sister , who repulsed me at every turn ; I am afraid to think of what I might have done on requirement , in the secrecy of my terror .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 63]: If I slept at all that night , it was only to imagine myself drifting down the river on a strong spring-tide , to the Hulks ; a ghostly pirate calling out to me through a speaking-trumpet , as I passed the gibbet-station , that I had better come ashore and be hanged there at once , and not put it off .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 30]: I was afraid to sleep , even if I had been inclined , for I knew that at the first faint dawn of morning I must rob the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 50]: There was no doing it in the night , for there was no getting a light by easy friction then ; to have got one I must have struck it out of flint and steel , and have made a noise like the very pirate himself rattling his chains .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 46]: As soon as the great black velvet pall outside my little window was shot with gray , I got up and went down stairs ; every board upon the way , and every crack in every board calling after me , `` Stop thief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 9]: and `` Get up , Mrs. Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 47]: In the pantry , which was far more abundantly supplied than usual , owing to the season , I was very much alarmed by a hare hanging up by the heels , whom I rather thought I caught when my back was half turned , winking .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 25]: I had no time for verification , no time for selection , no time for anything , for I had no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 93]: I stole some bread , some rind of cheese , about half a jar of mincemeat -LRB- which I tied up in my pocket-handkerchief with my last night 's slice -RRB- , some brandy from a stone bottle -LRB- which I decanted into a glass bottle I had secretly used for making that intoxicating fluid , Spanish-liquorice-water , up in my room : diluting the stone bottle from a jug in the kitchen cupboard -RRB- , a meat bone with very little on it , and a beautiful round compact pork pie .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 73]: I was nearly going away without the pie , but I was tempted to mount upon a shelf , to look what it was that was put away so carefully in a covered earthen ware dish in a corner , and I found it was the pie , and I took it in the hope that it was not intended for early use , and would not be missed for some time .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 30]: There was a door in the kitchen , communicating with the forge ; I unlocked and unbolted that door , and got a file from among Joe 's tools .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 36]: Then I put the fastenings as I had found them , opened the door at which I had entered when I ran home last night , shut it , and ran for the misty marshes .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 12]: Chapter III It was a rimy morning , and very damp .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 33]: I had seen the damp lying on the outside of my little window , as if some goblin had been crying there all night , and using the window for a pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 35]: Now , I saw the damp lying on the bare hedges and spare grass , like a coarser sort of spiders ' webs ; hanging itself from twig to twig and blade to blade .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 56]: On every rail and gate , wet lay clammy , and the marsh mist was so thick , that the wooden finger on the post directing people to our village -- a direction which they never accepted , for they never came there -- was invisible to me until I was quite close under it .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 28]: Then , as I looked up at it , while it dripped , it seemed to my oppressed conscience like a phantom devoting me to the Hulks .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 29]: The mist was heavier yet when I got out upon the marshes , so that instead of my running at everything , everything seemed to run at me .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 9]: This was very disagreeable to a guilty mind .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 35]: The gates and dikes and banks came bursting at me through the mist , as if they cried as plainly as could be , `` A boy with Somebody 's else 's pork pie !
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 4]: Stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 29]: The cattle came upon me with like suddenness , staring out of their eyes , and steaming out of their nostrils , `` Halloa , young thief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 65]: One black ox , with a white cravat on , -- who even had to my awakened conscience something of a clerical air , -- fixed me so obstinately with his eyes , and moved his blunt head round in such an accusatory manner as I moved round , that I blubbered out to him , `` I could n't help it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: It was n't for myself I took it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 33]: Upon which he put down his head , blew a cloud of smoke out of his nose , and vanished with a kick-up of his hind-legs and a flourish of his tail .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 50]: All this time , I was getting on towards the river ; but however fast I went , I could n't warm my feet , to which the damp cold seemed riveted , as the iron was riveted to the leg of the man I was running to meet .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 54]: I knew my way to the Battery , pretty straight , for I had been down there on a Sunday with Joe , and Joe , sitting on an old gun , had told me that when I was ` prentice to him , regularly bound , we would have such Larks there !
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 48]: However , in the confusion of the mist , I found myself at last too far to the right , and consequently had to try back along the river-side , on the bank of loose stones above the mud and the stakes that staked the tide out .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 45]: Making my way along here with all despatch , I had just crossed a ditch which I knew to be very near the Battery , and had just scrambled up the mound beyond the ditch , when I saw the man sitting before me .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 22]: His back was towards me , and he had his arms folded , and was nodding forward , heavy with sleep .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 33]: I thought he would be more glad if I came upon him with his breakfast , in that unexpected manner , so I went forward softly and touched him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 17]: He instantly jumped up , and it was not the same man , but another man !
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 59]: And yet this man was dressed in coarse gray , too , and had a great iron on his leg , and was lame , and hoarse , and cold , and was everything that the other man was ; except that he had not the same face , and had a flat broad-brimmed low-crowned felt that on .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 74]: All this I saw in a moment , for I had only a moment to see it in : he swore an oath at me , made a hit at me , -- it was a round weak blow that missed me and almost knocked himself down , for it made him stumble , -- and then he ran into the mist , stumbling twice as he went , and I lost him .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 8]: `` It 's the young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 12]: I thought , feeling my heart shoot as I identified him .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 23]: I dare say I should have felt a pain in my liver , too , if I had known where it was .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 43]: I was soon at the Battery after that , and there was the right Man , -- hugging himself and limping to and fro , as if he had never all night left off hugging and limping , -- waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 9]: He was awfully cold , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 17]: I half expected to see him drop down before my face and die of deadly cold .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 44]: His eyes looked so awfully hungry too , that when I handed him the file and he laid it down on the grass , it occurred to me he would have tried to eat it , if he had not seen my bundle .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 32]: He did not turn me upside down this time to get at what I had , but left me right side upwards while I opened the bundle and emptied my pockets .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 10]: `` What 's in the bottle , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 7]: `` Brandy , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 50]: He was already handing mincemeat down his throat in the most curious manner , -- more like a man who was putting it away somewhere in a violent hurry , than a man who was eating it , -- but he left off to take some of the liquor .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 34]: He shivered all the while so violently , that it was quite as much as he could do to keep the neck of the bottle between his teeth , without biting it off .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 26]: `` I think you have got the ague , '' said I. `` I 'm much of your opinion , boy , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 12]: `` It 's bad about here , '' I told him .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 16]: `` You 've been lying out on the meshes , and they 're dreadful aguish .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 4]: Rheumatic too . ''
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 18]: `` I 'll eat my breakfast afore they 're the death of me , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 27]: `` I 'd do that , if I was going to be strung up to that there gallows as there is over there , directly afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 14]: I 'll beat the shivers so far , I 'll bet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 44]: He was gobbling mincemeat , meatbone , bread , cheese , and pork pie , all at once : staring distrustfully while he did so at the mist all round us , and often stopping -- even stopping his jaws -- to listen .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 40]: Some real or fancied sound , some clink upon the river or breathing of beast upon the marsh , now gave him a start , and he said , suddenly , -- `` You 're not a deceiving imp ?
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 8]: You brought no one with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 5]: `` No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 13]: `` Nor giv ' no one the office to follow you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 12]: `` Well , '' said he , `` I believe you .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 38]: You 'd be but a fierce young hound indeed , if at your time of life you could help to hunt a wretched warmint hunted as near death and dunghill as this poor wretched warmint is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 22]: Something clicked in his throat as if he had works in him like a clock , and was going to strike .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 11]: And he smeared his ragged rough sleeve over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 31]: Pitying his desolation , and watching him as he gradually settled down upon the pie , I made bold to say , `` I am glad you enjoy it . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 6]: `` Did you speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 11]: `` I said I was glad you enjoyed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 6]: `` Thankee , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 4]: I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 33]: I had often watched a large dog of ours eating his food ; and I now noticed a decided similarity between the dog 's way of eating , and the man 's .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 13]: The man took strong sharp sudden bites , just like the dog .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 48]: He swallowed , or rather snapped up , every mouthful , too soon and too fast ; and he looked sideways here and there while he ate , as if he thought there was danger in every direction of somebody 's coming to take the pie away .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 38]: He was altogether too unsettled in his mind over it , to appreciate it comfortably I thought , or to have anybody to dine with him , without making a chop with his jaws at the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 12]: In all of which particulars he was very like the dog .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 37]: `` I am afraid you wo n't leave any of it for him , '' said I , timidly ; after a silence during which I had hesitated as to the politeness of making the remark .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 14]: `` There 's no more to be got where that came from . ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 15]: It was the certainty of this fact that impelled me to offer the hint .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 6]: `` Leave any for him ?
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 5]: Who 's him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 11]: said my friend , stopping in his crunching of pie-crust .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 5]: `` The young man .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 5]: That you spoke of .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 7]: That was hid with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 5]: `` Oh ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 10]: he returned , with something like a gruff laugh .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 3]: `` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 4]: Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 8]: He do n't want no wittles . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 14]: `` I thought he looked as if he did , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 17]: The man stopped eating , and regarded me with the keenest scrutiny and the greatest surprise .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 3]: `` Looked ?
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 3]: When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 5]: `` Just now . ''
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 27]: `` Yonder , '' said I , pointing ; `` over there , where I found him nodding asleep , and thought it was you . ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 27]: He held me by the collar and stared at me so , that I began to think his first idea about cutting my throat had revived .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 48]: `` Dressed like you , you know , only with a hat , '' I explained , trembling ; `` and -- and '' -- I was very anxious to put this delicately -- `` and with -- the same reason for wanting to borrow a file .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 10]: Did n't you hear the cannon last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 7]: `` Then there was firing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 39]: `` I wonder you should n't have been sure of that , '' I returned , `` for we heard it up at home , and that 's farther away , and we were shut in besides . ''
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 7]: `` Why , see now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 40]: `` When a man 's alone on these flats , with a light head and a light stomach , perishing of cold and want , he hears nothin ' all night , but guns firing , and voices calling .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 2]: Hears ?
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 22]: He sees the soldiers , with their red coats lighted up by the torches carried afore , closing in round him .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 23]: Hears his number called , hears himself challenged , hears the rattle of the muskets , hears the orders ` Make ready !
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 2]: Present !
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 7]: Cover him steady , men ! '
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 12]: and is laid hands on -- and there 's nothin ' !
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 30]: Why , if I see one pursuing party last night -- coming up in order , Damn 'em , with their tramp , tramp -- I see a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 5]: And as to firing !
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 48]: Why , I see the mist shake with the cannon , arter it was broad day , -- But this man '' ; he had said all the rest , as if he had forgotten my being there ; `` did you notice anything in him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 20]: `` He had a badly bruised face , '' said I , recalling what I hardly knew I knew .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 5]: `` Not here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 17]: exclaimed the man , striking his left cheek mercilessly , with the flat of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 6]: `` Yes , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 16]: He crammed what little food was left , into the breast of his gray jacket .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 8]: `` Show me the way he went .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 10]: I 'll pull him down , like a bloodhound .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 8]: Curse this iron on my sore leg !
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 10]: Give us hold of the file , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 23]: I indicated in what direction the mist had shrouded the other man , and he looked up at it for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 58]: But he was down on the rank wet grass , filing at his iron like a madman , and not minding me or minding his own leg , which had an old chafe upon it and was bloody , but which he handled as roughly as if it had no more feeling in it than the file .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 35]: I was very much afraid of him again , now that he had worked himself into this fierce hurry , and I was likewise very much afraid of keeping away from home any longer .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 27]: I told him I must go , but he took no notice , so I thought the best thing I could do was to slip off .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 33]: The last I saw of him , his head was bent over his knee and he was working hard at his fetter , muttering impatient imprecations at it and at his leg .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 22]: The last I heard of him , I stopped in the mist to listen , and the file was still going .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 19]: Chapter IV I fully expected to find a Constable in the kitchen , waiting to take me up .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 20]: But not only was there no Constable there , but no discovery had yet been made of the robbery .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 61]: Mrs. Joe was prodigiously busy in getting the house ready for the festivities of the day , and Joe had been put upon the kitchen doorstep to keep him out of the dust-pan , -- an article into which his destiny always led him , sooner or later , when my sister was vigorously reaping the floors of her establishment .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 11]: `` And where the deuce ha ' you been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 15]: was Mrs. Joe 's Christmas salutation , when I and my conscience showed ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 11]: I said I had been down to hear the Carols .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 3]: well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 4]: observed Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 9]: `` You might ha ' done worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 8]: Not a doubt of that I thought .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 41]: `` Perhaps if I war n't a blacksmith 's wife , and -LRB- what 's the same thing -RRB- a slave with her apron never off , I should have been to hear the Carols , '' said Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 24]: `` I 'm rather partial to Carols , myself , and that 's the best of reasons for my never hearing any . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 73]: Joe , who had ventured into the kitchen after me as the dustpan had retired before us , drew the back of his hand across his nose with a conciliatory air , when Mrs. Joe darted a look at him , and , when her eyes were withdrawn , secretly crossed his two forefingers , and exhibited them to me , as our token that Mrs. Joe was in a cross temper .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 34]: This was so much her normal state , that Joe and I would often , for weeks together , be , as to our fingers , like monumental Crusaders as to their legs .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 26]: We were to have a superb dinner , consisting of a leg of pickled pork and greens , and a pair of roast stuffed fowls .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 28]: A handsome mince-pie had been made yesterday morning -LRB- which accounted for the mincemeat not being missed -RRB- , and the pudding was already on the boil .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 58]: These extensive arrangements occasioned us to be cut off unceremoniously in respect of breakfast ; `` for I ai n't , '' said Mrs. Joe , -- `` I ai n't a going to have no formal cramming and busting and washing up now , with what I 've got before me , I promise you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 49]: So , we had our slices served out , as if we were two thousand troops on a forced march instead of a man and boy at home ; and we took gulps of milk and water , with apologetic countenances , from a jug on the dresser .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 98]: In the meantime , Mrs. Joe put clean white curtains up , and tacked a new flowered flounce across the wide chimney to replace the old one , and uncovered the little state parlor across the passage , which was never uncovered at any other time , but passed the rest of the year in a cool haze of silver paper , which even extended to the four little white crockery poodles on the mantel-shelf , each with a black nose and a basket of flowers in his mouth , and each the counterpart of the other .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 25]: Mrs. Joe was a very clean housekeeper , but had an exquisite art of making her cleanliness more uncomfortable and unacceptable than dirt itself .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 16]: Cleanliness is next to Godliness , and some people do the same by their religion .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 26]: My sister , having so much to do , was going to church vicariously , that is to say , Joe and I were going .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 32]: In his working -- clothes , Joe was a well-knit characteristic-looking blacksmith ; in his holiday clothes , he was more like a scarecrow in good circumstances , than anything else .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 23]: Nothing that he wore then fitted him or seemed to belong to him ; and everything that he wore then grazed him .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 31]: On the present festive occasion he emerged from his room , when the blithe bells were going , the picture of misery , in a full suit of Sunday penitentials .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 51]: As to me , I think my sister must have had some general idea that I was a young offender whom an Accoucheur Policeman had taken up -LRB- on my birthday -RRB- and delivered over to her , to be dealt with according to the outraged majesty of the law .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 35]: I was always treated as if I had insisted on being born in opposition to the dictates of reason , religion , and morality , and against the dissuading arguments of my best friends .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 41]: Even when I was taken to have a new suit of clothes , the tailor had orders to make them like a kind of Reformatory , and on no account to let me have the free use of my limbs .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 19]: Joe and I going to church , therefore , must have been a moving spectacle for compassionate minds .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 14]: Yet , what I suffered outside was nothing to what I underwent within .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 41]: The terrors that had assailed me whenever Mrs. Joe had gone near the pantry , or out of the room , were only to be equalled by the remorse with which my mind dwelt on what my hands had done .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 36]: Under the weight of my wicked secret , I pondered whether the Church would be powerful enough to shield me from the vengeance of the terrible young man , if I divulged to that establishment .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 27]: I conceived the idea that the time when the banns were read and when the clergyman said , `` Ye are now to declare it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 17]: would be the time for me to rise and propose a private conference in the vestry .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 32]: I am far from being sure that I might not have astonished our small congregation by resorting to this extreme measure , but for its being Christmas Day and no Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 54]: Mr. Wopsle , the clerk at church , was to dine with us ; and Mr. Hubble the wheelwright and Mrs. Hubble ; and Uncle Pumblechook -LRB- Joe 's uncle , but Mrs. Joe appropriated him -RRB- , who was a well-to-do cornchandler in the nearest town , and drove his own chaise-cart .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 7]: The dinner hour was half-past one .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 49]: When Joe and I got home , we found the table laid , and Mrs. Joe dressed , and the dinner dressing , and the front door unlocked -LRB- it never was at any other time -RRB- for the company to enter by , and everything most splendid .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 10]: And still , not a word of the robbery .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 19]: The time came , without bringing with it any relief to my feelings , and the company came .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 79]: Mr. Wopsle , united to a Roman nose and a large shining bald forehead , had a deep voice which he was uncommonly proud of ; indeed it was understood among his acquaintance that if you could only give him his head , he would read the clergyman into fits ; he himself confessed that if the Church was `` thrown open , '' meaning to competition , he would not despair of making his mark in it .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 20]: The Church not being `` thrown open , '' he was , as I have said , our clerk .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 55]: But he punished the Amens tremendously ; and when he gave out the psalm , -- always giving the whole verse , -- he looked all round the congregation first , as much as to say , `` You have heard my friend overhead ; oblige me with your opinion of this style ! ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 48]: I opened the door to the company , -- making believe that it was a habit of ours to open that door , -- and I opened it first to Mr. Wopsle , next to Mr. and Mrs. Hubble , and last of all to Uncle Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 15]: N.B. I was not allowed to call him uncle , under the severest penalties .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 97]: `` Mrs. Joe , '' said Uncle Pumblechook , a large hard-breathing middle-aged slow man , with a mouth like a fish , dull staring eyes , and sandy hair standing upright on his head , so that he looked as if he had just been all but choked , and had that moment come to , `` I have brought you as the compliments of the season -- I have brought you , Mum , a bottle of sherry wine -- and I have brought you , Mum , a bottle of port wine . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 26]: Every Christmas Day he presented himself , as a profound novelty , with exactly the same words , and carrying the two bottles like dumb-bells .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 23]: Every Christmas Day , Mrs. Joe replied , as she now replied , `` O , Un -- cle Pum-ble -- chook !
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 5]: This is kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 21]: Every Christmas Day , he retorted , as he now retorted , `` It 's no more than your merits .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 15]: And now are you all bobbish , and how 's Sixpennorth of halfpence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 3]: meaning me .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 40]: We dined on these occasions in the kitchen , and adjourned , for the nuts and oranges and apples to the parlor ; which was a change very like Joe 's change from his working-clothes to his Sunday dress .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 27]: My sister was uncommonly lively on the present occasion , and indeed was generally more gracious in the society of Mrs. Hubble than in other company .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 46]: I remember Mrs. Hubble as a little curly sharp-edged person in sky-blue , who held a conventionally juvenile position , because she had married Mr. Hubble , -- I do n't know at what remote period , -- when she was much younger than he .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 51]: I remember Mr Hubble as a tough , high-shouldered , stooping old man , of a sawdusty fragrance , with his legs extraordinarily wide apart : so that in my short days I always saw some miles of open country between them when I met him coming up the lane .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 24]: Among this good company I should have felt myself , even if I had n't robbed the pantry , in a false position .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 86]: Not because I was squeezed in at an acute angle of the tablecloth , with the table in my chest , and the Pumblechookian elbow in my eye , nor because I was not allowed to speak -LRB- I did n't want to speak -RRB- , nor because I was regaled with the scaly tips of the drumsticks of the fowls , and with those obscure corners of pork of which the pig , when living , had had the least reason to be vain .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 18]: No ; I should not have minded that , if they would only have left me alone .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 8]: But they would n't leave me alone .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 30]: They seemed to think the opportunity lost , if they failed to point the conversation at me , every now and then , and stick the point into me .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 24]: I might have been an unfortunate little bull in a Spanish arena , I got so smartingly touched up by these moral goads .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 10]: It began the moment we sat down to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 46]: Mr. Wopsle said grace with theatrical declamation , -- as it now appears to me , something like a religious cross of the Ghost in Hamlet with Richard the Third , -- and ended with the very proper aspiration that we might be truly grateful .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 25]: Upon which my sister fixed me with her eye , and said , in a low reproachful voice , `` Do you hear that ?
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 4]: Be grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 24]: `` Especially , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , `` be grateful , boy , to them which brought you up by hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 35]: Mrs. Hubble shook her head , and contemplating me with a mournful presentiment that I should come to no good , asked , `` Why is it that the young are never grateful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 23]: This moral mystery seemed too much for the company until Mr. Hubble tersely solved it by saying , `` Naterally wicious . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 7]: Everybody then murmured `` True ! ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 12]: and looked at me in a particularly unpleasant and personal manner .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 22]: Joe 's station and influence were something feebler -LRB- if possible -RRB- when there was company than when there was none .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 35]: But he always aided and comforted me when he could , in some way of his own , and he always did so at dinner-time by giving me gravy , if there were any .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 22]: There being plenty of gravy to-day , Joe spooned into my plate , at this point , about half a pint .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 44]: A little later on in the dinner , Mr. Wopsle reviewed the sermon with some severity , and intimated -- in the usual hypothetical case of the Church being `` thrown open '' -- what kind of sermon he would have given them .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 46]: After favoring them with some heads of that discourse , he remarked that he considered the subject of the day 's homily , ill chosen ; which was the less excusable , he added , when there were so many subjects `` going about . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 9]: `` True again , '' said Uncle Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 8]: `` You 've hit it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 18]: Plenty of subjects going about , for them that know how to put salt upon their tails .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 6]: That 's what 's wanted .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 20]: A man need n't go far to find a subject , if he 's ready with his salt-box . ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 17]: Mr. Pumblechook added , after a short interval of reflection , `` Look at Pork alone .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 5]: There 's a subject !
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 11]: If you want a subject , look at Pork ! ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 5]: `` True , sir .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 38]: Many a moral for the young , '' returned Mr. Wopsle , -- and I knew he was going to lug me in , before he said it ; `` might be deduced from that text . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 20]: -LRB- `` You listen to this , '' said my sister to me , in a severe parenthesis . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 7]: Joe gave me some more gravy .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 40]: `` Swine , '' pursued Mr. Wopsle , in his deepest voice , and pointing his fork at my blushes , as if he were mentioning my Christian name , -- `` swine were the companions of the prodigal .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 17]: The gluttony of Swine is put before us , as an example to the young . ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 23]: -LRB- I thought this pretty well in him who had been praising up the pork for being so plump and juicy . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 15]: `` What is detestable in a pig is more detestable in a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 9]: `` Or girl , '' suggested Mr. Hubble .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 27]: `` Of course , or girl , Mr. Hubble , '' assented Mr. Wopsle , rather irritably , `` but there is no girl present . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 24]: `` Besides , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , turning sharp on me , `` think what you 've got to be grateful for .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 27]: If you 'd been born a Squeaker -- '' `` He was , if ever a child was , '' said my sister , most emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 7]: Joe gave me some more gravy .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 15]: `` Well , but I mean a four-footed Squeaker , '' said Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 15]: `` If you had been born such , would you have been here now ?
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 20]: Not you -- '' `` Unless in that form , '' said Mr. Wopsle , nodding towards the dish .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 52]: `` But I do n't mean in that form , sir , '' returned Mr. Pumblechook , who had an objection to being interrupted ; `` I mean , enjoying himself with his elders and betters , and improving himself with their conversation , and rolling in the lap of luxury .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 7]: Would he have been doing that ?
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 6]: No , he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 9]: And what would have been your destination ? ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 5]: turning on me again .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 81]: `` You would have been disposed of for so many shillings according to the market price of the article , and Dunstable the butcher would have come up to you as you lay in your straw , and he would have whipped you under his left arm , and with his right he would have tucked up his frock to get a penknife from out of his waistcoat-pocket , and he would have shed your blood and had your life .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 7]: No bringing up by hand then .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 7]: Not a bit of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 13]: Joe offered me more gravy , which I was afraid to take .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 21]: `` He was a world of trouble to you , ma'am , '' said Mrs. Hubble , commiserating my sister .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 4]: `` Trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 8]: echoed my sister ; `` trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 77]: and then entered on a fearful catalogue of all the illnesses I had been guilty of , and all the acts of sleeplessness I had committed , and all the high places I had tumbled from , and all the low places I had tumbled into , and all the injuries I had done myself , and all the times she had wished me in my grave , and I had contumaciously refused to go there .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 16]: I think the Romans must have aggravated one another very much , with their noses .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 13]: Perhaps , they became the restless people they were , in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 30]: Anyhow , Mr. Wopsle 's Roman nose so aggravated me , during the recital of my misdemeanours , that I should have liked to pull it until he howled .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 57]: But , all I had endured up to this time was nothing in comparison with the awful feelings that took possession of me when the pause was broken which ensued upon my sister 's recital , and in which pause everybody had looked at me -LRB- as I felt painfully conscious -RRB- with indignation and abhorrence .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 39]: `` Yet , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , leading the company gently back to the theme from which they had strayed , `` Pork -- regarded as biled -- is rich , too ; ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 13]: `` Have a little brandy , uncle , '' said my sister .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 9]: O Heavens , it had come at last !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 19]: He would find it was weak , he would say it was weak , and I was lost !
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 22]: I held tight to the leg of the table under the cloth , with both hands , and awaited my fate .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 27]: My sister went for the stone bottle , came back with the stone bottle , and poured his brandy out : no one else taking any .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 29]: The wretched man trifled with his glass , -- took it up , looked at it through the light , put it down , -- prolonged my misery .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 18]: All this time Mrs. Joe and Joe were briskly clearing the table for the pie and pudding .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 9]: I could n't keep my eyes off him .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 42]: Always holding tight by the leg of the table with my hands and feet , I saw the miserable creature finger his glass playfully , take it up , smile , throw his head back , and drink the brandy off .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 63]: Instantly afterwards , the company were seized with unspeakable consternation , owing to his springing to his feet , turning round several times in an appalling spasmodic whooping-cough dance , and rushing out at the door ; he then became visible through the window , violently plunging and expectorating , making the most hideous faces , and apparently out of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 14]: I held on tight , while Mrs. Joe and Joe ran to him .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 21]: I did n't know how I had done it , but I had no doubt I had murdered him somehow .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 44]: In my dreadful situation , it was a relief when he was brought back , and surveying the company all round as if they had disagreed with him , sank down into his chair with the one significant gasp , `` Tar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 11]: I had filled up the bottle from the tar-water jug .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 10]: I knew he would be worse by and by .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 23]: I moved the table , like a Medium of the present day , by the vigor of my unseen hold upon it .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 4]: `` Tar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 7]: cried my sister , in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 11]: `` Why , how ever could Tar come there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 42]: But , Uncle Pumblechook , who was omnipotent in that kitchen , would n't hear the word , would n't hear of the subject , imperiously waved it all away with his hand , and asked for hot gin and water .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 35]: My sister , who had begun to be alarmingly meditative , had to employ herself actively in getting the gin the hot water , the sugar , and the lemon-peel , and mixing them .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 11]: For the time being at least , I was saved .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 21]: I still held on to the leg of the table , but clutched it now with the fervor of gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 16]: By degrees , I became calm enough to release my grasp and partake of pudding .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 6]: Mr. Pumblechook partook of pudding .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 5]: All partook of pudding .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 20]: The course terminated , and Mr. Pumblechook had begun to beam under the genial influence of gin and water .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 26]: I began to think I should get over the day , when my sister said to Joe , `` Clean plates , -- cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 32]: I clutched the leg of the table again immediately , and pressed it to my bosom as if it had been the companion of my youth and friend of my soul .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 17]: I foresaw what was coming , and I felt that this time I really was gone .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 39]: `` You must taste , '' said my sister , addressing the guests with her best grace -- `` you must taste , to finish with , such a delightful and delicious present of Uncle Pumblechook 's ! ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 3]: Must they !
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 8]: Let them not hope to taste it !
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 24]: `` You must know , '' said my sister , rising , `` it 's a pie ; a savory pork pie . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 6]: The company murmured their compliments .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 47]: Uncle Pumblechook , sensible of having deserved well of his fellow-creatures , said , -- quite vivaciously , all things considered , -- `` Well , Mrs. Joe , we 'll do our best endeavors ; let us have a cut at this same pie . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: My sister went out to get it .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 9]: I heard her steps proceed to the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 8]: I saw Mr. Pumblechook balance his knife .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 12]: I saw reawakening appetite in the Roman nostrils of Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 43]: I heard Mr. Hubble remark that `` a bit of savory pork pie would lay atop of anything you could mention , and do no harm , '' and I heard Joe say , `` You shall have some , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 28]: I have never been absolutely certain whether I uttered a shrill yell of terror , merely in spirit , or in the bodily hearing of the company .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 16]: I felt that I could bear no more , and that I must run away .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 14]: I released the leg of the table , and ran for my life .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 52]: But I ran no farther than the house door , for there I ran head -- foremost into a party of soldiers with their muskets , one of whom held out a pair of handcuffs to me , saying , `` Here you are , look sharp , come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 67]: Chapter V The apparition of a file of soldiers ringing down the but-ends of their loaded muskets on our door-step , caused the dinner-party to rise from table in confusion , and caused Mrs. Joe re-entering the kitchen empty-handed , to stop short and stare , in her wondering lament of `` Gracious goodness gracious me , what 's gone -- with the -- pie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 26]: The sergeant and I were in the kitchen when Mrs. Joe stood staring ; at which crisis I partially recovered the use of my senses .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 39]: It was the sergeant who had spoken to me , and he was now looking round at the company , with his handcuffs invitingly extended towards them in his right hand , and his left on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 56]: `` Excuse me , ladies and gentleman , '' said the sergeant , `` but as I have mentioned at the door to this smart young shaver , '' -LRB- which he had n't -RRB- , `` I am on a chase in the name of the king , and I want the blacksmith . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: `` And pray what might you want with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: retorted my sister , quick to resent his being wanted at all .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 43]: `` Missis , '' returned the gallant sergeant , `` speaking for myself , I should reply , the honor and pleasure of his fine wife 's acquaintance ; speaking for the king , I answer , a little job done . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 22]: This was received as rather neat in the sergeant ; insomuch that Mr. Pumblechook cried audibly , `` Good again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 52]: `` You see , blacksmith , '' said the sergeant , who had by this time picked out Joe with his eye , `` we have had an accident with these , and I find the lock of one of 'em goes wrong , and the coupling do n't act pretty .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 17]: As they are wanted for immediate service , will you throw your eye over them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 34]: Joe threw his eye over them , and pronounced that the job would necessitate the lighting of his forge fire , and would take nearer two hours than one , `` Will it ?
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 12]: Then will you set about it at once , blacksmith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 15]: said the off-hand sergeant , `` as it 's on his Majesty 's service .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 17]: And if my men can bear a hand anywhere , they 'll make themselves useful . ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 27]: With that , he called to his men , who came trooping into the kitchen one after another , and piled their arms in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 56]: And then they stood about , as soldiers do ; now , with their hands loosely clasped before them ; now , resting a knee or a shoulder ; now , easing a belt or a pouch ; now , opening the door to spit stiffly over their high stocks , out into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 22]: All these things I saw without then knowing that I saw them , for I was in an agony of apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 43]: But beginning to perceive that the handcuffs were not for me , and that the military had so far got the better of the pie as to put it in the background , I collected a little more of my scattered wits .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 9]: `` Would you give me the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 28]: said the sergeant , addressing himself to Mr. Pumblechook , as to a man whose appreciative powers justified the inference that he was equal to the time .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 10]: `` It 's just gone half past two . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 31]: `` That 's not so bad , '' said the sergeant , reflecting ; `` even if I was forced to halt here nigh two hours , that 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 12]: How far might you call yourselves from the marshes , hereabouts ?
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 9]: Not above a mile , I reckon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 10]: `` Just a mile , '' said Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 5]: `` That 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 10]: We begin to close in upon 'em about dusk .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: A little before dusk , my orders are .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 5]: That 'll do . ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 6]: `` Convicts , sergeant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 9]: asked Mr. Wopsle , in a matter-of-course way .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 4]: `` Ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 7]: returned the sergeant , `` two .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 26]: They 're pretty well known to be out on the marshes still , and they wo n't try to get clear of 'em before dusk .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 10]: Anybody here seen anything of any such game ? ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 11]: Everybody , myself excepted , said no , with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 5]: Nobody thought of me .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 23]: said the sergeant , `` they 'll find themselves trapped in a circle , I expect , sooner than they count on .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: Now , blacksmith !
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 12]: If you 're ready , his Majesty the King is . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 23]: Joe had got his coat and waistcoat and cravat off , and his leather apron on , and passed into the forge .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 33]: One of the soldiers opened its wooden windows , another lighted the fire , another turned to at the bellows , the rest stood round the blaze , which was soon roaring .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 18]: Then Joe began to hammer and clink , hammer and clink , and we all looked on .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 20]: The interest of the impending pursuit not only absorbed the general attention , but even made my sister liberal .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 24]: She drew a pitcher of beer from the cask for the soldiers , and invited the sergeant to take a glass of brandy .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 14]: But Mr. Pumblechook said , sharply , `` Give him wine , Mum .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 39]: I 'll engage there 's no Tar in that : '' so , the sergeant thanked him and said that as he preferred his drink without tar , he would take wine , if it was equally convenient .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 30]: When it was given him , he drank his Majesty 's health and compliments of the season , and took it all at a mouthful and smacked his lips .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 9]: `` Good stuff , eh , sergeant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: said Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 23]: `` I 'll tell you something , '' returned the sergeant ; `` I suspect that stuff 's of your providing . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 17]: Mr. Pumblechook , with a fat sort of laugh , said , `` Ay , ay ?
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 26]: `` Because , '' returned the sergeant , clapping him on the shoulder , `` you 're a man that knows what 's what . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 6]: `` D'ye think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 9]: said Mr. Pumblechook , with his former laugh .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 6]: `` Have another glass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 4]: `` With you .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 9]: Hob and nob , '' returned the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 38]: `` The top of mine to the foot of yours , -- the foot of yours to the top of mine , -- Ring once , ring twice , -- the best tune on the Musical Glasses !
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 3]: Your health .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 29]: May you live a thousand years , and never be a worse judge of the right sort than you are at the present moment of your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 15]: The sergeant tossed off his glass again and seemed quite ready for another glass .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 43]: I noticed that Mr. Pumblechook in his hospitality appeared to forget that he had made a present of the wine , but took the bottle from Mrs. Joe and had all the credit of handing it about in a gush of joviality .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 5]: Even I got some .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 33]: And he was so very free of the wine that he even called for the other bottle , and handed that about with the same liberality , when the first was gone .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 35]: As I watched them while they all stood clustering about the forge , enjoying themselves so much , I thought what terrible good sauce for a dinner my fugitive friend on the marshes was .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 21]: They had not enjoyed themselves a quarter so much , before the entertainment was brightened with the excitement he furnished .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 106]: And now , when they were all in lively anticipation of `` the two villains '' being taken , and when the bellows seemed to roar for the fugitives , the fire to flare for them , the smoke to hurry away in pursuit of them , Joe to hammer and clink for them , and all the murky shadows on the wall to shake at them in menace as the blaze rose and sank , and the red-hot sparks dropped and died , the pale afternoon outside almost seemed in my pitying young fancy to have turned pale on their account , poor wretches .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 16]: At last , Joe 's job was done , and the ringing and roaring stopped .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 30]: As Joe got on his coat , he mustered courage to propose that some of us should go down with the soldiers and see what came of the hunt .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 30]: Mr. Pumblechook and Mr. Hubble declined , on the plea of a pipe and ladies ' society ; but Mr. Wopsle said he would go , if Joe would .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 16]: Joe said he was agreeable , and would take me , if Mrs. Joe approved .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 29]: We never should have got leave to go , I am sure , but for Mrs. Joe 's curiosity to know all about it and how it ended .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 37]: As it was , she merely stipulated , `` If you bring the boy back with his head blown to bits by a musket , do n't look to me to put it together again . ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 46]: The sergeant took a polite leave of the ladies , and parted from Mr. Pumblechook as from a comrade ; though I doubt if he were quite as fully sensible of that gentleman 's merits under arid conditions , as when something moist was going .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 9]: His men resumed their muskets and fell in .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 28]: Mr. Wopsle , Joe , and I , received strict charge to keep in the rear , and to speak no word after we reached the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 36]: When we were all out in the raw air and were steadily moving towards our business , I treasonably whispered to Joe , `` I hope , Joe , we sha n't find them . ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 22]: and Joe whispered to me , `` I 'd give a shilling if they had cut and run , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 43]: We were joined by no stragglers from the village , for the weather was cold and threatening , the way dreary , the footing bad , darkness coming on , and the people had good fires in-doors and were keeping the day .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 17]: A few faces hurried to glowing windows and looked after us , but none came out .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: We passed the finger-post , and held straight on to the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 35]: There we were stopped a few minutes by a signal from the sergeant 's hand , while two or three of his men dispersed themselves among the graves , and also examined the porch .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 28]: They came in again without finding anything , and then we struck out on the open marshes , through the gate at the side of the churchyard .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 21]: A bitter sleet came rattling against us here on the east wind , and Joe took me on his back .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 62]: Now that we were out upon the dismal wilderness where they little thought I had been within eight or nine hours and had seen both men hiding , I considered for the first time , with great dread , if we should come upon them , would my particular convict suppose that it was I who had brought the soldiers there ?
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 30]: He had asked me if I was a deceiving imp , and he had said I should be a fierce young hound if I joined the hunt against him .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 19]: Would he believe that I was both imp and hound in treacherous earnest , and had betrayed him ?
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 11]: It was of no use asking myself this question now .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 43]: There I was , on Joe 's back , and there was Joe beneath me , charging at the ditches like a hunter , and stimulating Mr. Wopsle not to tumble on his Roman nose , and to keep up with us .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 22]: The soldiers were in front of us , extending into a pretty wide line with an interval between man and man .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 20]: We were taking the course I had begun with , and from which I had diverged in the mist .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 16]: Either the mist was not out again yet , or the wind had dispelled it .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 41]: Under the low red glare of sunset , the beacon , and the gibbet , and the mound of the Battery , and the opposite shore of the river , were plain , though all of a watery lead color .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 24]: With my heart thumping like a blacksmith at Joe 's broad shoulder , I looked all about for any sign of the convicts .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 10]: I could see none , I could hear none .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 36]: Mr. Wopsle had greatly alarmed me more than once , by his blowing and hard breathing ; but I knew the sounds by this time , and could dissociate them from the object of pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 23]: I got a dreadful start , when I thought I heard the file still going ; but it was only a sheep-bell .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 68]: The sheep stopped in their eating and looked timidly at us ; and the cattle , their heads turned from the wind and sleet , stared angrily as if they held us responsible for both annoyances ; but , except these things , and the shudder of the dying day in every blade of grass , there was no break in the bleak stillness of the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 35]: The soldiers were moving on in the direction of the old Battery , and we were moving on a little way behind them , when , all of a sudden , we all stopped .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 18]: For there had reached us on the wings of the wind and rain , a long shout .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 4]: It was repeated .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 16]: It was at a distance towards the east , but it was long and loud .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 25]: Nay , there seemed to be two or more shouts raised together , -- if one might judge from a confusion in the sound .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 22]: To this effect the sergeant and the nearest men were speaking under their breath , when Joe and I came up .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 28]: After another moment 's listening , Joe -LRB- who was a good judge -RRB- agreed , and Mr. Wopsle -LRB- who was a bad judge -RRB- agreed .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 38]: The sergeant , a decisive man , ordered that the sound should not be answered , but that the course should be changed , and that his men should make towards it `` at the double . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 32]: So we slanted to the right -LRB- where the East was -RRB- , and Joe pounded away so wonderfully , that I had to hold on tight to keep my seat .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 28]: It was a run indeed now , and what Joe called , in the only two words he spoke all the time , `` a Winder . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 28]: Down banks and up banks , and over gates , and splashing into dikes , and breaking among coarse rushes : no man cared where he went .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 24]: As we came nearer to the shouting , it became more and more apparent that it was made by more than one voice .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 14]: Sometimes , it seemed to stop altogether , and then the soldiers stopped .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 23]: When it broke out again , the soldiers made for it at a greater rate than ever , and we after them .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 22]: After a while , we had so run it down , that we could hear one voice calling `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: and another voice , `` Convicts !
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 2]: Runaways !
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 2]: Guard !
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 8]: This way for the runaway convicts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 19]: Then both voices would seem to be stifled in a struggle , and then would break out again .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 18]: And when it had come to this , the soldiers ran like deer , and Joe too .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 26]: The sergeant ran in first , when we had run the noise quite down , and two of his men ran in close upon him .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 12]: Their pieces were cocked and levelled when we all ran in .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 7]: `` Here are both men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 12]: panted the sergeant , struggling at the bottom of a ditch .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 6]: `` Surrender , you two !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 8]: and confound you for two wild beasts !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 4]: Come asunder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 48]: Water was splashing , and mud was flying , and oaths were being sworn , and blows were being struck , when some more men went down into the ditch to help the sergeant , and dragged out , separately , my convict and the other one .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 19]: Both were bleeding and panting and execrating and struggling ; but of course I knew them both directly .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 4]: `` Mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 27]: said my convict , wiping blood from his face with his ragged sleeves , and shaking torn hair from his fingers : `` I took him !
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 7]: I give him up to you !
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 4]: Mind that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 33]: `` It 's not much to be particular about , '' said the sergeant ; `` it 'll do you small good , my man , being in the same plight yourself .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 4]: Handcuffs there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 12]: `` I do n't expect it to do me any good .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 25]: I do n't want it to do me more good than it does now , '' said my convict , with a greedy laugh .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 5]: `` I took him .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 4]: He knows it .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 7]: That 's enough for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 32]: The other convict was livid to look at , and , in addition to the old bruised left side of his face , seemed to be bruised and torn all over .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 30]: He could not so much as get his breath to speak , until they were both separately handcuffed , but leaned upon a soldier to keep himself from falling .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 19]: `` Take notice , guard , -- he tried to murder me , '' were his first words .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 7]: `` Tried to murder him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 6]: said my convict , disdainfully .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 8]: `` Try , and not do it ?
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 16]: I took him , and giv ' him up ; that 's what I done .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 26]: I not only prevented him getting off the marshes , but I dragged him here , -- dragged him this far on his way back .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 12]: He 's a gentleman , if you please , this villain .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 13]: Now , the Hulks has got its gentleman again , through me .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 3]: Murder him ?
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 21]: Worth my while , too , to murder him , when I could do worse and drag him back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 16]: The other one still gasped , `` He tried -- he tried-to -- murder me .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 6]: Bear -- bear witness . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 5]: `` Lookee here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 7]: said my convict to the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 18]: `` Single-handed I got clear of the prison-ship ; I made a dash and I done it .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 38]: I could ha ' got clear of these death-cold flats likewise -- look at my leg : you wo n't find much iron on it -- if I had n't made the discovery that he was here .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 5]: Let him go free ?
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 11]: Let him profit by the means as I found out ?
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 11]: Let him make a tool of me afresh and again ?
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 3]: Once more ?
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 6]: No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 49]: If I had died at the bottom there , '' and he made an emphatic swing at the ditch with his manacled hands , `` I 'd have held to him with that grip , that you should have been safe to find him in my hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 23]: The other fugitive , who was evidently in extreme horror of his companion , repeated , `` He tried to murder me .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 15]: I should have been a dead man if you had not come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 5]: `` He lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 8]: said my convict , with fierce energy .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 14]: `` He 's a liar born , and he 'll die a liar .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 11]: Look at his face ; ai n't it written there ?
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 10]: Let him turn those eyes of his on me .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 8]: I defy him to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 54]: The other , with an effort at a scornful smile , which could not , however , collect the nervous working of his mouth into any set expression , looked at the soldiers , and looked about at the marshes and at the sky , but certainly did not look at the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 7]: `` Do you see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 4]: pursued my convict .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 10]: `` Do you see what a villain he is ?
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 9]: Do you see those grovelling and wandering eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 11]: That 's how he looked when we were tried together .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 7]: He never looked at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 57]: The other , always working and working his dry lips and turning his eyes restlessly about him far and near , did at last turn them for a moment on the speaker , with the words , `` You are not much to look at , '' and with a half-taunting glance at the bound hands .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 26]: At that point , my convict became so frantically exasperated , that he would have rushed upon him but for the interposition of the soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 26]: `` Did n't I tell you , '' said the other convict then , `` that he would murder me , if he could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 27]: And any one could see that he shook with fear , and that there broke out upon his lips curious white flakes , like thin snow .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 11]: `` Enough of this parley , '' said the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 6]: `` Light those torches . ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 39]: As one of the soldiers , who carried a basket in lieu of a gun , went down on his knee to open it , my convict looked round him for the first time , and saw me .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 24]: I had alighted from Joe 's back on the brink of the ditch when we came up , and had not moved since .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 21]: I looked at him eagerly when he looked at me , and slightly moved my hands and shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 20]: I had been waiting for him to see me that I might try to assure him of my innocence .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 35]: It was not at all expressed to me that he even comprehended my intention , for he gave me a look that I did not understand , and it all passed in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 31]: But if he had looked at me for an hour or for a day , I could not have remembered his face ever afterwards , as having been more attentive .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 26]: The soldier with the basket soon got a light , and lighted three or four torches , and took one himself and distributed the others .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 20]: It had been almost dark before , but now it seemed quite dark , and soon afterwards very dark .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 20]: Before we departed from that spot , four soldiers standing in a ring , fired twice into the air .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 25]: Presently we saw other torches kindled at some distance behind us , and others on the marshes on the opposite bank of the river .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 9]: `` All right , '' said the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 4]: `` March . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 25]: We had not gone far when three cannon were fired ahead of us with a sound that seemed to burst something inside my ear .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 22]: `` You are expected on board , '' said the sergeant to my convict ; `` they know you are coming .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 7]: Do n't straggle , my man .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 5]: Close up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 15]: The two were kept apart , and each walked surrounded by a separate guard .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 17]: I had hold of Joe 's hand now , and Joe carried one of the torches .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 25]: Mr. Wopsle had been for going back , but Joe was resolved to see it out , so we went on with the party .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 38]: There was a reasonably good path now , mostly on the edge of the river , with a divergence here and there where a dike came , with a miniature windmill on it and a muddy sluice-gate .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 16]: When I looked round , I could see the other lights coming in after us .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 26]: The torches we carried dropped great blotches of fire upon the track , and I could see those , too , lying smoking and flaring .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 9]: I could see nothing else but black darkness .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 33]: Our lights warmed the air about us with their pitchy blaze , and the two prisoners seemed rather to like that , as they limped along in the midst of the muskets .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 30]: We could not go fast , because of their lameness ; and they were so spent , that two or three times we had to halt while they rested .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 20]: After an hour or so of this travelling , we came to a rough wooden hut and a landing-place .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 17]: There was a guard in the hut , and they challenged , and the sergeant answered .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 62]: Then , we went into the hut , where there was a smell of tobacco and whitewash , and a bright fire , and a lamp , and a stand of muskets , and a drum , and a low wooden bedstead , like an overgrown mangle without the machinery , capable of holding about a dozen soldiers all at once .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 35]: Three or four soldiers who lay upon it in their great-coats were not much interested in us , but just lifted their heads and took a sleepy stare , and then lay down again .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 38]: The sergeant made some kind of report , and some entry in a book , and then the convict whom I call the other convict was drafted off with his guard , to go on board first .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 11]: My convict never looked at me , except that once .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 43]: While we stood in the hut , he stood before the fire looking thoughtfully at it , or putting up his feet by turns upon the hob , and looking thoughtfully at them as if he pitied them for their recent adventures .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 22]: Suddenly , he turned to the sergeant , and remarked , -- `` I wish to say something respecting this escape .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 12]: It may prevent some persons laying under suspicion alonger me . ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 34]: `` You can say what you like , '' returned the sergeant , standing coolly looking at him with his arms folded , `` but you have no call to say it here .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 25]: You 'll have opportunity enough to say about it , and hear about it , before it 's done with , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 14]: `` I know , but this is another pint , a separate matter .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 12]: A man ca n't starve ; at least I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 26]: I took some wittles , up at the willage over yonder , -- where the church stands a ` most out on the marshes . ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 10]: `` You mean stole , '' said the sergeant .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 9]: `` And I 'll tell you where from .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 6]: From the blacksmith 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 8]: said the sergeant , staring at Joe .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 6]: `` Halloa , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 7]: said Joe , staring at me .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 24]: `` It was some broken wittles -- that 's what it was -- and a dram of liquor , and a pie . ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 16]: `` Have you happened to miss such an article as a pie , blacksmith ? ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 6]: asked the sergeant , confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 14]: `` My wife did , at the very moment when you came in .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 8]: Do n't you know , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 37]: `` So , '' said my convict , turning his eyes on Joe in a moody manner , and without the least glance at me , -- `` so you 're the blacksmith , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 14]: Than I 'm sorry to say , I 've eat your pie . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 30]: `` God knows you 're welcome to it , -- so far as it was ever mine , '' returned Joe , with a saving remembrance of Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 26]: `` We do n't know what you have done , but we would n't have you starved to death for it , poor miserable fellow-creatur .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 7]: -- Would us , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 22]: The something that I had noticed before , clicked in the man 's throat again , and he turned his back .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 44]: The boat had returned , and his guard were ready , so we followed him to the landing-place made of rough stakes and stones , and saw him put into the boat , which was rowed by a crew of convicts like himself .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 50]: No one seemed surprised to see him , or interested in seeing him , or glad to see him , or sorry to see him , or spoke a word , except that somebody in the boat growled as if to dogs , `` Give way , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 11]: which was the signal for the dip of the oars .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 31]: By the light of the torches , we saw the black Hulk lying out a little way from the mud of the shore , like a wicked Noah 's ark .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 24]: Cribbed and barred and moored by massive rusty chains , the prison-ship seemed in my young eyes to be ironed like the prisoners .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 18]: We saw the boat go alongside , and we saw him taken up the side and disappear .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 27]: Then , the ends of the torches were flung hissing into the water , and went out , as if it were all over with him .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 40]: Chapter VI My state of mind regarding the pilfering from which I had been so unexpectedly exonerated did not impel me to frank disclosure ; but I hope it had some dregs of good at the bottom of it .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 29]: I do not recall that I felt any tenderness of conscience in reference to Mrs. Joe , when the fear of being found out was lifted off me .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 41]: But I loved Joe , -- perhaps for no better reason in those early days than because the dear fellow let me love him , -- and , as to him , my inner self was not so easily composed .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 29]: It was much upon my mind -LRB- particularly when I first saw him looking about for his file -RRB- that I ought to tell Joe the whole truth .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 26]: Yet I did not , and for the reason that I mistrusted that if I did , he would think me worse than I was .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 33]: The fear of losing Joe 's confidence , and of thenceforth sitting in the chimney corner at night staring drearily at my forever lost companion and friend , tied up my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 34]: I morbidly represented to myself that if Joe knew it , I never afterwards could see him at the fireside feeling his fair whisker , without thinking that he was meditating on it .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 46]: That , if Joe knew it , I never afterwards could see him glance , however casually , at yesterday 's meat or pudding when it came on to-day 's table , without thinking that he was debating whether I had been in the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 45]: That , if Joe knew it , and at any subsequent period of our joint domestic life remarked that his beer was flat or thick , the conviction that he suspected Tar in it , would bring a rush of blood to my face .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 33]: In a word , I was too cowardly to do what I knew to be right , as I had been too cowardly to avoid doing what I knew to be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 26]: I had had no intercourse with the world at that time , and I imitated none of its many inhabitants who act in this manner .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 17]: Quite an untaught genius , I made the discovery of the line of action for myself .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 25]: As I was sleepy before we were far away from the prison-ship , Joe took me on his back again and carried me home .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 49]: He must have had a tiresome journey of it , for Mr. Wopsle , being knocked up , was in such a very bad temper that if the Church had been thrown open , he would probably have excommunicated the whole expedition , beginning with Joe and myself .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 53]: In his lay capacity , he persisted in sitting down in the damp to such an insane extent , that when his coat was taken off to be dried at the kitchen fire , the circumstantial evidence on his trousers would have hanged him , if it had been a capital offence .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 45]: By that time , I was staggering on the kitchen floor like a little drunkard , through having been newly set upon my feet , and through having been fast asleep , and through waking in the heat and lights and noise of tongues .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 24]: As I came to myself -LRB- with the aid of a heavy thump between the shoulders , and the restorative exclamation `` Yah !
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 10]: Was there ever such a boy as this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 32]: from my sister , -RRB- I found Joe telling them about the convict 's confession , and all the visitors suggesting different ways by which he had got into the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 79]: Mr. Pumblechook made out , after carefully surveying the premises , that he had first got upon the roof of the forge , and had then got upon the roof of the house , and had then let himself down the kitchen chimney by a rope made of his bedding cut into strips ; and as Mr. Pumblechook was very positive and drove his own chaise-cart -- over Everybody -- it was agreed that it must be so .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 13]: Mr. Wopsle , indeed , wildly cried out , `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 62]: with the feeble malice of a tired man ; but , as he had no theory , and no coat on , he was unanimously set at naught , -- not to mention his smoking hard behind , as he stood with his back to the kitchen fire to draw the damp out : which was not calculated to inspire confidence .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 56]: This was all I heard that night before my sister clutched me , as a slumberous offence to the company 's eyesight , and assisted me up to bed with such a strong hand that I seemed to have fifty boots on , and to be dangling them all against the edges of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 41]: My state of mind , as I have described it , began before I was up in the morning , and lasted long after the subject had died out , and had ceased to be mentioned saving on exceptional occasions .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 29]: Chapter VII At the time when I stood in the churchyard reading the family tombstones , I had just enough learning to be able to spell them out .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 70]: My construction even of their simple meaning was not very correct , for I read `` wife of the Above '' as a complimentary reference to my father 's exaltation to a better world ; and if any one of my deceased relations had been referred to as `` Below , '' I have no doubt I should have formed the worst opinions of that member of the family .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 85]: Neither were my notions of the theological positions to which my Catechism bound me , at all accurate ; for , I have a lively remembrance that I supposed my declaration that I was to `` walk in the same all the days of my life , '' laid me under an obligation always to go through the village from our house in one particular direction , and never to vary it by turning down by the wheelwright 's or up by the mill .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 43]: When I was old enough , I was to be apprenticed to Joe , and until I could assume that dignity I was not to be what Mrs. Joe called `` Pompeyed , '' or -LRB- as I render it -RRB- pampered .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 43]: Therefore , I was not only odd-boy about the forge , but if any neighbor happened to want an extra boy to frighten birds , or pick up stones , or do any such job , I was favored with the employment .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 39]: In order , however , that our superior position might not be compromised thereby , a money-box was kept on the kitchen mantel-shelf , in to which it was publicly made known that all my earnings were dropped .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 34]: I have an impression that they were to be contributed eventually towards the liquidation of the National Debt , but I know I had no hope of any personal participation in the treasure .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 66]: Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt kept an evening school in the village ; that is to say , she was a ridiculous old woman of limited means and unlimited infirmity , who used to go to sleep from six to seven every evening , in the society of youth who paid two pence per week each , for the improving opportunity of seeing her do it .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 39]: She rented a small cottage , and Mr. Wopsle had the room up stairs , where we students used to overhear him reading aloud in a most dignified and terrific manner , and occasionally bumping on the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 16]: There was a fiction that Mr. Wopsle `` examined '' the scholars once a quarter .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 31]: What he did on those occasions was to turn up his cuffs , stick up his hair , and give us Mark Antony 's oration over the body of Caesar .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 38]: This was always followed by Collins 's Ode on the Passions , wherein I particularly venerated Mr. Wopsle as Revenge throwing his blood-stained sword in thunder down , and taking the War-denouncing trumpet with a withering look .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 40]: It was not with me then , as it was in later life , when I fell into the society of the Passions , and compared them with Collins and Wopsle , rather to the disadvantage of both gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 22]: Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt , besides keeping this Educational Institution , kept in the same room -- a little general shop .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 50]: She had no idea what stock she had , or what the price of anything in it was ; but there was a little greasy memorandum-book kept in a drawer , which served as a Catalogue of Prices , and by this oracle Biddy arranged all the shop transaction .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 30]: Biddy was Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt 's granddaughter ; I confess myself quiet unequal to the working out of the problem , what relation she was to Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 19]: She was an orphan like myself ; like me , too , had been brought up by hand .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 40]: She was most noticeable , I thought , in respect of her extremities ; for , her hair always wanted brushing , her hands always wanted washing , and her shoes always wanted mending and pulling up at heel .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 10]: This description must be received with a week-day limitation .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 9]: On Sundays , she went to church elaborated .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 42]: Much of my unassisted self , and more by the help of Biddy than of Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt , I struggled through the alphabet as if it had been a bramble-bush ; getting considerably worried and scratched by every letter .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 27]: After that I fell among those thieves , the nine figures , who seemed every evening to do something new to disguise themselves and baffle recognition .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 27]: But , at last I began , in a purblind groping way , to read , write , and cipher , on the very smallest scale .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 25]: One night I was sitting in the chimney corner with my slate , expending great efforts on the production of a letter to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 33]: I think it must have been a full year after our hunt upon the marshes , for it was a long time after , and it was winter and a hard frost .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 75]: With an alphabet on the hearth at my feet for reference , I contrived in an hour or two to print and smear this epistle : -- `` MI DEER JO i OPE U R KR WITE WELL i OPE i SHAL SON B HABELL 4 2 TEEDGE U JO AN THEN WE SHORL B SO GLODD AN WEN i M PRENGTD 2 U JO WOT LARX AN BLEVE ME INF XN PIP . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 24]: There was no indispensable necessity for my communicating with Joe by letter , inasmuch as he sat beside me and we were alone .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 26]: But I delivered this written communication -LRB- slate and all -RRB- with my own hand , and Joe received it as a miracle of erudition .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 10]: `` I say , Pip , old chap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 16]: cried Joe , opening his blue eyes wide , `` what a scholar you are !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 5]: A n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 30]: `` I should like to be , '' said I , glancing at the slate as he held it ; with a misgiving that the writing was rather hilly .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 20]: `` Why , here 's a J , '' said Joe , `` and a O equal to anythink !
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 19]: Here 's a J and a O , Pip , and a J -- O , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 53]: I had never heard Joe read aloud to any greater extent than this monosyllable , and I had observed at church last Sunday , when I accidentally held our Prayer -- Book upside down , that it seemed to suit his convenience quite as well as if it had been all right .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 30]: Wishing to embrace the present occasion of finding out whether in teaching Joe , I should have to begin quite at the beginning , I said , `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 8]: But read the rest , Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 9]: `` The rest , eh , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 20]: said Joe , looking at it with a slow , searching eye , `` One , two , three .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 24]: Why , here 's three Js , and three Os , and three J -- O , Joes in it , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 19]: I leaned over Joe , and , with the aid of my forefinger read him the whole letter .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 4]: `` Astonishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: said Joe , when I had finished .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 7]: `` You ARE a scholar . ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 10]: `` How do you spell Gargery , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 9]: I asked him , with a modest patronage .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 13]: `` I do n't spell it at all , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 7]: `` But supposing you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 11]: `` It ca n't be supposed , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 13]: `` Tho ' I 'm uncommon fond of reading , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 7]: `` Are you , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 3]: `` On-common .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 32]: Give me , '' said Joe , `` a good book , or a good newspaper , and sit me down afore a good fire , and I ask no better .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 3]: Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 47]: he continued , after rubbing his knees a little , `` when you do come to a J and a O , and says you , `` Here , at last , is a J -- O , Joe , '' how interesting reading is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 47]: I derived from this , that Joe 's education , like Steam , was yet in its infancy , Pursuing the subject , I inquired , -- `` Did n't you ever go to school , Joe , when you were as little as me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 6]: `` No , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 21]: `` Why did n't you ever go to school , Joe , when you were as little as me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 42]: `` Well , Pip , '' said Joe , taking up the poker , and settling himself to his usual occupation when he was thoughtful , of slowly raking the fire between the lower bars ; `` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 29]: My father , Pip , he were given to drink , and when he were overtook with drink , he hammered away at my mother , most onmerciful .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 18]: It were a ` most the only hammering he did , indeed , ` xcepting at myself .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 25]: And he hammered at me with a wigor only to be equalled by the wigor with which he did n't hammer at his anwil .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 11]: -- You 're a listening and understanding , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 7]: `` Yes , Joe . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 63]: ` Consequence , my mother and me we ran away from my father several times ; and then my mother she 'd go out to work , and she 'd say , ` Joe , ' she 'd say , ` now , please God , you shall have some schooling , child , ' and she 'd put me to school .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 19]: But my father were that good in his hart that he could n't abear to be without us .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 47]: So , he 'd come with a most tremenjous crowd and make such a row at the doors of the houses where we was , that they used to be obligated to have no more to do with us and to give us up to him .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 10]: And then he took us home and hammered us .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 34]: Which , you see , Pip , '' said Joe , pausing in his meditative raking of the fire , and looking at me , `` were a drawback on my learning . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: `` Certainly , poor Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 56]: `` Though mind you , Pip , '' said Joe , with a judicial touch or two of the poker on the top bar , `` rendering unto all their doo , and maintaining equal justice betwixt man and man , my father were that good in his hart , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 12]: I did n't see ; but I did n't say so .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 27]: Joe pursued , `` somebody must keep the pot a biling , Pip , or the pot wo n't bile , do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 9]: I saw that , and said so . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 51]: ` Consequence , my father did n't make objections to my going to work ; so I went to work to work at my present calling , which were his too , if he would have followed it , and I worked tolerable hard , I assure you , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 23]: In time I were able to keep him , and I kep him till he went off in a purple leptic fit .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 32]: And it were my intentions to have had put upon his tombstone that , Whatsume'er the failings on his part , Remember reader he were that good in his heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 23]: Joe recited this couplet with such manifest pride and careful perspicuity , that I asked him if he had made it himself .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 14]: `` I made it , '' said Joe , `` my own self .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 7]: I made it in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 14]: It was like striking out a horseshoe complete , in a single blow .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 34]: I never was so much surprised in all my life , -- could n't credit my own ed , -- to tell you the truth , hardly believed it were my own ed .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 40]: As I was saying , Pip , it were my intentions to have had it cut over him ; but poetry costs money , cut it how you will , small or large , and it were not done .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 18]: Not to mention bearers , all the money that could be spared were wanted for my mother .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 10]: She were in poor elth , and quite broke .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 21]: She were n't long of following , poor soul , and her share of peace come round at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 40]: Joe 's blue eyes turned a little watery ; he rubbed first one of them , and then the other , in a most uncongenial and uncomfortable manner , with the round knob on the top of the poker .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 24]: `` It were but lonesome then , '' said Joe , `` living here alone , and I got acquainted with your sister .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 37]: Now , Pip , '' -- Joe looked firmly at me as if he knew I was not going to agree with him ; -- `` your sister is a fine figure of a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 16]: I could not help looking at the fire , in an obvious state of doubt .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 48]: `` Whatever family opinions , or whatever the world 's opinions , on that subject may be , Pip , your sister is , '' Joe tapped the top bar with the poker after every word following , `` a-fine-figure -- of -- a -- woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 20]: I could think of nothing better to say than `` I am glad you think so , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 13]: `` So am I , '' returned Joe , catching me up .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 10]: `` I am glad I think so , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 22]: A little redness or a little matter of Bone , here or there , what does it signify to Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 18]: I sagaciously observed , if it did n't signify to him , to whom did it signify ?
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 4]: `` Certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 3]: assented Joe .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 5]: `` That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 7]: You 're right , old chap !
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 21]: When I got acquainted with your sister , it were the talk how she was bringing you up by hand .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 21]: Very kind of her too , all the folks said , and I said , along with all the folks .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 49]: As to you , '' Joe pursued with a countenance expressive of seeing something very nasty indeed , `` if you could have been aware how small and flabby and mean you was , dear me , you 'd have formed the most contemptible opinion of yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 16]: Not exactly relishing this , I said , `` Never mind me , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 16]: `` But I did mind you , Pip , '' he returned with tender simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 45]: `` When I offered to your sister to keep company , and to be asked in church at such times as she was willing and ready to come to the forge , I said to her , ` And bring the poor little child .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 26]: God bless the poor little child , ' I said to your sister , ` there 's room for him at the forge ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 40]: I broke out crying and begging pardon , and hugged Joe round the neck : who dropped the poker to hug me , and to say , `` Ever the best of friends ; a n't us , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 8]: Do n't cry , old chap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 24]: When this little interruption was over , Joe resumed : -- `` Well , you see , Pip , and here we are !
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 11]: That 's about where it lights ; here we are !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 43]: Now , when you take me in hand in my learning , Pip -LRB- and I tell you beforehand I am awful dull , most awful dull -RRB- , Mrs. Joe must n't see too much of what we 're up to .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 14]: It must be done , as I may say , on the sly .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 6]: And why on the sly ?
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 9]: I 'll tell you why , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 22]: He had taken up the poker again ; without which , I doubt if he could have proceeded in his demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 9]: `` Your sister is given to government . ''
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 8]: `` Given to government , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 39]: I was startled , for I had some shadowy idea -LRB- and I am afraid I must add , hope -RRB- that Joe had divorced her in a favor of the Lords of the Admiralty , or Treasury .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 9]: `` Given to government , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 12]: `` Which I meantersay the government of you and myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 40]: `` And she a n't over partial to having scholars on the premises , '' Joe continued , `` and in partickler would not be over partial to my being a scholar , for fear as I might rise .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 12]: Like a sort or rebel , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 24]: I was going to retort with an inquiry , and had got as far as `` Why -- '' when Joe stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 5]: `` Stay a bit .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 16]: I know what you 're a going to say , Pip ; stay a bit !
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 17]: I do n't deny that your sister comes the Mo-gul over us , now and again .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 21]: I do n't deny that she do throw us back-falls , and that she do drop down upon us heavy .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 41]: At such times as when your sister is on the Ram-page , Pip , '' Joe sank his voice to a whisper and glanced at the door , `` candor compels fur to admit that she is a Buster . ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 16]: Joe pronounced this word , as if it began with at least twelve capital Bs .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 7]: `` Why do n't I rise ?
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 13]: That were your observation when I broke it off , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 6]: `` Yes , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 44]: `` Well , '' said Joe , passing the poker into his left hand , that he might feel his whisker ; and I had no hope of him whenever he took to that placid occupation ; `` your sister 's a master-mind .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 4]: A master-mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 13]: I asked , in some hope of bringing him to a stand .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 31]: But Joe was readier with his definition than I had expected , and completely stopped me by arguing circularly , and answering with a fixed look , `` Her . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 26]: `` And I ai n't a master-mind , '' Joe resumed , when he had unfixed his look , and got back to his whisker .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 98]: `` And last of all , Pip , -- and this I want to say very serious to you , old chap , -- I see so much in my poor mother , of a woman drudging and slaving and breaking her honest hart and never getting no peace in her mortal days , that I 'm dead afeerd of going wrong in the way of not doing what 's right by a woman , and I 'd fur rather of the two go wrong the t ` other way , and be a little ill-conwenienced myself .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 55]: I wish it was only me that got put out , Pip ; I wish there war n't no Tickler for you , old chap ; I wish I could take it all on myself ; but this is the up-and-down-and-straight on it , Pip , and I hope you 'll overlook shortcomings . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 19]: Young as I was , I believe that I dated a new admiration of Joe from that night .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 47]: We were equals afterwards , as we had been before ; but , afterwards at quiet times when I sat looking at Joe and thinking about him , I had a new sensation of feeling conscious that I was looking up to Joe in my heart .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 39]: `` However , '' said Joe , rising to replenish the fire ; `` here 's the Dutch-clock a working himself up to being equal to strike Eight of 'em , and she 's not come home yet !
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 24]: I hope Uncle Pumblechook 's mare may n't have set a forefoot on a piece o ' ice , and gone down . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 42]: Mrs. Joe made occasional trips with Uncle Pumblechook on market-days , to assist him in buying such household stuffs and goods as required a woman 's judgment ; Uncle Pumblechook being a bachelor and reposing no confidences in his domestic servant .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 15]: This was market-day , and Mrs. Joe was out on one of these expeditions .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 22]: Joe made the fire and swept the hearth , and then we went to the door to listen for the chaise-cart .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 21]: It was a dry cold night , and the wind blew keenly , and the frost was white and hard .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 15]: A man would die to-night of lying out on the marshes , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 43]: And then I looked at the stars , and considered how awful if would be for a man to turn his face up to them as he froze to death , and see no help or pity in all the glittering multitude .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 19]: `` Here comes the mare , '' said Joe , `` ringing like a peal of bells ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 26]: The sound of her iron shoes upon the hard road was quite musical , as she came along at a much brisker trot than usual .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 43]: We got a chair out , ready for Mrs. Joe 's alighting , and stirred up the fire that they might see a bright window , and took a final survey of the kitchen that nothing might be out of its place .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 16]: When we had completed these preparations , they drove up , wrapped to the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 51]: Mrs. Joe was soon landed , and Uncle Pumblechook was soon down too , covering the mare with a cloth , and we were soon all in the kitchen , carrying so much cold air in with us that it seemed to drive all the heat out of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 46]: `` Now , '' said Mrs. Joe , unwrapping herself with haste and excitement , and throwing her bonnet back on her shoulders where it hung by the strings , `` if this boy ai n't grateful this night , he never will be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 22]: I looked as grateful as any boy possibly could , who was wholly uninformed why he ought to assume that expression .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 21]: `` It 's only to be hoped , '' said my sister , `` that he wo n't be Pompeyed .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 7]: But I have my fears . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 15]: `` She ai n't in that line , Mum , '' said Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 6]: `` She knows better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 2]: She ?
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 18]: I looked at Joe , making the motion with my lips and eyebrows , `` She ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 18]: Joe looked at me , making the motion with his lips and eyebrows , `` She ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 32]: My sister catching him in the act , he drew the back of his hand across his nose with his usual conciliatory air on such occasions , and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 9]: said my sister , in her snappish way .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 7]: `` What are you staring at ?
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 7]: Is the house afire ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 16]: -- Which some individual , '' Joe politely hinted , `` mentioned -- she . ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 11]: `` And she is a she , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 4]: said my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 9]: `` Unless you call Miss Havisham a he .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 14]: And I doubt if even you 'll go so far as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 8]: `` Miss Havisham , up town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: `` Is there any Miss Havisham down town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 4]: returned my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 11]: `` She wants this boy to go and play there .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 7]: And of course he 's going .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 35]: And he had better play there , '' said my sister , shaking her head at me as an encouragement to be extremely light and sportive , `` or I 'll work him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 50]: I had heard of Miss Havisham up town , -- everybody for miles round had heard of Miss Havisham up town , -- as an immensely rich and grim lady who lived in a large and dismal house barricaded against robbers , and who led a life of seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 7]: `` Well to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 5]: said Joe , astounded .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 11]: `` I wonder how she come to know Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 4]: `` Noodle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 4]: cried my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 9]: `` Who said she knew him ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 24]: -- Which some individual , '' Joe again politely hinted , `` mentioned that she wanted him to go and play there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 20]: `` And could n't she ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there ?
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 50]: Is n't it just barely possible that Uncle Pumblechook may be a tenant of hers , and that he may sometimes -- we wo n't say quarterly or half-yearly , for that would be requiring too much of you -- but sometimes -- go there to pay his rent ?
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 20]: And could n't she then ask Uncle Pumblechook if he knew of a boy to go and play there ?
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 75]: And could n't Uncle Pumblechook , being always considerate and thoughtful for us -- though you may not think it , Joseph , '' in a tone of the deepest reproach , as if he were the most callous of nephews , `` then mention this boy , standing Prancing here '' -- which I solemnly declare I was not doing -- `` that I have for ever been a willing slave to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 5]: `` Good again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 4]: cried Uncle Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 4]: `` Well put !
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 3]: Prettily pointed !
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 3]: Good indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 9]: Now Joseph , you know the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 48]: `` No , Joseph , '' said my sister , still in a reproachful manner , while Joe apologetically drew the back of his hand across and across his nose , `` you do not yet -- though you may not think it -- know the case .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 14]: You may consider that you do , but you do not , Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 67]: For you do not know that Uncle Pumblechook , being sensible that for anything we can tell , this boy 's fortune may be made by his going to Miss Havisham 's , has offered to take him into town to-night in his own chaise-cart , and to keep him to-night , and to take him with his own hands to Miss Havisham 's to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 5]: And Lor-a-mussy me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 57]: cried my sister , casting off her bonnet in sudden desperation , `` here I stand talking to mere Mooncalfs , with Uncle Pumblechook waiting , and the mare catching cold at the door , and the boy grimed with crock and dirt from the hair of his head to the sole of his foot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 64]: With that , she pounced upon me , like an eagle on a lamb , and my face was squeezed into wooden bowls in sinks , and my head was put under taps of water-butts , and I was soaped , and kneaded , and towelled , and thumped , and harrowed , and rasped , until I really was quite beside myself .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 34]: -LRB- I may here remark that I suppose myself to be better acquainted than any living authority , with the ridgy effect of a wedding-ring , passing unsympathetically over the human countenance . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 35]: When my ablutions were completed , I was put into clean linen of the stiffest character , like a young penitent into sackcloth , and was trussed up in my tightest and fearfullest suit .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 62]: I was then delivered over to Mr. Pumblechook , who formally received me as if he were the Sheriff , and who let off upon me the speech that I knew he had been dying to make all along : `` Boy , be forever grateful to all friends , but especially unto them which brought you up by hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 6]: `` Good-bye , Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 11]: `` God bless you , Pip , old chap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 29]: I had never parted from him before , and what with my feelings and what with soapsuds , I could at first see no stars from the chaise-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 39]: But they twinkled out one by one , without throwing any light on the questions why on earth I was going to play at Miss Havisham 's , and what on earth I was expected to play at .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 34]: Chapter VIII Mr. Pumblechook 's premises in the High Street of the market town , were of a peppercorny and farinaceous character , as the premises of a cornchandler and seedsman should be .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 69]: It appeared to me that he must be a very happy man indeed , to have so many little drawers in his shop ; and I wondered when I peeped into one or two on the lower tiers , and saw the tied-up brown paper packets inside , whether the flower-seeds and bulbs ever wanted of a fine day to break out of those jails , and bloom .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 15]: It was in the early morning after my arrival that I entertained this speculation .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 46]: On the previous night , I had been sent straight to bed in an attic with a sloping roof , which was so low in the corner where the bedstead was , that I calculated the tiles as being within a foot of my eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 16]: In the same early morning , I discovered a singular affinity between seeds and corduroys .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 59]: Mr. Pumblechook wore corduroys , and so did his shopman ; and somehow , there was a general air and flavor about the corduroys , so much in the nature of seeds , and a general air and flavor about the seeds , so much in the nature of corduroys , that I hardly knew which was which .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 81]: The same opportunity served me for noticing that Mr. Pumblechook appeared to conduct his business by looking across the street at the saddler , who appeared to transact his business by keeping his eye on the coachmaker , who appeared to get on in life by putting his hands in his pockets and contemplating the baker , who in his turn folded his arms and stared at the grocer , who stood at his door and yawned at the chemist .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 51]: The watchmaker , always poring over a little desk with a magnifying-glass at his eye , and always inspected by a group of smock-frocks poring over him through the glass of his shop-window , seemed to be about the only person in the High Street whose trade engaged his attention .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 39]: Mr. Pumblechook and I breakfasted at eight o'clock in the parlor behind the shop , while the shopman took his mug of tea and hunch of bread and butter on a sack of peas in the front premises .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 7]: I considered Mr. Pumblechook wretched company .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 73]: Besides being possessed by my sister 's idea that a mortifying and penitential character ought to be imparted to my diet , -- besides giving me as much crumb as possible in combination with as little butter , and putting such a quantity of warm water into my milk that it would have been more candid to have left the milk out altogether , -- his conversation consisted of nothing but arithmetic .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 21]: On my politely bidding him Good morning , he said , pompously , `` Seven times nine , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 24]: And how should I be able to answer , dodged in that way , in a strange place , on an empty stomach !
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 24]: I was hungry , but before I had swallowed a morsel , he began a running sum that lasted all through the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 4]: `` Seven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 5]: `` And four ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 5]: `` And eight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 5]: `` And six ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 5]: `` And two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 5]: `` And ten ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 61]: And after each figure was disposed of , it was as much as I could do to get a bite or a sup , before the next came ; while he sat at his ease guessing nothing , and eating bacon and hot roll , in -LRB- if I may be allowed the expression -RRB- a gorging and gormandizing manner .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 44]: For such reasons , I was very glad when ten o'clock came and we started for Miss Havisham 's ; though I was not at all at my ease regarding the manner in which I should acquit myself under that lady 's roof .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 33]: Within a quarter of an hour we came to Miss Havisham 's house , which was of old brick , and dismal , and had a great many iron bars to it .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 21]: Some of the windows had been walled up ; of those that remained , all the lower were rustily barred .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 32]: There was a courtyard in front , and that was barred ; so we had to wait , after ringing the bell , until some one should come to open it .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 22]: While we waited at the gate , I peeped in -LRB- even then Mr. Pumblechook said , `` And fourteen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 24]: but I pretended not to hear him -RRB- , and saw that at the side of the house there was a large brewery .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 21]: No brewing was going on in it , and none seemed to have gone on for a long long time .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 15]: A window was raised , and a clear voice demanded `` What name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 10]: To which my conductor replied , `` Pumblechook . ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 31]: The voice returned , `` Quite right , '' and the window was shut again , and a young lady came across the court-yard , with keys in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 13]: `` This , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , `` is Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 9]: `` This is Pip , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 21]: returned the young lady , who was very pretty and seemed very proud ; `` come in , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 15]: Mr. Pumblechook was coming in also , when she stopped him with the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 10]: `` Did you wish to see Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 16]: `` If Miss Havisham wished to see me , '' returned Mr. Pumblechook , discomfited .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 13]: said the girl ; `` but you see she do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 29]: She said it so finally , and in such an undiscussible way , that Mr. Pumblechook , though in a condition of ruffled dignity , could not protest .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 16]: But he eyed me severely , -- as if I had done anything to him !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 12]: -- and departed with the words reproachfully delivered : `` Boy !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 17]: Let your behavior here be a credit unto them which brought you up by hand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 22]: I was not free from apprehension that he would come back to propound through the gate , `` And sixteen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 5]: But he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 14]: My young conductress locked the gate , and we went across the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 14]: It was paved and clean , but grass was growing in every crevice .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 44]: The brewery buildings had a little lane of communication with it , and the wooden gates of that lane stood open , and all the brewery beyond stood open , away to the high enclosing wall ; and all was empty and disused .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 46]: The cold wind seemed to blow colder there than outside the gate ; and it made a shrill noise in howling in and out at the open sides of the brewery , like the noise of wind in the rigging of a ship at sea .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 30]: She saw me looking at it , and she said , `` You could drink without hurt all the strong beer that 's brewed there now , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 18]: `` I should think I could , miss , '' said I , in a shy way .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 26]: `` Better not try to brew beer there now , or it would turn out sour , boy ; do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 9]: `` It looks like it , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 34]: `` Not that anybody means to try , '' she added , `` for that 's all done with , and the place will stand as idle as it is till it falls .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 22]: As to strong beer , there 's enough of it in the cellars already , to drown the Manor House . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 12]: `` Is that the name of this house , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 9]: `` One of its names , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 12]: `` It has more than one , then , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 4]: `` One more .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 30]: Its other name was Satis ; which is Greek , or Latin , or Hebrew , or all three -- or all one to me -- for enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 18]: `` Enough House , '' said I ; `` that 's a curious name , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' she replied ; `` but it meant more than it said .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 18]: It meant , when it was given , that whoever had this house could want nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 14]: They must have been easily satisfied in those days , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 8]: But do n't loiter , boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 28]: Though she called me `` boy '' so often , and with a carelessness that was far from complimentary , she was of about my own age .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 37]: She seemed much older than I , of course , being a girl , and beautiful and self-possessed ; and she was as scornful of me as if she had been one-and-twenty , and a queen .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 47]: We went into the house by a side door , the great front entrance had two chains across it outside , -- and the first thing I noticed was , that the passages were all dark , and that she had left a candle burning there .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 30]: She took it up , and we went through more passages and up a staircase , and still it was all dark , and only the candle lighted us .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 20]: At last we came to the door of a room , and she said , `` Go in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 16]: I answered , more in shyness than politeness , `` After you , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 20]: To this she returned : `` Do n't be ridiculous , boy ; I am not going in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 17]: And scornfully walked away , and -- what was worse -- took the candle with her .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 11]: This was very uncomfortable , and I was half afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 26]: However , the only thing to be done being to knock at the door , I knocked , and was told from within to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 20]: I entered , therefore , and found myself in a pretty large room , well lighted with wax candles .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 11]: No glimpse of daylight was to be seen in it .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 27]: It was a dressing-room , as I supposed from the furniture , though much of it was of forms and uses then quite unknown to me .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 29]: But prominent in it was a draped table with a gilded looking-glass , and that I made out at first sight to be a fine lady 's dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 26]: Whether I should have made out this object so soon if there had been no fine lady sitting at it , I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 33]: In an arm-chair , with an elbow resting on the table and her head leaning on that hand , sat the strangest lady I have ever seen , or shall ever see .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 21]: She was dressed in rich materials , -- satins , and lace , and silks , -- all of white .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 5]: Her shoes were white .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 27]: And she had a long white veil dependent from her hair , and she had bridal flowers in her hair , but her hair was white .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 22]: Some bright jewels sparkled on her neck and on her hands , and some other jewels lay sparkling on the table .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 18]: Dresses , less splendid than the dress she wore , and half-packed trunks , were scattered about .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 78]: She had not quite finished dressing , for she had but one shoe on , -- the other was on the table near her hand , -- her veil was but half arranged , her watch and chain were not put on , and some lace for her bosom lay with those trinkets , and with her handkerchief , and gloves , and some flowers , and a Prayer -- Book all confusedly heaped about the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 30]: It was not in the first few moments that I saw all these things , though I saw more of them in the first moments than might be supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 31]: But I saw that everything within my view which ought to be white , had been white long ago , and had lost its lustre and was faded and yellow .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 33]: I saw that the bride within the bridal dress had withered like the dress , and like the flowers , and had no brightness left but the brightness of her sunken eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 34]: I saw that the dress had been put upon the rounded figure of a young woman , and that the figure upon which it now hung loose had shrunk to skin and bone .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 26]: Once , I had been taken to see some ghastly waxwork at the Fair , representing I know not what impossible personage lying in state .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 37]: Once , I had been taken to one of our old marsh churches to see a skeleton in the ashes of a rich dress that had been dug out of a vault under the church pavement .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 17]: Now , waxwork and skeleton seemed to have dark eyes that moved and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 10]: I should have cried out , if I could .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: said the lady at the table .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 6]: `` Pip , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 4]: `` Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 8]: `` Mr. Pumblechook 's boy , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 6]: Come -- to play . ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 10]: `` Come nearer ; let me look at you .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 4]: Come close . ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 51]: It was when I stood before her , avoiding her eyes , that I took note of the surrounding objects in detail , and saw that her watch had stopped at twenty minutes to nine , and that a clock in the room had stopped at twenty minutes to nine .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 10]: `` Look at me , '' said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 20]: `` You are not afraid of a woman who has never seen the sun since you were born ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 22]: I regret to state that I was not afraid of telling the enormous lie comprehended in the answer `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 10]: `` Do you know what I touch here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 17]: she said , laying her hands , one upon the other , on her left side .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: -LRB- It made me think of the young man . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 7]: `` What do I touch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: `` Your heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 4]: `` Broken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 28]: She uttered the word with an eager look , and with strong emphasis , and with a weird smile that had a kind of boast in it .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 22]: Afterwards she kept her hands there for a little while , and slowly took them away as if they were heavy .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 10]: `` I am tired , '' said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 14]: `` I want diversion , and I have done with men and women .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 3]: Play . ''
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 37]: I think it will be conceded by my most disputatious reader , that she could hardly have directed an unfortunate boy to do anything in the wide world more difficult to be done under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 27]: `` I sometimes have sick fancies , '' she went on , `` and I have a sick fancy that I want to see some play .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 5]: There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 20]: with an impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand ; `` play , play , play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 37]: For a moment , with the fear of my sister 's working me before my eyes , I had a desperate idea of starting round the room in the assumed character of Mr. Pumblechook 's chaise-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 57]: But I felt myself so unequal to the performance that I gave it up , and stood looking at Miss Havisham in what I suppose she took for a dogged manner , inasmuch as she said , when we had taken a good look at each other , -- `` Are you sullen and obstinate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 22]: `` No , ma'am , I am very sorry for you , and very sorry I ca n't play just now .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 44]: If you complain of me I shall get into trouble with my sister , so I would do it if I could ; but it 's so new here , and so strange , and so fine , -- and melancholy -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 25]: I stopped , fearing I might say too much , or had already said it , and we took another look at each other .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 33]: Before she spoke again , she turned her eyes from me , and looked at the dress she wore , and at the dressing-table , and finally at herself in the looking-glass .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 33]: `` So new to him , '' she muttered , `` so old to me ; so strange to him , so familiar to me ; so melancholy to both of us !
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 4]: Call Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 24]: As she was still looking at the reflection of herself , I thought she was still talking to herself , and kept quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 14]: `` Call Estella , '' she repeated , flashing a look at me .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 6]: `` You can do that .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 3]: Call Estella .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 5]: At the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 48]: To stand in the dark in a mysterious passage of an unknown house , bawling Estella to a scornful young lady neither visible nor responsive , and feeling it a dreadful liberty so to roar out her name , was almost as bad as playing to order .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 18]: But she answered at last , and her light came along the dark passage like a star .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 33]: Miss Havisham beckoned her to come close , and took up a jewel from the table , and tried its effect upon her fair young bosom and against her pretty brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 17]: `` Your own , one day , my dear , and you will use it well .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 11]: Let me see you play cards with this boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 5]: `` With this boy ?
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 10]: Why , he is a common laboring boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 19]: I thought I overheard Miss Havisham answer , -- only it seemed so Unlikely , -- `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 7]: You can break his heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 9]: `` What do you play , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 10]: asked Estella of myself , with the greatest disdain .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 10]: `` Nothing but beggar my neighbor , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 11]: `` Beggar him , '' said Miss Havisham to Estella .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 7]: So we sat down to cards .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 27]: It was then I began to understand that everything in the room had stopped , like the watch and the clock , a long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 21]: I noticed that Miss Havisham put down the jewel exactly on the spot from which she had taken it up .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 32]: As Estella dealt the cards , I glanced at the dressing-table again , and saw that the shoe upon it , once white , now yellow , had never been worn .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 33]: I glanced down at the foot from which the shoe was absent , and saw that the silk stocking on it , once white , now yellow , had been trodden ragged .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 42]: Without this arrest of everything , this standing still of all the pale decayed objects , not even the withered bridal dress on the collapsed form could have looked so like grave-clothes , or the long veil so like a shroud .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 26]: So she sat , corpse-like , as we played at cards ; the frillings and trimmings on her bridal dress , looking like earthy paper .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 60]: I knew nothing then of the discoveries that are occasionally made of bodies buried in ancient times , which fall to powder in the moment of being distinctly seen ; but , I have often thought since , that she must have looked as if the admission of the natural light of day would have struck her to dust .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 11]: `` He calls the knaves Jacks , this boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 12]: said Estella with disdain , before our first game was out .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: `` And what coarse hands he has !
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 6]: And what thick boots ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 23]: I had never thought of being ashamed of my hands before ; but I began to consider them a very indifferent pair .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 18]: Her contempt for me was so strong , that it became infectious , and I caught it .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 9]: She won the game , and I dealt .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 33]: I misdealt , as was only natural , when I knew she was lying in wait for me to do wrong ; and she denounced me for a stupid , clumsy laboring-boy .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 19]: `` You say nothing of her , '' remarked Miss Havisham to me , as she looked on .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 16]: `` She says many hard things of you , but you say nothing of her .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: What do you think of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 12]: `` I do n't like to say , '' I stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 15]: `` Tell me in my ear , '' said Miss Havisham , bending down .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 16]: `` I think she is very proud , '' I replied , in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 9]: `` I think she is very pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 9]: `` I think she is very insulting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 15]: -LRB- She was looking at me then with a look of supreme aversion . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 5]: `` Anything else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 11]: `` I think I should like to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 14]: `` And never see her again , though she is so pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 25]: `` I am not sure that I should n't like to see her again , but I should like to go home now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 13]: `` You shall go soon , '' said Miss Havisham , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 7]: `` Play the game out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 24]: Saving for the one weird smile at first , I should have felt almost sure that Miss Havisham 's face could not smile .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 37]: It had dropped into a watchful and brooding expression , -- most likely when all the things about her had become transfixed , -- and it looked as if nothing could ever lift it up again .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 55]: Her chest had dropped , so that she stooped ; and her voice had dropped , so that she spoke low , and with a dead lull upon her ; altogether , she had the appearance of having dropped body and soul , within and without , under the weight of a crushing blow .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 15]: I played the game to an end with Estella , and she beggared me .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 27]: She threw the cards down on the table when she had won them all , as if she despised them for having been won of me .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 10]: `` When shall I have you here again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 4]: said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 6]: `` Let me think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 28]: I was beginning to remind her that to-day was Wednesday , when she checked me with her former impatient movement of the fingers of her right hand .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 5]: `` There , there !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 18]: I know nothing of days of the week ; I know nothing of weeks of the year .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 6]: Come again after six days .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 4]: You hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 7]: `` Estella , take him down .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 19]: Let him have something to eat , and let him roam and look about him while he eats .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 5]: Go , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 27]: I followed the candle down , as I had followed the candle up , and she stood it in the place where we had found it .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 23]: Until she opened the side entrance , I had fancied , without thinking about it , that it must necessarily be night-time .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 28]: The rush of the daylight quite confounded me , and made me feel as if I had been in the candlelight of the strange room many hours .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 21]: `` You are to wait here , you boy , '' said Estella ; and disappeared and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 21]: I took the opportunity of being alone in the courtyard to look at my coarse hands and my common boots .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 9]: My opinion of those accessories was not favorable .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 17]: They had never troubled me before , but they troubled me now , as vulgar appendages .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 24]: I determined to ask Joe why he had ever taught me to call those picture-cards Jacks , which ought to be called knaves .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 20]: I wished Joe had been rather more genteelly brought up , and then I should have been so too .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 16]: She came back , with some bread and meat and a little mug of beer .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 35]: She put the mug down on the stones of the yard , and gave me the bread and meat without looking at me , as insolently as if I were a dog in disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 43]: I was so humiliated , hurt , spurned , offended , angry , sorry , -- I can not hit upon the right name for the smart -- God knows what its name was , -- that tears started to my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 23]: The moment they sprang there , the girl looked at me with a quick delight in having been the cause of them .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 45]: This gave me power to keep them back and to look at her : so , she gave a contemptuous toss -- but with a sense , I thought , of having made too sure that I was so wounded -- and left me .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 48]: But when she was gone , I looked about me for a place to hide my face in , and got behind one of the gates in the brewery-lane , and leaned my sleeve against the wall there , and leaned my forehead on it and cried .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 38]: As I cried , I kicked the wall , and took a hard twist at my hair ; so bitter were my feelings , and so sharp was the smart without a name , that needed counteraction .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: My sister 's bringing up had made me sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 28]: In the little world in which children have their existence whosoever brings them up , there is nothing so finely perceived and so finely felt as injustice .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 45]: It may be only small injustice that the child can be exposed to ; but the child is small , and its world is small , and its rocking-horse stands as many hands high , according to scale , as a big-boned Irish hunter .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 17]: Within myself , I had sustained , from my babyhood , a perpetual conflict with injustice .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 28]: I had known , from the time when I could speak , that my sister , in her capricious and violent coercion , was unjust to me .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 24]: I had cherished a profound conviction that her bringing me up by hand gave her no right to bring me up by jerks .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 55]: Through all my punishments , disgraces , fasts , and vigils , and other penitential performances , I had nursed this assurance ; and to my communing so much with it , in a solitary and unprotected way , I in great part refer the fact that I was morally timid and very sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 43]: I got rid of my injured feelings for the time by kicking them into the brewery wall , and twisting them out of my hair , and then I smoothed my face with my sleeve , and came from behind the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 26]: The bread and meat were acceptable , and the beer was warming and tingling , and I was soon in spirits to look about me .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 55]: To be sure , it was a deserted place , down to the pigeon-house in the brewery-yard , which had been blown crooked on its pole by some high wind , and would have made the pigeons think themselves at sea , if there had been any pigeons there to be rocked by it .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 40]: But there were no pigeons in the dove-cot , no horses in the stable , no pigs in the sty , no malt in the storehouse , no smells of grains and beer in the copper or the vat .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 18]: All the uses and scents of the brewery might have evaporated with its last reek of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 58]: In a by-yard , there was a wilderness of empty casks , which had a certain sour remembrance of better days lingering about them ; but it was too sour to be accepted as a sample of the beer that was gone , -- and in this respect I remember those recluses as being like most others .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 90]: Behind the furthest end of the brewery , was a rank garden with an old wall ; not so high but that I could struggle up and hold on long enough to look over it , and see that the rank garden was the garden of the house , and that it was overgrown with tangled weeds , but that there was a track upon the green and yellow paths , as if some one sometimes walked there , and that Estella was walking away from me even then .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 7]: But she seemed to be everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 34]: For when I yielded to the temptation presented by the casks , and began to walk on them , I saw her walking on them at the end of the yard of casks .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 33]: She had her back towards me , and held her pretty brown hair spread out in her two hands , and never looked round , and passed out of my view directly .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 34]: So , in the brewery itself , -- by which I mean the large paved lofty place in which they used to make the beer , and where the brewing utensils still were .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 58]: When I first went into it , and , rather oppressed by its gloom , stood near the door looking about me , I saw her pass among the extinguished fires , and ascend some light iron stairs , and go out by a gallery high overhead , as if she were going out into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 20]: It was in this place , and at this moment , that a strange thing happened to my fancy .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 18]: I thought it a strange thing then , and I thought it a stranger thing long afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 46]: I turned my eyes -- a little dimmed by looking up at the frosty light -- towards a great wooden beam in a low nook of the building near me on my right hand , and I saw a figure hanging there by the neck .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 63]: A figure all in yellow white , with but one shoe to the feet ; and it hung so , that I could see that the faded trimmings of the dress were like earthy paper , and that the face was Miss Havisham 's , with a movement going over the whole countenance as if she were trying to call to me .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 38]: In the terror of seeing the figure , and in the terror of being certain that it had not been there a moment before , I at first ran from it , and then ran towards it .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 14]: And my terror was greatest of all when I found no figure there .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 45]: Nothing less than the frosty light of the cheerful sky , the sight of people passing beyond the bars of the court-yard gate , and the reviving influence of the rest of the bread and meat and beer , would have brought me round .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 33]: Even with those aids , I might not have come to myself as soon as I did , but that I saw Estella approaching with the keys , to let me out .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 29]: She would have some fair reason for looking down upon me , I thought , if she saw me frightened ; and she would have no fair reason .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 38]: She gave me a triumphant glance in passing me , as if she rejoiced that my hands were so coarse and my boots were so thick , and she opened the gate , and stood holding it .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 18]: I was passing out without looking at her , when she touched me with a taunting hand .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 8]: `` Why do n't you cry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 9]: `` Because I do n't want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 8]: `` You do , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 20]: `` You have been crying till you are half blind , and you are near crying again now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 15]: She laughed contemptuously , pushed me out , and locked the gate upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 19]: I went straight to Mr. Pumblechook 's , and was immensely relieved to find him not at home .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 103]: So , leaving word with the shopman on what day I was wanted at Miss Havisham 's again , I set off on the four-mile walk to our forge ; pondering , as I went along , on all I had seen , and deeply revolving that I was a common laboring-boy ; that my hands were coarse ; that my boots were thick ; that I had fallen into a despicable habit of calling knaves Jacks ; that I was much more ignorant than I had considered myself last night , and generally that I was in a low-lived bad way .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 27]: Chapter IX When I reached home , my sister was very curious to know all about Miss Havisham 's , and asked a number of questions .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 45]: And I soon found myself getting heavily bumped from behind in the nape of the neck and the small of the back , and having my face ignominiously shoved against the kitchen wall , because I did not answer those questions at sufficient length .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 61]: If a dread of not being understood be hidden in the breasts of other young people to anything like the extent to which it used to be hidden in mine , -- which I consider probable , as I have no particular reason to suspect myself of having been a monstrosity , -- it is the key to many reservations .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 23]: I felt convinced that if I described Miss Havisham 's as my eyes had seen it , I should not be understood .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 61]: Not only that , but I felt convinced that Miss Havisham too would not be understood ; and although she was perfectly incomprehensible to me , I entertained an impression that there would be something coarse and treacherous in my dragging her as she really was -LRB- to say nothing of Miss Estella -RRB- before the contemplation of Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 20]: Consequently , I said as little as I could , and had my face shoved against the kitchen wall .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 45]: The worst of it was that that bullying old Pumblechook , preyed upon by a devouring curiosity to be informed of all I had seen and heard , came gaping over in his chaise-cart at tea-time , to have the details divulged to him .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 38]: And the mere sight of the torment , with his fishy eyes and mouth open , his sandy hair inquisitively on end , and his waistcoat heaving with windy arithmetic , made me vicious in my reticence .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 25]: `` Well , boy , '' Uncle Pumblechook began , as soon as he was seated in the chair of honor by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 10]: `` How did you get on up town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 19]: I answered , `` Pretty well , sir , '' and my sister shook her fist at me .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 5]: `` Pretty well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 4]: Mr. Pumblechook repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 7]: `` Pretty well is no answer .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 12]: Tell us what you mean by pretty well , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 14]: Whitewash on the forehead hardens the brain into a state of obstinacy perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 16]: Anyhow , with whitewash from the wall on my forehead , my obstinacy was adamantine .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 25]: I reflected for some time , and then answered as if I had discovered a new idea , `` I mean pretty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 39]: My sister with an exclamation of impatience was going to fly at me , -- I had no shadow of defence , for Joe was busy in the forge , -- when Mr. Pumblechook interposed with `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 6]: Do n't lose your temper .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 15]: Leave this lad to me , ma'am ; leave this lad to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 37]: Mr. Pumblechook then turned me towards him , as if he were going to cut my hair , and said , -- `` First -LRB- to get our thoughts in order -RRB- : Forty-three pence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 34]: I calculated the consequences of replying `` Four Hundred Pound , '' and finding them against me , went as near the answer as I could -- which was somewhere about eightpence off .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 44]: Mr. Pumblechook then put me through my pence-table from `` twelve pence make one shilling , '' up to `` forty pence make three and fourpence , '' and then triumphantly demanded , as if he had done for me , `` Now !
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 7]: How much is forty-three pence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 19]: To which I replied , after a long interval of reflection , `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 14]: And I was so aggravated that I almost doubt if I did know .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 32]: Mr. Pumblechook worked his head like a screw to screw it out of me , and said , `` Is forty-three pence seven and sixpence three fardens , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 34]: said I. And although my sister instantly boxed my ears , it was highly gratifying to me to see that the answer spoilt his joke , and brought him to a dead stop .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 3]: `` Boy !
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 7]: What like is Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 21]: Mr. Pumblechook began again when he had recovered ; folding his arms tight on his chest and applying the screw .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: `` Very tall and dark , '' I told him .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 7]: `` Is she , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 4]: asked my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 27]: Mr. Pumblechook winked assent ; from which I at once inferred that he had never seen Miss Havisham , for she was nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 5]: said Mr. Pumblechook conceitedly .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 10]: -LRB- `` This is the way to have him !
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 15]: We are beginning to hold our own , I think , Mum ? '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 31]: `` I am sure , uncle , '' returned Mrs. Joe , `` I wish you had him always ; you know so well how to deal with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 5]: `` Now , boy !
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 14]: What was she a doing of , when you went in today ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 4]: asked Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 17]: `` She was sitting , '' I answered , `` in a black velvet coach . ''
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 27]: Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another -- as they well Might -- and both repeated , `` In a black velvet coach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 34]: `` Yes , '' said I. `` And Miss Estella -- that 's her niece , I think -- handed her in cake and wine at the coach-window , on a gold plate .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 11]: And we all had cake and wine on gold plates .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 18]: And I got up behind the coach to eat mine , because she told me to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 7]: `` Was anybody else there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 4]: asked Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 13]: `` Four dogs , '' said I. `` Large or small ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 19]: `` Immense , '' said I. `` And they fought for veal-cutlets out of a silver basket . ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 15]: Mr. Pumblechook and Mrs. Joe stared at one another again , in utter amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 21]: I was perfectly frantic , -- a reckless witness under the torture , -- and would have told them anything .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 13]: `` Where was this coach , in the name of gracious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 4]: asked my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 8]: `` In Miss Havisham 's room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 4]: They stared again .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 11]: `` But there were n't any horses to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 24]: I added this saving clause , in the moment of rejecting four richly caparisoned coursers which I had had wild thoughts of harnessing .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 9]: `` Can this be possible , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 8]: `` What can the boy mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 13]: `` I 'll tell you , Mum , '' said Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 10]: `` My opinion is , it 's a sedan-chair .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 24]: She 's flighty , you know , -- very flighty , -- quite flighty enough to pass her days in a sedan-chair . ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 12]: `` Did you ever see her in it , uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 24]: `` How could I , '' he returned , forced to the admission , `` when I never see her in my life ?
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 7]: Never clapped eyes upon her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 5]: `` Goodness , uncle !
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 9]: And yet you have spoken to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 51]: `` Why , do n't you know , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , testily , `` that when I have been there , I have been took up to the outside of her door , and the door has stood ajar , and she has spoke to me that way .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 11]: Do n't say you do n't know that , Mum .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 9]: Howsever , the boy went there to play .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 9]: What did you play at , boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: `` We played with flags , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 25]: -LRB- I beg to observe that I think of myself with amazement , when I recall the lies I told on this occasion . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 4]: `` Flags ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 4]: echoed my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 38]: `` Yes , '' said I. `` Estella waved a blue flag , and I waved a red one , and Miss Havisham waved one sprinkled all over with little gold stars , out at the coach-window .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 11]: And then we all waved our swords and hurrahed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 4]: `` Swords ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 4]: repeated my sister .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 9]: `` Where did you get swords from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 25]: `` Out of a cupboard , '' said I. `` And I saw pistols in it , -- and jam , -- and pills .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 19]: And there was no daylight in the room , but it was all lighted up with candles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 17]: `` That 's true , Mum , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , with a grave nod .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 18]: `` That 's the state of the case , for that much I 've seen myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 38]: And then they both stared at me , and I , with an obtrusive show of artlessness on my countenance , stared at them , and plaited the right leg of my trousers with my right hand .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 57]: If they had asked me any more questions , I should undoubtedly have betrayed myself , for I was even then on the point of mentioning that there was a balloon in the yard , and should have hazarded the statement but for my invention being divided between that phenomenon and a bear in the brewery .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 24]: They were so much occupied , however , in discussing the marvels I had already presented for their consideration , that I escaped .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 19]: The subject still held them when Joe came in from his work to have a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 25]: To whom my sister , more for the relief of her own mind than for the gratification of his , related my pretended experiences .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 44]: Now , when I saw Joe open his blue eyes and roll them all round the kitchen in helpless amazement , I was overtaken by penitence ; but only as regarded him , -- not in the least as regarded the other two .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 32]: Towards Joe , and Joe only , I considered myself a young monster , while they sat debating what results would come to me from Miss Havisham 's acquaintance and favor .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 26]: They had no doubt that Miss Havisham would `` do something '' for me ; their doubts related to the form that something would take .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 9]: My sister stood out for `` property . ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 30]: Mr. Pumblechook was in favor of a handsome premium for binding me apprentice to some genteel trade , -- say , the corn and seed trade , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 32]: Joe fell into the deepest disgrace with both , for offering the bright suggestion that I might only be presented with one of the dogs who had fought for the veal-cutlets .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 38]: `` If a fool 's head ca n't express better opinions than that , '' said my sister , `` and you have got any work to do , you had better go and do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 4]: So he went .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 35]: After Mr. Pumblechook had driven off , and when my sister was washing up , I stole into the forge to Joe , and remained by him until he had done for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 22]: Then I said , `` Before the fire goes out , Joe , I should like to tell you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 7]: `` Should you , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 10]: said Joe , drawing his shoeing-stool near the forge .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 5]: `` Then tell us .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 7]: What is it , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 35]: `` Joe , '' said I , taking hold of his rolled-up shirt sleeve , and twisting it between my finger and thumb , `` you remember all that about Miss Havisham 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 4]: `` Remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 5]: `` I believe you !
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 3]: Wonderful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 15]: `` It 's a terrible thing , Joe ; it ai n't true . ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 10]: `` What are you telling of , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 10]: cried Joe , falling back in the greatest amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 23]: `` You do n't mean to say it 's -- '' `` Yes I do ; it 's lies , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 7]: `` But not all of it ?
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 22]: Why sure you do n't mean to say , Pip , that there was no black welwet co -- ch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 8]: For , I stood shaking my head .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: `` But at least there was dogs , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 25]: Come , Pip , '' said Joe , persuasively , `` if there war n't no weal-cutlets , at least there was dogs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 6]: `` No , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: `` A dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 4]: `` A puppy ?
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 3]: Come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 15]: `` No , Joe , there was nothing at all of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 15]: As I fixed my eyes hopelessly on Joe , Joe contemplated me in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 6]: `` Pip , old chap !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 8]: This wo n't do , old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 9]: Where do you expect to go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 12]: `` It 's terrible , Joe ; ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 4]: `` Terrible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 3]: cried Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 3]: `` Awful !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 5]: What possessed you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 67]: `` I do n't know what possessed me , Joe , '' I replied , letting his shirt sleeve go , and sitting down in the ashes at his feet , hanging my head ; `` but I wish you had n't taught me to call Knaves at cards Jacks ; and I wish my boots were n't so thick nor my hands so coarse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 95]: And then I told Joe that I felt very miserable , and that I had n't been able to explain myself to Mrs. Joe and Pumblechook , who were so rude to me , and that there had been a beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham 's who was dreadfully proud , and that she had said I was common , and that I knew I was common , and that I wished I was not common , and that the lies had come of it somehow , though I did n't know how .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 20]: This was a case of metaphysics , at least as difficult for Joe to deal with as for me .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 20]: But Joe took the case altogether out of the region of metaphysics , and by that means vanquished it .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 29]: `` There 's one thing you may be sure of , Pip , '' said Joe , after some rumination , `` namely , that lies is lies .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 27]: Howsever they come , they did n't ought to come , and they come from the father of lies , and work round to the same .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 11]: Do n't you tell no more of 'em , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 15]: That ai n't the way to get out of being common , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 16]: And as to being common , I do n't make it out at all clear .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: You are oncommon in some things .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 5]: You 're oncommon small .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 8]: Likewise you 're a oncommon scholar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 12]: `` No , I am ignorant and backward , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 12]: `` Why , see what a letter you wrote last night !
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: Wrote in print even !
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 7]: I 've seen letters -- Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 4]: and from gentlefolks !
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 15]: -- that I 'll swear were n't wrote in print , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 10]: `` I have learnt next to nothing , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 6]: You think much of me .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 6]: It 's only that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 37]: `` Well , Pip , '' said Joe , `` be it so or be it so n't , you must be a common scholar afore you can be a oncommon one , I should hope !
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 40]: The king upon his throne , with his crown upon his ed , ca n't sit and write his acts of Parliament in print , without having begun , when he were a unpromoted Prince , with the alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 4]: -- Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 49]: added Joe , with a shake of the head that was full of meaning , `` and begun at A. too , and worked his way to Z. And I know what that is to do , though I ca n't say I 've exactly done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 16]: There was some hope in this piece of wisdom , and it rather encouraged me .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 57]: `` Whether common ones as to callings and earnings , '' pursued Joe , reflectively , `` might n't be the better of continuing for to keep company with common ones , instead of going out to play with oncommon ones , -- which reminds me to hope that there were a flag , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 7]: `` No , Joe . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 13]: -LRB- I 'm sorry there were n't a flag , Pip -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 43]: Whether that might be or might n't be , is a thing as ca n't be looked into now , without putting your sister on the Rampage ; and that 's a thing not to be thought of as being done intentional .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 16]: Lookee here , Pip , at what is said to you by a true friend .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 9]: Which this to you the true friend say .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 23]: If you ca n't get to be oncommon through going straight , you 'll never get to do it through going crooked .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 19]: So do n't tell no more on 'em , Pip , and live well and die happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 11]: `` You are not angry with me , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 6]: `` No , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 52]: But bearing in mind that them were which I meantersay of a stunning and outdacious sort , -- alluding to them which bordered on weal-cutlets and dog-fighting , -- a sincere well-wisher would adwise , Pip , their being dropped into your meditations , when you go up stairs to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 17]: That 's all , old chap , and do n't never do it no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 66]: When I got up to my little room and said my prayers , I did not forget Joe 's recommendation , and yet my young mind was in that disturbed and unthankful state , that I thought long after I laid me down , how common Estella would consider Joe , a mere blacksmith ; how thick his boots , and how coarse his hands .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 49]: I thought how Joe and my sister were then sitting in the kitchen , and how I had come up to bed from the kitchen , and how Miss Havisham and Estella never sat in a kitchen , but were far above the level of such common doings .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 55]: I fell asleep recalling what I `` used to do '' when I was at Miss Havisham 's ; as though I had been there weeks or months , instead of hours ; and as though it were quite an old subject of remembrance , instead of one that had arisen only that day .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 16]: That was a memorable day to me , for it made great changes in me .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 9]: But it is the same with any life .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 19]: Imagine one selected day struck out of it , and think how different its course would have been .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 45]: Pause you who read this , and think for a moment of the long chain of iron or gold , of thorns or flowers , that would never have bound you , but for the formation of the first link on one memorable day .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 38]: Chapter X The felicitous idea occurred to me a morning or two later when I woke , that the best step I could take towards making myself uncommon was to get out of Biddy everything she knew .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 56]: In pursuance of this luminous conception I mentioned to Biddy when I went to Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt 's at night , that I had a particular reason for wishing to get on in life , and that I should feel very much obliged to her if she would impart all her learning to me .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 27]: Biddy , who was the most obliging of girls , immediately said she would , and indeed began to carry out her promise within five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 19]: The Educational scheme or Course established by Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt may be resolved into the following synopsis .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 33]: The pupils ate apples and put straws down one another 's backs , until Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt collected her energies , and made an indiscriminate totter at them with a birch-rod .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 26]: After receiving the charge with every mark of derision , the pupils formed in line and buzzingly passed a ragged book from hand to hand .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 29]: The book had an alphabet in it , some figures and tables , and a little spelling , -- that is to say , it had had once .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 29]: As soon as this volume began to circulate , Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt fell into a state of coma , arising either from sleep or a rheumatic paroxysm .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 30]: The pupils then entered among themselves upon a competitive examination on the subject of Boots , with the view of ascertaining who could tread the hardest upon whose toes .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 69]: This mental exercise lasted until Biddy made a rush at them and distributed three defaced Bibles -LRB- shaped as if they had been unskilfully cut off the chump end of something -RRB- , more illegibly printed at the best than any curiosities of literature I have since met with , speckled all over with ironmould , and having various specimens of the insect world smashed between their leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 18]: This part of the Course was usually lightened by several single combats between Biddy and refractory students .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 68]: When the fights were over , Biddy gave out the number of a page , and then we all read aloud what we could , -- or what we could n't -- in a frightful chorus ; Biddy leading with a high , shrill , monotonous voice , and none of us having the least notion of , or reverence for , what we were reading about .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 30]: When this horrible din had lasted a certain time , it mechanically awoke Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt , who staggered at a boy fortuitously , and pulled his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 23]: This was understood to terminate the Course for the evening , and we emerged into the air with shrieks of intellectual victory .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 90]: It is fair to remark that there was no prohibition against any pupil 's entertaining himself with a slate or even with the ink -LRB- when there was any -RRB- , but that it was not easy to pursue that branch of study in the winter season , on account of the little general shop in which the classes were holden -- and which was also Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt 's sitting-room and bedchamber -- being but faintly illuminated through the agency of one low-spirited dip-candle and no snuffers .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 100]: It appeared to me that it would take time to become uncommon , under these circumstances : nevertheless , I resolved to try it , and that very evening Biddy entered on our special agreement , by imparting some information from her little catalogue of Prices , under the head of moist sugar , and lending me , to copy at home , a large old English D which she had imitated from the heading of some newspaper , and which I supposed , until she told me what it was , to be a design for a buckle .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 22]: Of course there was a public-house in the village , and of course Joe liked sometimes to smoke his pipe there .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 35]: I had received strict orders from my sister to call for him at the Three Jolly Bargemen , that evening , on my way from school , and bring him home at my peril .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 13]: To the Three Jolly Bargemen , therefore , I directed my steps .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 37]: There was a bar at the Jolly Bargemen , with some alarmingly long chalk scores in it on the wall at the side of the door , which seemed to me to be never paid off .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 18]: They had been there ever since I could remember , and had grown more than I had .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 24]: But there was a quantity of chalk about our country , and perhaps the people neglected no opportunity of turning it to account .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 73]: It being Saturday night , I found the landlord looking rather grimly at these records ; but as my business was with Joe and not with him , I merely wished him good evening , and passed into the common room at the end of the passage , where there was a bright large kitchen fire , and where Joe was smoking his pipe in company with Mr. Wopsle and a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 15]: Joe greeted me as usual with `` Halloa , Pip , old chap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 17]: and the moment he said that , the stranger turned his head and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 12]: He was a secret-looking man whom I had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 31]: His head was all on one side , and one of his eyes was half shut up , as if he were taking aim at something with an invisible gun .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 34]: He had a pipe in his mouth , and he took it out , and , after slowly blowing all his smoke away and looking hard at me all the time , nodded .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 26]: So , I nodded , and then he nodded again , and made room on the settle beside him that I might sit down there .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 42]: But as I was used to sit beside Joe whenever I entered that place of resort , I said `` No , thank you , sir , '' and fell into the space Joe made for me on the opposite settle .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 46]: The strange man , after glancing at Joe , and seeing that his attention was otherwise engaged , nodded to me again when I had taken my seat , and then rubbed his leg -- in a very odd way , as it struck me .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 23]: `` You was saying , '' said the strange man , turning to Joe , `` that you was a blacksmith . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 11]: I said it , you know , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 9]: `` What 'll you drink , Mr. -- ?
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: You did n't mention your name , by the bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 14]: Joe mentioned it now , and the strange man called him by it .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 9]: `` What 'll you drink , Mr. Gargery ?
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 4]: At my expense ?
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 6]: To top up with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 32]: `` Well , '' said Joe , `` to tell you the truth , I ai n't much in the habit of drinking at anybody 's expense but my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 3]: `` Habit ?
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 20]: No , '' returned the stranger , `` but once and away , and on a Saturday night too .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 10]: Put a name to it , Mr. Gargery . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 14]: `` I would n't wish to be stiff company , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 4]: `` Rum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 8]: `` Rum , '' repeated the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: `` And will the other gentleman originate a sentiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 8]: `` Rum , '' said Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 5]: `` Three Rums ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 9]: cried the stranger , calling to the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 5]: `` Glasses round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 30]: `` This other gentleman , '' observed Joe , by way of introducing Mr. Wopsle , `` is a gentleman that you would like to hear give it out .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 6]: Our clerk at church . ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 13]: said the stranger , quickly , and cocking his eye at me .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 17]: `` The lonely church , right out on the marshes , with graves round it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 9]: `` That 's it , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 26]: The stranger , with a comfortable kind of grunt over his pipe , put his legs up on the settle that he had to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 32]: He wore a flapping broad-brimmed traveller 's hat , and under it a handkerchief tied over his head in the manner of a cap : so that he showed no hair .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 25]: As he looked at the fire , I thought I saw a cunning expression , followed by a half-laugh , come into his face .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 22]: `` I am not acquainted with this country , gentlemen , but it seems a solitary country towards the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 10]: `` Most marshes is solitary , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 7]: `` No doubt , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 21]: Do you find any gypsies , now , or tramps , or vagrants of any sort , out there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 17]: `` No , '' said Joe ; `` none but a runaway convict now and then .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 9]: And we do n't find them , easy .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 6]: Eh , Mr. Wopsle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 17]: Mr. Wopsle , with a majestic remembrance of old discomfiture , assented ; but not warmly .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 10]: `` Seems you have been out after such ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 4]: asked the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 7]: `` Once , '' returned Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 28]: `` Not that we wanted to take them , you understand ; we went out as lookers on ; me , and Mr. Wopsle , and Pip .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 7]: Did n't us , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: `` Yes , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 42]: The stranger looked at me again , -- still cocking his eye , as if he were expressly taking aim at me with his invisible gun , -- and said , `` He 's a likely young parcel of bones that .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 8]: What is it you call him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 7]: `` Pip , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 5]: `` Christened Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 8]: `` No , not christened Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 5]: `` Surname Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 29]: `` No , '' said Joe , `` it 's a kind of family name what he gave himself when a infant , and is called by . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 6]: `` Son of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 55]: `` Well , '' said Joe , meditatively , not , of course , that it could be in anywise necessary to consider about it , but because it was the way at the Jolly Bargemen to seem to consider deeply about everything that was discussed over pipes , -- `` well -- no .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 7]: No , he ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 4]: `` Nevvy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 5]: said the strange man .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 35]: `` Well , '' said Joe , with the same appearance of profound cogitation , `` he is not -- no , not to deceive you , he is not -- my nevvy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 9]: `` What the Blue Blazes is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 4]: asked the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 12]: Which appeared to me to be an inquiry of unnecessary strength .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 40]: Mr. Wopsle struck in upon that ; as one who knew all about relationships , having professional occasion to bear in mind what female relations a man might not marry ; and expounded the ties between me and Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 45]: Having his hand in , Mr. Wopsle finished off with a most terrifically snarling passage from Richard the Third , and seemed to think he had done quite enough to account for it when he added , '' -- as the poet says . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 33]: And here I may remark that when Mr. Wopsle referred to me , he considered it a necessary part of such reference to rumple my hair and poke it into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 28]: I can not conceive why everybody of his standing who visited at our house should always have put me through the same inflammatory process under similar circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 38]: Yet I do not call to mind that I was ever in my earlier youth the subject of remark in our social family circle , but some large-handed person took some such ophthalmic steps to patronize me .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 36]: All this while , the strange man looked at nobody but me , and looked at me as if he were determined to have a shot at me at last , and bring me down .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 36]: But he said nothing after offering his Blue Blazes observation , until the glasses of rum and water were brought ; and then he made his shot , and a most extraordinary shot it was .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 20]: It was not a verbal remark , but a proceeding in dumb-show , and was pointedly addressed to me .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 21]: He stirred his rum and water pointedly at me , and he tasted his rum and water pointedly at me .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 24]: And he stirred it and he tasted it ; not with a spoon that was brought to him , but with a file .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 29]: He did this so that nobody but I saw the file ; and when he had done it he wiped the file and put it in a breast-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 25]: I knew it to be Joe 's file , and I knew that he knew my convict , the moment I saw the instrument .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 8]: I sat gazing at him , spell-bound .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: But he now reclined on his settle , taking very little notice of me , and talking principally about turnips .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 45]: There was a delicious sense of cleaning-up and making a quiet pause before going on in life afresh , in our village on Saturday nights , which stimulated Joe to dare to stay out half an hour longer on Saturdays than at other times .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 24]: The half-hour and the rum and water running out together , Joe got up to go , and took me by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 15]: `` Stop half a moment , Mr. Gargery , '' said the strange man .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 27]: `` I think I 've got a bright new shilling somewhere in my pocket , and if I have , the boy shall have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 24]: He looked it out from a handful of small change , folded it in some crumpled paper , and gave it to me .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 4]: `` Yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 3]: `` Mind !
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 4]: Your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 21]: I thanked him , staring at him far beyond the bounds of good manners , and holding tight to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 56]: He gave Joe good-night , and he gave Mr. Wopsle good-night -LRB- who went out with us -RRB- , and he gave me only a look with his aiming eye , -- no , not a look , for he shut it up , but wonders may be done with an eye by hiding it .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 64]: On the way home , if I had been in a humor for talking , the talk must have been all on my side , for Mr. Wopsle parted from us at the door of the Jolly Bargemen , and Joe went all the way home with his mouth wide open , to rinse the rum out with as much air as possible .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 26]: But I was in a manner stupefied by this turning up of my old misdeed and old acquaintance , and could think of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 33]: My sister was not in a very bad temper when we presented ourselves in the kitchen , and Joe was encouraged by that unusual circumstance to tell her about the bright shilling .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 28]: `` A bad un , I 'll be bound , '' said Mrs. Joe triumphantly , `` or he would n't have given it to the boy !
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: Let 's look at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 17]: I took it out of the paper , and it proved to be a good one .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 7]: `` But what 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 14]: said Mrs. Joe , throwing down the shilling and catching up the paper .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 8]: `` Two One -- Pound notes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 29]: Nothing less than two fat sweltering one-pound notes that seemed to have been on terms of the warmest intimacy with all the cattle -- markets in the county .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 22]: Joe caught up his hat again , and ran with them to the Jolly Bargemen to restore them to their owner .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 30]: While he was gone , I sat down on my usual stool and looked vacantly at my sister , feeling pretty sure that the man would not be there .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 31]: Presently , Joe came back , saying that the man was gone , but that he , Joe , had left word at the Three Jolly Bargemen concerning the notes .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 34]: Then my sister sealed them up in a piece of paper , and put them under some dried rose-leaves in an ornamental teapot on the top of a press in the state parlor .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 17]: There they remained , a nightmare to me , many and many a night and day .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 60]: I had sadly broken sleep when I got to bed , through thinking of the strange man taking aim at me with his invisible gun , and of the guiltily coarse and common thing it was , to be on secret terms of conspiracy with convicts , -- a feature in my low career that I had previously forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 8]: I was haunted by the file too .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 16]: A dread possessed me that when I least expected it , the file would reappear .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 43]: I coaxed myself to sleep by thinking of Miss Havisham 's , next Wednesday ; and in my sleep I saw the file coming at me out of a door , without seeing who held it , and I screamed myself awake .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 24]: Chapter XI At the appointed time I returned to Miss Havisham 's , and my hesitating ring at the gate brought out Estella .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 26]: She locked it after admitting me , as she had done before , and again preceded me into the dark passage where her candle stood .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 46]: She took no notice of me until she had the candle in her hand , when she looked over her shoulder , superciliously saying , `` You are to come this way to-day , '' and took me to quite another part of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 20]: The passage was a long one , and seemed to pervade the whole square basement of the Manor House .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 30]: We traversed but one side of the square , however , and at the end of it she stopped , and put her candle down and opened a door .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 47]: Here , the daylight reappeared , and I found myself in a small paved courtyard , the opposite side of which was formed by a detached dwelling-house , that looked as if it had once belonged to the manager or head clerk of the extinct brewery .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: There was a clock in the outer wall of this house .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 25]: Like the clock in Miss Havisham 's room , and like Miss Havisham 's watch , it had stopped at twenty minutes to nine .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 28]: We went in at the door , which stood open , and into a gloomy room with a low ceiling , on the ground-floor at the back .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 34]: There was some company in the room , and Estella said to me as she joined it , `` You are to go and stand there boy , till you are wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 30]: `` There '' , being the window , I crossed to it , and stood `` there , '' in a very uncomfortable state of mind , looking out .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 76]: It opened to the ground , and looked into a most miserable corner of the neglected garden , upon a rank ruin of cabbage-stalks , and one box-tree that had been clipped round long ago , like a pudding , and had a new growth at the top of it , out of shape and of a different color , as if that part of the pudding had stuck to the saucepan and got burnt .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 12]: This was my homely thought , as I contemplated the box-tree .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 60]: There had been some light snow , overnight , and it lay nowhere else to my knowledge ; but , it had not quite melted from the cold shadow of this bit of garden , and the wind caught it up in little eddies and threw it at the window , as if it pelted me for coming there .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 22]: I divined that my coming had stopped conversation in the room , and that its other occupants were looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 34]: I could see nothing of the room except the shining of the fire in the window-glass , but I stiffened in all my joints with the consciousness that I was under close inspection .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 11]: There were three ladies in the room and one gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 66]: Before I had been standing at the window five minutes , they somehow conveyed to me that they were all toadies and humbugs , but that each of them pretended not to know that the others were toadies and humbugs : because the admission that he or she did know it , would have made him or her out to be a toady and humbug .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 31]: They all had a listless and dreary air of waiting somebody 's pleasure , and the most talkative of the ladies had to speak quite rigidly to repress a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 43]: This lady , whose name was Camilla , very much reminded me of my sister , with the difference that she was older , and -LRB- as I found when I caught sight of her -RRB- of a blunter cast of features .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 35]: Indeed , when I knew her better I began to think it was a Mercy she had any features at all , so very blank and high was the dead wall of her face .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 6]: `` Poor dear soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 14]: said this lady , with an abruptness of manner quite my sister 's .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: `` Nobody 's enemy but his own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 25]: `` It would be much more commendable to be somebody else 's enemy , '' said the gentleman ; `` far more natural . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 18]: `` Cousin Raymond , '' observed another lady , `` we are to love our neighbor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 23]: `` Sarah Pocket , '' returned Cousin Raymond , `` if a man is not his own neighbor , who is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 20]: Miss Pocket laughed , and Camilla laughed and said -LRB- checking a yawn -RRB- , `` The idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 14]: But I thought they seemed to think it rather a good idea too .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: The other lady , who had not spoken yet , said gravely and emphatically , `` Very true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 5]: `` Poor soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 27]: Camilla presently went on -LRB- I knew they had all been looking at me in the mean time -RRB- , `` he is so very strange !
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 33]: Would anyone believe that when Tom 's wife died , he actually could not be induced to see the importance of the children 's having the deepest of trimmings to their mourning ?
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 5]: ` Good Lord ! '
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 23]: says he , ` Camilla , what can it signify so long as the poor bereaved little things are in black ? '
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 4]: So like Matthew !
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 4]: The idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 45]: `` Good points in him , good points in him , '' said Cousin Raymond ; `` Heaven forbid I should deny good points in him ; but he never had , and he never will have , any sense of the proprieties . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 20]: `` You know I was obliged , '' said Camilla , -- `` I was obliged to be firm .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 17]: I said , ` It WILL NOT DO , for the credit of the family . '
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 14]: I told him that , without deep trimmings , the family was disgraced .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 9]: I cried about it from breakfast till dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 5]: I injured my digestion .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 26]: And at last he flung out in his violent way , and said , with a D , ` Then do as you like . '
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 27]: Thank Goodness it will always be a consolation to me to know that I instantly went out in a pouring rain and bought the things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 11]: `` He paid for them , did he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 3]: asked Estella .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 20]: `` It 's not the question , my dear child , who paid for them , '' returned Camilla .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 5]: `` I bought them .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 19]: And I shall often think of that with peace , when I wake up in the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 42]: The ringing of a distant bell , combined with the echoing of some cry or call along the passage by which I had come , interrupted the conversation and caused Estella to say to me , `` Now , boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 34]: On my turning round , they all looked at me with the utmost contempt , and , as I went out , I heard Sarah Pocket say , `` Well I am sure !
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 4]: What next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 15]: and Camilla add , with indignation , `` Was there ever such a fancy !
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 4]: The i-de-a ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 43]: As we were going with our candle along the dark passage , Estella stopped all of a sudden , and , facing round , said in her taunting manner , with her face quite close to mine , -- `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 6]: `` Well , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 11]: I answered , almost falling over her and checking myself .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 17]: She stood looking at me , and , of course , I stood looking at her .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 6]: `` Am I pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 11]: `` Yes ; I think you are very pretty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 6]: `` Am I insulting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 21]: `` Not so much so as you were last time , '' said I. `` Not so much so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 26]: She fired when she asked the last question , and she slapped my face with such force as she had , when I answered it .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 4]: `` Now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 15]: `` You little coarse monster , what do you think of me now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 8]: `` I shall not tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 10]: `` Because you are going to tell up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: Is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 14]: `` No , '' said I , `` that 's not it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: `` Why do n't you cry again , you little wretch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 51]: `` Because I 'll never cry for you again , '' said I. Which was , I suppose , as false a declaration as ever was made ; for I was inwardly crying for her then , and I know what I know of the pain she cost me afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 28]: We went on our way up stairs after this episode ; and , as we were going up , we met a gentleman groping his way down .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 7]: `` Whom have we here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 10]: asked the gentleman , stopping and looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 8]: `` A boy , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 23]: He was a burly man of an exceedingly dark complexion , with an exceedingly large head , and a corresponding large hand .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 26]: He took my chin in his large hand and turned up my face to have a look at me by the light of the candle .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 26]: He was prematurely bald on the top of his head , and had bushy black eyebrows that would n't lie down but stood up bristling .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 17]: His eyes were set very deep in his head , and were disagreeably sharp and suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 24]: He had a large watch-chain , and strong black dots where his beard and whiskers would have been if he had let them .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 37]: He was nothing to me , and I could have had no foresight then , that he ever would be anything to me , but it happened that I had this opportunity of observing him well .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 6]: `` Boy of the neighborhood ?
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 3]: Hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 16]: `` Yes , sir , '' said I. `` How do you come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 13]: `` Miss Havisham sent for me , sir , '' I explained .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 3]: Behave yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 18]: I have a pretty large experience of boys , and you 're a bad set of fellows .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 4]: Now mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 22]: said he , biting the side of his great forefinger as he frowned at me , `` you behave yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 29]: With those words , he released me -- which I was glad of , for his hand smelt of scented soap -- and went his way down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 33]: I wondered whether he could be a doctor ; but no , I thought ; he could n't be a doctor , or he would have a quieter and more persuasive manner .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 33]: There was not much time to consider the subject , for we were soon in Miss Havisham 's room , where she and everything else were just as I had left them .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 24]: Estella left me standing near the door , and I stood there until Miss Havisham cast her eyes upon me from the dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 20]: she said , without being startled or surprised : `` the days have worn away , have they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 5]: `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 12]: To-day is -- '' `` There , there , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 8]: with the impatient movement of her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 8]: `` I do n't want to know .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: Are you ready to play ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 20]: I was obliged to answer in some confusion , `` I do n't think I am , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 7]: `` Not at cards again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 8]: she demanded , with a searching look .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 16]: `` Yes , ma'am ; I could do that , if I was wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 34]: `` Since this house strikes you old and grave , boy , '' said Miss Havisham , impatiently , `` and you are unwilling to play , are you willing to work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 29]: I could answer this inquiry with a better heart than I had been able to find for the other question , and I said I was quite willing .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 32]: `` Then go into that opposite room , '' said she , pointing at the door behind me with her withered hand , `` and wait there till I come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 13]: I crossed the staircase landing , and entered the room she indicated .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 22]: From that room , too , the daylight was completely excluded , and it had an airless smell that was oppressive .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 48]: A fire had been lately kindled in the damp old-fashioned grate , and it was more disposed to go out than to burn up , and the reluctant smoke which hung in the room seemed colder than the clearer air , -- like our own marsh mist .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 28]: Certain wintry branches of candles on the high chimney-piece faintly lighted the chamber ; or it would be more expressive to say , faintly troubled its darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 31]: It was spacious , and I dare say had once been handsome , but every discernible thing in it was covered with dust and mould , and dropping to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 33]: The most prominent object was a long table with a tablecloth spread on it , as if a feast had been in preparation when the house and the clocks all stopped together .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 88]: An epergne or centre-piece of some kind was in the middle of this cloth ; it was so heavily overhung with cobwebs that its form was quite undistinguishable ; and , as I looked along the yellow expanse out of which I remember its seeming to grow , like a black fungus , I saw speckle-legged spiders with blotchy bodies running home to it , and running out from it , as if some circumstances of the greatest public importance had just transpired in the spider community .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 22]: I heard the mice too , rattling behind the panels , as if the same occurrence were important to their interests .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 40]: But the black beetles took no notice of the agitation , and groped about the hearth in a ponderous elderly way , as if they were short-sighted and hard of hearing , and not on terms with one another .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 27]: These crawling things had fascinated my attention , and I was watching them from a distance , when Miss Havisham laid a hand upon my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 24]: In her other hand she had a crutch-headed stick on which she leaned , and she looked like the Witch of the place .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 28]: `` This , '' said she , pointing to the long table with her stick , `` is where I will be laid when I am dead .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 10]: They shall come and look at me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 36]: With some vague misgiving that she might get upon the table then and there and die at once , the complete realization of the ghastly waxwork at the Fair , I shrank under her touch .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 9]: `` What do you think that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: she asked me , again pointing with her stick ; `` that , where those cobwebs are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 12]: `` I ca n't guess what it is , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 7]: `` It 's a great cake .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 3]: A bride-cake .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 3]: Mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 32]: She looked all round the room in a glaring manner , and then said , leaning on me while her hand twitched my shoulder , `` Come , come , come !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 7]: Walk me , walk me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 25]: I made out from this , that the work I had to do , was to walk Miss Havisham round and round the room .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 43]: Accordingly , I started at once , and she leaned upon my shoulder , and we went away at a pace that might have been an imitation -LRB- founded on my first impulse under that roof -RRB- of Mr. Pumblechook 's chaise-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 17]: She was not physically strong , and after a little time said , `` Slower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 44]: Still , we went at an impatient fitful speed , and as we went , she twitched the hand upon my shoulder , and worked her mouth , and led me to believe that we were going fast because her thoughts went fast .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 11]: After a while she said , `` Call Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 20]: so I went out on the landing and roared that name as I had done on the previous occasion .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 22]: When her light appeared , I returned to Miss Havisham , and we started away again round and round the room .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 46]: If only Estella had come to be a spectator of our proceedings , I should have felt sufficiently discontented ; but as she brought with her the three ladies and the gentleman whom I had seen below , I did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 39]: In my politeness , I would have stopped ; but Miss Havisham twitched my shoulder , and we posted on , -- with a shame-faced consciousness on my part that they would think it was all my doing .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 11]: `` Dear Miss Havisham , '' said Miss Sarah Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 7]: `` How well you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 10]: `` I do not , '' returned Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: `` I am yellow skin and bone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 26]: Camilla brightened when Miss Pocket met with this rebuff ; and she murmured , as she plaintively contemplated Miss Havisham , `` Poor dear soul !
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 12]: Certainly not to be expected to look well , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 4]: The idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 7]: `` And how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 6]: said Miss Havisham to Camilla .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 25]: As we were close to Camilla then , I would have stopped as a matter of course , only Miss Havisham would n't stop .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 15]: We swept on , and I felt that I was highly obnoxious to Camilla .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 22]: `` Thank you , Miss Havisham , '' she returned , `` I am as well as can be expected . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 11]: `` Why , what 's the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 8]: asked Miss Havisham , with exceeding sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 9]: `` Nothing worth mentioning , '' replied Camilla .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 32]: `` I do n't wish to make a display of my feelings , but I have habitually thought of you more in the night than I am quite equal to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 13]: `` Then do n't think of me , '' retorted Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: `` Very easily said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 22]: remarked Camilla , amiably repressing a sob , while a hitch came into her upper lip , and her tears overflowed .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 19]: `` Raymond is a witness what ginger and sal volatile I am obliged to take in the night .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 13]: Raymond is a witness what nervous jerkings I have in my legs .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 22]: Chokings and nervous jerkings , however , are nothing new to me when I think with anxiety of those I love .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 22]: If I could be less affectionate and sensitive , I should have a better digestion and an iron set of nerves .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 10]: I am sure I wish it could be so .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 15]: But as to not thinking of you in the night -- The idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 7]: Here , a burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 22]: The Raymond referred to , I understood to be the gentleman present , and him I understood to be Mr. Camilla .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 51]: He came to the rescue at this point , and said in a consolatory and complimentary voice , `` Camilla , my dear , it is well known that your family feelings are gradually undermining you to the extent of making one of your legs shorter than the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 40]: `` I am not aware , '' observed the grave lady whose voice I had heard but once , `` that to think of any person is to make a great claim upon that person , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 58]: Miss Sarah Pocket , whom I now saw to be a little dry , brown , corrugated old woman , with a small face that might have been made of walnut-shells , and a large mouth like a cat 's without the whiskers , supported this position by saying , `` No , indeed , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 3]: Hem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 12]: `` Thinking is easy enough , '' said the grave lady .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 9]: `` What is easier , you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 5]: assented Miss Sarah Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 16]: cried Camilla , whose fermenting feelings appeared to rise from her legs to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 7]: `` It 's all very true !
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 16]: It 's a weakness to be so affectionate , but I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 24]: No doubt my health would be much better if it was otherwise , still I would n't change my disposition if I could .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 28]: It 's the cause of much suffering , but it 's a consolation to know I posses it , when I wake up in the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 6]: Here another burst of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 40]: Miss Havisham and I had never stopped all this time , but kept going round and round the room ; now brushing against the skirts of the visitors , now giving them the whole length of the dismal chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 6]: `` There 's Matthew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 3]: said Camilla .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 18]: `` Never mixing with any natural ties , never coming here to see how Miss Havisham is !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 58]: I have taken to the sofa with my staylace cut , and have lain there hours insensible , with my head over the side , and my hair all down , and my feet I do n't know where -- '' -LRB- `` Much higher than your head , my love , '' said Mr. Camilla . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 30]: `` I have gone off into that state , hours and hours , on account of Matthew 's strange and inexplicable conduct , and nobody has thanked me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 11]: `` Really I must say I should think not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 5]: interposed the grave lady .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 40]: `` You see , my dear , '' added Miss Sarah Pocket -LRB- a blandly vicious personage -RRB- , `` the question to put to yourself is , who did you expect to thank you , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 115]: `` Without expecting any thanks , or anything of the sort , '' resumed Camilla , `` I have remained in that state , hours and hours , and Raymond is a witness of the extent to which I have choked , and what the total inefficacy of ginger has been , and I have been heard at the piano-forte tuner 's across the street , where the poor mistaken children have even supposed it to be pigeons cooing at a distance , -- and now to be told -- '' Here Camilla put her hand to her throat , and began to be quite chemical as to the formation of new combinations there .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 21]: When this same Matthew was mentioned , Miss Havisham stopped me and herself , and stood looking at the speaker .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 16]: This change had a great influence in bringing Camilla 's chemistry to a sudden end .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 25]: `` Matthew will come and see me at last , '' said Miss Havisham , sternly , when I am laid on that table .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 22]: That will be his place , -- there , '' striking the table with her stick , `` at my head !
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 6]: And yours will be there !
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 6]: And your husband 's there !
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 6]: And Sarah Pocket 's there !
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 5]: And Georgiana 's there !
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 17]: Now you all know where to take your stations when you come to feast upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 5]: And now go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 20]: At the mention of each name , she had struck the table with her stick in a new place .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 12]: She now said , `` Walk me , walk me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 6]: and we went on again .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 20]: `` I suppose there 's nothing to be done , '' exclaimed Camilla , `` but comply and depart .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 21]: It 's something to have seen the object of one 's love and duty for even so short a time .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 17]: I shall think of it with a melancholy satisfaction when I wake up in the night .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 15]: I wish Matthew could have that comfort , but he sets it at defiance .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 45]: I am determined not to make a display of my feelings , but it 's very hard to be told one wants to feast on one 's relations , -- as if one was a Giant , -- and to be told to go .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 5]: The bare idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 53]: Mr. Camilla interposing , as Mrs. Camilla laid her hand upon her heaving bosom , that lady assumed an unnatural fortitude of manner which I supposed to be expressive of an intention to drop and choke when out of view , and kissing her hand to Miss Havisham , was escorted forth .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 36]: Sarah Pocket and Georgiana contended who should remain last ; but Sarah was too knowing to be outdone , and ambled round Georgiana with that artful slipperiness that the latter was obliged to take precedence .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: Sarah Pocket then made her separate effect of departing with , `` Bless you , Miss Havisham dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 18]: and with a smile of forgiving pity on her walnut-shell countenance for the weaknesses of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 25]: While Estella was away lighting them down , Miss Havisham still walked with her hand on my shoulder , but more and more slowly .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 30]: At last she stopped before the fire , and said , after muttering and looking at it some seconds , -- `` This is my birthday , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 16]: I was going to wish her many happy returns , when she lifted her stick .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 11]: `` I do n't suffer it to be spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 19]: I do n't suffer those who were here just now , or any one to speak of it .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 16]: They come here on the day , but they dare not refer to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 12]: Of course I made no further effort to refer to it .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 44]: `` On this day of the year , long before you were born , this heap of decay , '' stabbing with her crutched stick at the pile of cobwebs on the table , but not touching it , `` was brought here .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 8]: It and I have worn away together .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 20]: The mice have gnawed at it , and sharper teeth than teeth of mice have gnawed at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 50]: She held the head of her stick against her heart as she stood looking at the table ; she in her once white dress , all yellow and withered ; the once white cloth all yellow and withered ; everything around in a state to crumble under a touch .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 65]: `` When the ruin is complete , '' said she , with a ghastly look , `` and when they lay me dead , in my bride 's dress on the bride 's table , -- which shall be done , and which will be the finished curse upon him , -- so much the better if it is done on this day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 18]: She stood looking at the table as if she stood looking at her own figure lying there .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 4]: I remained quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 9]: Estella returned , and she too remained quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 13]: It seemed to me that we continued thus for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 35]: In the heavy air of the room , and the heavy darkness that brooded in its remoter corners , I even had an alarming fancy that Estella and I might presently begin to decay .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 38]: At length , not coming out of her distraught state by degrees , but in an instant , Miss Havisham said , `` Let me see you two play cards ; why have you not begun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 62]: With that , we returned to her room , and sat down as before ; I was beggared , as before ; and again , as before , Miss Havisham watched us all the time , directed my attention to Estella 's beauty , and made me notice it the more by trying her jewels on Estella 's breast and hair .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 21]: Estella , for her part , likewise treated me as before , except that she did not condescend to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 33]: When we had played some half-dozen games , a day was appointed for my return , and I was taken down into the yard to be fed in the former dog-like manner .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 15]: There , too , I was again left to wander about as I liked .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 37]: It is not much to the purpose whether a gate in that garden wall which I had scrambled up to peep over on the last occasion was , on that last occasion , open or shut .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 15]: Enough that I saw no gate then , and that I saw one now .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 42]: As it stood open , and as I knew that Estella had let the visitors out , -- for she had returned with the keys in her hand , -- I strolled into the garden , and strolled all over it .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 53]: It was quite a wilderness , and there were old melon-frames and cucumber-frames in it , which seemed in their decline to have produced a spontaneous growth of weak attempts at pieces of old hats and boots , with now and then a weedy offshoot into the likeness of a battered saucepan .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 38]: When I had exhausted the garden and a greenhouse with nothing in it but a fallen-down grape-vine and some bottles , I found myself in the dismal corner upon which I had looked out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 44]: Never questioning for a moment that the house was now empty , I looked in at another window , and found myself , to my great surprise , exchanging a broad stare with a pale young gentleman with red eyelids and light hair .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 12]: This pale young gentleman quickly disappeared , and reappeared beside me .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 24]: He had been at his books when I had found myself staring at him , and I now saw that he was inky .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 8]: said he , `` young fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 24]: Halloa being a general observation which I had usually observed to be best answered by itself , I said , `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 5]: politely omitting young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 7]: `` Who let you in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 5]: `` Miss Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: `` Who gave you leave to prowl about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 5]: `` Miss Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 12]: `` Come and fight , '' said the pale young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: What could I do but follow him ?
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 16]: I have often asked myself the question since ; but what else could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 28]: His manner was so final , and I was so astonished , that I followed where he led , as if I had been under a spell .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 20]: `` Stop a minute , though , '' he said , wheeling round before we had gone many paces .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 13]: `` I ought to give you a reason for fighting , too .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 5]: There it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 44]: In a most irritating manner he instantly slapped his hands against one another , daintily flung one of his legs up behind him , pulled my hair , slapped his hands again , dipped his head , and butted it into my stomach .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 30]: The bull-like proceeding last mentioned , besides that it was unquestionably to be regarded in the light of a liberty , was particularly disagreeable just after bread and meat .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 21]: I therefore hit out at him and was going to hit out again , when he said , `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 4]: Would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 16]: and began dancing backwards and forwards in a manner quite unparalleled within my limited experience .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 7]: `` Laws of the game ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 13]: Here , he skipped from his left leg on to his right .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 5]: `` Regular rules ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 13]: Here , he skipped from his right leg on to his left .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 13]: `` Come to the ground , and go through the preliminaries ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 21]: Here , he dodged backwards and forwards , and did all sorts of things while I looked helplessly at him .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 55]: I was secretly afraid of him when I saw him so dexterous ; but I felt morally and physically convinced that his light head of hair could have had no business in the pit of my stomach , and that I had a right to consider it irrelevant when so obtruded on my attention .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 30]: Therefore , I followed him without a word , to a retired nook of the garden , formed by the junction of two walls and screened by some rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 44]: On his asking me if I was satisfied with the ground , and on my replying Yes , he begged my leave to absent himself for a moment , and quickly returned with a bottle of water and a sponge dipped in vinegar .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 15]: `` Available for both , '' he said , placing these against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 31]: And then fell to pulling off , not only his jacket and waistcoat , but his shirt too , in a manner at once light-hearted , business-like , and bloodthirsty .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 31]: Although he did not look very healthy , -- having pimples on his face , and a breaking out at his mouth , -- these dreadful preparations quite appalled me .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 31]: I judged him to be about my own age , but he was much taller , and he had a way of spinning himself about that was full of appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 43]: For the rest , he was a young gentleman in a gray suit -LRB- when not denuded for battle -RRB- , with his elbows , knees , wrists , and heels considerably in advance of the rest of him as to development .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 31]: My heart failed me when I saw him squaring at me with every demonstration of mechanical nicety , and eyeing my anatomy as if he were minutely choosing his bone .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 43]: I never have been so surprised in my life , as I was when I let out the first blow , and saw him lying on his back , looking up at me with a bloody nose and his face exceedingly fore-shortened .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 23]: But , he was on his feet directly , and after sponging himself with a great show of dexterity began squaring again .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 29]: The second greatest surprise I have ever had in my life was seeing him on his back again , looking up at me out of a black eye .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 8]: His spirit inspired me with great respect .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 78]: He seemed to have no strength , and he never once hit me hard , and he was always knocked down ; but he would be up again in a moment , sponging himself or drinking out of the water-bottle , with the greatest satisfaction in seconding himself according to form , and then came at me with an air and a show that made me believe he really was going to do for me at last .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 52]: He got heavily bruised , for I am sorry to record that the more I hit him , the harder I hit him ; but he came up again and again and again , until at last he got a bad fall with the back of his head against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 56]: Even after that crisis in our affairs , he got up and turned round and round confusedly a few times , not knowing where I was ; but finally went on his knees to his sponge and threw it up : at the same time panting out , `` That means you have won . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 26]: He seemed so brave and innocent , that although I had not proposed the contest , I felt but a gloomy satisfaction in my victory .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 27]: Indeed , I go so far as to hope that I regarded myself while dressing as a species of savage young wolf or other wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 25]: However , I got dressed , darkly wiping my sanguinary face at intervals , and I said , `` Can I help you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 25]: and he said `` No thankee , '' and I said `` Good afternoon , '' and he said `` Same to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 15]: When I got into the courtyard , I found Estella waiting with the keys .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 37]: But she neither asked me where I had been , nor why I had kept her waiting ; and there was a bright flush upon her face , as though something had happened to delight her .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 21]: Instead of going straight to the gate , too , she stepped back into the passage , and beckoned me .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 4]: `` Come here !
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 10]: You may kiss me , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 11]: I kissed her cheek as she turned it to me .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 15]: I think I would have gone through a great deal to kiss her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 29]: But I felt that the kiss was given to the coarse common boy as a piece of money might have been , and that it was worth nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 64]: What with the birthday visitors , and what with the cards , and what with the fight , my stay had lasted so long , that when I neared home the light on the spit of sand off the point on the marshes was gleaming against a black night-sky , and Joe 's furnace was flinging a path of fire across the road .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 16]: Chapter XII My mind grew very uneasy on the subject of the pale young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 39]: The more I thought of the fight , and recalled the pale young gentleman on his back in various stages of puffy and incrimsoned countenance , the more certain it appeared that something would be done to me .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 22]: I felt that the pale young gentleman 's blood was on my head , and that the Law would avenge it .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 50]: Without having any definite idea of the penalties I had incurred , it was clear to me that village boys could not go stalking about the country , ravaging the houses of gentlefolks and pitching into the studious youth of England , without laying themselves open to severe punishment .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 42]: For some days , I even kept close at home , and looked out at the kitchen door with the greatest caution and trepidation before going on an errand , lest the officers of the County Jail should pounce upon me .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 28]: The pale young gentleman 's nose had stained my trousers , and I tried to wash out that evidence of my guilt in the dead of night .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 43]: I had cut my knuckles against the pale young gentleman 's teeth , and I twisted my imagination into a thousand tangles , as I devised incredible ways of accounting for that damnatory circumstance when I should be haled before the Judges .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 23]: When the day came round for my return to the scene of the deed of violence , my terrors reached their height .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 145]: Whether myrmidons of Justice , specially sent down from London , would be lying in ambush behind the gate ; -- whether Miss Havisham , preferring to take personal vengeance for an outrage done to her house , might rise in those grave-clothes of hers , draw a pistol , and shoot me dead : -- whether suborned boys -- a numerous band of mercenaries -- might be engaged to fall upon me in the brewery , and cuff me until I was no more ; -- it was high testimony to my confidence in the spirit of the pale young gentleman , that I never imagined him accessory to these retaliations ; they always came into my mind as the acts of injudicious relatives of his , goaded on by the state of his visage and an indignant sympathy with the family features .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 15]: However , go to Miss Havisham 's I must , and go I did .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 3]: And behold !
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 7]: nothing came of the late struggle .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 22]: It was not alluded to in any way , and no pale young gentleman was to be discovered on the premises .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 42]: I found the same gate open , and I explored the garden , and even looked in at the windows of the detached house ; but my view was suddenly stopped by the closed shutters within , and all was lifeless .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 22]: Only in the corner where the combat had taken place could I detect any evidence of the young gentleman 's existence .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 22]: There were traces of his gore in that spot , and I covered them with garden-mould from the eye of man .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 41]: On the broad landing between Miss Havisham 's own room and that other room in which the long table was laid out , I saw a garden-chair , -- a light chair on wheels , that you pushed from behind .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 59]: It had been placed there since my last visit , and I entered , that same day , on a regular occupation of pushing Miss Havisham in this chair -LRB- when she was tired of walking with her hand upon my shoulder -RRB- round her own room , and across the landing , and round the other room .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 27]: Over and over and over again , we would make these journeys , and sometimes they would last as long as three hours at a stretch .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 51]: I insensibly fall into a general mention of these journeys as numerous , because it was at once settled that I should return every alternate day at noon for these purposes , and because I am now going to sum up a period of at least eight or ten months .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 36]: As we began to be more used to one another , Miss Havisham talked more to me , and asked me such questions as what had I learnt and what was I going to be ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 42]: I told her I was going to be apprenticed to Joe , I believed ; and I enlarged upon my knowing nothing and wanting to know everything , in the hope that she might offer some help towards that desirable end .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 17]: But she did not ; on the contrary , she seemed to prefer my being ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 30]: Neither did she ever give me any money , -- or anything but my daily dinner , -- nor ever stipulate that I should be paid for my services .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 23]: Estella was always about , and always let me in and out , but never told me I might kiss her again .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 38]: Sometimes , she would coldly tolerate me ; sometimes , she would condescend to me ; sometimes , she would be quite familiar with me ; sometimes , she would tell me energetically that she hated me .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 27]: Miss Havisham would often ask me in a whisper , or when we were alone , `` Does she grow prettier and prettier , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 19]: And when I said yes -LRB- for indeed she did -RRB- , would seem to enjoy it greedily .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 26]: Also , when we played at cards Miss Havisham would look on , with a miserly relish of Estella 's moods , whatever they were .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 60]: And sometimes , when her moods were so many and so contradictory of one another that I was puzzled what to say or do , Miss Havisham would embrace her with lavish fondness , murmuring something in her ear that sounded like `` Break their hearts my pride and hope , break their hearts and have no mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 22]: There was a song Joe used to hum fragments of at the forge , of which the burden was Old Clem .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 27]: This was not a very ceremonious way of rendering homage to a patron saint , but I believe Old Clem stood in that relation towards smiths .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 29]: It was a song that imitated the measure of beating upon iron , and was a mere lyrical excuse for the introduction of Old Clem 's respected name .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 12]: Thus , you were to hammer boys round -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 10]: With a thump and a sound -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: Beat it out , beat it out -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 10]: With a clink for the stout -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 11]: Blow the fire , blow the fire -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 9]: Roaring dryer , soaring higher -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 32]: One day soon after the appearance of the chair , Miss Havisham suddenly saying to me , with the impatient movement of her fingers , `` There , there , there !
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 3]: Sing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 15]: I was surprised into crooning this ditty as I pushed her over the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 26]: It happened so to catch her fancy that she took it up in a low brooding voice as if she were singing in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 56]: After that , it became customary with us to have it as we moved about , and Estella would often join in ; though the whole strain was so subdued , even when there were three of us , that it made less noise in the grim old house than the lightest breath of wind .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 8]: What could I become with these surroundings ?
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 11]: How could my character fail to be influenced by them ?
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 31]: Is it to be wondered at if my thoughts were dazed , as my eyes were , when I came out into the natural light from the misty yellow rooms ?
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 29]: Perhaps I might have told Joe about the pale young gentleman , if I had not previously been betrayed into those enormous inventions to which I had confessed .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 39]: Under the circumstances , I felt that Joe could hardly fail to discern in the pale young gentleman , an appropriate passenger to be put into the black velvet coach ; therefore , I said nothing of him .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 30]: Besides , that shrinking from having Miss Havisham and Estella discussed , which had come upon me in the beginning , grew much more potent as time went on .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 17]: I reposed complete confidence in no one but Biddy ; but I told poor Biddy everything .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 36]: Why it came natural to me to do so , and why Biddy had a deep concern in everything I told her , I did not know then , though I think I know now .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 21]: Meanwhile , councils went on in the kitchen at home , fraught with almost insupportable aggravation to my exasperated spirit .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 63]: That ass , Pumblechook , used often to come over of a night for the purpose of discussing my prospects with my sister ; and I really do believe -LRB- to this hour with less penitence than I ought to feel -RRB- , that if these hands could have taken a linchpin out of his chaise-cart , they would have done it .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 90]: The miserable man was a man of that confined stolidity of mind , that he could not discuss my prospects without having me before him , -- as it were , to operate upon , -- and he would drag me up from my stool -LRB- usually by the collar -RRB- where I was quiet in a corner , and , putting me before the fire as if I were going to be cooked , would begin by saying , `` Now , Mum , here is this boy !
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 11]: Here is this boy which you brought up by hand .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 18]: Hold up your head , boy , and be forever grateful unto them which so did do .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 11]: Now , Mum , with respections to this boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 59]: And then he would rumple my hair the wrong way , -- which from my earliest remembrance , as already hinted , I have in my soul denied the right of any fellow-creature to do , -- and would hold me before him by the sleeve , -- a spectacle of imbecility only to be equalled by himself .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 54]: Then , he and my sister would pair off in such nonsensical speculations about Miss Havisham , and about what she would do with me and for me , that I used to want -- quite painfully -- to burst into spiteful tears , fly at Pumblechook , and pummel him all over .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 57]: In these dialogues , my sister spoke to me as if she were morally wrenching one of my teeth out at every reference ; while Pumblechook himself , self-constituted my patron , would sit supervising me with a depreciatory eye , like the architect of my fortunes who thought himself engaged on a very unremunerative job .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 9]: In these discussions , Joe bore no part .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 33]: But he was often talked at , while they were in progress , by reason of Mrs. Joe 's perceiving that he was not favorable to my being taken from the forge .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 70]: I was fully old enough now to be apprenticed to Joe ; and when Joe sat with the poker on his knees thoughtfully raking out the ashes between the lower bars , my sister would so distinctly construe that innocent action into opposition on his part , that she would dive at him , take the poker out of his hands , shake him , and put it away .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 13]: There was a most irritating end to every one of these debates .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 41]: All in a moment , with nothing to lead up to it , my sister would stop herself in a yawn , and catching sight of me as it were incidentally , would swoop upon me with , `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 6]: there 's enough of you !
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 19]: You get along to bed ; you 've given trouble enough for one night , I hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 15]: As if I had besought them as a favor to bother my life out .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 66]: We went on in this way for a long time , and it seemed likely that we should continue to go on in this way for a long time , when one day Miss Havisham stopped short as she and I were walking , she leaning on my shoulder ; and said with some displeasure , -- `` You are growing tall , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 29]: I thought it best to hint , through the medium of a meditative look , that this might be occasioned by circumstances over which I had no control .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 31]: She said no more at the time ; but she presently stopped and looked at me again ; and presently again ; and after that , looked frowning and moody .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 49]: On the next day of my attendance , when our usual exercise was over , and I had landed her at her dressing-table , she stayed me with a movement of her impatient fingers : -- `` Tell me the name again of that blacksmith of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 7]: `` Joe Gargery , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 12]: `` Meaning the master you were to be apprenticed to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 7]: `` Yes , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 9]: `` You had better be apprenticed at once .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 17]: Would Gargery come here with you , and bring your indentures , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 18]: I signified that I had no doubt he would take it as an honor to be asked .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 7]: `` Then let him come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 10]: `` At any particular time , Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 5]: `` There , there !
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 6]: I know nothing about times .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 12]: Let him come soon , and come along with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 34]: When I got home at night , and delivered this message for Joe , my sister `` went on the Rampage , '' in a more alarming degree than at any previous period .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 35]: She asked me and Joe whether we supposed she was door-mats under our feet , and how we dared to use her so , and what company we graciously thought she was fit for ?
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 53]: When she had exhausted a torrent of such inquiries , she threw a candlestick at Joe , burst into a loud sobbing , got out the dustpan , -- which was always a very bad sign , -- put on her coarse apron , and began cleaning up to a terrible extent .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 33]: Not satisfied with a dry cleaning , she took to a pail and scrubbing-brush , and cleaned us out of house and home , so that we stood shivering in the back-yard .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 30]: It was ten o'clock at night before we ventured to creep in again , and then she asked Joe why he had n't married a Negress Slave at once ?
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 32]: Joe offered no answer , poor fellow , but stood feeling his whisker and looking dejectedly at me , as if he thought it really might have been a better speculation .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 34]: Chapter XIII It was a trial to my feelings , on the next day but one , to see Joe arraying himself in his Sunday clothes to accompany me to Miss Havisham 's .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 81]: However , as he thought his court-suit necessary to the occasion , it was not for me tell him that he looked far better in his working-dress ; the rather , because I knew he made himself so dreadfully uncomfortable , entirely on my account , and that it was for me he pulled up his shirt-collar so very high behind , that it made the hair on the crown of his head stand up like a tuft of feathers .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 52]: At breakfast-time my sister declared her intention of going to town with us , and being left at Uncle Pumblechook 's and called for `` when we had done with our fine ladies '' -- a way of putting the case , from which Joe appeared inclined to augur the worst .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 59]: The forge was shut up for the day , and Joe inscribed in chalk upon the door -LRB- as it was his custom to do on the very rare occasions when he was not at work -RRB- the monosyllable HOUT , accompanied by a sketch of an arrow supposed to be flying in the direction he had taken .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 52]: We walked to town , my sister leading the way in a very large beaver bonnet , and carrying a basket like the Great Seal of England in plaited Straw , a pair of pattens , a spare shawl , and an umbrella , though it was a fine bright day .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 48]: I am not quite clear whether these articles were carried penitentially or ostentatiously ; but I rather think they were displayed as articles of property , -- much as Cleopatra or any other sovereign lady on the Rampage might exhibit her wealth in a pageant or procession .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 15]: When we came to Pumblechook 's , my sister bounced in and left us .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 18]: As it was almost noon , Joe and I held straight on to Miss Havisham 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 52]: Estella opened the gate as usual , and , the moment she appeared , Joe took his hat off and stood weighing it by the brim in both his hands ; as if he had some urgent reason in his mind for being particular to half a quarter of an ounce .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 20]: Estella took no notice of either of us , but led us the way that I knew so well .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 11]: I followed next to her , and Joe came last .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 37]: When I looked back at Joe in the long passage , he was still weighing his hat with the greatest care , and was coming after us in long strides on the tips of his toes .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 26]: Estella told me we were both to go in , so I took Joe by the coat-cuff and conducted him into Miss Havisham 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 14]: She was seated at her dressing-table , and looked round at us immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 5]: said she to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 13]: `` You are the husband of the sister of this boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 43]: I could hardly have imagined dear old Joe looking so unlike himself or so like some extraordinary bird ; standing as he did speechless , with his tuft of feathers ruffled , and his mouth open as if he wanted a worm .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 20]: `` You are the husband , '' repeated Miss Havisham , `` of the sister of this boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 21]: It was very aggravating ; but , throughout the interview , Joe persisted in addressing Me instead of Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 61]: `` Which I meantersay , Pip , '' Joe now observed in a manner that was at once expressive of forcible argumentation , strict confidence , and great politeness , `` as I hup and married your sister , and I were at the time what you might call -LRB- if you was anyways inclined -RRB- a single man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 4]: said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 26]: `` And you have reared the boy , with the intention of taking him for your apprentice ; is that so , Mr. Gargery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 40]: `` You know , Pip , '' replied Joe , `` as you and me were ever friends , and it were looked for ` ard to betwixt us , as being calc ` lated to lead to larks .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 47]: Not but what , Pip , if you had ever made objections to the business , -- such as its being open to black and sut , or such-like , -- not but what they would have been attended to , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 16]: `` Has the boy , '' said Miss Havisham , `` ever made any objection ?
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 7]: Does he like the trade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 39]: `` Which it is well beknown to yourself , Pip , '' returned Joe , strengthening his former mixture of argumentation , confidence , and politeness , `` that it were the wish of your own hart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 49]: -LRB- I saw the idea suddenly break upon him that he would adapt his epitaph to the occasion , before he went on to say -RRB- `` And there were n't no objection on your part , and Pip it were the great wish of your hart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 22]: It was quite in vain for me to endeavor to make him sensible that he ought to speak to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 29]: The more I made faces and gestures to him to do it , the more confidential , argumentative , and polite , he persisted in being to Me .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 10]: `` Have you brought his indentures with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 4]: asked Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 42]: `` Well , Pip , you know , '' replied Joe , as if that were a little unreasonable , `` you yourself see me put 'em in my ` at , and therefore you know as they are here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 20]: With which he took them out , and gave them , not to Miss Havisham , but to me .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 44]: I am afraid I was ashamed of the dear good fellow , -- I know I was ashamed of him , -- when I saw that Estella stood at the back of Miss Havisham 's chair , and that her eyes laughed mischievously .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 15]: I took the indentures out of his hand and gave them to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 23]: `` You expected , '' said Miss Havisham , as she looked them over , `` no premium with the boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 4]: `` Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 11]: I remonstrated , for he made no reply at all .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 53]: `` Why do n't you answer -- '' `` Pip , '' returned Joe , cutting me short as if he were hurt , `` which I meantersay that were not a question requiring a answer betwixt yourself and me , and which you know the answer to be full well No .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 17]: You know it to be No , Pip , and wherefore should I say it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 38]: Miss Havisham glanced at him as if she understood what he really was better than I had thought possible , seeing what he was there ; and took up a little bag from the table beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 18]: `` Pip has earned a premium here , '' she said , `` and here it is .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 8]: There are five-and-twenty guineas in this bag .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 9]: Give it to your master , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 36]: As if he were absolutely out of his mind with the wonder awakened in him by her strange figure and the strange room , Joe , even at this pass , persisted in addressing me .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 38]: `` This is wery liberal on your part , Pip , '' said Joe , `` and it is as such received and grateful welcome , though never looked for , far nor near , nor nowheres .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 52]: And now , old chap , '' said Joe , conveying to me a sensation , first of burning and then of freezing , for I felt as if that familiar expression were applied to Miss Havisham , -- `` and now , old chap , may we do our duty !
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 72]: May you and me do our duty , both on us , by one and another , and by them which your liberal present -- have-conweyed -- to be -- for the satisfaction of mind-of -- them as never -- '' here Joe showed that he felt he had fallen into frightful difficulties , until he triumphantly rescued himself with the words , `` and from myself far be it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 17]: These words had such a round and convincing sound for him that he said them twice .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 7]: `` Good by , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 4]: said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 8]: `` Let them out , Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 11]: `` Am I to come again , Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 6]: Gargery is your master now .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 2]: Gargery !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 4]: One word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 40]: Thus calling him back as I went out of the door , I heard her say to Joe in a distinct emphatic voice , `` The boy has been a good boy here , and that is his reward .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 18]: Of course , as an honest man , you will expect no other and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 53]: How Joe got out of the room , I have never been able to determine ; but I know that when he did get out he was steadily proceeding up stairs instead of coming down , and was deaf to all remonstrances until I went after him and laid hold of him .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 19]: In another minute we were outside the gate , and it was locked , and Estella was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 25]: When we stood in the daylight alone again , Joe backed up against a wall , and said to me , `` Astonishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 29]: And there he remained so long saying , `` Astonishing '' at intervals , so often , that I began to think his senses were never coming back .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 21]: At length he prolonged his remark into `` Pip , I do assure you this is as -- TON-ishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 14]: and so , by degrees , became conversational and able to walk away .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 35]: I have reason to think that Joe 's intellects were brightened by the encounter they had passed through , and that on our way to Pumblechook 's he invented a subtle and deep design .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 33]: My reason is to be found in what took place in Mr. Pumblechook 's parlor : where , on our presenting ourselves , my sister sat in conference with that detested seedsman .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 10]: cried my sister , addressing us both at once .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 8]: `` And what 's happened to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 21]: I wonder you condescend to come back to such poor society as this , I am sure I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 43]: `` Miss Havisham , '' said Joe , with a fixed look at me , like an effort of remembrance , `` made it wery partick ` ler that we should give her -- were it compliments or respects , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 7]: `` Compliments , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 30]: `` Which that were my own belief , '' answered Joe ; `` her compliments to Mrs. J. Gargery -- '' `` Much good they 'll do me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 9]: observed my sister ; but rather gratified too .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 44]: `` And wishing , '' pursued Joe , with another fixed look at me , like another effort of remembrance , `` that the state of Miss Havisham 's elth were sitch as would have -- allowed , were it , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 11]: `` Of her having the pleasure , '' I added .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 10]: `` Of ladies ' company , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 6]: And drew a long breath .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 12]: cried my sister , with a mollified glance at Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 22]: `` She might have had the politeness to send that message at first , but it 's better late than never .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 10]: And what did she give young Rantipole here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 14]: `` She giv ' him , '' said Joe , `` nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 13]: Mrs. Joe was going to break out , but Joe went on .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 18]: `` What she giv ' , '' said Joe , `` she giv ' to his friends .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 25]: ` And by his friends , ' were her explanation , ` I mean into the hands of his sister Mrs. J. Gargery . '
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 11]: Them were her words ; ` Mrs. J. Gargery . '
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 27]: She may n't have know 'd , '' added Joe , with an appearance of reflection , `` whether it were Joe , or Jorge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 34]: My sister looked at Pumblechook : who smoothed the elbows of his wooden arm-chair , and nodded at her and at the fire , as if he had known all about it beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: `` And how much have you got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 6]: asked my sister , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 3]: Positively laughing !
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 11]: `` What would present company say to ten pound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 3]: demanded Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 16]: `` They 'd say , '' returned my sister , curtly , `` pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 9]: Not too much , but pretty well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 13]: `` It 's more than that , then , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 31]: That fearful Impostor , Pumblechook , immediately nodded , and said , as he rubbed the arms of his chair , `` It 's more than that , Mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 15]: `` Why , you do n't mean to say -- '' began my sister .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 17]: `` Yes I do , Mum , '' said Pumblechook ; `` but wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 5]: Go on , Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 4]: Good in you !
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 17]: `` What would present company say , '' proceeded Joe , `` to twenty pound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 12]: `` Handsome would be the word , '' returned my sister .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 18]: `` Well , then , '' said Joe , `` It 's more than twenty pound . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 26]: That abject hypocrite , Pumblechook , nodded again , and said , with a patronizing laugh , `` It 's more than that , Mum .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 3]: Good again !
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 7]: Follow her up , Joseph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 28]: `` Then to make an end of it , '' said Joe , delightedly handing the bag to my sister ; `` it 's five-and-twenty pound . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 54]: `` It 's five-and-twenty pound , Mum , '' echoed that basest of swindlers , Pumblechook , rising to shake hands with her ; `` and it 's no more than your merits -LRB- as I said when my opinion was asked -RRB- , and I wish you joy of the money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 42]: If the villain had stopped here , his case would have been sufficiently awful , but he blackened his guilt by proceeding to take me into custody , with a right of patronage that left all his former criminality far behind .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 41]: `` Now you see , Joseph and wife , '' said Pumblechook , as he took me by the arm above the elbow , `` I am one of them that always go right through with what they 've begun .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 10]: This boy must be bound , out of hand .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 5]: That 's my way .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 6]: Bound out of hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 26]: `` Goodness knows , Uncle Pumblechook , '' said my sister -LRB- grasping the money -RRB- , `` we 're deeply beholden to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 12]: `` Never mind me , Mum , returned that diabolical cornchandler .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 11]: `` A pleasure 's a pleasure all the world over .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: But this boy , you know ; we must have him bound .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 15]: I said I 'd see to it -- to tell you the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 30]: The Justices were sitting in the Town Hall near at hand , and we at once went over to have me bound apprentice to Joe in the Magisterial presence .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 70]: I say we went over , but I was pushed over by Pumblechook , exactly as if I had that moment picked a pocket or fired a rick ; indeed , it was the general impression in Court that I had been taken red-handed ; for , as Pumblechook shoved me before him through the crowd , I heard some people say , `` What 's he done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 21]: and others , `` He 's a young ` un , too , but looks bad , do n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 39]: One person of mild and benevolent aspect even gave me a tract ornamented with a woodcut of a malevolent young man fitted up with a perfect sausage-shop of fetters , and entitled TO BE READ IN MY CELL .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 92]: The Hall was a queer place , I thought , with higher pews in it than a church , -- and with people hanging over the pews looking on , -- and with mighty Justices -LRB- one with a powdered head -RRB- leaning back in chairs , with folded arms , or taking snuff , or going to sleep , or writing , or reading the newspapers , -- and with some shining black portraits on the walls , which my unartistic eye regarded as a composition of hardbake and sticking-plaster .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 48]: Here , in a corner my indentures were duly signed and attested , and I was `` bound '' ; Mr. Pumblechook holding me all the while as if we had looked in on our way to the scaffold , to have those little preliminaries disposed of .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 53]: When we had come out again , and had got rid of the boys who had been put into great spirits by the expectation of seeing me publicly tortured , and who were much disappointed to find that my friends were merely rallying round me , we went back to Pumblechook 's .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 50]: And there my sister became so excited by the twenty-five guineas , that nothing would serve her but we must have a dinner out of that windfall at the Blue Boar , and that Pumblechook must go over in his chaise-cart , and bring the Hubbles and Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 15]: It was agreed to be done ; and a most melancholy day I passed .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 27]: For , it inscrutably appeared to stand to reason , in the minds of the whole company , that I was an excrescence on the entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 35]: And to make it worse , they all asked me from time to time , -- in short , whenever they had nothing else to do , -- why I did n't enjoy myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 21]: And what could I possibly do then , but say I was enjoying myself , -- when I was n't !
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 20]: However , they were grown up and had their own way , and they made the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 97]: That swindling Pumblechook , exalted into the beneficent contriver of the whole occasion , actually took the top of the table ; and , when he addressed them on the subject of my being bound , and had fiendishly congratulated them on my being liable to imprisonment if I played at cards , drank strong liquors , kept late hours or bad company , or indulged in other vagaries which the form of my indentures appeared to contemplate as next to inevitable , he placed me standing on a chair beside him to illustrate his remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 38]: My only other remembrances of the great festival are , That they would n't let me go to sleep , but whenever they saw me dropping off , woke me up and told me to enjoy myself .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 55]: That , rather late in the evening Mr. Wopsle gave us Collins 's ode , and threw his bloodstained sword in thunder down , with such effect , that a waiter came in and said , `` The Commercials underneath sent up their compliments , and it was n't the Tumblers ' Arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 20]: That , they were all in excellent spirits on the road home , and sang , O Lady Fair !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 66]: Mr. Wopsle taking the bass , and asserting with a tremendously strong voice -LRB- in reply to the inquisitive bore who leads that piece of music in a most impertinent manner , by wanting to know all about everybody 's private affairs -RRB- that he was the man with his white locks flowing , and that he was upon the whole the weakest pilgrim going .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 34]: Finally , I remember that when I got into my little bedroom , I was truly wretched , and had a strong conviction on me that I should never like Joe 's trade .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 12]: I had liked it once , but once was not now .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 14]: Chapter XIV It is a most miserable thing to feel ashamed of home .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 31]: There may be black ingratitude in the thing , and the punishment may be retributive and well deserved ; but that it is a miserable thing , I can testify .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 18]: Home had never been a very pleasant place to me , because of my sister 's temper .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 14]: But , Joe had sanctified it , and I had believed in it .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 71]: I had believed in the best parlor as a most elegant saloon ; I had believed in the front door , as a mysterious portal of the Temple of State whose solemn opening was attended with a sacrifice of roast fowls ; I had believed in the kitchen as a chaste though not magnificent apartment ; I had believed in the forge as the glowing road to manhood and independence .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 9]: Within a single year all this was changed .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 24]: Now it was all coarse and common , and I would not have had Miss Havisham and Estella see it on any account .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 39]: How much of my ungracious condition of mind may have been my own fault , how much Miss Havisham 's , how much my sister 's , is now of no moment to me or to any one .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 12]: The change was made in me ; the thing was done .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 13]: Well or ill done , excusably or inexcusably , it was done .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 35]: Once , it had seemed to me that when I should at last roll up my shirt-sleeves and go into the forge , Joe 's ` prentice , I should be distinguished and happy .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 39]: Now the reality was in my hold , I only felt that I was dusty with the dust of small-coal , and that I had a weight upon my daily remembrance to which the anvil was a feather .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 49]: There have been occasions in my later life -LRB- I suppose as in most lives -RRB- when I have felt for a time as if a thick curtain had fallen on all its interest and romance , to shut me out from anything save dull endurance any more .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 32]: Never has that curtain dropped so heavy and blank , as when my way in life lay stretched out straight before me through the newly entered road of apprenticeship to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 72]: I remember that at a later period of my `` time , '' I used to stand about the churchyard on Sunday evenings when night was falling , comparing my own perspective with the windy marsh view , and making out some likeness between them by thinking how flat and low both were , and how on both there came an unknown way and a dark mist and then the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 36]: I was quite as dejected on the first working-day of my apprenticeship as in that after-time ; but I am glad to know that I never breathed a murmur to Joe while my indentures lasted .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 17]: It is about the only thing I am glad to know of myself in that connection .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 24]: For , though it includes what I proceed to add , all the merit of what I proceed to add was Joe 's .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 28]: It was not because I was faithful , but because Joe was faithful , that I never ran away and went for a soldier or a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 38]: It was not because I had a strong sense of the virtue of industry , but because Joe had a strong sense of the virtue of industry , that I worked with tolerable zeal against the grain .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 68]: It is not possible to know how far the influence of any amiable honest-hearted duty-doing man flies out into the world ; but it is very possible to know how it has touched one 's self in going by , and I know right well that any good that intermixed itself with my apprenticeship came of plain contented Joe , and not of restlessly aspiring discontented me .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 8]: What I wanted , who can say ?
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 10]: How can I say , when I never knew ?
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 39]: What I dreaded was , that in some unlucky hour I , being at my grimiest and commonest , should lift up my eyes and see Estella looking in at one of the wooden windows of the forge .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 42]: I was haunted by the fear that she would , sooner or later , find me out , with a black face and hands , doing the coarsest part of my work , and would exult over me and despise me .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 108]: Often after dark , when I was pulling the bellows for Joe , and we were singing Old Clem , and when the thought how we used to sing it at Miss Havisham 's would seem to show me Estella 's face in the fire , with her pretty hair fluttering in the wind and her eyes scorning me , -- often at such a time I would look towards those panels of black night in the wall which the wooden windows then were , and would fancy that I saw her just drawing her face away , and would believe that she had come at last .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 41]: After that , when we went in to supper , the place and the meal would have a more homely look than ever , and I would feel more ashamed of home than ever , in my own ungracious breast .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 24]: Chapter XV As I was getting too big for Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt 's room , my education under that preposterous female terminated .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 33]: Not , however , until Biddy had imparted to me everything she knew , from the little catalogue of prices , to a comic song she had once bought for a half-penny .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 40]: Although the only coherent part of the latter piece of literature were the opening lines , When I went to Lunnon town sirs , Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul Was n't I done very brown sirs ?
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 61]: Too rul loo rul Too rul loo rul -- still , in my desire to be wiser , I got this composition by heart with the utmost gravity ; nor do I recollect that I questioned its merit , except that I thought -LRB- as I still do -RRB- the amount of Too rul somewhat in excess of the poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 26]: In my hunger for information , I made proposals to Mr. Wopsle to bestow some intellectual crumbs upon me , with which he kindly complied .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 62]: As it turned out , however , that he only wanted me for a dramatic lay-figure , to be contradicted and embraced and wept over and bullied and clutched and stabbed and knocked about in a variety of ways , I soon declined that course of instruction ; though not until Mr. Wopsle in his poetic fury had severely mauled me .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 11]: Whatever I acquired , I tried to impart to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 18]: This statement sounds so well , that I can not in my conscience let it pass unexplained .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 26]: I wanted to make Joe less ignorant and common , that he might be worthier of my society and less open to Estella 's reproach .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 38]: The old Battery out on the marshes was our place of study , and a broken slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our educational implements : to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 27]: I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another , or to acquire , under my tuition , any piece of information whatever .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 37]: Yet he would smoke his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else , -- even with a learned air , -- as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 8]: Dear fellow , I hope he did .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 48]: It was pleasant and quiet , out there with the sails on the river passing beyond the earthwork , and sometimes , when the tide was low , looking as if they belonged to sunken ships that were still sailing on at the bottom of the water .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 51]: Whenever I watched the vessels standing out to sea with their white sails spread , I somehow thought of Miss Havisham and Estella ; and whenever the light struck aslant , afar off , upon a cloud or sail or green hillside or water-line , it was just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 25]: -- Miss Havisham and Estella and the strange house and the strange life appeared to have something to do with everything that was picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 86]: One Sunday when Joe , greatly enjoying his pipe , had so plumed himself on being `` most awful dull , '' that I had given him up for the day , I lay on the earthwork for some time with my chin on my hand , descrying traces of Miss Havisham and Estella all over the prospect , in the sky and in the water , until at last I resolved to mention a thought concerning them that had been much in my head .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 22]: `` Joe , '' said I ; `` do n't you think I ought to make Miss Havisham a visit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 12]: `` Well , Pip , '' returned Joe , slowly considering .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 6]: `` What for , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 8]: What is any visit made for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 27]: `` There is some wisits p ` r ` aps , '' said Joe , `` as for ever remains open to the question , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 8]: But in regard to wisiting Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 14]: She might think you wanted something , -- expected something of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 16]: `` Do n't you think I might say that I did not , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 11]: `` You might , old chap , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 7]: `` And she might credit it .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: Similarly she might n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 31]: Joe felt , as I did , that he had made a point there , and he pulled hard at his pipe to keep himself from weakening it by repetition .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 29]: `` You see , Pip , '' Joe pursued , as soon as he was past that danger , `` Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 24]: When Miss Havisham done the handsome thing by you , she called me back to say to me as that were all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 5]: `` Yes , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 5]: I heard her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 10]: `` ALL , '' Joe repeated , very emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 5]: `` Yes , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 9]: I tell you , I heard her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 22]: `` Which I meantersay , Pip , it might be that her meaning were , -- Make a end on it !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 5]: -- As you was !
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 12]: -- Me to the North , and you to the South !
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 6]: -- Keep in sunders ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 34]: I had thought of that too , and it was very far from comforting to me to find that he had thought of it ; for it seemed to render it more probable .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 6]: `` But , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 7]: `` Yes , old chap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 45]: `` Here am I , getting on in the first year of my time , and , since the day of my being bound , I have never thanked Miss Havisham , or asked after her , or shown that I remember her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 73]: `` That 's true , Pip ; and unless you was to turn her out a set of shoes all four round , -- and which I meantersay as even a set of shoes all four round might not be acceptable as a present , in a total wacancy of hoofs -- '' `` I do n't mean that sort of remembrance , Joe ; I do n't mean a present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 18]: But Joe had got the idea of a present in his head and must harp upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 86]: `` Or even , '' said he , `` if you was helped to knocking her up a new chain for the front door , -- or say a gross or two of shark-headed screws for general use , -- or some light fancy article , such as a toasting-fork when she took her muffins , -- or a gridiron when she took a sprat or such like -- '' `` I do n't mean any present at all , Joe , '' I interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 31]: `` Well , '' said Joe , still harping on it as though I had particularly pressed it , `` if I was yourself , Pip , I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 6]: No , I would not .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 13]: For what 's a door-chain when she 's got one always up ?
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 7]: And shark-headers is open to misrepresentations .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 18]: And if it was a toasting-fork , you 'd go into brass and do yourself no credit .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 106]: And the oncommonest workman ca n't show himself oncommon in a gridiron , -- for a gridiron IS a gridiron , '' said Joe , steadfastly impressing it upon me , as if he were endeavouring to rouse me from a fixed delusion , `` and you may haim at what you like , but a gridiron it will come out , either by your leave or again your leave , and you ca n't help yourself -- '' `` My dear Joe , '' I cried , in desperation , taking hold of his coat , `` do n't go on in that way .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 11]: I never thought of making Miss Havisham any present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 37]: `` No , Pip , '' Joe assented , as if he had been contending for that , all along ; `` and what I say to you is , you are right , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 49]: `` Yes , Joe ; but what I wanted to say , was , that as we are rather slack just now , if you would give me a half-holiday to-morrow , I think I would go up-town and make a call on Miss Est -- Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 27]: `` Which her name , '' said Joe , gravely , `` ai n't Estavisham , Pip , unless she have been rechris ` ened . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 9]: `` I know , Joe , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 7]: It was a slip of mine .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 10]: What do you think of it , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 19]: In brief , Joe thought that if I thought well of it , he thought well of it .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 54]: But , he was particular in stipulating that if I were not received with cordiality , or if I were not encouraged to repeat my visit as a visit which had no ulterior object but was simply one of gratitude for a favor received , then this experimental trip should have no successor .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 8]: By these conditions I promised to abide .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 14]: Now , Joe kept a journeyman at weekly wages whose name was Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 57]: He pretended that his Christian name was Dolge , -- a clear Impossibility , -- but he was a fellow of that obstinate disposition that I believe him to have been the prey of no delusion in this particular , but wilfully to have imposed that name upon the village as an affront to its understanding .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 20]: He was a broadshouldered loose-limbed swarthy fellow of great strength , never in a hurry , and always slouching .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 71]: He never even seemed to come to his work on purpose , but would slouch in as if by mere accident ; and when he went to the Jolly Bargemen to eat his dinner , or went away at night , he would slouch out , like Cain or the Wandering Jew , as if he had no idea where he was going and no intention of ever coming back .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 44]: He lodged at a sluice-keeper 's out on the marshes , and on working-days would come slouching from his hermitage , with his hands in his pockets and his dinner loosely tied in a bundle round his neck and dangling on his back .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 18]: On Sundays he mostly lay all day on the sluice-gates , or stood against ricks and barns .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 60]: He always slouched , locomotively , with his eyes on the ground ; and , when accosted or otherwise required to raise them , he looked up in a half-resentful , half-puzzled way , as though the only thought he ever had was , that it was rather an odd and injurious fact that he should never be thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 9]: This morose journeyman had no liking for me .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 63]: When I was very small and timid , he gave me to understand that the Devil lived in a black corner of the forge , and that he knew the fiend very well : also that it was necessary to make up the fire , once in seven years , with a live boy , and that I might consider myself fuel .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 29]: When I became Joe 's ` prentice , Orlick was perhaps confirmed in some suspicion that I should displace him ; howbeit , he liked me still less .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 43]: Not that he ever said anything , or did anything , openly importing hostility ; I only noticed that he always beat his sparks in my direction , and that whenever I sang Old Clem , he came in out of time .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 19]: Dolge Orlick was at work and present , next day , when I reminded Joe of my half-holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 47]: He said nothing at the moment , for he and Joe had just got a piece of hot iron between them , and I was at the bellows ; but by and by he said , leaning on his hammer , -- `` Now , master !
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 13]: Sure you 're not a going to favor only one of us .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 15]: If Young Pip has a half-holiday , do as much for Old Orlick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 18]: I suppose he was about five-and-twenty , but he usually spoke of himself as an ancient person .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 17]: `` Why , what 'll you do with a half-holiday , if you get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 8]: `` What 'll I do with it !
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 7]: What 'll he do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 14]: I 'll do as much with it as him , '' said Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 15]: `` As to Pip , he 's going up town , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 21]: `` Well then , as to Old Orlick , he 's a going up town , '' retorted that worthy .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 7]: `` Two can go up town .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 10]: Tai n't only one wot can go up town .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 11]: `` Do n't lose your temper , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 10]: `` Shall if I like , '' growled Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 6]: `` Some and their up-towning !
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 4]: Now , master !
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 2]: Come .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 6]: No favoring in this shop .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 5]: Be a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 110]: The master refusing to entertain the subject until the journeyman was in a better temper , Orlick plunged at the furnace , drew out a red-hot bar , made at me with it as if he were going to run it through my body , whisked it round my head , laid it on the anvil , hammered it out , -- as if it were I , I thought , and the sparks were my spirting blood , -- and finally said , when he had hammered himself hot and the iron cold , and he again leaned on his hammer , -- `` Now , master ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 8]: `` Are you all right now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 3]: demanded Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 11]: I am all right , '' said gruff Old Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 31]: `` Then , as in general you stick to your work as well as most men , '' said Joe , `` let it be a half-holiday for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 35]: My sister had been standing silent in the yard , within hearing , -- she was a most unscrupulous spy and listener , -- and she instantly looked in at one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 8]: `` Like you , you fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 15]: said she to Joe , `` giving holidays to great idle hulkers like that .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 17]: You are a rich man , upon my life , to waste wages in that way .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 8]: I wish I was his master ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 21]: `` You 'd be everybody 's master , if you durst , '' retorted Orlick , with an ill-favored grin .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 11]: -LRB- `` Let her alone , '' said Joe . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 27]: `` I 'd be a match for all noodles and all rogues , '' returned my sister , beginning to work herself into a mighty rage .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 29]: `` And I could n't be a match for the noodles , without being a match for your master , who 's the dunder-headed king of the noodles .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 31]: And I could n't be a match for the rogues , without being a match for you , who are the blackest-looking and the worst rogue between this and France .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 14]: `` You 're a foul shrew , Mother Gargery , growled the journeyman .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 19]: `` If that makes a judge of rogues , you ought to be a good ` un . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 10]: -LRB- `` Let her alone , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 4]: said Joe . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 8]: cried my sister , beginning to scream .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: `` What did you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 11]: What did that fellow Orlick say to me , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 12]: What did he call me , with my husband standing by ?
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 88]: Each of these exclamations was a shriek ; and I must remark of my sister , what is equally true of all the violent women I have ever seen , that passion was no excuse for her , because it is undeniable that instead of lapsing into passion , she consciously and deliberately took extraordinary pains to force herself into it , and became blindly furious by regular stages ; `` what was the name he gave me before the base man who swore to defend me ?
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 3]: Hold me !
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 4]: `` Ah-h-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 20]: growled the journeyman , between his teeth , `` I 'd hold you , if you was my wife .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 16]: I 'd hold you under the pump , and choke it out of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 15]: -LRB- `` I tell you , let her alone , '' said Joe . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 5]: To hear him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 22]: cried my sister , with a clap of her hands and a scream together , -- which was her next stage .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 10]: `` To hear the names he 's giving me !
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 3]: That Orlick !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 5]: In my own house !
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 6]: Me , a married woman !
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 6]: With my husband standing by !
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 47]: Here my sister , after a fit of clappings and screamings , beat her hands upon her bosom and upon her knees , and threw her cap off , and pulled her hair down , -- which were the last stages on her road to frenzy .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 25]: Being by this time a perfect Fury and a complete success , she made a dash at the door which I had fortunately locked .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 46]: What could the wretched Joe do now , after his disregarded parenthetical interruptions , but stand up to his journeyman , and ask him what he meant by interfering betwixt himself and Mrs. Joe ; and further whether he was man enough to come on ?
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 45]: Old Orlick felt that the situation admitted of nothing less than coming on , and was on his defence straightway ; so , without so much as pulling off their singed and burnt aprons , they went at one another , like two giants .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 20]: But , if any man in that neighborhood could stand uplong against Joe , I never saw the man .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 34]: Orlick , as if he had been of no more account than the pale young gentleman , was very soon among the coal-dust , and in no hurry to come out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 64]: Then Joe unlocked the door and picked up my sister , who had dropped insensible at the window -LRB- but who had seen the fight first , I think -RRB- , and who was carried into the house and laid down , and who was recommended to revive , and would do nothing but struggle and clench her hands in Joe 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 52]: Then , came that singular calm and silence which succeed all uproars ; and then , with the vague sensation which I have always connected with such a lull , -- namely , that it was Sunday , and somebody was dead , -- I went up stairs to dress myself .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 37]: When I came down again , I found Joe and Orlick sweeping up , without any other traces of discomposure than a slit in one of Orlick 's nostrils , which was neither expressive nor ornamental .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 23]: A pot of beer had appeared from the Jolly Bargemen , and they were sharing it by turns in a peaceable manner .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 51]: The lull had a sedative and philosophical influence on Joe , who followed me out into the road to say , as a parting observation that might do me good , `` On the Rampage , Pip , and off the Rampage , Pip : -- such is Life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 37]: With what absurd emotions -LRB- for we think the feelings that are very serious in a man quite comical in a boy -RRB- I found myself again going to Miss Havisham 's , matters little here .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 21]: Nor , how I passed and repassed the gate many times before I could make up my mind to ring .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 34]: Nor , how I debated whether I should go away without ringing ; nor , how I should undoubtedly have gone , if my time had been my own , to come back .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 8]: Miss Sarah Pocket came to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 3]: No Estella .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 5]: `` How , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 5]: You here again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 4]: said Miss Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 28]: When I said that I only came to see how Miss Havisham was , Sarah evidently deliberated whether or no she should send me about my business .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 27]: But unwilling to hazard the responsibility , she let me in , and presently brought the sharp message that I was to `` come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 10]: Everything was unchanged , and Miss Havisham was alone .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 9]: said she , fixing her eyes upon me .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 7]: `` I hope you want nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 6]: You 'll get nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 7]: `` No indeed , Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 25]: I only wanted you to know that I am doing very well in my apprenticeship , and am always much obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 6]: `` There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 6]: with the old restless fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 11]: `` Come now and then ; come on your birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 4]: -- Ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 20]: she cried suddenly , turning herself and her chair towards me , `` You are looking round for Estella ?
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 3]: Hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 24]: I had been looking round , -- in fact , for Estella , -- and I stammered that I hoped she was well .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 30]: `` Abroad , '' said Miss Havisham ; `` educating for a lady ; far out of reach ; prettier than ever ; admired by all who see her .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 10]: Do you feel that you have lost her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 33]: There was such a malignant enjoyment in her utterance of the last words , and she broke into such a disagreeable laugh , that I was at a loss what to say .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 12]: She spared me the trouble of considering , by dismissing me .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 41]: When the gate was closed upon me by Sarah of the walnut-shell countenance , I felt more than ever dissatisfied with my home and with my trade and with everything ; and that was all I took by that motion .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 40]: As I was loitering along the High Street , looking in disconsolately at the shop windows , and thinking what I would buy if I were a gentleman , who should come out of the bookshop but Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 46]: Mr. Wopsle had in his hand the affecting tragedy of George Barnwell , in which he had that moment invested sixpence , with the view of heaping every word of it on the head of Pumblechook , with whom he was going to drink tea .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 47]: No sooner did he see me , than he appeared to consider that a special Providence had put a ` prentice in his way to be read at ; and he laid hold of me , and insisted on my accompanying him to the Pumblechookian parlor .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 58]: As I knew it would be miserable at home , and as the nights were dark and the way was dreary , and almost any companionship on the road was better than none , I made no great resistance ; consequently , we turned into Pumblechook 's just as the street and the shops were lighting up .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 74]: As I never assisted at any other representation of George Barnwell , I do n't know how long it may usually take ; but I know very well that it took until half-past nine o ' clock that night , and that when Mr. Wopsle got into Newgate , I thought he never would go to the scaffold , he became so much slower than at any former period of his disgraceful career .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 41]: I thought it a little too much that he should complain of being cut short in his flower after all , as if he had not been running to seed , leaf after leaf , ever since his course began .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 13]: This , however , was a mere question of length and wearisomeness .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 16]: What stung me , was the identification of the whole affair with my unoffending self .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 25]: When Barnwell began to go wrong , I declare that I felt positively apologetic , Pumblechook 's indignant stare so taxed me with it .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 14]: Wopsle , too , took pains to present me in the worst light .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 76]: At once ferocious and maudlin , I was made to murder my uncle with no extenuating circumstances whatever ; Millwood put me down in argument , on every occasion ; it became sheer monomania in my master 's daughter to care a button for me ; and all I can say for my gasping and procrastinating conduct on the fatal morning , is , that it was worthy of the general feebleness of my character .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 37]: Even after I was happily hanged and Wopsle had closed the book , Pumblechook sat staring at me , and shaking his head , and saying , `` Take warning , boy , take warning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 30]: as if it were a well-known fact that I contemplated murdering a near relation , provided I could only induce one to have the weakness to become my benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 25]: It was a very dark night when it was all over , and when I set out with Mr. Wopsle on the walk home .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 17]: Beyond town , we found a heavy mist out , and it fell wet and thick .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 27]: The turnpike lamp was a blur , quite out of the lamp 's usual place apparently , and its rays looked solid substance on the fog .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 41]: We were noticing this , and saying how that the mist rose with a change of wind from a certain quarter of our marshes , when we came upon a man , slouching under the lee of the turnpike house .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 5]: we said , stopping .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 5]: `` Orlick there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 6]: he answered , slouching out .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: `` I was standing by a minute , on the chance of company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 9]: `` You are late , '' I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 8]: Orlick not unnaturally answered , `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 6]: And you 're late . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 32]: `` We have been , '' said Mr. Wopsle , exalted with his late performance , -- `` we have been indulging , Mr. Orlick , in an intellectual evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 21]: Old Orlick growled , as if he had nothing to say about that , and we all went on together .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 16]: I asked him presently whether he had been spending his half-holiday up and down town ?
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said he , `` all of it .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 6]: I come in behind yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 16]: I did n't see you , but I must have been pretty close behind you .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 11]: By the by , the guns is going again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 6]: `` At the Hulks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: said I. `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 11]: There 's some of the birds flown from the cages .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 10]: The guns have been going since dark , about .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 7]: You 'll hear one presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 46]: In effect , we had not walked many yards further , when the well-remembered boom came towards us , deadened by the mist , and heavily rolled away along the low grounds by the river , as if it were pursuing and threatening the fugitives .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 13]: `` A good night for cutting off in , '' said Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 18]: `` We 'd be puzzled how to bring down a jail-bird on the wing , to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 17]: The subject was a suggestive one to me , and I thought about it in silence .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 23]: Mr. Wopsle , as the ill-requited uncle of the evening 's tragedy , fell to meditating aloud in his garden at Camberwell .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 15]: Orlick , with his hands in his pockets , slouched heavily at my side .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 17]: It was very dark , very wet , very muddy , and so we splashed along .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 26]: Now and then , the sound of the signal cannon broke upon us again , and again rolled sulkily along the course of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 9]: I kept myself to myself and my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 22]: Mr. Wopsle died amiably at Camberwell , and exceedingly game on Bosworth Field , and in the greatest agonies at Glastonbury .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 17]: Orlick sometimes growled , `` Beat it out , beat it out , -- Old Clem !
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 12]: With a clink for the stout , -- Old Clem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 13]: I thought he had been drinking , but he was not drunk .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 8]: Thus , we came to the village .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 54]: The way by which we approached it took us past the Three Jolly Bargemen , which we were surprised to find -- it being eleven o'clock -- in a state of commotion , with the door wide open , and unwonted lights that had been hastily caught up and put down scattered about .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 29]: Mr. Wopsle dropped in to ask what was the matter -LRB- surmising that a convict had been taken -RRB- , but came running out in a great hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 21]: `` There 's something wrong , '' said he , without stopping , `` up at your place , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 4]: Run all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 8]: I asked , keeping up with him .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 8]: So did Orlick , at my side .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 7]: `` I ca n't quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 14]: The house seems to have been violently entered when Joe Gargery was out .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 4]: Supposed by convicts .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 8]: Somebody has been attacked and hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 24]: We were running too fast to admit of more being said , and we made no stop until we got into our kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 47]: It was full of people ; the whole village was there , or in the yard ; and there was a surgeon , and there was Joe , and there were a group of women , all on the floor in the midst of the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 78]: The unemployed bystanders drew back when they saw me , and so I became aware of my sister , -- lying without sense or movement on the bare boards where she had been knocked down by a tremendous blow on the back of the head , dealt by some unknown hand when her face was turned towards the fire , -- destined never to be on the Rampage again , while she was the wife of Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 63]: Chapter XVI With my head full of George Barnwell , I was at first disposed to believe that I must have had some hand in the attack upon my sister , or at all events that as her near relation , popularly known to be under obligations to her , I was a more legitimate object of suspicion than any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 41]: But when , in the clearer light of next morning , I began to reconsider the matter and to hear it discussed around me on all sides , I took another view of the case , which was more reasonable .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 25]: Joe had been at the Three Jolly Bargemen , smoking his pipe , from a quarter after eight o'clock to a quarter before ten .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 27]: While he was there , my sister had been seen standing at the kitchen door , and had exchanged Good Night with a farm-laborer going home .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 38]: The man could not be more particular as to the time at which he saw her -LRB- he got into dense confusion when he tried to be -RRB- , than that it must have been before nine .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 25]: When Joe went home at five minutes before ten , he found her struck down on the floor , and promptly called in assistance .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 29]: The fire had not then burnt unusually low , nor was the snuff of the candle very long ; the candle , however , had been blown out .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 12]: Nothing had been taken away from any part of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 59]: Neither , beyond the blowing out of the candle , -- which stood on a table between the door and my sister , and was behind her when she stood facing the fire and was struck , -- was there any disarrangement of the kitchen , excepting such as she herself had made , in falling and bleeding .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 13]: But , there was one remarkable piece of evidence on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 41]: She had been struck with something blunt and heavy , on the head and spine ; after the blows were dealt , something heavy had been thrown down at her with considerable violence , as she lay on her face .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 24]: And on the ground beside her , when Joe picked her up , was a convict 's leg-iron which had been filed asunder .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 24]: Now , Joe , examining this iron with a smith 's eye , declared it to have been filed asunder some time ago .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 25]: The hue and cry going off to the Hulks , and people coming thence to examine the iron , Joe 's opinion was corroborated .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 47]: They did not undertake to say when it had left the prison-ships to which it undoubtedly had once belonged ; but they claimed to know for certain that that particular manacle had not been worn by either of the two convicts who had escaped last night .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 19]: Further , one of those two was already retaken , and had not freed himself of his iron .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 15]: Knowing what I knew , I set up an inference of my own here .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 44]: I believed the iron to be my convict 's iron , -- the iron I had seen and heard him filing at , on the marshes , -- but my mind did not accuse him of having put it to its latest use .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 25]: For I believed one of two other persons to have become possessed of it , and to have turned it to this cruel account .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 14]: Either Orlick , or the strange man who had shown me the file .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 56]: Now , as to Orlick ; he had gone to town exactly as he told us when we picked him up at the turnpike , he had been seen about town all the evening , he had been in divers companies in several public-houses , and he had come back with myself and Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 29]: There was nothing against him , save the quarrel ; and my sister had quarrelled with him , and with everybody else about her , ten thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 34]: As to the strange man ; if he had come back for his two bank-notes there could have been no dispute about them , because my sister was fully prepared to restore them .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 29]: Besides , there had been no altercation ; the assailant had come in so silently and suddenly , that she had been felled before she could look round .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 22]: It was horrible to think that I had provided the weapon , however undesignedly , but I could hardly think otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 27]: I suffered unspeakable trouble while I considered and reconsidered whether I should at last dissolve that spell of my childhood and tell Joe all the story .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 23]: For months afterwards , I every day settled the question finally in the negative , and reopened and reargued it next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 40]: The contention came , after all , to this ; -- the secret was such an old one now , had so grown into me and become a part of myself , that I could not tear it away .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 61]: In addition to the dread that , having led up to so much mischief , it would be now more likely than ever to alienate Joe from me if he believed it , I had a further restraining dread that he would not believe it , but would assort it with the fabulous dogs and veal-cutlets as a monstrous invention .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 28]: However , I temporized with myself , of course -- for , was I not wavering between right and wrong , when the thing is always done ?
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 29]: -- and resolved to make a full disclosure if I should see any such new occasion as a new chance of helping in the discovery of the assailant .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 52]: The Constables and the Bow Street men from London -- for , this happened in the days of the extinct red-waistcoated police -- were about the house for a week or two , and did pretty much what I have heard and read of like authorities doing in other such cases .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 41]: They took up several obviously wrong people , and they ran their heads very hard against wrong ideas , and persisted in trying to fit the circumstances to the ideas , instead of trying to extract ideas from the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 46]: Also , they stood about the door of the Jolly Bargemen , with knowing and reserved looks that filled the whole neighborhood with admiration ; and they had a mysterious manner of taking their drink , that was almost as good as taking the culprit .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 10]: But not quite , for they never did it .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 16]: Long after these constitutional powers had dispersed , my sister lay very ill in bed .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 40]: Her sight was disturbed , so that she saw objects multiplied , and grasped at visionary teacups and wineglasses instead of the realities ; her hearing was greatly impaired ; her memory also ; and her speech was unintelligible .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 43]: When , at last , she came round so far as to be helped down stairs , it was still necessary to keep my slate always by her , that she might indicate in writing what she could not indicate in speech .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 39]: As she was -LRB- very bad handwriting apart -RRB- a more than indifferent speller , and as Joe was a more than indifferent reader , extraordinary complications arose between them which I was always called in to solve .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 30]: The administration of mutton instead of medicine , the substitution of Tea for Joe , and the baker for bacon , were among the mildest of my own mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 13]: However , her temper was greatly improved , and she was patient .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 58]: A tremulous uncertainty of the action of all her limbs soon became a part of her regular state , and afterwards , at intervals of two or three months , she would often put her hands to her head , and would then remain for about a week at a time in some gloomy aberration of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 22]: We were at a loss to find a suitable attendant for her , until a circumstance happened conveniently to relieve us .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 25]: Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt conquered a confirmed habit of living into which she had fallen , and Biddy became a part of our establishment .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 42]: It may have been about a month after my sister 's reappearance in the kitchen , when Biddy came to us with a small speckled box containing the whole of her worldly effects , and became a blessing to the household .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 76]: Above all , she was a blessing to Joe , for the dear old fellow was sadly cut up by the constant contemplation of the wreck of his wife , and had been accustomed , while attending on her of an evening , to turn to me every now and then and say , with his blue eyes moistened , `` Such a fine figure of a woman as she once were , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 51]: Biddy instantly taking the cleverest charge of her as though she had studied her from infancy ; Joe became able in some sort to appreciate the greater quiet of his life , and to get down to the Jolly Bargemen now and then for a change that did him good .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 47]: It was characteristic of the police people that they had all more or less suspected poor Joe -LRB- though he never knew it -RRB- , and that they had to a man concurred in regarding him as one of the deepest spirits they had ever encountered .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 20]: Biddy 's first triumph in her new office , was to solve a difficulty that had completely vanquished me .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 14]: I had tried hard at it , but had made nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 46]: Thus it was : -- Again and again and again , my sister had traced upon the slate , a character that looked like a curious T , and then with the utmost eagerness had called our attention to it as something she particularly wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 20]: I had in vain tried everything producible that began with a T , from tar to toast and tub .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 44]: At length it had come into my head that the sign looked like a hammer , and on my lustily calling that word in my sister 's ear , she had begun to hammer on the table and had expressed a qualified assent .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 18]: Thereupon , I had brought in all our hammers , one after another , but without avail .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 33]: Then I bethought me of a crutch , the shape being much the same , and I borrowed one in the village , and displayed it to my sister with considerable confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 31]: But she shook her head to that extent when she was shown it , that we were terrified lest in her weak and shattered state she should dislocate her neck .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 21]: When my sister found that Biddy was very quick to understand her , this mysterious sign reappeared on the slate .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 46]: Biddy looked thoughtfully at it , heard my explanation , looked thoughtfully at my sister , looked thoughtfully at Joe -LRB- who was always represented on the slate by his initial letter -RRB- , and ran into the forge , followed by Joe and me .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 7]: `` Why , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 8]: cried Biddy , with an exultant face .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 6]: `` Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 5]: It 's him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: Orlick , without a doubt !
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 15]: She had lost his name , and could only signify him by his hammer .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 56]: We told him why we wanted him to come into the kitchen , and he slowly laid down his hammer , wiped his brow with his arm , took another wipe at it with his apron , and came slouching out , with a curious loose vagabond bend in the knees that strongly distinguished him .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 22]: I confess that I expected to see my sister denounce him , and that I was disappointed by the different result .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 36]: She manifested the greatest anxiety to be on good terms with him , was evidently much pleased by his being at length produced , and motioned that she would have him given something to drink .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 59]: She watched his countenance as if she were particularly wishful to be assured that he took kindly to his reception , she showed every possible desire to conciliate him , and there was an air of humble propitiation in all she did , such as I have seen pervade the bearing of a child towards a hard master .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 44]: After that day , a day rarely passed without her drawing the hammer on her slate , and without Orlick 's slouching in and standing doggedly before her , as if he knew no more than I did what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 46]: Chapter XVII I now fell into a regular routine of apprenticeship life , which was varied beyond the limits of the village and the marshes , by no more remarkable circumstance than the arrival of my birthday and my paying another visit to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 42]: I found Miss Sarah Pocket still on duty at the gate ; I found Miss Havisham just as I had left her , and she spoke of Estella in the very same way , if not in the very same words .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 30]: The interview lasted but a few minutes , and she gave me a guinea when I was going , and told me to come again on my next birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 12]: I may mention at once that this became an annual custom .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 31]: I tried to decline taking the guinea on the first occasion , but with no better effect than causing her to ask me very angrily , if I expected more ?
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 10]: Then , and after that , I took it .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 61]: So unchanging was the dull old house , the yellow light in the darkened room , the faded spectre in the chair by the dressing-table glass , that I felt as if the stopping of the clocks had stopped Time in that mysterious place , and , while I and everything else outside it grew older , it stood still .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 23]: Daylight never entered the house as to my thoughts and remembrances of it , any more than as to the actual fact .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 23]: It bewildered me , and under its influence I continued at heart to hate my trade and to be ashamed of home .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 12]: Imperceptibly I became conscious of a change in Biddy , however .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 21]: Her shoes came up at the heel , her hair grew bright and neat , her hands were always clean .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 27]: She was not beautiful , -- she was common , and could not be like Estella , -- but she was pleasant and wholesome and sweet-tempered .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 52]: She had not been with us more than a year -LRB- I remember her being newly out of mourning at the time it struck me -RRB- , when I observed to myself one evening that she had curiously thoughtful and attentive eyes ; eyes that were very pretty and very good .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 48]: It came of my lifting up my own eyes from a task I was poring at -- writing some passages from a book , to improve myself in two ways at once by a sort of stratagem -- and seeing Biddy observant of what I was about .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 17]: I laid down my pen , and Biddy stopped in her needlework without laying it down .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 14]: `` Biddy , '' said I , `` how do you manage it ?
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 13]: Either I am very stupid , or you are very clever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 8]: `` What is it that I manage ?
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: I do n't know , '' returned Biddy , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 28]: She managed our whole domestic life , and wonderfully too ; but I did not mean that , though that made what I did mean more surprising .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 29]: `` How do you manage , Biddy , '' said I , `` to learn everything that I learn , and always to keep up with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 53]: I was beginning to be rather vain of my knowledge , for I spent my birthday guineas on it , and set aside the greater part of my pocket-money for similar investment ; though I have no doubt , now , that the little I knew was extremely dear at the price .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 18]: `` I might as well ask you , '' said Biddy , `` how you manage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 25]: `` No ; because when I come in from the forge of a night , any one can see me turning to at it .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 11]: But you never turn to at it , Biddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 24]: `` I suppose I must catch it like a cough , '' said Biddy , quietly ; and went on with her sewing .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 35]: Pursuing my idea as I leaned back in my wooden chair , and looked at Biddy sewing away with her head on one side , I began to think her rather an extraordinary girl .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 34]: For I called to mind now , that she was equally accomplished in the terms of our trade , and the names of our different sorts of work , and our various tools .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 10]: In short , whatever I knew , Biddy knew .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: Theoretically , she was already as good a blacksmith as I , or better .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 22]: `` You are one of those , Biddy , '' said I , `` who make the most of every chance .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 18]: You never had a chance before you came here , and see how improved you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 15]: Biddy looked at me for an instant , and went on with her sewing .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 13]: `` I was your first teacher though ; was n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 7]: said she , as she sewed .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 4]: `` Biddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 6]: I exclaimed , in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 8]: `` Why , you are crying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 15]: `` No I am not , '' said Biddy , looking up and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 9]: `` What put that in your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 21]: What could have put it in my head but the glistening of a tear as it dropped on her work ?
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 36]: I sat silent , recalling what a drudge she had been until Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt successfully overcame that bad habit of living , so highly desirable to be got rid of by some people .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 38]: I recalled the hopeless circumstances by which she had been surrounded in the miserable little shop and the miserable little noisy evening school , with that miserable old bundle of incompetence always to be dragged and shouldered .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 42]: I reflected that even in those untoward times there must have been latent in Biddy what was now developing , for , in my first uneasiness and discontent I had turned to her for help , as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 37]: Biddy sat quietly sewing , shedding no more tears , and while I looked at her and thought about it all , it occurred to me that perhaps I had not been sufficiently grateful to Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 30]: I might have been too reserved , and should have patronized her more -LRB- though I did not use that precise word in my meditations -RRB- with my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 45]: `` Yes , Biddy , '' I observed , when I had done turning it over , `` you were my first teacher , and that at a time when we little thought of ever being together like this , in this kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 7]: `` Ah , poor thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 3]: replied Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 35]: It was like her self-forgetfulness to transfer the remark to my sister , and to get up and be busy about her , making her more comfortable ; `` that 's sadly true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 18]: said I , `` we must talk together a little more , as we used to do .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 15]: And I must consult you a little more , as I used to do .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 20]: Let us have a quiet walk on the marshes next Sunday , Biddy , and a long chat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 31]: My sister was never left alone now ; but Joe more than readily undertook the care of her on that Sunday afternoon , and Biddy and I went out together .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 8]: It was summer-time , and lovely weather .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 50]: When we had passed the village and the church and the churchyard , and were out on the marshes and began to see the sails of the ships as they sailed on , I began to combine Miss Havisham and Estella with the prospect , in my usual way .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 55]: When we came to the river-side and sat down on the bank , with the water rippling at our feet , making it all more quiet than it would have been without that sound , I resolved that it was a good time and place for the admission of Biddy into my inner confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 22]: `` Biddy , '' said I , after binding her to secrecy , `` I want to be a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 13]: `` O , I would n't , if I was you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 10]: `` I do n't think it would answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 24]: `` Biddy , '' said I , with some severity , `` I have particular reasons for wanting to be a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 20]: `` You know best , Pip ; but do n't you think you are happier as you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 20]: `` Biddy , '' I exclaimed , impatiently , `` I am not at all happy as I am .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 11]: I am disgusted with my calling and with my life .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 12]: I have never taken to either , since I was bound .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 6]: Do n't be absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 6]: `` Was I absurd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 22]: said Biddy , quietly raising her eyebrows ; `` I am sorry for that ; I did n't mean to be .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 14]: I only want you to do well , and to be comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 27]: `` Well , then , understand once for all that I never shall or can be comfortable -- or anything but miserable -- there , Biddy !
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 19]: -- unless I can lead a very different sort of life from the life I lead now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 7]: `` That 's a pity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 11]: said Biddy , shaking her head with a sorrowful air .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 51]: Now , I too had so often thought it a pity , that , in the singular kind of quarrel with myself which I was always carrying on , I was half inclined to shed tears of vexation and distress when Biddy gave utterance to her sentiment and my own .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 26]: I told her she was right , and I knew it was much to be regretted , but still it was not to be helped .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 81]: `` If I could have settled down , '' I said to Biddy , plucking up the short grass within reach , much as I had once upon a time pulled my feelings out of my hair and kicked them into the brewery wall , -- `` if I could have settled down and been but half as fond of the forge as I was when I was little , I know it would have been much better for me .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 59]: You and I and Joe would have wanted nothing then , and Joe and I would perhaps have gone partners when I was out of my time , and I might even have grown up to keep company with you , and we might have sat on this very bank on a fine Sunday , quite different people .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 16]: I should have been good enough for you ; should n't I , Biddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 25]: Biddy sighed as she looked at the ships sailing on , and returned for answer , `` Yes ; I am not over-particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 12]: It scarcely sounded flattering , but I knew she meant well .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 28]: `` Instead of that , '' said I , plucking up more grass and chewing a blade or two , `` see how I am going on .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 27]: Dissatisfied , and uncomfortable , and -- what would it signify to me , being coarse and common , if nobody had told me so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 24]: Biddy turned her face suddenly towards mine , and looked far more attentively at me than she had looked at the sailing ships .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 27]: `` It was neither a very true nor a very polite thing to say , '' she remarked , directing her eyes to the ships again .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 6]: `` Who said it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 18]: I was disconcerted , for I had broken away without quite seeing where I was going to .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 53]: It was not to be shuffled off now , however , and I answered , `` The beautiful young lady at Miss Havisham 's , and she 's more beautiful than anybody ever was , and I admire her dreadfully , and I want to be a gentleman on her account . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 27]: Having made this lunatic confession , I began to throw my torn-up grass into the river , as if I had some thoughts of following it .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 19]: `` Do you want to be a gentleman , to spite her or to gain her over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 9]: Biddy quietly asked me , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , '' I moodily answered .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 39]: `` Because , if it is to spite her , '' Biddy pursued , `` I should think -- but you know best -- that might be better and more independently done by caring nothing for her words .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 26]: And if it is to gain her over , I should think -- but you know best -- she was not worth gaining over . ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 10]: Exactly what I myself had thought , many times .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 11]: Exactly what was perfectly manifest to me at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 27]: But how could I , a poor dazed village lad , avoid that wonderful inconsistency into which the best and wisest of men fall every day ?
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 22]: `` It may be all quite true , '' said I to Biddy , `` but I admire her dreadfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 35]: In short , I turned over on my face when I came to that , and got a good grasp on the hair on each side of my head , and wrenched it well .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 56]: All the while knowing the madness of my heart to be so very mad and misplaced , that I was quite conscious it would have served my face right , if I had lifted it up by my hair , and knocked it against the pebbles as a punishment for belonging to such an idiot .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 17]: Biddy was the wisest of girls , and she tried to reason no more with me .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 32]: She put her hand , which was a comfortable hand though roughened by work , upon my hands , one after another , and gently took them out of my hair .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 58]: Then she softly patted my shoulder in a soothing way , while with my face upon my sleeve I cried a little , -- exactly as I had done in the brewery yard , -- and felt vaguely convinced that I was very much ill-used by somebody , or by everybody ; I ca n't say which .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 30]: `` I am glad of one thing , '' said Biddy , `` and that is , that you have felt you could give me your confidence , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 31]: And I am glad of another thing , and that is , that of course you know you may depend upon my keeping it and always so far deserving it .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 7]: If your first teacher -LRB- dear !
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 16]: such a poor one , and so much in need of being taught herself ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 19]: had been your teacher at the present time , she thinks she knows what lesson she would set .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 26]: But it would be a hard one to learn , and you have got beyond her , and it 's of no use now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 40]: So , with a quiet sigh for me , Biddy rose from the bank , and said , with a fresh and pleasant change of voice , `` Shall we walk a little farther , or go home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 32]: `` Biddy , '' I cried , getting up , putting my arm round her neck , and giving her a kiss , `` I shall always tell you everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 11]: `` Till you 're a gentleman , '' said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 13]: `` You know I never shall be , so that 's always .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 30]: Not that I have any occasion to tell you anything , for you know everything I know , -- as I told you at home the other night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 16]: said Biddy , quite in a whisper , as she looked away at the ships .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 23]: And then repeated , with her former pleasant change , `` shall we walk a little farther , or go home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 33]: I said to Biddy we would walk a little farther , and we did so , and the summer afternoon toned down into the summer evening , and it was very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 42]: I began to consider whether I was not more naturally and wholesomely situated , after all , in these circumstances , than playing beggar my neighbor by candle-light in the room with the stopped clocks , and being despised by Estella .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 55]: I thought it would be very good for me if I could get her out of my head , with all the rest of those remembrances and fancies , and could go to work determined to relish what I had to do , and stick to it , and make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 30]: I asked myself the question whether I did not surely know that if Estella were beside me at that moment instead of Biddy , she would make me miserable ?
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 30]: I was obliged to admit that I did know it for a certainty , and I said to myself , `` Pip , what a fool you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 17]: We talked a good deal as we walked , and all that Biddy said seemed right .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 44]: Biddy was never insulting , or capricious , or Biddy to-day and somebody else to-morrow ; she would have derived only pain , and no pleasure , from giving me pain ; she would far rather have wounded her own breast than mine .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 20]: How could it be , then , that I did not like her much the better of the two ?
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 23]: `` Biddy , '' said I , when we were walking homeward , `` I wish you could put me right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 7]: `` I wish I could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 3]: said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 30]: `` If I could only get myself to fall in love with you , -- you do n't mind my speaking so openly to such an old acquaintance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 9]: `` Oh dear , not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 3]: said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 7]: `` Do n't mind me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 20]: `` If I could only get myself to do it , that would be the thing for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 13]: `` But you never will , you see , '' said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 27]: It did not appear quite so unlikely to me that evening , as it would have done if we had discussed it a few hours before .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 11]: I therefore observed I was not quite sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 12]: But Biddy said she was , and she said it decisively .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 30]: In my heart I believed her to be right ; and yet I took it rather ill , too , that she should be so positive on the point .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 23]: When we came near the churchyard , we had to cross an embankment , and get over a stile near a sluice-gate .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 30]: There started up , from the gate , or from the rushes , or from the ooze -LRB- which was quite in his stagnant way -RRB- , Old Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 11]: he growled , `` where are you two going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 11]: `` Where should we be going , but home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 22]: `` Well , then , '' said he , `` I 'm jiggered if I do n't see you home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 13]: This penalty of being jiggered was a favorite supposititious case of his .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 38]: He attached no definite meaning to the word that I am aware of , but used it , like his own pretended Christian name , to affront mankind , and convey an idea of something savagely damaging .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 31]: When I was younger , I had had a general belief that if he had jiggered me personally , he would have done it with a sharp and twisted hook .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 31]: Biddy was much against his going with us , and said to me in a whisper , `` Do n't let him come ; I do n't like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 27]: As I did not like him either , I took the liberty of saying that we thanked him , but we did n't want seeing home .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 26]: He received that piece of information with a yell of laughter , and dropped back , but came slouching after us at a little distance .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 39]: Curious to know whether Biddy suspected him of having had a hand in that murderous attack of which my sister had never been able to give any account , I asked her why she did not like him .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 25]: she replied , glancing over her shoulder as he slouched after us , `` because I -- I am afraid he likes me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 11]: `` Did he ever tell you he liked you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 4]: I asked indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 34]: `` No , '' said Biddy , glancing over her shoulder again , `` he never told me so ; but he dances at me , whenever he can catch my eye . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 19]: However novel and peculiar this testimony of attachment , I did not doubt the accuracy of the interpretation .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 25]: I was very hot indeed upon Old Orlick 's daring to admire her ; as hot as if it were an outrage on myself .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 18]: `` But it makes no difference to you , you know , '' said Biddy , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 27]: `` No , Biddy , it makes no difference to me ; only I do n't like it ; I do n't approve of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 9]: `` Nor I neither , '' said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 10]: `` Though that makes no difference to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 34]: `` Exactly , '' said I ; `` but I must tell you I should have no opinion of you , Biddy , if he danced at you with your own consent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 30]: I kept an eye on Orlick after that night , and , whenever circumstances were favorable to his dancing at Biddy , got before him to obscure that demonstration .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 30]: He had struck root in Joe 's establishment , by reason of my sister 's sudden fancy for him , or I should have tried to get him dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 17]: He quite understood and reciprocated my good intentions , as I had reason to know thereafter .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 67]: And now , because my mind was not confused enough before , I complicated its confusion fifty thousand-fold , by having states and seasons when I was clear that Biddy was immeasurably better than Estella , and that the plain honest working life to which I was born had nothing in it to be ashamed of , but offered me sufficient means of self-respect and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 71]: At those times , I would decide conclusively that my disaffection to dear old Joe and the forge was gone , and that I was growing up in a fair way to be partners with Joe and to keep company with Biddy , -- when all in a moment some confounding remembrance of the Havisham days would fall upon me like a destructive missile , and scatter my wits again .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 49]: Scattered wits take a long time picking up ; and often before I had got them well together , they would be dispersed in all directions by one stray thought , that perhaps after all Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune when my time was out .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 24]: If my time had run out , it would have left me still at the height of my perplexities , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 22]: It never did run out , however , but was brought to a premature end , as I proceed to relate .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 21]: Chapter XVIII It was in the fourth year of my apprenticeship to Joe , and it was a Saturday night .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 25]: There was a group assembled round the fire at the Three Jolly Bargemen , attentive to Mr. Wopsle as he read the newspaper aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 7]: Of that group I was one .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 19]: A highly popular murder had been committed , and Mr. Wopsle was imbrued in blood to the eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 20]: He gloated over every abhorrent adjective in the description , and identified himself with every witness at the Inquest .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 32]: He faintly moaned , `` I am done for , '' as the victim , and he barbarously bellowed , `` I 'll serve you out , '' as the murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 48]: He gave the medical testimony , in pointed imitation of our local practitioner ; and he piped and shook , as the aged turnpike-keeper who had heard blows , to an extent so very paralytic as to suggest a doubt regarding the mental competency of that witness .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 19]: The coroner , in Mr. Wopsle 's hands , became Timon of Athens ; the beadle , Coriolanus .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 16]: He enjoyed himself thoroughly , and we all enjoyed ourselves , and were delightfully comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 14]: In this cosey state of mind we came to the verdict Wilful Murder .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 26]: Then , and not sooner , I became aware of a strange gentleman leaning over the back of the settle opposite me , looking on .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 27]: There was an expression of contempt on his face , and he bit the side of a great forefinger as he watched the group of faces .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 30]: said the stranger to Mr. Wopsle , when the reading was done , `` you have settled it all to your own satisfaction , I have no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 13]: Everybody started and looked up , as if it were the murderer .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 8]: He looked at everybody coldly and sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 7]: `` Guilty , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 5]: `` Out with it .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 23]: `` Sir , '' returned Mr. Wopsle , `` without having the honor of your acquaintance , I do say Guilty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 13]: Upon this we all took courage to unite in a confirmatory murmur .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 17]: `` I know you do , '' said the stranger ; `` I knew you would .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 5]: I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 9]: But now I 'll ask you a question .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 32]: Do you know , or do you not know , that the law of England supposes every man to be innocent , until he is proved-proved -- to be guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 23]: `` Sir , '' Mr. Wopsle began to reply , `` as an Englishman myself , I -- '' `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 10]: said the stranger , biting his forefinger at him .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 7]: `` Do n't evade the question .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 12]: Either you know it , or you do n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 7]: Which is it to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 44]: He stood with his head on one side and himself on one side , in a Bullying , interrogative manner , and he threw his forefinger at Mr. Wopsle , -- as it were to mark him out -- before biting it again .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 14]: `` Do you know it , or do n't you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 11]: `` Certainly I know it , '' replied Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 6]: `` Certainly you know it .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 10]: Then why did n't you say so at first ?
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 42]: Now , I 'll ask you another question , '' -- taking possession of Mr. Wopsle , as if he had a right to him , -- `` do you know that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 18]: Mr. Wopsle was beginning , `` I can only say -- '' when the stranger stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 11]: You wo n't answer the question , yes or no ?
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 9]: Now , I 'll try you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 7]: Throwing his finger at him again .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 5]: `` Attend to me .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 20]: Are you aware , or are you not aware , that none of these witnesses have yet been cross-examined ?
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 10]: Come , I only want one word from you .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 6]: Yes , or no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 17]: Mr. Wopsle hesitated , and we all began to conceive rather a poor opinion of him .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 10]: said the stranger , `` I 'll help you .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 12]: You do n't deserve help , but I 'll help you .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 10]: Look at that paper you hold in your hand .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 12]: repeated Mr. Wopsle , eyeing it , much at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 28]: `` Is it , '' pursued the stranger in his most sarcastic and suspicious manner , `` the printed paper you have just been reading from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 4]: `` Undoubtedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 32]: Now , turn to that paper , and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that his legal advisers instructed him altogether to reserve his defence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 12]: `` I read that just now , '' Mr. Wopsle pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 22]: `` Never mind what you read just now , sir ; I do n't ask you what you read just now .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 24]: You may read the Lord 's Prayer backwards , if you like , -- and , perhaps , have done it before to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 5]: Turn to the paper .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 31]: No , no , no my friend ; not to the top of the column ; you know better than that ; to the bottom , to the bottom . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 13]: -LRB- We all began to think Mr. Wopsle full of subterfuge . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 3]: `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 6]: Have you found it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: `` Here it is , '' said Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 36]: `` Now , follow that passage with your eye , and tell me whether it distinctly states that the prisoner expressly said that he was instructed by his legal advisers wholly to reserve his defence ?
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 8]: Do you make that of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 13]: Mr. Wopsle answered , `` Those are not the exact words . ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 7]: `` Not the exact words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 5]: repeated the gentleman bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 8]: `` Is that the exact substance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 27]: `` Yes , '' repeated the stranger , looking round at the rest of the company with his right hand extended towards the witness , Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 41]: `` And now I ask you what you say to the conscience of that man who , with that passage before his eyes , can lay his head upon his pillow after having pronounced a fellow-creature guilty , unheard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 27]: We all began to suspect that Mr. Wopsle was not the man we had thought him , and that he was beginning to be found out .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 104]: `` And that same man , remember , '' pursued the gentleman , throwing his finger at Mr. Wopsle heavily , -- `` that same man might be summoned as a juryman upon this very trial , and , having thus deeply committed himself , might return to the bosom of his family and lay his head upon his pillow , after deliberately swearing that he would well and truly try the issue joined between Our Sovereign Lord the King and the prisoner at the bar , and would a true verdict give according to the evidence , so help him God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 28]: We were all deeply persuaded that the unfortunate Wopsle had gone too far , and had better stop in his reckless career while there was yet time .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 86]: The strange gentleman , with an air of authority not to be disputed , and with a manner expressive of knowing something secret about every one of us that would effectually do for each individual if he chose to disclose it , left the back of the settle , and came into the space between the two settles , in front of the fire , where he remained standing , his left hand in his pocket , and he biting the forefinger of his right .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 44]: `` From information I have received , '' said he , looking round at us as we all quailed before him , `` I have reason to believe there is a blacksmith among you , by name Joseph -- or Joe -- Gargery .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 6]: Which is the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 10]: `` Here is the man , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: The strange gentleman beckoned him out of his place , and Joe went .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 17]: `` You have an apprentice , '' pursued the stranger , `` commonly known as Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 5]: Is he here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 6]: `` I am here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 3]: I cried .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 32]: The stranger did not recognize me , but I recognized him as the gentleman I had met on the stairs , on the occasion of my second visit to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 76]: I had known him the moment I saw him looking over the settle , and now that I stood confronting him with his hand upon my shoulder , I checked off again in detail his large head , his dark complexion , his deep-set eyes , his bushy black eyebrows , his large watch-chain , his strong black dots of beard and whisker , and even the smell of scented soap on his great hand .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 25]: `` I wish to have a private conference with you two , '' said he , when he had surveyed me at his leisure .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 8]: `` It will take a little time .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 11]: Perhaps we had better go to your place of residence .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 36]: I prefer not to anticipate my communication here ; you will impart as much or as little of it as you please to your friends afterwards ; I have nothing to do with that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 22]: Amidst a wondering silence , we three walked out of the Jolly Bargemen , and in a wondering silence walked home .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 21]: While going along , the strange gentleman occasionally looked at me , and occasionally bit the side of his finger .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 26]: As we neared home , Joe vaguely acknowledging the occasion as an impressive and ceremonious one , went on ahead to open the front door .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 17]: Our conference was held in the state parlor , which was feebly lighted by one candle .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 28]: It began with the strange gentleman 's sitting down at the table , drawing the candle to him , and looking over some entries in his pocket-book .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 32]: He then put up the pocket-book and set the candle a little aside , after peering round it into the darkness at Joe and me , to ascertain which was which .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 20]: `` My name , '' he said , `` is Jaggers , and I am a lawyer in London .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 6]: I am pretty well known .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 22]: I have unusual business to transact with you , and I commence by explaining that it is not of my originating .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 14]: If my advice had been asked , I should not have been here .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 11]: It was not asked , and you see me here .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 15]: What I have to do as the confidential agent of another , I do .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 7]: No less , no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 51]: Finding that he could not see us very well from where he sat , he got up , and threw one leg over the back of a chair and leaned upon it ; thus having one foot on the seat of the chair , and one foot on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 23]: `` Now , Joseph Gargery , I am the bearer of an offer to relieve you of this young fellow your apprentice .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 16]: You would not object to cancel his indentures at his request and for his good ?
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 9]: You would want nothing for so doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 22]: `` Lord forbid that I should want anything for not standing in Pip 's way , '' said Joe , staring .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 17]: `` Lord forbidding is pious , but not to the purpose , '' returned Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 10]: `` The question is , Would you want anything ?
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 6]: Do you want anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 15]: `` The answer is , '' returned Joe , sternly , `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 19]: I thought Mr. Jaggers glanced at Joe , as if he considered him a fool for his disinterestedness .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 18]: But I was too much bewildered between breathless curiosity and surprise , to be sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 9]: `` Very well , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 19]: `` Recollect the admission you have made , and do n't try to go from it presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 9]: `` Who 's a going to try ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 3]: retorted Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 8]: `` I do n't say anybody is .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 7]: Do you keep a dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 10]: `` Yes , I do keep a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 19]: `` Bear in mind then , that Brag is a good dog , but Holdfast is a better .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 9]: Bear that in mind , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 22]: repeated Mr. Jaggers , shutting his eyes and nodding his head at Joe , as if he were forgiving him something .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 10]: `` Now , I return to this young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 17]: And the communication I have got to make is , that he has Great Expectations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 11]: Joe and I gasped , and looked at one another .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 31]: `` I am instructed to communicate to him , '' said Mr. Jaggers , throwing his finger at me sideways , `` that he will come into a handsome property .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 53]: Further , that it is the desire of the present possessor of that property , that he be immediately removed from his present sphere of life and from this place , and be brought up as a gentleman , -- in a word , as a young fellow of great expectations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 27]: My dream was out ; my wild fancy was surpassed by sober reality ; Miss Havisham was going to make my fortune on a grand scale .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 26]: `` Now , Mr. Pip , '' pursued the lawyer , `` I address the rest of what I have to say , to you .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 30]: You are to understand , first , that it is the request of the person from whom I take my instructions that you always bear the name of Pip .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 21]: You will have no objection , I dare say , to your great expectations being encumbered with that easy condition .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 16]: But if you have any objection , this is the time to mention it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 27]: My heart was beating so fast , and there was such a singing in my ears , that I could scarcely stammer I had no objection .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 6]: `` I should think not !
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 35]: Now you are to understand , secondly , Mr. Pip , that the name of the person who is your liberal benefactor remains a profound secret , until the person chooses to reveal it .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 26]: I am empowered to mention that it is the intention of the person to reveal it at first hand by word of mouth to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 20]: When or where that intention may be carried out , I can not say ; no one can say .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: It may be years hence .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 48]: Now , you are distinctly to understand that you are most positively prohibited from making any inquiry on this head , or any allusion or reference , however distant , to any individual whomsoever as the individual , in all the communications you may have with me .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 18]: If you have a suspicion in your own breast , keep that suspicion in your own breast .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 32]: It is not the least to the purpose what the reasons of this prohibition are ; they may be the strongest and gravest reasons , or they may be mere whim .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 9]: This is not for you to inquire into .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 6]: The condition is laid down .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 43]: Your acceptance of it , and your observance of it as binding , is the only remaining condition that I am charged with , by the person from whom I take my instructions , and for whom I am not otherwise responsible .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 25]: That person is the person from whom you derive your expectations , and the secret is solely held by that person and by me .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 34]: Again , not a very difficult condition with which to encumber such a rise in fortune ; but if you have any objection to it , this is the time to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 4]: Speak out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 13]: Once more , I stammered with difficulty that I had no objection .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 6]: `` I should think not !
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 12]: Now , Mr. Pip , I have done with stipulations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 72]: Though he called me Mr. Pip , and began rather to make up to me , he still could not get rid of a certain air of bullying suspicion ; and even now he occasionally shut his eyes and threw his finger at me while he spoke , as much as to express that he knew all kinds of things to my disparagement , if he only chose to mention them .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: `` We come next , to mere details of arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 26]: You must know that , although I have used the term `` expectations '' more than once , you are not endowed with expectations only .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 20]: There is already lodged in my hands a sum of money amply sufficient for your suitable education and maintenance .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 8]: You will please consider me your guardian .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 29]: for I was going to thank him , `` I tell you at once , I am paid for my services , or I should n't render them .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 37]: It is considered that you must be better educated , in accordance with your altered position , and that you will be alive to the importance and necessity of at once entering on that advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 9]: I said I had always longed for it .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 23]: `` Never mind what you have always longed for , Mr. Pip , '' he retorted ; `` keep to the record .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: If you long for it now , that 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 17]: Am I answered that you are ready to be placed at once under some proper tutor ?
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 5]: Is that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: I stammered yes , that was it .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 9]: Now , your inclinations are to be consulted .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 15]: I do n't think that wise , mind , but it 's my trust .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 15]: Have you ever heard of any tutor whom you would prefer to another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 23]: I had never heard of any tutor but Biddy and Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt ; so , I replied in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 27]: `` There is a certain tutor , of whom I have some knowledge , who I think might suit the purpose , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 15]: `` I do n't recommend him , observe ; because I never recommend anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 12]: The gentleman I speak of is one Mr. Matthew Pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 7]: I caught at the name directly .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 5]: Miss Havisham 's relation .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 11]: The Matthew whom Mr. and Mrs. Camilla had spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 29]: The Matthew whose place was to be at Miss Havisham 's head , when she lay dead , in her bride 's dress on the bride 's table .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 7]: `` You know the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 22]: said Mr. Jaggers , looking shrewdly at me , and then shutting up his eyes while he waited for my answer .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 12]: My answer was , that I had heard of the name .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 8]: `` You have heard of the name .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 13]: But the question is , what do you say of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 27]: I said , or tried to say , that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation -- `` No , my young friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 10]: he interrupted , shaking his great head very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 5]: `` Recollect yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 70]: Not recollecting myself , I began again that I was much obliged to him for his recommendation -- `` No , my young friend , '' he interrupted , shaking his head and frowning and smiling both at once , -- `` no , no , no ; it 's very well done , but it wo n't do ; you are too young to fix me with it .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 9]: Recommendation is not the word , Mr. Pip .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 4]: Try another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 28]: Correcting myself , I said that I was much obliged to him for his mention of Mr. Matthew Pocket -- `` That 's more like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 4]: cried Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 14]: -- And -LRB- I added -RRB- , I would gladly try that gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 10]: You had better try him in his own house .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 21]: The way shall be prepared for you , and you can see his son first , who is in London .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 8]: When will you come to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 23]: I said -LRB- glancing at Joe , who stood looking on , motionless -RRB- , that I supposed I could come directly .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 26]: `` First , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` you should have some new clothes to come in , and they should not be working-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 5]: Say this day week .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 6]: You 'll want some money .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 8]: Shall I leave you twenty guineas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 25]: He produced a long purse , with the greatest coolness , and counted them out on the table and pushed them over to me .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 14]: This was the first time he had taken his leg from the chair .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 23]: He sat astride of the chair when he had pushed the money over , and sat swinging his purse and eyeing Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 6]: `` Well , Joseph Gargery ?
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 5]: You look dumbfoundered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 5]: `` I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 9]: said Joe , in a very decided manner .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: `` It was understood that you wanted nothing for yourself , remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 9]: `` It were understood , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 6]: `` And it are understood .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 9]: And it ever will be similar according . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 32]: `` But what , '' said Mr. Jaggers , swinging his purse , -- `` what if it was in my instructions to make you a present , as compensation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 7]: `` As compensation what for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 3]: Joe demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 9]: `` For the loss of his services . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 14]: Joe laid his hand upon my shoulder with the touch of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 28]: I have often thought him since , like the steam-hammer that can crush a man or pat an egg-shell , in his combination of strength with gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 32]: `` Pip is that hearty welcome , '' said Joe , `` to go free with his services , to honor and fortun ' , as no words can tell him .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 32]: But if you think as Money can make compensation to me for the loss of the little child -- what come to the forge -- and ever the best of friends !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 46]: -- '' O dear good Joe , whom I was so ready to leave and so unthankful to , I see you again , with your muscular blacksmith 's arm before your eyes , and your broad chest heaving , and your voice dying away .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 36]: O dear good faithful tender Joe , I feel the loving tremble of your hand upon my arm , as solemnly this day as if it had been the rustle of an angel 's wing !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 8]: But I encouraged Joe at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 22]: I was lost in the mazes of my future fortunes , and could not retrace the by-paths we had trodden together .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 34]: I begged Joe to be comforted , for -LRB- as he said -RRB- we had ever been the best of friends , and -LRB- as I said -RRB- we ever would be so .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 24]: Joe scooped his eyes with his disengaged wrist , as if he were bent on gouging himself , but said not another word .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 24]: Mr. Jaggers had looked on at this , as one who recognized in Joe the village idiot , and in me his keeper .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 36]: When it was over , he said , weighing in his hand the purse he had ceased to swing : -- `` Now , Joseph Gargery , I warn you this is your last chance .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 6]: No half measures with me .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 26]: If you mean to take a present that I have it in charge to make you , speak out , and you shall have it .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 36]: If on the contrary you mean to say -- '' Here , to his great amazement , he was stopped by Joe 's suddenly working round him with every demonstration of a fell pugilistic purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 25]: `` Which I meantersay , '' cried Joe , `` that if you come into my place bull-baiting and badgering me , come out !
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 14]: Which I meantersay as sech if you 're a man , come on !
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 17]: Which I meantersay that what I say , I meantersay and stand or fall by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 52]: I drew Joe away , and he immediately became placable ; merely stating to me , in an obliging manner and as a polite expostulatory notice to any one whom it might happen to concern , that he were not a going to be bull-baited and badgered in his own place .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 15]: Mr. Jaggers had risen when Joe demonstrated , and had backed near the door .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 16]: Without evincing any inclination to come in again , he there delivered his valedictory remarks .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 4]: They were these .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 25]: `` Well , Mr. Pip , I think the sooner you leave here -- as you are to be a gentleman -- the better .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 19]: Let it stand for this day week , and you shall receive my printed address in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 18]: You can take a hackney-coach at the stage-coach office in London , and come straight to me .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 19]: Understand , that I express no opinion , one way or other , on the trust I undertake .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 12]: I am paid for undertaking it , and I do so .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 7]: Now , understand that , finally .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 4]: Understand that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 31]: He was throwing his finger at both of us , and I think would have gone on , but for his seeming to think Joe dangerous , and going off .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 31]: Something came into my head which induced me to run after him , as he was going down to the Jolly Bargemen , where he had left a hired carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 10]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Jaggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 13]: said he , facing round , `` what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 26]: `` I wish to be quite right , Mr. Jaggers , and to keep to your directions ; so I thought I had better ask .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 24]: Would there be any objection to my taking leave of any one I know , about here , before I go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 15]: `` No , '' said he , looking as if he hardly understood me .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 15]: `` I do n't mean in the village only , but up town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 7]: `` No , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 5]: `` No objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 47]: I thanked him and ran home again , and there I found that Joe had already locked the front door and vacated the state parlor , and was seated by the kitchen fire with a hand on each knee , gazing intently at the burning coals .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 22]: I too sat down before the fire and gazed at the coals , and nothing was said for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 39]: My sister was in her cushioned chair in her corner , and Biddy sat at her needle-work before the fire , and Joe sat next Biddy , and I sat next Joe in the corner opposite my sister .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 33]: The more I looked into the glowing coals , the more incapable I became of looking at Joe ; the longer the silence lasted , the more unable I felt to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 15]: At length I got out , `` Joe , have you told Biddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 46]: `` No , Pip , '' returned Joe , still looking at the fire , and holding his knees tight , as if he had private information that they intended to make off somewhere , `` which I left it to yourself , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 10]: `` I would rather you told , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 23]: `` Pip 's a gentleman of fortun ' then , '' said Joe , `` and God bless him in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 10]: Biddy dropped her work , and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 9]: Joe held his knees and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 7]: I looked at both of them .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 26]: After a pause , they both heartily congratulated me ; but there was a certain touch of sadness in their congratulations that I rather resented .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 38]: I took it upon myself to impress Biddy -LRB- and through Biddy , Joe -RRB- with the grave obligation I considered my friends under , to know nothing and say nothing about the maker of my fortune .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 35]: It would all come out in good time , I observed , and in the meanwhile nothing was to be said , save that I had come into great expectations from a mysterious patron .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 79]: Biddy nodded her head thoughtfully at the fire as she took up her work again , and said she would be very particular ; and Joe , still detaining his knees , said , `` Ay , ay , I 'll be ekervally partickler , Pip ; '' and then they congratulated me again , and went on to express so much wonder at the notion of my being a gentleman that I did n't half like it .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 19]: Infinite pains were then taken by Biddy to convey to my sister some idea of what had happened .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 12]: To the best of my belief , those efforts entirely failed .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 27]: She laughed and nodded her head a great many times , and even repeated after Biddy , the words `` Pip '' and `` Property . ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 29]: But I doubt if they had more meaning in them than an election cry , and I can not suggest a darker picture of her state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 27]: I never could have believed it without experience , but as Joe and Biddy became more at their cheerful ease again , I became quite gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 31]: Dissatisfied with my fortune , of course I could not be ; but it is possible that I may have been , without quite knowing it , dissatisfied with myself .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 45]: Any how , I sat with my elbow on my knee and my face upon my hand , looking into the fire , as those two talked about my going away , and about what they should do without me , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 42]: And whenever I caught one of them looking at me , though never so pleasantly -LRB- and they often looked at me , -- particularly Biddy -RRB- , I felt offended : as if they were expressing some mistrust of me .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 11]: Though Heaven knows they never did by word or sign .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 36]: At those times I would get up and look out at the door ; for our kitchen door opened at once upon the night , and stood open on summer evenings to air the room .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 37]: The very stars to which I then raised my eyes , I am afraid I took to be but poor and humble stars for glittering on the rustic objects among which I had passed my life .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 21]: `` Saturday night , '' said I , when we sat at our supper of bread and cheese and beer .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 13]: `` Five more days , and then the day before the day !
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 6]: They 'll soon go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 19]: `` Yes , Pip , '' observed Joe , whose voice sounded hollow in his beer -- mug .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 7]: `` They 'll soon go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 10]: `` Soon , soon go , '' said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 50]: `` I have been thinking , Joe , that when I go down town on Monday , and order my new clothes , I shall tell the tailor that I 'll come and put them on there , or that I 'll have them sent to Mr. Pumblechook 's .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 16]: It would be very disagreeable to be stared at by all the people here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 62]: `` Mr. and Mrs. Hubble might like to see you in your new gen-teel figure too , Pip , '' said Joe , industriously cutting his bread , with his cheese on it , in the palm of his left hand , and glancing at my untasted supper as if he thought of the time when we used to compare slices .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 5]: `` So might Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 12]: And the Jolly Bargemen might take it as a compliment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 12]: `` That 's just what I do n't want , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 26]: They would make such a business of it , -- such a coarse and common business , -- that I could n't bear myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 9]: `` Ah , that indeed , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 43]: `` If you could n't abear yourself -- '' Biddy asked me here , as she sat holding my sister 's plate , `` Have you thought about when you 'll show yourself to Mr. Gargery , and your sister and me ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 12]: You will show yourself to us ; wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 27]: `` Biddy , '' I returned with some resentment , `` you are so exceedingly quick that it 's difficult to keep up with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 12]: -LRB- `` She always were quick , '' observed Joe . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 41]: `` If you had waited another moment , Biddy , you would have heard me say that I shall bring my clothes here in a bundle one evening , -- most likely on the evening before I go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 5]: Biddy said no more .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 22]: Handsomely forgiving her , I soon exchanged an affectionate good night with her and Joe , and went up to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 38]: When I got into my little room , I sat down and took a long look at it , as a mean little room that I should soon be parted from and raised above , for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 57]: It was furnished with fresh young remembrances too , and even at the same moment I fell into much the same confused division of mind between it and the better rooms to which I was going , as I had been in so often between the forge and Miss Havisham 's , and Biddy and Estella .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 21]: The sun had been shining brightly all day on the roof of my attic , and the room was warm .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 52]: As I put the window open and stood looking out , I saw Joe come slowly forth at the dark door , below , and take a turn or two in the air ; and then I saw Biddy come , and bring him a pipe and light it for him .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 24]: He never smoked so late , and it seemed to hint to me that he wanted comforting , for some reason or other .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 52]: He presently stood at the door immediately beneath me , smoking his pipe , and Biddy stood there too , quietly talking to him , and I knew that they talked of me , for I heard my name mentioned in an endearing tone by both of them more than once .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 57]: I would not have listened for more , if I could have heard more ; so I drew away from the window , and sat down in my one chair by the bedside , feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this first night of my bright fortunes should be the loneliest I had ever known .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 46]: Looking towards the open window , I saw light wreaths from Joe 's pipe floating there , and I fancied it was like a blessing from Joe , -- not obtruded on me or paraded before me , but pervading the air we shared together .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 32]: I put my light out , and crept into bed ; and it was an uneasy bed now , and I never slept the old sound sleep in it any more .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 26]: Chapter XIX Morning made a considerable difference in my general prospect of Life , and brightened it so much that it scarcely seemed the same .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 59]: What lay heaviest on my mind was , the consideration that six days intervened between me and the day of departure ; for I could not divest myself of a misgiving that something might happen to London in the meanwhile , and that , when I got there , it would be either greatly deteriorated or clean gone .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 26]: Joe and Biddy were very sympathetic and pleasant when I spoke of our approaching separation ; but they only referred to it when I did .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 32]: After breakfast , Joe brought out my indentures from the press in the best parlor , and we put them in the fire , and I felt that I was free .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 43]: With all the novelty of my emancipation on me , I went to church with Joe , and thought perhaps the clergyman would n't have read that about the rich man and the kingdom of Heaven , if he had known all .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 25]: After our early dinner , I strolled out alone , purposing to finish off the marshes at once , and get them done with .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 54]: As I passed the church , I felt -LRB- as I had felt during service in the morning -RRB- a sublime compassion for the poor creatures who were destined to go there , Sunday after Sunday , all their lives through , and to lie obscurely at last among the low green mounds .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 47]: I promised myself that I would do something for them one of these days , and formed a plan in outline for bestowing a dinner of roast-beef and plum-pudding , a pint of ale , and a gallon of condescension , upon everybody in the village .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 55]: If I had often thought before , with something allied to shame , of my companionship with the fugitive whom I had once seen limping among those graves , what were my thoughts on this Sunday , when the place recalled the wretch , ragged and shivering , with his felon iron and badge !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 41]: My comfort was , that it happened a long time ago , and that he had doubtless been transported a long way off , and that he was dead to me , and might be veritably dead into the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 90]: No more low , wet grounds , no more dikes and sluices , no more of these grazing cattle , -- though they seemed , in their dull manner , to wear a more respectful air now , and to face round , in order that they might stare as long as possible at the possessor of such great expectations , -- farewell , monotonous acquaintances of my childhood , henceforth I was for London and greatness ; not for smith 's work in general , and for you !
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 30]: I made my exultant way to the old Battery , and , lying down there to consider the question whether Miss Havisham intended me for Estella , fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 19]: When I awoke , I was much surprised to find Joe sitting beside me , smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 33]: He greeted me with a cheerful smile on my opening my eyes , and said , -- `` As being the last time , Pip , I thought I 'd foller . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 13]: `` And Joe , I am very glad you did so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 6]: `` Thankee , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 29]: `` You may be sure , dear Joe , '' I went on , after we had shaken hands , `` that I shall never forget you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 8]: `` No , no , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 15]: said Joe , in a comfortable tone , `` I 'm sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 7]: Ay , ay , old chap !
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 24]: Bless you , it were only necessary to get it well round in a man 's mind , to be certain on it .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 25]: But it took a bit of time to get it well round , the change come so oncommon plump ; did n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 17]: Somehow , I was not best pleased with Joe 's being so mightily secure of me .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 30]: I should have liked him to have betrayed emotion , or to have said , `` It does you credit , Pip , '' or something of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 55]: Therefore , I made no remark on Joe 's first head ; merely saying as to his second , that the tidings had indeed come suddenly , but that I had always wanted to be a gentleman , and had often and often speculated on what I would do , if I were one .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 6]: `` Have you though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 3]: said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 4]: `` Astonishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 36]: `` It 's a pity now , Joe , '' said I , `` that you did not get on a little more , when we had our lessons here ; is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 12]: `` Well , I do n't know , '' returned Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 7]: `` I 'm so awful dull .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 9]: I 'm only master of my own trade .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 36]: It were always a pity as I was so awful dull ; but it 's no more of a pity now , than it was -- this day twelvemonth -- do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 41]: What I had meant was , that when I came into my property and was able to do something for Joe , it would have been much more agreeable if he had been better qualified for a rise in station .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 23]: He was so perfectly innocent of my meaning , however , that I thought I would mention it to Biddy in preference .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 59]: So , when we had walked home and had had tea , I took Biddy into our little garden by the side of the lane , and , after throwing out in a general way for the elevation of her spirits , that I should never forget her , said I had a favor to ask of her .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 28]: `` And it is , Biddy , '' said I , `` that you will not omit any opportunity of helping Joe on , a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 7]: `` How helping him on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 10]: asked Biddy , with a steady sort of glance .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 32]: Joe is a dear good fellow , -- in fact , I think he is the dearest fellow that ever lived , -- but he is rather backward in some things .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 13]: For instance , Biddy , in his learning and his manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 30]: Although I was looking at Biddy as I spoke , and although she opened her eyes very wide when I had spoken , she did not look at me .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 6]: `` O , his manners !
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 8]: wo n't his manners do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 8]: asked Biddy , plucking a black-currant leaf .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 15]: `` My dear Biddy , they do very well here -- '' `` O !
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 7]: they do very well here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 12]: interrupted Biddy , looking closely at the leaf in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 41]: `` Hear me out , -- but if I were to remove Joe into a higher sphere , as I shall hope to remove him when I fully come into my property , they would hardly do him justice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 11]: `` And do n't you think he knows that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 3]: asked Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 38]: It was such a very provoking question -LRB- for it had never in the most distant manner occurred to me -RRB- , that I said , snappishly , -- `` Biddy , what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 54]: Biddy , having rubbed the leaf to pieces between her hands , -- and the smell of a black-currant bush has ever since recalled to me that evening in the little garden by the side of the lane , -- said , `` Have you never considered that he may be proud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 4]: `` Proud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 7]: I repeated , with disdainful emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 3]: `` O !
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 33]: there are many kinds of pride , '' said Biddy , looking full at me and shaking her head ; `` pride is not all of one kind -- '' `` Well ?
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: What are you stopping for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 13]: said I. `` Not all of one kind , '' resumed Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 30]: `` He may be too proud to let any one take him out of a place that he is competent to fill , and fills well and with respect .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 33]: To tell you the truth , I think he is ; though it sounds bold in me to say so , for you must know him far better than I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 20]: `` Now , Biddy , '' said I , `` I am very sorry to see this in you .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 10]: I did not expect to see this in you .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 9]: You are envious , Biddy , and grudging .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 20]: You are dissatisfied on account of my rise in fortune , and you ca n't help showing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 18]: `` If you have the heart to think so , '' returned Biddy , `` say so .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 17]: Say so over and over again , if you have the heart to think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 35]: `` If you have the heart to be so , you mean , Biddy , '' said I , in a virtuous and superior tone ; `` do n't put it off upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 22]: I am very sorry to see it , and it 's a -- it 's a bad side of human nature .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 24]: I did intend to ask you to use any little opportunities you might have after I was gone , of improving dear Joe .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 8]: But after this I ask you nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 16]: I am extremely sorry to see this in you , Biddy , '' I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 15]: `` It 's a -- it 's a bad side of human nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 38]: `` Whether you scold me or approve of me , '' returned poor Biddy , `` you may equally depend upon my trying to do all that lies in my power , here , at all times .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 19]: And whatever opinion you take away of me , shall make no difference in my remembrance of you .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 18]: Yet a gentleman should not be unjust neither , '' said Biddy , turning away her head .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 96]: I again warmly repeated that it was a bad side of human nature -LRB- in which sentiment , waiving its application , I have since seen reason to think I was right -RRB- , and I walked down the little path away from Biddy , and Biddy went into the house , and I went out at the garden gate and took a dejected stroll until supper-time ; again feeling it very sorrowful and strange that this , the second night of my bright fortunes , should be as lonely and unsatisfactory as the first .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 23]: But , morning once more brightened my view , and I extended my clemency to Biddy , and we dropped the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 68]: Putting on the best clothes I had , I went into town as early as I could hope to find the shops open , and presented myself before Mr. Trabb , the tailor , who was having his breakfast in the parlor behind his shop , and who did not think it worth his while to come out to me , but called me in to him .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 11]: said Mr. Trabb , in a hail-fellow-well-met kind of way .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 14]: `` How are you , and what can I do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 25]: Mr. Trabb had sliced his hot roll into three feather-beds , and was slipping butter in between the blankets , and covering it up .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 56]: He was a prosperous old bachelor , and his open window looked into a prosperous little garden and orchard , and there was a prosperous iron safe let into the wall at the side of his fireplace , and I did not doubt that heaps of his prosperity were put away in it in bags .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 35]: `` Mr. Trabb , '' said I , `` it 's an unpleasant thing to have to mention , because it looks like boasting ; but I have come into a handsome property . ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 7]: A change passed over Mr. Trabb .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 30]: He forgot the butter in bed , got up from the bedside , and wiped his fingers on the tablecloth , exclaiming , `` Lord bless my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 41]: `` I am going up to my guardian in London , '' said I , casually drawing some guineas out of my pocket and looking at them ; `` and I want a fashionable suit of clothes to go in .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 28]: I wish to pay for them , '' I added -- otherwise I thought he might only pretend to make them , `` with ready money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 44]: `` My dear sir , '' said Mr. Trabb , as he respectfully bent his body , opened his arms , and took the liberty of touching me on the outside of each elbow , `` do n't hurt me by mentioning that .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 7]: May I venture to congratulate you ?
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 13]: Would you do me the favor of stepping into the shop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 14]: Mr. Trabb 's boy was the most audacious boy in all that country-side .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 21]: When I had entered he was sweeping the shop , and he had sweetened his labors by sweeping over me .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 44]: He was still sweeping when I came out into the shop with Mr. Trabb , and he knocked the broom against all possible corners and obstacles , to express -LRB- as I understood it -RRB- equality with any blacksmith , alive or dead .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 24]: `` Hold that noise , '' said Mr. Trabb , with the greatest sternness , `` or I 'll knock your head off !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 11]: -- Do me the favor to be seated , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 47]: Now , this , '' said Mr. Trabb , taking down a roll of cloth , and tiding it out in a flowing manner over the counter , preparatory to getting his hand under it to show the gloss , `` is a very sweet article .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 17]: I can recommend it for your purpose , sir , because it really is extra super .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 7]: But you shall see some others .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 8]: Give me Number Four , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 33]: -LRB- To the boy , and with a dreadfully severe stare ; foreseeing the danger of that miscreant 's brushing me with it , or making some other sign of familiarity . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 27]: Mr. Trabb never removed his stern eye from the boy until he had deposited number four on the counter and was at a safe distance again .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 13]: Then he commanded him to bring number five , and number eight .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 36]: `` And let me have none of your tricks here , '' said Mr. Trabb , `` or you shall repent it , you young scoundrel , the longest day you have to live . ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 69]: Mr. Trabb then bent over number four , and in a sort of deferential confidence recommended it to me as a light article for summer wear , an article much in vogue among the nobility and gentry , an article that it would ever be an honor to him to reflect upon a distinguished fellow-townsman 's -LRB- if he might claim me for a fellow-townsman -RRB- having worn .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 38]: `` Are you bringing numbers five and eight , you vagabond , '' said Mr. Trabb to the boy after that , `` or shall I kick you out of the shop and bring them myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 25]: I selected the materials for a suit , with the assistance of Mr. Trabb 's judgment , and re-entered the parlor to be measured .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 41]: For although Mr. Trabb had my measure already , and had previously been quite contented with it , he said apologetically that it `` would n't do under existing circumstances , sir , -- would n't do at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 50]: So , Mr. Trabb measured and calculated me in the parlor , as if I were an estate and he the finest species of surveyor , and gave himself such a world of trouble that I felt that no suit of clothes could possibly remunerate him for his pains .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 79]: When he had at last done and had appointed to send the articles to Mr. Pumblechook 's on the Thursday evening , he said , with his hand upon the parlor lock , `` I know , sir , that London gentlemen can not be expected to patronize local work , as a rule ; but if you would give me a turn now and then in the quality of a townsman , I should greatly esteem it .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 8]: Good morning , sir , much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 4]: -- Door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 19]: The last word was flung at the boy , who had not the least notion what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 40]: But I saw him collapse as his master rubbed me out with his hands , and my first decided experience of the stupendous power of money was , that it had morally laid upon his back Trabb 's boy .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 40]: After this memorable event , I went to the hatter 's , and the bootmaker 's , and the hosier 's , and felt rather like Mother Hubbard 's dog whose outfit required the services of so many trades .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 17]: I also went to the coach-office and took my place for seven o'clock on Saturday morning .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 52]: It was not necessary to explain everywhere that I had come into a handsome property ; but whenever I said anything to that effect , it followed that the officiating tradesman ceased to have his attention diverted through the window by the High Street , and concentrated his mind upon me .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 36]: When I had ordered everything I wanted , I directed my steps towards Pumblechook 's , and , as I approached that gentleman 's place of business , I saw him standing at his door .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 9]: He was waiting for me with great impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 20]: He had been out early with the chaise-cart , and had called at the forge and heard the news .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 32]: He had prepared a collation for me in the Barnwell parlor , and he too ordered his shopman to `` come out of the gangway '' as my sacred person passed .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 36]: `` My dear friend , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , taking me by both hands , when he and I and the collation were alone , `` I give you joy of your good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 7]: Well deserved , well deserved ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 18]: This was coming to the point , and I thought it a sensible way of expressing himself .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 39]: `` To think , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , after snorting admiration at me for some moments , `` that I should have been the humble instrument of leading up to this , is a proud reward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 20]: I begged Mr. Pumblechook to remember that nothing was to be ever said or hinted , on that point .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 87]: `` My dear young friend , '' said Mr. Pumblechook ; `` if you will allow me to call you so -- '' I murmured `` Certainly , '' and Mr. Pumblechook took me by both hands again , and communicated a movement to his waistcoat , which had an emotional appearance , though it was rather low down , `` My dear young friend , rely upon my doing my little all in your absence , by keeping the fact before the mind of Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 4]: -- Joseph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 12]: said Mr. Pumblechook , in the way of a compassionate adjuration .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 23]: `` Joseph !! Joseph !!! '' Thereupon he shook his head and tapped it , expressing his sense of deficiency in Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 23]: `` But my dear young friend , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , `` you must be hungry , you must be exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 3]: Be seated .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 41]: Here is a chicken had round from the Boar , here is a tongue had round from the Boar , here 's one or two little things had round from the Boar , that I hope you may not despise .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 38]: But do I , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again the moment after he had sat down , `` see afore me , him as I ever sported with in his times of happy infancy ?
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 9]: And may I -- may I -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 10]: This May I , meant might he shake hands ?
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 14]: I consented , and he was fervent , and then sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 10]: `` Here is wine , '' said Mr. Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 21]: `` Let us drink , Thanks to Fortune , and may she ever pick out her favorites with equal judgment !
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 39]: And yet I can not , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again , `` see afore me One -- and likewise drink to One -- without again expressing -- May I -- may I -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 23]: I said he might , and he shook hands with me again , and emptied his glass and turned it upside down .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 28]: I did the same ; and if I had turned myself upside down before drinking , the wine could not have gone more direct to my head .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 41]: Mr. Pumblechook helped me to the liver wing , and to the best slice of tongue -LRB- none of those out-of-the-way No Thoroughfares of Pork now -RRB- , and took , comparatively speaking , no care of himself at all .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 4]: poultry , poultry !
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 31]: You little thought , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , apostrophizing the fowl in the dish , `` when you was a young fledgling , what was in store for you .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 39]: You little thought you was to be refreshment beneath this humble roof for one as -- Call it a weakness , if you will , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , getting up again , `` but may I ?
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 5]: may I -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 21]: It began to be unnecessary to repeat the form of saying he might , so he did it at once .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 19]: How he ever did it so often without wounding himself with my knife , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 27]: `` And your sister , '' he resumed , after a little steady eating , `` which had the honor of bringing you up by hand !
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 20]: It 's a sad picter , to reflect that she 's no longer equal to fully understanding the honor .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 19]: May -- '' I saw he was about to come at me again , and I stopped him .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 14]: `` We 'll drink her health , '' said I. `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 27]: cried Mr. Pumblechook , leaning back in his chair , quite flaccid with admiration , `` that 's the way you know 'em , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 37]: -LRB- I do n't know who Sir was , but he certainly was not I , and there was no third person present -RRB- ; `` that 's the way you know the noble-minded , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 6]: Ever forgiving and ever affable .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 40]: It might , '' said the servile Pumblechook , putting down his untasted glass in a hurry and getting up again , `` to a common person , have the appearance of repeating -- but may I -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 16]: When he had done it , he resumed his seat and drank to my sister .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 30]: `` Let us never be blind , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , `` to her faults of temper , but it is to be hoped she meant well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 33]: At about this time , I began to observe that he was getting flushed in the face ; as to myself , I felt all face , steeped in wine and smarting .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 28]: I mentioned to Mr. Pumblechook that I wished to have my new clothes sent to his house , and he was ecstatic on my so distinguishing him .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 21]: I mentioned my reason for desiring to avoid observation in the village , and he lauded it to the skies .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 22]: There was nobody but himself , he intimated , worthy of my confidence , and -- in short , might he ?
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 44]: Then he asked me tenderly if I remembered our boyish games at sums , and how we had gone together to have me bound apprentice , and , in effect , how he had ever been my favorite fancy and my chosen friend ?
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 42]: If I had taken ten times as many glasses of wine as I had , I should have known that he never had stood in that relation towards me , and should in my heart of hearts have repudiated the idea .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 31]: Yet for all that , I remember feeling convinced that I had been much mistaken in him , and that he was a sensible , practical , good-hearted prime fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 24]: By degrees he fell to reposing such great confidence in me , as to ask my advice in reference to his own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 39]: He mentioned that there was an opportunity for a great amalgamation and monopoly of the corn and seed trade on those premises , if enlarged , such as had never occurred before in that or any other neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 19]: What alone was wanting to the realization of a vast fortune , he considered to be More Capital .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 10]: Those were the two little words , more capital .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 105]: Now it appeared to him -LRB- Pumblechook -RRB- that if that capital were got into the business , through a sleeping partner , sir , -- which sleeping partner would have nothing to do but walk in , by self or deputy , whenever he pleased , and examine the books , -- and walk in twice a year and take his profits away in his pocket , to the tune of fifty per cent , -- it appeared to him that that might be an opening for a young gentleman of spirit combined with property , which would be worthy of his attention .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 6]: But what did I think ?
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 14]: He had great confidence in my opinion , and what did I think ?
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 7]: I gave it as my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 6]: `` Wait a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 35]: The united vastness and distinctness of this view so struck him , that he no longer asked if he might shake hands with me , but said he really must , -- and did .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 48]: We drank all the wine , and Mr. Pumblechook pledged himself over and over again to keep Joseph up to the mark -LRB- I do n't know what mark -RRB- , and to render me efficient and constant service -LRB- I do n't know what service -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 55]: He also made known to me for the first time in my life , and certainly after having kept his secret wonderfully well , that he had always said of me , `` That boy is no common boy , and mark me , his fortun ' will be no common fortun ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 23]: He said with a tearful smile that it was a singular thing to think of now , and I said so too .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 44]: Finally , I went out into the air , with a dim perception that there was something unwonted in the conduct of the sunshine , and found that I had slumberously got to the turnpike without having taken any account of the road .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 12]: There , I was roused by Mr. Pumblechook 's hailing me .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 20]: He was a long way down the sunny street , and was making expressive gestures for me to stop .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 9]: I stopped , and he came up breathless .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 19]: `` No , my dear friend , '' said he , when he had recovered wind for speech .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 8]: `` Not if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 13]: This occasion shall not entirely pass without that affability on your part .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 11]: -- May I , as an old friend and well-wisher ?
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 4]: May I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 25]: We shook hands for the hundredth time at least , and he ordered a young carter out of my way with the greatest indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 44]: Then , he blessed me and stood waving his hand to me until I had passed the crook in the road ; and then I turned into a field and had a long nap under a hedge before I pursued my way home .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 25]: I had scant luggage to take with me to London , for little of the little I possessed was adapted to my new station .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 35]: But I began packing that same afternoon , and wildly packed up things that I knew I should want next morning , in a fiction that there was not a moment to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 36]: So , Tuesday , Wednesday , and Thursday , passed ; and on Friday morning I went to Mr. Pumblechook 's , to put on my new clothes and pay my visit to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 25]: Mr. Pumblechook 's own room was given up to me to dress in , and was decorated with clean towels expressly for the event .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 10]: My clothes were rather a disappointment , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 25]: Probably every new and eagerly expected garment ever put on since clothes came in , fell a trifle short of the wearer 's expectation .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 46]: But after I had had my new suit on some half an hour , and had gone through an immensity of posturing with Mr. Pumblechook 's very limited dressing-glass , in the futile endeavor to see my legs , it seemed to fit me better .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 20]: It being market morning at a neighboring town some ten miles off , Mr. Pumblechook was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 25]: I had not told him exactly when I meant to leave , and was not likely to shake hands with him again before departing .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 47]: This was all as it should be , and I went out in my new array , fearfully ashamed of having to pass the shopman , and suspicious after all that I was at a personal disadvantage , something like Joe 's in his Sunday suit .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 31]: I went circuitously to Miss Havisham 's by all the back ways , and rang at the bell constrainedly , on account of the stiff long fingers of my gloves .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 30]: Sarah Pocket came to the gate , and positively reeled back when she saw me so changed ; her walnut-shell countenance likewise turned from brown to green and yellow .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 3]: `` You ?
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 26]: `` I am going to London , Miss Pocket , '' said I , `` and want to say good by to Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 26]: I was not expected , for she left me locked in the yard , while she went to ask if I were to be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 20]: After a very short delay , she returned and took me up , staring at me all the way .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 20]: Miss Havisham was taking exercise in the room with the long spread table , leaning on her crutch stick .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 21]: The room was lighted as of yore , and at the sound of our entrance , she stopped and turned .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 10]: She was then just abreast of the rotted bride-cake .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 11]: `` Do n't go , Sarah , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 6]: `` Well , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 36]: `` I start for London , Miss Havisham , to-morrow , '' I was exceedingly careful what I said , `` and I thought you would kindly not mind my taking leave of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 39]: `` This is a gay figure , Pip , '' said she , making her crutch stick play round me , as if she , the fairy godmother who had changed me , were bestowing the finishing gift .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 21]: `` I have come into such good fortune since I saw you last , Miss Havisham , '' I murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 13]: `` And I am so grateful for it , Miss Havisham ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 6]: `` Ay , ay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 14]: said she , looking at the discomfited and envious Sarah , with delight .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: `` I have seen Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 8]: I have heard about it , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 6]: So you go to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 7]: `` Yes , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 11]: `` And you are adopted by a rich person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 7]: `` Yes , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 5]: `` Not named ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 7]: `` No , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 10]: `` And Mr. Jaggers is made your guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 7]: `` Yes , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 21]: She quite gloated on these questions and answers , so keen was her enjoyment of Sarah Pocket 's jealous dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 13]: she went on ; `` you have a promising career before you .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 15]: Be good -- deserve it -- and abide by Mr. Jaggers 's instructions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 24]: She looked at me , and looked at Sarah , and Sarah 's countenance wrung out of her watchful face a cruel smile .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 6]: `` Good by , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 14]: -- you will always keep the name of Pip , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 7]: `` Yes , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 7]: `` Good by , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 20]: She stretched out her hand , and I went down on my knee and put it to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 24]: I had not considered how I should take leave of her ; it came naturally to me at the moment to do this .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 48]: She looked at Sarah Pocket with triumph in her weird eyes , and so I left my fairy godmother , with both her hands on her crutch stick , standing in the midst of the dimly lighted room beside the rotten bride-cake that was hidden in cobwebs .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 18]: Sarah Pocket conducted me down , as if I were a ghost who must be seen out .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 16]: She could not get over my appearance , and was in the last degree confounded .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 28]: I said `` Good by , Miss Pocket ; '' but she merely stared , and did not seem collected enough to know that I had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 61]: Clear of the house , I made the best of my way back to Pumblechook 's , took off my new clothes , made them into a bundle , and went back home in my older dress , carrying it -- to speak the truth -- much more at my ease too , though I had the bundle to carry .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 39]: And now , those six days which were to have run out so slowly , had run out fast and were gone , and to-morrow looked me in the face more steadily than I could look at it .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 35]: As the six evenings had dwindled away , to five , to four , to three , to two , I had become more and more appreciative of the society of Joe and Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 26]: On this last evening , I dressed my self out in my new clothes for their delight , and sat in my splendor until bedtime .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 25]: We had a hot supper on the occasion , graced by the inevitable roast fowl , and we had some flip to finish with .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 17]: We were all very low , and none the higher for pretending to be in spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 31]: I was to leave our village at five in the morning , carrying my little hand-portmanteau , and I had told Joe that I wished to walk away all alone .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 33]: I am afraid -- sore afraid -- that this purpose originated in my sense of the contrast there would be between me and Joe , if we went to the coach together .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 62]: I had pretended with myself that there was nothing of this taint in the arrangement ; but when I went up to my little room on this last night , I felt compelled to admit that it might be so , and had an impulse upon me to go down again and entreat Joe to walk with me in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 4]: I did not .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 41]: All night there were coaches in my broken sleep , going to wrong places instead of to London , and having in the traces , now dogs , now cats , now pigs , now men , -- never horses .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 16]: Fantastic failures of journeys occupied me until the day dawned and the birds were singing .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 28]: Then , I got up and partly dressed , and sat at the window to take a last look out , and in taking it fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 48]: Biddy was astir so early to get my breakfast , that , although I did not sleep at the window an hour , I smelt the smoke of the kitchen fire when I started up with a terrible idea that it must be late in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 30]: But long after that , and long after I had heard the clinking of the teacups and was quite ready , I wanted the resolution to go down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 33]: After all , I remained up there , repeatedly unlocking and unstrapping my small portmanteau and locking and strapping it up again , until Biddy called to me that I was late .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 11]: It was a hurried breakfast with no taste in it .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 27]: I got up from the meal , saying with a sort of briskness , as if it had only just occurred to me , `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 8]: I suppose I must be off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 31]: and then I kissed my sister who was laughing and nodding and shaking in her usual chair , and kissed Biddy , and threw my arms around Joe 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 11]: Then I took up my little portmanteau and walked out .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 36]: The last I saw of them was , when I presently heard a scuffle behind me , and looking back , saw Joe throwing an old shoe after me and Biddy throwing another old shoe .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 28]: I stopped then , to wave my hat , and dear old Joe waved his strong right arm above his head , crying huskily `` Hooroar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 9]: and Biddy put her apron to her face .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 49]: I walked away at a good pace , thinking it was easier to go than I had supposed it would be , and reflecting that it would never have done to have had an old shoe thrown after the coach , in sight of all the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 8]: I whistled and made nothing of going .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 59]: But the village was very peaceful and quiet , and the light mists were solemnly rising , as if to show me the world , and I had been so innocent and little there , and all beyond was so unknown and great , that in a moment with a strong heave and sob I broke into tears .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 35]: It was by the finger-post at the end of the village , and I laid my hand upon it , and said , `` Good by , O my dear , dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 27]: Heaven knows we need never be ashamed of our tears , for they are rain upon the blinding dust of earth , overlying our hard hearts .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 24]: I was better after I had cried than before , -- more sorry , more aware of my own ingratitude , more gentle .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 15]: If I had cried before , I should have had Joe with me then .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 70]: So subdued I was by those tears , and by their breaking out again in the course of the quiet walk , that when I was on the coach , and it was clear of the town , I deliberated with an aching heart whether I would not get down when we changed horses and walk back , and have another evening at home , and a better parting .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 36]: We changed , and I had not made up my mind , and still reflected for my comfort that it would be quite practicable to get down and walk back , when we changed again .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 34]: And while I was occupied with these deliberations , I would fancy an exact resemblance to Joe in some man coming along the road towards us , and my heart would beat high .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 9]: -- As if he could possibly be there !
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 26]: We changed again , and yet again , and it was now too late and too far to go back , and I went on .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 17]: And the mists had all solemnly risen now , and the world lay spread before me .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 13]: This is the end of the first stage of Pip 's expectations .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 18]: Chapter XX The journey from our town to the metropolis was a journey of about five hours .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 37]: It was a little past midday when the four-horse stage-coach by which I was a passenger , got into the ravel of traffic frayed out about the Cross Keys , Wood Street , Cheapside , London .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 59]: We Britons had at that time particularly settled that it was treasonable to doubt our having and our being the best of everything : otherwise , while I was scared by the immensity of London , I think I might have had some faint doubts whether it was not rather ugly , crooked , narrow , and dirty .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 38]: Mr. Jaggers had duly sent me his address ; it was , Little Britain , and he had written after it on his card , `` just out of Smithfield , and close by the coach-office . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 52]: Nevertheless , a hackney-coachman , who seemed to have as many capes to his greasy great-coat as he was years old , packed me up in his coach and hemmed me in with a folding and jingling barrier of steps , as if he were going to take me fifty miles .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 30]: His getting on his box , which I remember to have been decorated with an old weather-stained pea-green hammercloth moth-eaten into rags , was quite a work of time .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 45]: It was a wonderful equipage , with six great coronets outside , and ragged things behind for I do n't know how many footmen to hold on by , and a harrow below them , to prevent amateur footmen from yielding to the temptation .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 57]: I had scarcely had time to enjoy the coach and to think how like a straw-yard it was , and yet how like a rag-shop , and to wonder why the horses ' nose-bags were kept inside , when I observed the coachman beginning to get down , as if we were going to stop presently .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 25]: And stop we presently did , in a gloomy street , at certain offices with an open door , whereon was painted MR. JAGGERS .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 5]: `` How much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 5]: I asked the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 17]: The coachman answered , `` A shilling -- unless you wish to make it more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 12]: I naturally said I had no wish to make it more .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 13]: `` Then it must be a shilling , '' observed the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 10]: `` I do n't want to get into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 5]: I know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 16]: He darkly closed an eye at Mr. Jaggers 's name , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 55]: When he had got his shilling , and had in course of time completed the ascent to his box , and had got away -LRB- which appeared to relieve his mind -RRB- , I went into the front office with my little portmanteau in my hand and asked , Was Mr. Jaggers at home ?
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 10]: `` He is not , '' returned the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 8]: `` He is in Court at present .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 7]: Am I addressing Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 9]: I signified that he was addressing Mr. Pip .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 13]: `` Mr. Jaggers left word , would you wait in his room .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 15]: He could n't say how long he might be , having a case on .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 23]: But it stands to reason , his time being valuable , that he wo n't be longer than he can help . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 21]: With those words , the clerk opened a door , and ushered me into an inner chamber at the back .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 34]: Here , we found a gentleman with one eye , in a velveteen suit and knee-breeches , who wiped his nose with his sleeve on being interrupted in the perusal of the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 13]: `` Go and wait outside , Mike , '' said the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 42]: I began to say that I hoped I was not interrupting , when the clerk shoved this gentleman out with as little ceremony as I ever saw used , and tossing his fur cap out after him , left me alone .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 48]: Mr. Jaggers 's room was lighted by a skylight only , and was a most dismal place ; the skylight , eccentrically pitched like a broken head , and the distorted adjoining houses looking as if they had twisted themselves to peep down at me through it .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 72]: There were not so many papers about , as I should have expected to see ; and there were some odd objects about , that I should not have expected to see , -- such as an old rusty pistol , a sword in a scabbard , several strange-looking boxes and packages , and two dreadful casts on a shelf , of faces peculiarly swollen , and twitchy about the nose .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 45]: Mr. Jaggers 's own high-backed chair was of deadly black horsehair , with rows of brass nails round it , like a coffin ; and I fancied I could see how he leaned back in it , and bit his forefinger at the clients .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 38]: The room was but small , and the clients seemed to have had a habit of backing up against the wall ; the wall , especially opposite to Mr. Jaggers 's chair , being greasy with shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 27]: I recalled , too , that the one-eyed gentleman had shuffled forth against the wall when I was the innocent cause of his being turned out .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 26]: I sat down in the cliental chair placed over against Mr. Jaggers 's chair , and became fascinated by the dismal atmosphere of the place .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 25]: I called to mind that the clerk had the same air of knowing something to everybody else 's disadvantage , as his master had .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 25]: I wondered how many other clerks there were up-stairs , and whether they all claimed to have the same detrimental mastery of their fellow-creatures .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 21]: I wondered what was the history of all the odd litter about the room , and how it came there .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 58]: I wondered whether the two swollen faces were of Mr. Jaggers 's family , and , if he were so unfortunate as to have had a pair of such ill-looking relations , why he stuck them on that dusty perch for the blacks and flies to settle on , instead of giving them a place at home .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 37]: Of course I had no experience of a London summer day , and my spirits may have been oppressed by the hot exhausted air , and by the dust and grit that lay thick on everything .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 38]: But I sat wondering and waiting in Mr. Jaggers 's close room , until I really could not bear the two casts on the shelf above Mr. Jaggers 's chair , and got up and went out .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 33]: When I told the clerk that I would take a turn in the air while I waited , he advised me to go round the corner and I should come into Smithfield .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 29]: So I came into Smithfield ; and the shameful place , being all asmear with filth and fat and blood and foam , seemed to stick to me .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 43]: So , I rubbed it off with all possible speed by turning into a street where I saw the great black dome of Saint Paul 's bulging at me from behind a grim stone building which a bystander said was Newgate Prison .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 49]: Following the wall of the jail , I found the roadway covered with straw to deaden the noise of passing vehicles ; and from this , and from the quantity of people standing about smelling strongly of spirits and beer , I inferred that the trials were on .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 84]: While I looked about me here , an exceedingly dirty and partially drunk minister of justice asked me if I would like to step in and hear a trial or so : informing me that he could give me a front place for half a crown , whence I should command a full view of the Lord Chief Justice in his wig and robes , -- mentioning that awful personage like waxwork , and presently offering him at the reduced price of eighteen-pence .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 100]: As I declined the proposal on the plea of an appointment , he was so good as to take me into a yard and show me where the gallows was kept , and also where people were publicly whipped , and then he showed me the Debtors ' Door , out of which culprits came to be hanged ; heightening the interest of that dreadful portal by giving me to understand that `` four on 'em '' would come out at that door the day after to-morrow at eight in the morning , to be killed in a row .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 67]: This was horrible , and gave me a sickening idea of London ; the more so as the Lord Chief Justice 's proprietor wore -LRB- from his hat down to his boots and up again to his pocket-handkerchief inclusive -RRB- mildewed clothes which had evidently not belonged to him originally , and which I took it into my head he had bought cheap of the executioner .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 14]: Under these circumstances I thought myself well rid of him for a shilling .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 28]: I dropped into the office to ask if Mr. Jaggers had come in yet , and I found he had not , and I strolled out again .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 37]: This time , I made the tour of Little Britain , and turned into Bartholomew Close ; and now I became aware that other people were waiting about for Mr. Jaggers , as well as I .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 55]: There were two men of secret appearance lounging in Bartholomew Close , and thoughtfully fitting their feet into the cracks of the pavement as they talked together , one of whom said to the other when they first passed me , that `` Jaggers would do it if it was to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 62]: There was a knot of three men and two women standing at a corner , and one of the women was crying on her dirty shawl , and the other comforted her by saying , as she pulled her own shawl over her shoulders , `` Jaggers is for him , ` Melia , and what more could you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 81]: There was a red-eyed little Jew who came into the Close while I was loitering there , in company with a second little Jew whom he sent upon an errand ; and while the messenger was gone , I remarked this Jew , who was of a highly excitable temperament , performing a jig of anxiety under a lamp-post and accompanying himself , in a kind of frenzy , with the words , `` O Jaggerth , Jaggerth , Jaggerth !
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 12]: all otherth ith Cag -- Maggerth , give me Jaggerth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 24]: These testimonies to the popularity of my guardian made a deep impression on me , and I admired and wondered more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 30]: At length , as I was looking out at the iron gate of Bartholomew Close into Little Britain , I saw Mr. Jaggers coming across the road towards me .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 22]: All the others who were waiting saw him at the same time , and there was quite a rush at him .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 28]: Mr. Jaggers , putting a hand on my shoulder and walking me on at his side without saying anything to me , addressed himself to his followers .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 9]: First , he took the two secret men .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 22]: `` Now , I have nothing to say to you , '' said Mr. Jaggers , throwing his finger at them .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 11]: `` I want to know no more than I know .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 10]: As to the result , it 's a toss-up .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 11]: I told you from the first it was a toss-up .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 6]: Have you paid Wemmick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 29]: `` We made the money up this morning , sir , '' said one of the men , submissively , while the other perused Mr. Jaggers 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 24]: `` I do n't ask you when you made it up , or where , or whether you made it up at all .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 6]: Has Wemmick got it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 12]: `` Yes , sir , '' said both the men together .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 9]: `` Very well ; then you may go .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 9]: Now , I wo n't have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 15]: said Mr Jaggers , waving his hand at them to put them behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 17]: `` If you say a word to me , I 'll throw up the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 19]: `` We thought , Mr. Jaggers -- '' one of the men began , pulling off his hat .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 16]: `` That 's what I told you not to do , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 4]: `` You thought !
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 11]: I think for you ; that 's enough for you .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 21]: If I want you , I know where to find you ; I do n't want you to find me .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 7]: Now I wo n't have it .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 8]: I wo n't hear a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 25]: The two men looked at one another as Mr. Jaggers waved them behind again , and humbly fell back and were heard no more .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 6]: `` And now you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 30]: said Mr. Jaggers , suddenly stopping , and turning on the two women with the shawls , from whom the three men had meekly separated , -- `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 6]: Amelia , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Jaggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 28]: `` And do you remember , '' retorted Mr. Jaggers , `` that but for me you would n't be here and could n't be here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 7]: `` O yes , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 5]: exclaimed both women together .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 13]: `` Lord bless you , sir , well we knows that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 16]: `` Then why , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` do you come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 7]: `` My Bill , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 5]: the crying woman pleaded .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 9]: `` Now , I tell you what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 5]: `` Once for all .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 17]: If you do n't know that your Bill 's in good hands , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 30]: And if you come here bothering about your Bill , I 'll make an example of both your Bill and you , and let him slip through my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 6]: Have you paid Wemmick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 6]: `` O yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 4]: Every farden . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 11]: Then you have done all you have got to do .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 18]: Say another word -- one single word -- and Wemmick shall give you your money back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 12]: This terrible threat caused the two women to fall off immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 26]: No one remained now but the excitable Jew , who had already raised the skirts of Mr. Jaggers 's coat to his lips several times .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 9]: `` I do n't know this man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 18]: said Mr. Jaggers , in the same devastating strain : `` What does this fellow want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 6]: `` Ma thear Mithter Jaggerth .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 7]: Hown brother to Habraham Latharuth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 6]: `` Who 's he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 8]: `` Let go of my coat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 26]: The suitor , kissing the hem of the garment again before relinquishing it , replied , `` Habraham Latharuth , on thuthpithion of plate . ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 11]: `` You 're too late , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: `` I am over the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 8]: `` Holy father , Mithter Jaggerth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 19]: cried my excitable acquaintance , turning white , `` do n't thay you 're again Habraham Latharuth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 18]: `` I am , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` and there 's an end of it .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 7]: Get out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 4]: `` Mithter Jaggerth !
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 4]: Half a moment !
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 19]: My hown cuthe n'th gone to Mithter Wemmick at thith prethent minute , to hoffer him hany termth .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 3]: Mithter Jaggerth !
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 7]: Half a quarter of a moment !
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 22]: If you 'd have the condethenthun to be bought off from the t ` other thide -- at hany thuperior prithe !
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 5]: -- money no object !
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 8]: -- Mithter Jaggerth -- Mithter -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 24]: My guardian threw his supplicant off with supreme indifference , and left him dancing on the pavement as if it were red hot .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 25]: Without further interruption , we reached the front office , where we found the clerk and the man in velveteen with the fur cap .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 22]: `` Here 's Mike , '' said the clerk , getting down from his stool , and approaching Mr. Jaggers confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 42]: said Mr. Jaggers , turning to the man , who was pulling a lock of hair in the middle of his forehead , like the Bull in Cock Robin pulling at the bell-rope ; `` your man comes on this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 43]: `` Well , Mas ' r Jaggers , '' returned Mike , in the voice of a sufferer from a constitutional cold ; `` arter a deal o ' trouble , I 've found one , sir , as might do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 9]: `` What is he prepared to swear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 31]: `` Well , Mas ' r Jaggers , '' said Mike , wiping his nose on his fur cap this time ; `` in a general way , anythink . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 7]: Mr. Jaggers suddenly became most irate .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 41]: `` Now , I warned you before , '' said he , throwing his forefinger at the terrified client , `` that if you ever presumed to talk in that way here , I 'd make an example of you .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 12]: You infernal scoundrel , how dare you tell ME that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 19]: The client looked scared , but bewildered too , as if he were unconscious what he had done .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 4]: `` Spooney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 17]: said the clerk , in a low voice , giving him a stir with his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 4]: `` Soft Head !
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 9]: Need you say it face to face ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 41]: `` Now , I ask you , you blundering booby , '' said my guardian , very sternly , `` once more and for the last time , what the man you have brought here is prepared to swear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 47]: Mike looked hard at my guardian , as if he were trying to learn a lesson from his face , and slowly replied , `` Ayther to character , or to having been in his company and never left him all the night in question . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 6]: `` Now , be careful .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 10]: In what station of life is this man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 58]: Mike looked at his cap , and looked at the floor , and looked at the ceiling , and looked at the clerk , and even looked at me , before beginning to reply in a nervous manner , `` We 've dressed him up like -- '' when my guardian blustered out , -- `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 7]: You WILL , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 5]: -LRB- `` Spooney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 10]: added the clerk again , with another stir . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 23]: After some helpless casting about , Mike brightened and began again : -- `` He is dressed like a ` spectable pieman .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 7]: A sort of a pastry-cook . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 6]: `` Is he here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 4]: asked my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 20]: `` I left him , '' said Mike , `` a setting on some doorsteps round the corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 14]: `` Take him past that window , and let me see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 8]: The window indicated was the office window .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 42]: We all three went to it , behind the wire blind , and presently saw the client go by in an accidental manner , with a murderous-looking tall individual , in a short suit of white linen and a paper cap .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 27]: This guileless confectioner was not by any means sober , and had a black eye in the green stage of recovery , which was painted over .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 38]: `` Tell him to take his witness away directly , '' said my guardian to the clerk , in extreme disgust , `` and ask him what he means by bringing such a fellow as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 49]: My guardian then took me into his own room , and while he lunched , standing , from a sandwich-box and a pocket-flask of sherry -LRB- he seemed to bully his very sandwich as he ate it -RRB- , informed me what arrangements he had made for me .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 66]: I was to go to `` Barnard 's Inn , '' to young Mr. Pocket 's rooms , where a bed had been sent in for my accommodation ; I was to remain with young Mr. Pocket until Monday ; on Monday I was to go with him to his father 's house on a visit , that I might try how I liked it .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 62]: Also , I was told what my allowance was to be , -- it was a very liberal one , -- and had handed to me from one of my guardian 's drawers , the cards of certain tradesmen with whom I was to deal for all kinds of clothes , and such other things as I could in reason want .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 59]: `` You will find your credit good , Mr. Pip , '' said my guardian , whose flask of sherry smelt like a whole caskful , as he hastily refreshed himself , `` but I shall by this means be able to check your bills , and to pull you up if I find you outrunning the constable .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 17]: Of course you 'll go wrong somehow , but that 's no fault of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 23]: After I had pondered a little over this encouraging sentiment , I asked Mr. Jaggers if I could send for a coach ?
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 26]: He said it was not worth while , I was so near my destination ; Wemmick should walk round with me , if I pleased .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 13]: I then found that Wemmick was the clerk in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 32]: Another clerk was rung down from up stairs to take his place while he was out , and I accompanied him into the street , after shaking hands with my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 61]: We found a new set of people lingering outside , but Wemmick made a way among them by saying coolly yet decisively , `` I tell you it 's no use ; he wo n't have a word to say to one of you ; '' and we soon got clear of them , and went on side by side .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 59]: Chapter XXI Casting my eyes on Mr. Wemmick as we went along , to see what he was like in the light of day , I found him to be a dry man , rather short in stature , with a square wooden face , whose expression seemed to have been imperfectly chipped out with a dull-edged chisel .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 34]: There were some marks in it that might have been dimples , if the material had been softer and the instrument finer , but which , as it was , were only dints .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 29]: The chisel had made three or four of these attempts at embellishment over his nose , but had given them up without an effort to smooth them off .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 54]: I judged him to be a bachelor from the frayed condition of his linen , and he appeared to have sustained a good many bereavements ; for he wore at least four mourning rings , besides a brooch representing a lady and a weeping willow at a tomb with an urn on it .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 27]: I noticed , too , that several rings and seals hung at his watch-chain , as if he were quite laden with remembrances of departed friends .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 20]: He had glittering eyes , -- small , keen , and black , -- and thin wide mottled lips .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 18]: He had had them , to the best of my belief , from forty to fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 10]: `` So you were never in London before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 6]: said Mr. Wemmick to me .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 18]: `` No , '' said I. `` I was new here once , '' said Mr. Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 8]: `` Rum to think of now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 10]: `` You are well acquainted with it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 10]: `` Why , yes , '' said Mr. Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 9]: `` I know the moves of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 9]: `` Is it a very wicked place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 14]: I asked , more for the sake of saying something than for information .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 13]: `` You may get cheated , robbed , and murdered in London .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 16]: But there are plenty of people anywhere , who 'll do that for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 22]: `` If there is bad blood between you and them , '' said I , to soften it off a little .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 3]: `` O !
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 22]: I do n't know about bad blood , '' returned Mr. Wemmick ; `` there 's not much bad blood about .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 16]: They 'll do it , if there 's anything to be got by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 7]: `` That makes it worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 6]: `` You think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 4]: returned Mr. Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 11]: `` Much about the same , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 35]: He wore his hat on the back of his head , and looked straight before him : walking in a self-contained way as if there were nothing in the streets to claim his attention .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 18]: His mouth was such a post-office of a mouth that he had a mechanical appearance of smiling .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 29]: We had got to the top of Holborn Hill before I knew that it was merely a mechanical appearance , and that he was not smiling at all .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 11]: `` Do you know where Mr. Matthew Pocket lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 5]: I asked Mr. Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said he , nodding in the direction .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 9]: `` At Hammersmith , west of London . ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: `` Is that far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 5]: Say five miles . ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 7]: `` Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 10]: `` Why , you 're a regular cross-examiner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 12]: said Mr. Wemmick , looking at me with an approving air .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 7]: `` Yes , I know him .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 5]: I know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 52]: There was an air of toleration or depreciation about his utterance of these words that rather depressed me ; and I was still looking sideways at his block of a face in search of any encouraging note to the text , when he said here we were at Barnard 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 38]: My depression was not alleviated by the announcement , for , I had supposed that establishment to be an hotel kept by Mr. Barnard , to which the Blue Boar in our town was a mere public-house .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 37]: Whereas I now found Barnard to be a disembodied spirit , or a fiction , and his inn the dingiest collection of shabby buildings ever squeezed together in a rank corner as a club for Tom-cats .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 29]: We entered this haven through a wicket-gate , and were disgorged by an introductory passage into a melancholy little square that looked to me like a flat burying-ground .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 44]: I thought it had the most dismal trees in it , and the most dismal sparrows , and the most dismal cats , and the most dismal houses -LRB- in number half a dozen or so -RRB- , that I had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 92]: I thought the windows of the sets of chambers into which those houses were divided were in every stage of dilapidated blind and curtain , crippled flower-pot , cracked glass , dusty decay , and miserable makeshift ; while To Let , To Let , To Let , glared at me from empty rooms , as if no new wretches ever came there , and the vengeance of the soul of Barnard were being slowly appeased by the gradual suicide of the present occupants and their unholy interment under the gravel .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 34]: A frowzy mourning of soot and smoke attired this forlorn creation of Barnard , and it had strewn ashes on its head , and was undergoing penance and humiliation as a mere dust-hole .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 60]: Thus far my sense of sight ; while dry rot and wet rot and all the silent rots that rot in neglected roof and cellar , -- rot of rat and mouse and bug and coaching-stables near at hand besides -- addressed themselves faintly to my sense of smell , and moaned , `` Try Barnard 's Mixture . ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 22]: So imperfect was this realization of the first of my great expectations , that I looked in dismay at Mr. Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 15]: said he , mistaking me ; `` the retirement reminds you of the country .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 6]: So it does me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 63]: He led me into a corner and conducted me up a flight of stairs , -- which appeared to me to be slowly collapsing into sawdust , so that one of those days the upper lodgers would look out at their doors and find themselves without the means of coming down , -- to a set of chambers on the top floor .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 25]: MR. POCKET , JUN. , was painted on the door , and there was a label on the letter-box , `` Return shortly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 15]: `` He hardly thought you 'd come so soon , '' Mr. Wemmick explained .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 10]: `` You do n't want me any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 30]: `` No , thank you , '' said I. `` As I keep the cash , '' Mr. Wemmick observed , `` we shall most likely meet pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 4]: Good day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 5]: `` Good day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 22]: I put out my hand , and Mr. Wemmick at first looked at it as if he thought I wanted something .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 18]: Then he looked at me , and said , correcting himself , -- `` To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 10]: You 're in the habit of shaking hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 19]: I was rather confused , thinking it must be out of the London fashion , but said yes .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 10]: `` I have got so out of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 10]: said Mr. Wemmick , -- `` except at last .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 12]: Very glad , I 'm sure , to make your acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 4]: Good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 37]: When we had shaken hands and he was gone , I opened the staircase window and had nearly beheaded myself , for , the lines had rotted away , and it came down like the guillotine .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 14]: Happily it was so quick that I had not put my head out .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 38]: After this escape , I was content to take a foggy view of the Inn through the window 's encrusting dirt , and to stand dolefully looking out , saying to myself that London was decidedly overrated .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 55]: Mr. Pocket , Junior 's , idea of Shortly was not mine , for I had nearly maddened myself with looking out for half an hour , and had written my name with my finger several times in the dirt of every pane in the window , before I heard footsteps on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 29]: Gradually there arose before me the hat , head , neckcloth , waistcoat , trousers , boots , of a member of society of about my own standing .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 22]: He had a paper-bag under each arm and a pottle of strawberries in one hand , and was out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 5]: `` Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 5]: `` Mr. Pocket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 7]: said I. `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 32]: `` I am extremely sorry ; but I knew there was a coach from your part of the country at midday , and I thought you would come by that one .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 52]: The fact is , I have been out on your account , -- not that that is any excuse , -- for I thought , coming from the country , you might like a little fruit after dinner , and I went to Covent Garden Market to get it good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 20]: For a reason that I had , I felt as if my eyes would start out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 15]: I acknowledged his attention incoherently , and began to think this was a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 6]: said Mr. Pocket , Junior .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: `` This door sticks so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 32]: As he was fast making jam of his fruit by wrestling with the door while the paper-bags were under his arms , I begged him to allow me to hold them .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 21]: He relinquished them with an agreeable smile , and combated with the door as if it were a wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 28]: It yielded so suddenly at last , that he staggered back upon me , and I staggered back upon the opposite door , and we both laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 24]: But still I felt as if my eyes must start out of my head , and as if this must be a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 12]: `` Pray come in , '' said Mr. Pocket , Junior .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 8]: `` Allow me to lead the way .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 21]: I am rather bare here , but I hope you 'll be able to make out tolerably well till Monday .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 27]: My father thought you would get on more agreeably through to-morrow with me than with him , and might like to take a walk about London .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 14]: I am sure I shall be very happy to show London to you .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 46]: As to our table , you wo n't find that bad , I hope , for it will be supplied from our coffee-house here , and -LRB- it is only right I should add -RRB- at your expense , such being Mr. Jaggers 's directions .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 46]: As to our lodging , it 's not by any means splendid , because I have my own bread to earn , and my father has n't anything to give me , and I should n't be willing to take it , if he had .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 27]: This is our sitting-room , -- just such chairs and tables and carpet and so forth , you see , as they could spare from home .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 23]: You must n't give me credit for the tablecloth and spoons and castors , because they come for you from the coffee-house .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 15]: This is my little bedroom ; rather musty , but Barnard 's is musty .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 35]: This is your bedroom ; the furniture 's hired for the occasion , but I trust it will answer the purpose ; if you should want anything , I 'll go and fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 22]: The chambers are retired , and we shall be alone together , but we sha n't fight , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 18]: But dear me , I beg your pardon , you 're holding the fruit all this time .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 9]: Pray let me take these bags from you .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 6]: I am quite ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 57]: As I stood opposite to Mr. Pocket , Junior , delivering him the bags , One , Two , I saw the starting appearance come into his own eyes that I knew to be in mine , and he said , falling back , -- `` Lord bless me , you 're the prowling boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 16]: `` And you , '' said I , `` are the pale young gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 24]: Chapter XXII The pale young gentleman and I stood contemplating one another in Barnard 's Inn , until we both burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 9]: `` The idea of its being you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 9]: `` The idea of its being you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 14]: said I. And then we contemplated one another afresh , and laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 42]: said the pale young gentleman , reaching out his hand good-humoredly , `` it 's all over now , I hope , and it will be magnanimous in you if you 'll forgive me for having knocked you about so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 29]: I derived from this speech that Mr. Herbert Pocket -LRB- for Herbert was the pale young gentleman 's name -RRB- still rather confounded his intention with his execution .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 13]: But I made a modest reply , and we shook hands warmly .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 14]: `` You had n't come into your good fortune at that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 4]: said Herbert Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 22]: `` No , '' said I. `` No , '' he acquiesced : `` I heard it had happened very lately .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: I was rather on the lookout for good fortune then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 18]: Miss Havisham had sent for me , to see if she could take a fancy to me .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 15]: But she could n't , -- at all events , she did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 14]: I thought it polite to remark that I was surprised to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 15]: `` Bad taste , '' said Herbert , laughing , `` but a fact .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 42]: Yes , she had sent for me on a trial visit , and if I had come out of it successfully , I suppose I should have been provided for ; perhaps I should have been what-you-may-called it to Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 7]: I asked , with sudden gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 30]: He was arranging his fruit in plates while we talked , which divided his attention , and was the cause of his having made this lapse of a word .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 13]: `` Affianced , '' he explained , still busy with the fruit .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 3]: `` Betrothed .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 2]: Engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 5]: What 's - his-named .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 7]: Any word of that sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 9]: `` How did you bear your disappointment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: said he , `` I did n't care much for it .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 6]: She 's a Tartar . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 5]: `` Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 14]: `` I do n't say no to that , but I meant Estella .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 31]: That girl 's hard and haughty and capricious to the last degree , and has been brought up by Miss Havisham to wreak revenge on all the male sex . ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 10]: `` What relation is she to Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 7]: `` None , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 5]: `` Only adopted . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 12]: `` Why should she wreak revenge on all the male sex ?
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 4]: What revenge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 7]: `` Lord , Mr. Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 10]: `` No , '' said I. `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 13]: It 's quite a story , and shall be saved till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 13]: And now let me take the liberty of asking you a question .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 10]: How did you come there , that day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 29]: I told him , and he was attentive until I had finished , and then burst out laughing again , and asked me if I was sore afterwards ?
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 19]: I did n't ask him if he was , for my conviction on that point was perfectly established .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 11]: `` Mr. Jaggers is your guardian , I understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 4]: he went on .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 24]: `` You know he is Miss Havisham 's man of business and solicitor , and has her confidence when nobody else has ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 12]: This was bringing me -LRB- I felt -RRB- towards dangerous ground .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 53]: I answered with a constraint I made no attempt to disguise , that I had seen Mr. Jaggers in Miss Havisham 's house on the very day of our combat , but never at any other time , and that I believed he had no recollection of having ever seen me there .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 24]: `` He was so obliging as to suggest my father for your tutor , and he called on my father to propose it .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 14]: Of course he knew about my father from his connection with Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 30]: My father is Miss Havisham 's cousin ; not that that implies familiar intercourse between them , for he is a bad courtier and will not propitiate her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 15]: Herbert Pocket had a frank and easy way with him that was very taking .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 40]: I had never seen any one then , and I have never seen any one since , who more strongly expressed to me , in every look and tone , a natural incapacity to do anything secret and mean .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 29]: There was something wonderfully hopeful about his general air , and something that at the same time whispered to me he would never be very successful or rich .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: I do n't know how this was .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 26]: I became imbued with the notion on that first occasion before we sat down to dinner , but I can not define by what means .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 34]: He was still a pale young gentleman , and had a certain conquered languor about him in the midst of his spirits and briskness , that did not seem indicative of natural strength .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 20]: He had not a handsome face , but it was better than handsome : being extremely amiable and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 34]: His figure was a little ungainly , as in the days when my knuckles had taken such liberties with it , but it looked as if it would always be light and young .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 44]: Whether Mr. Trabb 's local work would have sat more gracefully on him than on me , may be a question ; but I am conscious that he carried off his rather old clothes much better than I carried off my new suit .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 23]: As he was so communicative , I felt that reserve on my part would be a bad return unsuited to our years .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 22]: I therefore told him my small story , and laid stress on my being forbidden to inquire who my benefactor was .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 55]: I further mentioned that as I had been brought up a blacksmith in a country place , and knew very little of the ways of politeness , I would take it as a great kindness in him if he would give me a hint whenever he saw me at a loss or going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 22]: `` With pleasure , '' said he , `` though I venture to prophesy that you 'll want very few hints .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 21]: I dare say we shall be often together , and I should like to banish any needless restraint between us .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 21]: Will you do me the favour to begin at once to call me by my Christian name , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 8]: I thanked him and said I would .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 12]: I informed him in exchange that my Christian name was Philip .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 90]: `` I do n't take to Philip , '' said he , smiling , `` for it sounds like a moral boy out of the spelling-book , who was so lazy that he fell into a pond , or so fat that he could n't see out of his eyes , or so avaricious that he locked up his cake till the mice ate it , or so determined to go a bird 's - nesting that he got himself eaten by bears who lived handy in the neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 8]: I tell you what I should like .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 20]: We are so harmonious , and you have been a blacksmith , -- -- would you mind it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 23]: `` I should n't mind anything that you propose , '' I answered , `` but I do n't understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 10]: `` Would you mind Handel for a familiar name ?
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 16]: There 's a charming piece of music by Handel , called the Harmonious Blacksmith . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 9]: `` I should like it very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 47]: `` Then , my dear Handel , '' said he , turning round as the door opened , `` here is the dinner , and I must beg of you to take the top of the table , because the dinner is of your providing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 18]: This I would not hear of , so he took the top , and I faced him .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 46]: It was a nice little dinner , -- seemed to me then a very Lord Mayor 's Feast , -- and it acquired additional relish from being eaten under those independent circumstances , with no old people by , and with London all around us .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 132]: This again was heightened by a certain gypsy character that set the banquet off ; for while the table was , as Mr. Pumblechook might have said , the lap of luxury , -- being entirely furnished forth from the coffee-house , -- the circumjacent region of sitting-room was of a comparatively pastureless and shifty character ; imposing on the waiter the wandering habits of putting the covers on the floor -LRB- where he fell over them -RRB- , the melted butter in the arm-chair , the bread on the bookshelves , the cheese in the coal-scuttle , and the boiled fowl into my bed in the next room , -- where I found much of its parsley and butter in a state of congelation when I retired for the night .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 24]: All this made the feast delightful , and when the waiter was not there to watch me , my pleasure was without alloy .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 23]: We had made some progress in the dinner , when I reminded Herbert of his promise to tell me about Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: `` True , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: `` I 'll redeem it at once .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 53]: Let me introduce the topic , Handel , by mentioning that in London it is not the custom to put the knife in the mouth , -- for fear of accidents , -- and that while the fork is reserved for that use , it is not put further in than necessary .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 18]: It is scarcely worth mentioning , only it 's as well to do as other people do .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 13]: Also , the spoon is not generally used over-hand , but under .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 5]: This has two advantages .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 37]: You get at your mouth better -LRB- which after all is the object -RRB- , and you save a good deal of the attitude of opening oysters , on the part of the right elbow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 20]: He offered these friendly suggestions in such a lively way , that we both laughed and I scarcely blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 12]: `` Now , '' he pursued , `` concerning Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 12]: Miss Havisham , you must know , was a spoilt child .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 16]: Her mother died when she was a baby , and her father denied her nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 19]: Her father was a country gentleman down in your part of the world , and was a brewer .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 42]: I do n't know why it should be a crack thing to be a brewer ; but it is indisputable that while you can not possibly be genteel and bake , you may be as genteel as never was and brew .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 7]: You see it every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 14]: `` Yet a gentleman may not keep a public-house ; may he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 21]: said I. `` Not on any account , '' returned Herbert ; `` but a public-house may keep a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 9]: Mr. Havisham was very rich and very proud .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 6]: So was his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 9]: `` Miss Havisham was an only child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 3]: I hazarded .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 11]: `` Stop a moment , I am coming to that .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 14]: No , she was not an only child ; she had a half-brother .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 14]: Her father privately married again -- his cook , I rather think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 19]: `` I thought he was proud , '' said I. `` My good Handel , so he was .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 20]: He married his second wife privately , because he was proud , and in course of time she died .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 37]: When she was dead , I apprehend he first told his daughter what he had done , and then the son became a part of the family , residing in the house you are acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 21]: As the son grew a young man , he turned out riotous , extravagant , undutiful , -- altogether bad .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 31]: At last his father disinherited him ; but he softened when he was dying , and left him well off , though not nearly so well off as Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 46]: -- Take another glass of wine , and excuse my mentioning that society as a body does not expect one to be so strictly conscientious in emptying one 's glass , as to turn it bottom upwards with the rim on one 's nose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 15]: I had been doing this , in an excess of attention to his recital .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 7]: I thanked him , and apologized .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 12]: He said , `` Not at all , '' and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 20]: `` Miss Havisham was now an heiress , and you may suppose was looked after as a great match .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 23]: Her half-brother had now ample means again , but what with debts and what with new madness wasted them most fearfully again .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 40]: There were stronger differences between him and her than there had been between him and his father , and it is suspected that he cherished a deep and mortal grudge against her as having influenced the father 's anger .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 34]: Now , I come to the cruel part of the story , -- merely breaking off , my dear Handel , to remark that a dinner-napkin will not go into a tumbler . ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 18]: Why I was trying to pack mine into my tumbler , I am wholly unable to say .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 30]: I only know that I found myself , with a perseverance worthy of a much better cause , making the most strenuous exertions to compress it within those limits .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 26]: Again I thanked him and apologized , and again he said in the cheerfullest manner , `` Not at all , I am sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 3]: and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 34]: `` There appeared upon the scene -- say at the races , or the public balls , or anywhere else you like -- a certain man , who made love to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 44]: I never saw him -LRB- for this happened five-and-twenty years ago , before you and I were , Handel -RRB- , but I have heard my father mention that he was a showy man , and the kind of man for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 56]: But that he was not to be , without ignorance or prejudice , mistaken for a gentleman , my father most strongly asseverates ; because it is a principle of his that no man who was not a true gentleman at heart ever was , since the world began , a true gentleman in manner .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 30]: He says , no varnish can hide the grain of the wood ; and that the more varnish you put on , the more the grain will express itself .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 15]: This man pursued Miss Havisham closely , and professed to be devoted to her .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 30]: I believe she had not shown much susceptibility up to that time ; but all the susceptibility she possessed certainly came out then , and she passionately loved him .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 10]: There is no doubt that she perfectly idolized him .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 68]: He practised on her affection in that systematic way , that he got great sums of money from her , and he induced her to buy her brother out of a share in the brewery -LRB- which had been weakly left him by his father -RRB- at an immense price , on the plea that when he was her husband he must hold and manage it all .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 30]: Your guardian was not at that time in Miss Havisham 's counsels , and she was too haughty and too much in love to be advised by any one .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 25]: Her relations were poor and scheming , with the exception of my father ; he was poor enough , but not time-serving or jealous .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 30]: The only independent one among them , he warned her that she was doing too much for this man , and was placing herself too unreservedly in his power .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 29]: She took the first opportunity of angrily ordering my father out of the house , in his presence , and my father has never seen her since . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 39]: I thought of her having said , `` Matthew will come and see me at last when I am laid dead upon that table ; '' and I asked Herbert whether his father was so inveterate against her ?
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 64]: `` It 's not that , '' said he , `` but she charged him , in the presence of her intended husband , with being disappointed in the hope of fawning upon her for his own advancement , and , if he were to go to her now , it would look true -- even to him -- and even to her .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 12]: To return to the man and make an end of him .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 25]: The marriage day was fixed , the wedding dresses were bought , the wedding tour was planned out , the wedding guests were invited .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 9]: The day came , but not the bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 26]: He wrote her a letter -- '' `` Which she received , '' I struck in , `` when she was dressing for her marriage ?
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 7]: At twenty minutes to nine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 23]: `` At the hour and minute , '' said Herbert , nodding , `` at which she afterwards stopped all the clocks .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 28]: What was in it , further than that it most heartlessly broke the marriage off , I ca n't tell you , because I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 37]: When she recovered from a bad illness that she had , she laid the whole place waste , as you have seen it , and she has never since looked upon the light of day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 8]: `` Is that all the story ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 7]: I asked , after considering it .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 56]: `` All I know of it ; and indeed I only know so much , through piecing it out for myself ; for my father always avoids it , and , even when Miss Havisham invited me to go there , told me no more of it than it was absolutely requisite I should understand .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 7]: But I have forgotten one thing .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 38]: It has been supposed that the man to whom she gave her misplaced confidence acted throughout in concert with her half-brother ; that it was a conspiracy between them ; and that they shared the profits . ''
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 44]: `` I wonder he did n't marry her and get all the property , '' said I. `` He may have been married already , and her cruel mortification may have been a part of her half-brother 's scheme , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 3]: `` Mind !
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 7]: I do n't know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 9]: `` What became of the two men ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 9]: I asked , after again considering the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 19]: `` They fell into deeper shame and degradation -- if there can be deeper -- and ruin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 7]: `` Are they alive now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 17]: `` You said just now that Estella was not related to Miss Havisham , but adopted .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 4]: When adopted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 5]: Herbert shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 17]: `` There has always been an Estella , since I have heard of a Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 5]: I know no more .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 28]: And now , Handel , '' said he , finally throwing off the story as it were , `` there is a perfectly open understanding between us .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 12]: All that I know about Miss Havisham , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 16]: `` And all that I know , '' I retorted , `` you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 6]: `` I fully believe it .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 13]: So there can be no competition or perplexity between you and me .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 61]: And as to the condition on which you hold your advancement in life , -- namely , that you are not to inquire or discuss to whom you owe it , -- you may be very sure that it will never be encroached upon , or even approached , by me , or by any one belonging to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 36]: In truth , he said this with so much delicacy , that I felt the subject done with , even though I should be under his father 's roof for years and years to come .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 32]: Yet he said it with so much meaning , too , that I felt he as perfectly understood Miss Havisham to be my benefactress , as I understood the fact myself .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 51]: It had not occurred to me before , that he had led up to the theme for the purpose of clearing it out of our way ; but we were so much the lighter and easier for having broached it , that I now perceived this to be the case .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 22]: We were very gay and sociable , and I asked him , in the course of conversation , what he was ?
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 14]: He replied , `` A capitalist , -- an Insurer of Ships . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 30]: I suppose he saw me glancing about the room in search of some tokens of Shipping , or capital , for he added , `` In the City . ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 46]: I had grand ideas of the wealth and importance of Insurers of Ships in the City , and I began to think with awe of having laid a young Insurer on his back , blackened his enterprising eye , and cut his responsible head open .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 25]: But again there came upon me , for my relief , that odd impression that Herbert Pocket would never be very successful or rich .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 15]: `` I shall not rest satisfied with merely employing my capital in insuring ships .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 16]: I shall buy up some good Life Assurance shares , and cut into the Direction .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 11]: I shall also do a little in the mining way .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 18]: None of these things will interfere with my chartering a few thousand tons on my own account .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 37]: I think I shall trade , '' said he , leaning back in his chair , `` to the East Indies , for silks , shawls , spices , dyes , drugs , and precious woods .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 7]: It 's an interesting trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 8]: `` And the profits are large ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 6]: said I. `` Tremendous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 16]: I wavered again , and began to think here were greater expectations than my own .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 37]: `` I think I shall trade , also , '' said he , putting his thumbs in his waist -- coat pockets , `` to the West Indies , for sugar , tobacco , and rum .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 11]: Also to Ceylon , specially for elephants ' tusks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 21]: `` You will want a good many ships , '' said I. `` A perfect fleet , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 23]: Quite overpowered by the magnificence of these transactions , I asked him where the ships he insured mostly traded to at present ?
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 12]: `` I have n't begun insuring yet , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 8]: `` I am looking about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 13]: Somehow , that pursuit seemed more in keeping with Barnard 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 14]: I said -LRB- in a tone of conviction -RRB- , `` Ah-h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 12]: I am in a counting-house , and looking about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 7]: `` Is a counting-house profitable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 16]: `` To -- do you mean to the young fellow who 's in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 6]: he asked , in reply .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 7]: `` Yes ; to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 10]: `` Why , n-no ; not to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 16]: He said this with the air of one carefully reckoning up and striking a balance .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 5]: `` Not directly profitable .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 19]: That is , it does n't pay me anything , and I have to -- keep myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 36]: This certainly had not a profitable appearance , and I shook my head as if I would imply that it would be difficult to lay by much accumulative capital from such a source of income .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 18]: `` But the thing is , '' said Herbert Pocket , `` that you look about you .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 6]: That 's the grand thing .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 16]: You are in a counting-house , you know , and you look about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 33]: It struck me as a singular implication that you could n't be out of a counting-house , you know , and look about you ; but I silently deferred to his experience .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 17]: `` Then the time comes , '' said Herbert , `` when you see your opening .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 22]: And you go in , and you swoop upon it and you make your capital , and then there you are !
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 18]: When you have once made your capital , you have nothing to do but employ it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 17]: This was very like his way of conducting that encounter in the garden ; very like .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 19]: His manner of bearing his poverty , too , exactly corresponded to his manner of bearing that defeat .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 24]: It seemed to me that he took all blows and buffets now with just the same air as he had taken mine then .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 37]: It was evident that he had nothing around him but the simplest necessaries , for everything that I remarked upon turned out to have been sent in on my account from the coffee-house or somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 31]: Yet , having already made his fortune in his own mind , he was so unassuming with it that I felt quite grateful to him for not being puffed up .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 17]: It was a pleasant addition to his naturally pleasant ways , and we got on famously .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 56]: In the evening we went out for a walk in the streets , and went half-price to the Theatre ; and next day we went to church at Westminster Abbey , and in the afternoon we walked in the Parks ; and I wondered who shod all the horses there , and wished Joe did .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 21]: On a moderate computation , it was many months , that Sunday , since I had left Joe and Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 20]: The space interposed between myself and them partook of that expansion , and our marshes were any distance off .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 38]: That I could have been at our old church in my old church-going clothes , on the very last Sunday that ever was , seemed a combination of impossibilities , geographical and social , solar and lunar .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 74]: Yet in the London streets so crowded with people and so brilliantly lighted in the dusk of evening , there were depressing hints of reproaches for that I had put the poor old kitchen at home so far away ; and in the dead of night , the footsteps of some incapable impostor of a porter mooning about Barnard 's Inn , under pretence of watching it , fell hollow on my heart .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 37]: On the Monday morning at a quarter before nine , Herbert went to the counting-house to report himself , -- to look about him , too , I suppose , -- and I bore him company .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 25]: He was to come away in an hour or two to attend me to Hammersmith , and I was to wait about for him .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 41]: It appeared to me that the eggs from which young Insurers were hatched were incubated in dust and heat , like the eggs of ostriches , judging from the places to which those incipient giants repaired on a Monday morning .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 52]: Nor did the counting-house where Herbert assisted , show in my eyes as at all a good Observatory ; being a back second floor up a yard , of a grimy presence in all particulars , and with a look into another back second floor , rather than a look out .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 50]: I waited about until it was noon , and I went upon ` Change , and I saw fluey men sitting there under the bills about shipping , whom I took to be great merchants , though I could n't understand why they should all be out of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 64]: When Herbert came , we went and had lunch at a celebrated house which I then quite venerated , but now believe to have been the most abject superstition in Europe , and where I could not help noticing , even then , that there was much more gravy on the tablecloths and knives and waiters ' clothes , than in the steaks .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 40]: This collation disposed of at a moderate price -LRB- considering the grease , which was not charged for -RRB- , we went back to Barnard 's Inn and got my little portmanteau , and then took coach for Hammersmith .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 25]: We arrived there at two or three o'clock in the afternoon , and had very little way to walk to Mr. Pocket 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 27]: Lifting the latch of a gate , we passed direct into a little garden overlooking the river , where Mr. Pocket 's children were playing about .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 41]: And unless I deceive myself on a point where my interests or prepossessions are certainly not concerned , I saw that Mr. and Mrs. Pocket 's children were not growing up or being brought up , but were tumbling up .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 37]: Mrs. Pocket was sitting on a garden chair under a tree , reading , with her legs upon another garden chair ; and Mrs. Pocket 's two nurse-maids were looking about them while the children played .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 15]: `` Mamma , '' said Herbert , `` this is young Mr. Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 13]: Upon which Mrs. Pocket received me with an appearance of amiable dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 49]: `` Master Alick and Miss Jane , '' cried one of the nurses to two of the children , `` if you go a bouncing up against them bushes you 'll fall over into the river and be drownded , and what 'll your pa say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 32]: At the same time this nurse picked up Mrs. Pocket 's handkerchief , and said , `` If that do n't make six times you 've dropped it , Mum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 27]: Upon which Mrs. Pocket laughed and said , `` Thank you , Flopson , '' and settling herself in one chair only , resumed her book .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 50]: Her countenance immediately assumed a knitted and intent expression as if she had been reading for a week , but before she could have read half a dozen lines , she fixed her eyes upon me , and said , `` I hope your mamma is quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 57]: This unexpected inquiry put me into such a difficulty that I began saying in the absurdest way that if there had been any such person I had no doubt she would have been quite well and would have been very much obliged and would have sent her compliments , when the nurse came to my rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 17]: she cried , picking up the pocket-handkerchief , `` if that do n't make seven times !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 12]: What ARE you a doing of this afternoon , Mum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 50]: Mrs. Pocket received her property , at first with a look of unutterable surprise as if she had never seen it before , and then with a laugh of recognition , and said , `` Thank you , Flopson , '' and forgot me , and went on reading .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 29]: I found , now I had leisure to count them , that there were no fewer than six little Pockets present , in various stages of tumbling up .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 23]: I had scarcely arrived at the total when a seventh was heard , as in the region of air , wailing dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 8]: `` If there ai n't Baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 10]: said Flopson , appearing to think it most surprising .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 8]: `` Make haste up , Millers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 38]: Millers , who was the other nurse , retired into the house , and by degrees the child 's wailing was hushed and stopped , as if it were a young ventriloquist with something in its mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 19]: Mrs. Pocket read all the time , and I was curious to know what the book could be .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 75]: We were waiting , I supposed , for Mr. Pocket to come out to us ; at any rate we waited there , and so I had an opportunity of observing the remarkable family phenomenon that whenever any of the children strayed near Mrs. Pocket in their play , they always tripped themselves up and tumbled over her , -- always very much to her momentary astonishment , and their own more enduring lamentation .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 74]: I was at a loss to account for this surprising circumstance , and could not help giving my mind to speculations about it , until by and by Millers came down with the baby , which baby was handed to Flopson , which Flopson was handing it to Mrs. Pocket , when she too went fairly head foremost over Mrs. Pocket , baby and all , and was caught by Herbert and myself .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 7]: `` Gracious me , Flopson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 18]: said Mrs. Pocket , looking off her book for a moment , `` everybody 's tumbling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 9]: `` Gracious you , indeed , Mum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 17]: returned Flopson , very red in the face ; `` what have you got there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 8]: `` I got here , Flopson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 11]: `` Why , if it ai n't your footstool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: cried Flopson .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 18]: `` And if you keep it under your skirts like that , who 's to help tumbling ?
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 2]: Here !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 13]: Take the baby , Mum , and give me your book . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 26]: Mrs. Pocket acted on the advice , and inexpertly danced the infant a little in her lap , while the other children played about it .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 29]: This had lasted but a very short time , when Mrs. Pocket issued summary orders that they were all to be taken into the house for a nap .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 27]: Thus I made the second discovery on that first occasion , that the nurture of the little Pockets consisted of alternately tumbling up and lying down .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 81]: Under these circumstances , when Flopson and Millers had got the children into the house , like a little flock of sheep , and Mr. Pocket came out of it to make my acquaintance , I was not much surprised to find that Mr. Pocket was a gentleman with a rather perplexed expression of face , and with his very gray hair disordered on his head , as if he did n't quite see his way to putting anything straight .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 23]: Chapter XXIII Mr. Pocket said he was glad to see me , and he hoped I was not sorry to see him .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 24]: `` For , I really am not , '' he added , with his son 's smile , `` an alarming personage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 24]: He was a young-looking man , in spite of his perplexities and his very gray hair , and his manner seemed quite natural .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 44]: I use the word natural , in the sense of its being unaffected ; there was something comic in his distraught way , as though it would have been downright ludicrous but for his own perception that it was very near being so .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 42]: When he had talked with me a little , he said to Mrs. Pocket , with a rather anxious contraction of his eyebrows , which were black and handsome , `` Belinda , I hope you have welcomed Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 15]: And she looked up from her book , and said , `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 24]: She then smiled upon me in an absent state of mind , and asked me if I liked the taste of orange-flower water ?
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 37]: As the question had no bearing , near or remote , on any foregone or subsequent transaction , I consider it to have been thrown out , like her previous approaches , in general conversational condescension .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 113]: I found out within a few hours , and may mention at once , that Mrs. Pocket was the only daughter of a certain quite accidental deceased Knight , who had invented for himself a conviction that his deceased father would have been made a Baronet but for somebody 's determined opposition arising out of entirely personal motives , -- I forget whose , if I ever knew , -- the Sovereign 's , the Prime Minister 's , the Lord Chancellor 's , the Archbishop of Canterbury 's , anybody 's , -- and had tacked himself on to the nobles of the earth in right of this quite supposititious fact .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 56]: I believe he had been knighted himself for storming the English grammar at the point of the pen , in a desperate address engrossed on vellum , on the occasion of the laying of the first stone of some building or other , and for handing some Royal Personage either the trowel or the mortar .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 45]: Be that as it may , he had directed Mrs. Pocket to be brought up from her cradle as one who in the nature of things must marry a title , and who was to be guarded from the acquisition of plebeian domestic knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 32]: So successful a watch and ward had been established over the young lady by this judicious parent , that she had grown up highly ornamental , but perfectly helpless and useless .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 50]: With her character thus happily formed , in the first bloom of her youth she had encountered Mr. Pocket : who was also in the first bloom of youth , and not quite decided whether to mount to the Woolsack , or to roof himself in with a mitre .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 54]: As his doing the one or the other was a mere question of time , he and Mrs. Pocket had taken Time by the forelock -LRB- when , to judge from its length , it would seem to have wanted cutting -RRB- , and had married without the knowledge of the judicious parent .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 43]: The judicious parent , having nothing to bestow or withhold but his blessing , had handsomely settled that dower upon them after a short struggle , and had informed Mr. Pocket that his wife was `` a treasure for a Prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 30]: Mr. Pocket had invested the Prince 's treasure in the ways of the world ever since , and it was supposed to have brought him in but indifferent interest .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 46]: Still , Mrs. Pocket was in general the object of a queer sort of respectful pity , because she had not married a title ; while Mr. Pocket was the object of a queer sort of forgiving reproach , because he had never got one .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 36]: Mr. Pocket took me into the house and showed me my room : which was a pleasant one , and so furnished as that I could use it with comfort for my own private sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 25]: He then knocked at the doors of two other similar rooms , and introduced me to their occupants , by name Drummle and Startop .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 16]: Drummle , an old-looking young man of a heavy order of architecture , was whistling .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 33]: Startop , younger in years and appearance , was reading and holding his head , as if he thought himself in danger of exploding it with too strong a charge of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 46]: Both Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had such a noticeable air of being in somebody else 's hands , that I wondered who really was in possession of the house and let them live there , until I found this unknown power to be the servants .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 56]: It was a smooth way of going on , perhaps , in respect of saving trouble ; but it had the appearance of being expensive , for the servants felt it a duty they owed to themselves to be nice in their eating and drinking , and to keep a deal of company down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 80]: They allowed a very liberal table to Mr. and Mrs. Pocket , yet it always appeared to me that by far the best part of the house to have boarded in would have been the kitchen , -- always supposing the boarder capable of self-defence , for , before I had been there a week , a neighboring lady with whom the family were personally unacquainted , wrote in to say that she had seen Millers slapping the baby .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 33]: This greatly distressed Mrs. Pocket , who burst into tears on receiving the note , and said that it was an extraordinary thing that the neighbors could n't mind their own business .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 59]: By degrees I learnt , and chiefly from Herbert , that Mr. Pocket had been educated at Harrow and at Cambridge , where he had distinguished himself ; but that when he had had the happiness of marrying Mrs. Pocket very early in life , he had impaired his prospects and taken up the calling of a Grinder .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 58]: After grinding a number of dull blades , -- of whom it was remarkable that their fathers , when influential , were always going to help him to preferment , but always forgot to do it when the blades had left the Grindstone , -- he had wearied of that poor work and had come to London .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 67]: Here , after gradually failing in loftier hopes , he had `` read '' with divers who had lacked opportunities or neglected them , and had refurbished divers others for special occasions , and had turned his acquirements to the account of literary compilation and correction , and on such means , added to some very moderate private resources , still maintained the house I saw .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 38]: Mr. and Mrs. Pocket had a toady neighbor ; a widow lady of that highly sympathetic nature that she agreed with everybody , blessed everybody , and shed smiles and tears on everybody , according to circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 26]: This lady 's name was Mrs. Coiler , and I had the honor of taking her down to dinner on the day of my installation .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 35]: She gave me to understand on the stairs , that it was a blow to dear Mrs. Pocket that dear Mr. Pocket should be under the necessity of receiving gentlemen to read with him .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 47]: That did not extend to me , she told me in a gush of love and confidence -LRB- at that time , I had known her something less than five minutes -RRB- ; if they were all like Me , it would be quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 60]: `` But dear Mrs. Pocket , '' said Mrs. Coiler , `` after her early disappointment -LRB- not that dear Mr. Pocket was to blame in that -RRB- , requires so much luxury and elegance -- '' `` Yes , ma'am , '' I said , to stop her , for I was afraid she was going to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 29]: `` And she is of so aristocratic a disposition -- '' `` Yes , ma'am , '' I said again , with the same object as before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 28]: -- That it is hard , '' said Mrs. Coiler , `` to have dear Mr. Pocket 's time and attention diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 45]: I could not help thinking that it might be harder if the butcher 's time and attention were diverted from dear Mrs. Pocket ; but I said nothing , and indeed had enough to do in keeping a bashful watch upon my company manners .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 54]: It came to my knowledge , through what passed between Mrs. Pocket and Drummle while I was attentive to my knife and fork , spoon , glasses , and other instruments of self-destruction , that Drummle , whose Christian name was Bentley , was actually the next heir but one to a baronetcy .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 46]: It further appeared that the book I had seen Mrs. Pocket reading in the garden was all about titles , and that she knew the exact date at which her grandpapa would have come into the book , if he ever had come at all .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 41]: Drummle did n't say much , but in his limited way -LRB- he struck me as a sulky kind of fellow -RRB- he spoke as one of the elect , and recognized Mrs. Pocket as a woman and a sister .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 54]: No one but themselves and Mrs. Coiler the toady neighbor showed any interest in this part of the conversation , and it appeared to me that it was painful to Herbert ; but it promised to last a long time , when the page came in with the announcement of a domestic affliction .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 14]: It was , in effect , that the cook had mislaid the beef .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 52]: To my unutterable amazement , I now , for the first time , saw Mr. Pocket relieve his mind by going through a performance that struck me as very extraordinary , but which made no impression on anybody else , and with which I soon became as familiar as the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 42]: He laid down the carving-knife and fork , -- being engaged in carving , at the moment , -- put his two hands into his disturbed hair , and appeared to make an extraordinary effort to lift himself up by it .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 25]: When he had done this , and had not lifted himself up at all , he quietly went on with what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 12]: Mrs. Coiler then changed the subject and began to flatter me .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 22]: I liked it for a few moments , but she flattered me so very grossly that the pleasure was soon over .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 74]: She had a serpentine way of coming close at me when she pretended to be vitally interested in the friends and localities I had left , which was altogether snaky and fork-tongued ; and when she made an occasional bounce upon Startop -LRB- who said very little to her -RRB- , or upon Drummle -LRB- who said less -RRB- , I rather envied them for being on the opposite side of the table .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 31]: After dinner the children were introduced , and Mrs. Coiler made admiring comments on their eyes , noses , and legs , -- a sagacious way of improving their minds .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 32]: There were four little girls , and two little boys , besides the baby who might have been either , and the baby 's next successor who was as yet neither .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 66]: They were brought in by Flopson and Millers , much as though those two non-commissioned officers had been recruiting somewhere for children and had enlisted these , while Mrs. Pocket looked at the young Nobles that ought to have been as if she rather thought she had had the pleasure of inspecting them before , but did n't quite know what to make of them .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 16]: Give me your fork , Mum , and take the baby , '' said Flopson .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 19]: `` Do n't take it that way , or you 'll get its head under the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 30]: Thus advised , Mrs. Pocket took it the other way , and got its head upon the table ; which was announced to all present by a prodigious concussion .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 5]: `` Dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 25]: Give it me back , Mum , '' said Flopson ; `` and Miss Jane , come and dance to baby , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 47]: One of the little girls , a mere mite who seemed to have prematurely taken upon herself some charge of the others , stepped out of her place by me , and danced to and from the baby until it left off crying , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 36]: Then , all the children laughed , and Mr. Pocket -LRB- who in the meantime had twice endeavored to lift himself up by the hair -RRB- laughed , and we all laughed and were glad .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 71]: Flopson , by dint of doubling the baby at the joints like a Dutch doll , then got it safely into Mrs. Pocket 's lap , and gave it the nut-crackers to play with ; at the same time recommending Mrs. Pocket to take notice that the handles of that instrument were not likely to agree with its eyes , and sharply charging Miss Jane to look after the same .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 39]: Then , the two nurses left the room , and had a lively scuffle on the staircase with a dissipated page who had waited at dinner , and who had clearly lost half his buttons at the gaming-table .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 54]: I was made very uneasy in my mind by Mrs. Pocket 's falling into a discussion with Drummle respecting two baronetcies , while she ate a sliced orange steeped in sugar and wine , and , forgetting all about the baby on her lap , who did most appalling things with the nut-crackers .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 29]: At length little Jane , perceiving its young brains to be imperilled , softly left her place , and with many small artifices coaxed the dangerous weapon away .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 31]: Mrs. Pocket finishing her orange at about the same time , and not approving of this , said to Jane , -- `` You naughty child , how dare you ?
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 8]: Go and sit down this instant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 20]: `` Mamma dear , '' lisped the little girl , `` baby ood have put hith eyeth out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 9]: `` How dare you tell me so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 4]: retorted Mrs. Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 12]: `` Go and sit down in your chair this moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 25]: Mrs. Pocket 's dignity was so crushing , that I felt quite abashed , as if I myself had done something to rouse it .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 24]: `` Belinda , '' remonstrated Mr. Pocket , from the other end of the table , `` how can you be so unreasonable ?
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 10]: Jane only interfered for the protection of baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 14]: `` I will not allow anybody to interfere , '' said Mrs. Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 19]: `` I am surprised , Matthew , that you should expose me to the affront of interference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 5]: `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 11]: cried Mr. Pocket , in an outbreak of desolate desperation .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 18]: `` Are infants to be nut-crackered into their tombs , and is nobody to save them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 25]: `` I will not be interfered with by Jane , '' said Mrs. Pocket , with a majestic glance at that innocent little offender .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 11]: `` I hope I know my poor grandpapa 's position .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 5]: Jane , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 24]: Mr. Pocket got his hands in his hair again , and this time really did lift himself some inches out of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 5]: `` Hear this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 7]: he helplessly exclaimed to the elements .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 17]: `` Babies are to be nut-crackered dead , for people 's poor grandpapa 's positions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: Then he let himself down again , and became silent .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 13]: We all looked awkwardly at the tablecloth while this was going on .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 47]: A pause succeeded , during which the honest and irrepressible baby made a series of leaps and crows at little Jane , who appeared to me to be the only member of the family -LRB- irrespective of servants -RRB- with whom it had any decided acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 16]: `` Mr. Drummle , '' said Mrs. Pocket , `` will you ring for Flopson ?
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 12]: Jane , you undutiful little thing , go and lie down .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 10]: Now , baby darling , come with ma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 15]: The baby was the soul of honor , and protested with all its might .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 43]: It doubled itself up the wrong way over Mrs. Pocket 's arm , exhibited a pair of knitted shoes and dimpled ankles to the company in lieu of its soft face , and was carried out in the highest state of mutiny .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 26]: And it gained its point after all , for I saw it through the window within a few minutes , being nursed by little Jane .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 31]: It happened that the other five children were left behind at the dinner-table , through Flopson 's having some private engagement , and their not being anybody else 's business .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 22]: I thus became aware of the mutual relations between them and Mr. Pocket , which were exemplified in the following manner .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 55]: Mr. Pocket , with the normal perplexity of his face heightened and his hair rumpled , looked at them for some minutes , as if he could n't make out how they came to be boarding and lodging in that establishment , and why they had n't been billeted by Nature on somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 68]: Then , in a distant Missionary way he asked them certain questions , -- as why little Joe had that hole in his frill , who said , Pa , Flopson was going to mend it when she had time , -- and how little Fanny came by that whitlow , who said , Pa , Millers was going to poultice it when she did n't forget .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 47]: Then , he melted into parental tenderness , and gave them a shilling apiece and told them to go and play ; and then as they went out , with one very strong effort to lift himself up by the hair he dismissed the hopeless subject .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 10]: In the evening there was rowing on the river .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 23]: As Drummle and Startop had each a boat , I resolved to set up mine , and to cut them both out .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 70]: I was pretty good at most exercises in which country boys are adepts , but as I was conscious of wanting elegance of style for the Thames , -- not to say for other waters , -- I at once engaged to place myself under the tuition of the winner of a prize-wherry who plied at our stairs , and to whom I was introduced by my new allies .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 17]: This practical authority confused me very much by saying I had the arm of a blacksmith .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 23]: If he could have known how nearly the compliment lost him his pupil , I doubt if he would have paid it .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 29]: There was a supper-tray after we got home at night , and I think we should all have enjoyed ourselves , but for a rather disagreeable domestic occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 32]: Mr. Pocket was in good spirits , when a housemaid came in , and said , `` If you please , sir , I should wish to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 7]: `` Speak to your master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 10]: said Mrs. Pocket , whose dignity was roused again .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 10]: `` How can you think of such a thing ?
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 6]: Go and speak to Flopson .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 11]: Or speak to me -- at some other time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 28]: `` Begging your pardon , ma'am , '' returned the housemaid , `` I should wish to speak at once , and to speak to master . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 22]: Hereupon , Mr. Pocket went out of the room , and we made the best of ourselves until he came back .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 10]: `` This is a pretty thing , Belinda ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 14]: said Mr. Pocket , returning with a countenance expressive of grief and despair .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 32]: `` Here 's the cook lying insensibly drunk on the kitchen floor , with a large bundle of fresh butter made up in the cupboard ready to sell for grease ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 21]: Mrs. Pocket instantly showed much amiable emotion , and said , `` This is that odious Sophia 's doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , Belinda ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 4]: demanded Mr. Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 11]: `` Sophia has told you , '' said Mrs. Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 32]: `` Did I not see her with my own eyes and hear her with my own ears , come into the room just now and ask to speak to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 30]: `` But has she not taken me down stairs , Belinda , '' returned Mr. Pocket , `` and shown me the woman , and the bundle too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 20]: `` And do you defend her , Matthew , '' said Mrs. Pocket , `` for making mischief ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 7]: Mr. Pocket uttered a dismal groan .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 16]: `` Am I , grandpapa 's granddaughter , to be nothing in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 4]: said Mrs. Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 42]: `` Besides , the cook has always been a very nice respectful woman , and said in the most natural manner when she came to look after the situation , that she felt I was born to be a Duchess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 22]: There was a sofa where Mr. Pocket stood , and he dropped upon it in the attitude of the Dying Gladiator .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 33]: Still in that attitude he said , with a hollow voice , `` Good night , Mr. Pip , '' when I deemed it advisable to go to bed and leave him .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 47]: Chapter XXIV After two or three days , when I had established myself in my room and had gone backwards and forwards to London several times , and had ordered all I wanted of my tradesmen , Mr. Pocket and I had a long talk together .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 61]: He knew more of my intended career than I knew myself , for he referred to his having been told by Mr. Jaggers that I was not designed for any profession , and that I should be well enough educated for my destiny if I could `` hold my own '' with the average of young men in prosperous circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 12]: I acquiesced , of course , knowing nothing to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 36]: He advised my attending certain places in London , for the acquisition of such mere rudiments as I wanted , and my investing him with the functions of explainer and director of all my studies .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 28]: He hoped that with intelligent assistance I should meet with little to discourage me , and should soon be able to dispense with any aid but his .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 61]: Through his way of saying this , and much more to similar purpose , he placed himself on confidential terms with me in an admirable manner ; and I may state at once that he was always so zealous and honorable in fulfilling his compact with me , that he made me zealous and honorable in fulfilling mine with him .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 39]: If he had shown indifference as a master , I have no doubt I should have returned the compliment as a pupil ; he gave me no such excuse , and each of us did the other justice .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 32]: Nor did I ever regard him as having anything ludicrous about him -- or anything but what was serious , honest , and good -- in his tutor communication with me .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 57]: When these points were settled , and so far carried out as that I had begun to work in earnest , it occurred to me that if I could retain my bedroom in Barnard 's Inn , my life would be agreeably varied , while my manners would be none the worse for Herbert 's society .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 30]: Mr. Pocket did not object to this arrangement , but urged that before any step could possibly be taken in it , it must be submitted to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 34]: I felt that this delicacy arose out of the consideration that the plan would save Herbert some expense , so I went off to Little Britain and imparted my wish to Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 34]: `` If I could buy the furniture now hired for me , '' said I , `` and one or two other little things , I should be quite at home there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 5]: `` Go it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 9]: said Mr. Jaggers , with a short laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 9]: `` I told you you 'd get on .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 7]: How much do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 9]: I said I did n't know how much .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 4]: retorted Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 4]: `` How much ?
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 4]: Fifty pounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 9]: `` O , not nearly so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 5]: `` Five pounds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 21]: This was such a great fall , that I said in discomfiture , `` O , more than that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 8]: `` More than that , eh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 38]: retorted Mr. Jaggers , lying in wait for me , with his hands in his pockets , his head on one side , and his eyes on the wall behind me ; `` how much more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 16]: `` It is so difficult to fix a sum , '' said I , hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 7]: `` Let 's get at it .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 7]: Twice five ; will that do ?
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 8]: Three times five ; will that do ?
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 9]: Four times five ; will that do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 9]: I said I thought that would do handsomely .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 12]: `` Four times five will do handsomely , will it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 8]: said Mr. Jaggers , knitting his brows .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 13]: `` Now , what do you make of four times five ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 9]: `` What do I make of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 9]: said Mr. Jaggers ; `` how much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 15]: `` I suppose you make it twenty pounds , '' said I , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 26]: `` Never mind what I make it , my friend , '' observed Mr. Jaggers , with a knowing and contradictory toss of his head .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 11]: `` I want to know what you make it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 8]: `` Twenty pounds , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 4]: `` Wemmick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 9]: said Mr. Jaggers , opening his office door .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 15]: `` Take Mr. Pip 's written order , and pay him twenty pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 23]: This strongly marked way of doing business made a strongly marked impression on me , and that not of an agreeable kind .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 57]: Mr. Jaggers never laughed ; but he wore great bright creaking boots , and , in poising himself on these boots , with his large head bent down and his eyebrows joined together , awaiting an answer , he sometimes caused the boots to creak , as if they laughed in a dry and suspicious way .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 33]: As he happened to go out now , and as Wemmick was brisk and talkative , I said to Wemmick that I hardly knew what to make of Mr. Jaggers 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 33]: `` Tell him that , and he 'll take it as a compliment , '' answered Wemmick ; `` he do n't mean that you should know what to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 4]: -- Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 19]: for I looked surprised , `` it 's not personal ; it 's professional : only professional . ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 40]: Wemmick was at his desk , lunching -- and crunching -- on a dry hard biscuit ; pieces of which he threw from time to time into his slit of a mouth , as if he were posting them .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 23]: `` Always seems to me , '' said Wemmick , `` as if he had set a man-trap and was watching it .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 7]: Suddenly-click -- you 're caught ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 21]: Without remarking that man-traps were not among the amenities of life , I said I supposed he was very skilful ?
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 12]: `` Deep , '' said Wemmick , `` as Australia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 34]: Pointing with his pen at the office floor , to express that Australia was understood , for the purposes of the figure , to be symmetrically on the opposite spot of the globe .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 24]: `` If there was anything deeper , '' added Wemmick , bringing his pen to paper , `` he 'd be it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 20]: Then , I said I supposed he had a fine business , and Wemmick said , `` Ca-pi-tal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 9]: Then I asked if there were many clerks ?
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 32]: to which he replied , -- `` We do n't run much into clerks , because there 's only one Jaggers , and people wo n't have him at second hand .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 7]: There are only four of us .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 7]: Would you like to see 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: You are one of us , as I may say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 5]: I accepted the offer .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 50]: When Mr. Wemmick had put all the biscuit into the post , and had paid me my money from a cash-box in a safe , the key of which safe he kept somewhere down his back and produced from his coat-collar like an iron-pigtail , we went up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 34]: The house was dark and shabby , and the greasy shoulders that had left their mark in Mr. Jaggers 's room seemed to have been shuffling up and down the staircase for years .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 58]: In the front first floor , a clerk who looked something between a publican and a rat-catcher -- a large pale , puffed , swollen man -- was attentively engaged with three or four people of shabby appearance , whom he treated as unceremoniously as everybody seemed to be treated who contributed to Mr. Jaggers 's coffers .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 21]: `` Getting evidence together , '' said Mr. Wemmick , as we came out , `` for the Bailey . ''
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 85]: In the room over that , a little flabby terrier of a clerk with dangling hair -LRB- his cropping seemed to have been forgotten when he was a puppy -RRB- was similarly engaged with a man with weak eyes , whom Mr. Wemmick presented to me as a smelter who kept his pot always boiling , and who would melt me anything I pleased , -- and who was in an excessive white-perspiration , as if he had been trying his art on himself .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 58]: In a back room , a high-shouldered man with a face-ache tied up in dirty flannel , who was dressed in old black clothes that bore the appearance of having been waxed , was stooping over his work of making fair copies of the notes of the other two gentlemen , for Mr. Jaggers 's own use .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 6]: This was all the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 27]: When we went down stairs again , Wemmick led me into my guardian 's room , and said , `` This you 've seen already . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 30]: `` Pray , '' said I , as the two odious casts with the twitchy leer upon them caught my sight again , `` whose likenesses are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 4]: `` These ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 21]: said Wemmick , getting upon a chair , and blowing the dust off the horrible heads before bringing them down .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 7]: `` These are two celebrated ones .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 12]: Famous clients of ours that got us a world of credit .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 32]: This chap -LRB- why you must have come down in the night and been peeping into the inkstand , to get this blot upon your eyebrow , you old rascal ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 23]: murdered his master , and , considering that he was n't brought up to evidence , did n't plan it badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 7]: `` Is it like him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 23]: I asked , recoiling from the brute , as Wemmick spat upon his eyebrow and gave it a rub with his sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 4]: `` Like him ?
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 7]: It 's himself , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 14]: The cast was made in Newgate , directly after he was taken down .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 16]: You had a particular fancy for me , had n't you , Old Artful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 3]: said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 40]: He then explained this affectionate apostrophe , by touching his brooch representing the lady and the weeping willow at the tomb with the urn upon it , and saying , `` Had it made for me , express ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 7]: `` Is the lady anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 9]: said I. `` No , '' returned Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 5]: `` Only his game .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 13]: -LRB- You liked your bit of game , did n't you ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 51]: No ; deuce a bit of a lady in the case , Mr. Pip , except one , -- and she was n't of this slender lady-like sort , and you would n't have caught her looking after this urn , unless there was something to drink in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 24]: Wemmick 's attention being thus directed to his brooch , he put down the cast , and polished the brooch with his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 12]: `` Did that other creature come to the same end ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 8]: `` He has the same look . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 16]: `` You 're right , '' said Wemmick ; `` it 's the genuine look .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 16]: Much as if one nostril was caught up with a horse-hair and a little fish-hook .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 19]: Yes , he came to the same end ; quite the natural end here , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 21]: He forged wills , this blade did , if he did n't also put the supposed testators to sleep too .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 25]: You were a gentlemanly Cove , though '' -LRB- Mr. Wemmick was again apostrophizing -RRB- , `` and you said you could write Greek .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 4]: Yah , Bounceable !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 6]: What a liar you were !
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 10]: I never met such a liar as you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 36]: Before putting his late friend on his shelf again , Wemmick touched the largest of his mourning rings and said , `` Sent out to buy it for me , only the day before . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 31]: While he was putting up the other cast and coming down from the chair , the thought crossed my mind that all his personal jewelry was derived from like sources .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 31]: As he had shown no diffidence on the subject , I ventured on the liberty of asking him the question , when he stood before me , dusting his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 17]: `` O yes , '' he returned , `` these are all gifts of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 14]: One brings another , you see ; that 's the way of it .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 5]: I always take 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 4]: They 're curiosities .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: And they 're property .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 18]: They may not be worth much , but , after all , they 're property and portable .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 30]: It do n't signify to you with your brilliant lookout , but as to myself , my guiding-star always is , `` Get hold of portable property '' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 62]: When I had rendered homage to this light , he went on to say , in a friendly manner : -- `` If at any odd time when you have nothing better to do , you would n't mind coming over to see me at Walworth , I could offer you a bed , and I should consider it an honor .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 39]: I have not much to show you ; but such two or three curiosities as I have got you might like to look over ; and I am fond of a bit of garden and a summer-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 11]: I said I should be delighted to accept his hospitality .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 24]: `` Thankee , '' said he ; `` then we 'll consider that it 's to come off , when convenient to you .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 9]: Have you dined with Mr. Jaggers yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 5]: `` Not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 18]: `` Well , '' said Wemmick , `` he 'll give you wine , and good wine .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 11]: I 'll give you punch , and not bad punch .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 8]: And now I 'll tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 15]: When you go to dine with Mr. Jaggers , look at his housekeeper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: `` Shall I see something very uncommon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 16]: `` Well , '' said Wemmick , `` you 'll see a wild beast tamed .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 10]: Not so very uncommon , you 'll tell me .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 19]: I reply , that depends on the original wildness of the beast , and the amount of taming .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 12]: It wo n't lower your opinion of Mr. Jaggers 's powers .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 7]: Keep your eye on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 19]: I told him I would do so , with all the interest and curiosity that his preparation awakened .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 27]: As I was taking my departure , he asked me if I would like to devote five minutes to seeing Mr. Jaggers `` at it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 31]: For several reasons , and not least because I did n't clearly know what Mr. Jaggers would be found to be `` at , '' I replied in the affirmative .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 79]: We dived into the City , and came up in a crowded police-court , where a blood-relation -LRB- in the murderous sense -RRB- of the deceased , with the fanciful taste in brooches , was standing at the bar , uncomfortably chewing something ; while my guardian had a woman under examination or cross-examination , -- I do n't know which , -- and was striking her , and the bench , and everybody present , with awe .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 28]: If anybody , of whatsoever degree , said a word that he did n't approve of , he instantly required to have it `` taken down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 21]: If anybody would n't make an admission , he said , `` I 'll have it out of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 18]: and if anybody made an admission , he said , `` Now I have got you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 11]: The magistrates shivered under a single bite of his finger .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 24]: Thieves and thief-takers hung in dread rapture on his words , and shrank when a hair of his eyebrows turned in their direction .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 87]: Which side he was on I could n't make out , for he seemed to me to be grinding the whole place in a mill ; I only know that when I stole out on tiptoe , he was not on the side of the bench ; for , he was making the legs of the old gentleman who presided , quite convulsive under the table , by his denunciations of his conduct as the representative of British law and justice in that chair that day .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 40]: Chapter XXV Bentley Drummle , who was so sulky a fellow that he even took up a book as if its writer had done him an injury , did not take up an acquaintance in a more agreeable spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 56]: Heavy in figure , movement , and comprehension , -- in the sluggish complexion of his face , and in the large , awkward tongue that seemed to loll about in his mouth as he himself lolled about in a room , -- he was idle , proud , niggardly , reserved , and suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 31]: He came of rich people down in Somersetshire , who had nursed this combination of qualities until they made the discovery that it was just of age and a blockhead .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 29]: Thus , Bentley Drummle had come to Mr. Pocket when he was a head taller than that gentleman , and half a dozen heads thicker than most gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 35]: Startop had been spoilt by a weak mother and kept at home when he ought to have been at school , but he was devotedly attached to her , and admired her beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 36]: He had a woman 's delicacy of feature , and was -- `` as you may see , though you never saw her , '' said Herbert to me -- `` exactly like his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 65]: It was but natural that I should take to him much more kindly than to Drummle , and that , even in the earliest evenings of our boating , he and I should pull homeward abreast of one another , conversing from boat to boat , while Bentley Drummle came up in our wake alone , under the overhanging banks and among the rushes .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 57]: He would always creep in-shore like some uncomfortable amphibious creature , even when the tide would have sent him fast upon his way ; and I always think of him as coming after us in the dark or by the back-water , when our own two boats were breaking the sunset or the moonlight in mid-stream .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 8]: Herbert was my intimate companion and friend .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 38]: I presented him with a half-share in my boat , which was the occasion of his often coming down to Hammersmith ; and my possession of a half-share in his chambers often took me up to London .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 12]: We used to walk between the two places at all hours .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 33]: I have an affection for the road yet -LRB- though it is not so pleasant a road as it was then -RRB- , formed in the impressibility of untried youth and hope .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 21]: When I had been in Mr. Pocket 's family a month or two , Mr. and Mrs. Camilla turned up .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 7]: Camilla was Mr. Pocket 's sister .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 19]: Georgiana , whom I had seen at Miss Havisham 's on the same occasion , also turned up .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 22]: she was a cousin , -- an indigestive single woman , who called her rigidity religion , and her liver love .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 12]: These people hated me with the hatred of cupidity and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 18]: As a matter of course , they fawned upon me in my prosperity with the basest meanness .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 27]: Towards Mr. Pocket , as a grown-up infant with no notion of his own interests , they showed the complacent forbearance I had heard them express .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 31]: Mrs. Pocket they held in contempt ; but they allowed the poor soul to have been heavily disappointed in life , because that shed a feeble reflected light upon themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 17]: These were the surroundings among which I settled down , and applied myself to my education .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 38]: I soon contracted expensive habits , and began to spend an amount of money that within a few short months I should have thought almost fabulous ; but through good and evil I stuck to my books .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 18]: There was no other merit in this , than my having sense enough to feel my deficiencies .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 53]: Between Mr. Pocket and Herbert I got on fast ; and , with one or the other always at my elbow to give me the start I wanted , and clear obstructions out of my road , I must have been as great a dolt as Drummle if I had done less .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 31]: I had not seen Mr. Wemmick for some weeks , when I thought I would write him a note and propose to go home with him on a certain evening .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 23]: He replied that it would give him much pleasure , and that he would expect me at the office at six o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 24]: Thither I went , and there I found him , putting the key of his safe down his back as the clock struck .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 11]: `` Did you think of walking down to Walworth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 13]: `` Certainly , '' said I , `` if you approve . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 31]: `` Very much , '' was Wemmick 's reply , `` for I have had my legs under the desk all day , and shall be glad to stretch them .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 16]: Now , I 'll tell you what I have got for supper , Mr. Pip .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 31]: I have got a stewed steak , -- which is of home preparation , -- and a cold roast fowl , -- which is from the cook 's - shop .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 31]: I think it 's tender , because the master of the shop was a Juryman in some cases of ours the other day , and we let him down easy .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 50]: I reminded him of it when I bought the fowl , and I said , `` Pick us out a good one , old Briton , because if we had chosen to keep you in the box another day or two , we could easily have done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 21]: He said to that , `` Let me make you a present of the best fowl in the shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 7]: I let him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 12]: As far as it goes , it 's property and portable .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 13]: You do n't object to an aged parent , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 28]: I really thought he was still speaking of the fowl , until he added , `` Because I have got an aged parent at my place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 7]: I then said what politeness required .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 13]: `` So , you have n't dined with Mr. Jaggers yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 8]: he pursued , as we walked along .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 5]: `` Not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 14]: `` He told me so this afternoon when he heard you were coming .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 9]: I expect you 'll have an invitation to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 10]: He 's going to ask your pals , too .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 9]: Three of 'em ; ai n't there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 24]: Although I was not in the habit of counting Drummle as one of my intimate associates , I answered , `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 36]: `` Well , he 's going to ask the whole gang , '' -- I hardly felt complimented by the word , -- `` and whatever he gives you , he 'll give you good .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 13]: Do n't look forward to variety , but you 'll have excellence .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 45]: And there ` sa nother rum thing in his house , '' proceeded Wemmick , after a moment 's pause , as if the remark followed on the housekeeper understood ; `` he never lets a door or window be fastened at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 7]: `` Is he never robbed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 6]: `` That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 3]: returned Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 23]: `` He says , and gives it out publicly , `` I want to see the man who 'll rob me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 57]: Lord bless you , I have heard him , a hundred times , if I have heard him once , say to regular cracksmen in our front office , `` You know where I live ; now , no bolt is ever drawn there ; why do n't you do a stroke of business with me ?
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 9]: Come ; ca n't I tempt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 23]: Not a man of them , sir , would be bold enough to try it on , for love or money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 8]: `` They dread him so much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: said I. `` Dread him , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 8]: `` I believe you they dread him .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 14]: Not but what he 's artful , even in his defiance of them .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 5]: No silver , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 7]: Britannia metal , every spoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 21]: `` So they would n't have much , '' I observed , `` even if they -- '' `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 20]: But he would have much , '' said Wemmick , cutting me short , `` and they know it .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 14]: He 'd have their lives , and the lives of scores of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 8]: He 'd have all he could get .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 21]: And it 's impossible to say what he could n't get , if he gave his mind to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 34]: I was falling into meditation on my guardian 's greatness , when Wemmick remarked : -- `` As to the absence of plate , that 's only his natural depth , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 14]: A river 's its natural depth , and he 's his natural depth .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 5]: Look at his watch-chain .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 6]: That 's real enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 13]: `` It 's very massive , '' said I. `` Massive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 3]: repeated Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 20]: And his watch is a gold repeater , and worth a hundred pound if it 's worth a penny .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 63]: Mr. Pip , there are about seven hundred thieves in this town who know all about that watch ; there 's not a man , a woman , or a child , among them , who would n't identify the smallest link in that chain , and drop it as if it was red hot , if inveigled into touching it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 44]: At first with such discourse , and afterwards with conversation of a more general nature , did Mr. Wemmick and I beguile the time and the road , until he gave me to understand that we had arrived in the district of Walworth .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 27]: It appeared to be a collection of back lanes , ditches , and little gardens , and to present the aspect of a rather dull retirement .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 33]: Wemmick 's house was a little wooden cottage in the midst of plots of garden , and the top of it was cut out and painted like a battery mounted with guns .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 9]: `` My own doing , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 9]: `` Looks pretty ; do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 44]: I highly commended it , I think it was the smallest house I ever saw ; with the queerest gothic windows -LRB- by far the greater part of them sham -RRB- , and a gothic door almost too small to get in at .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 25]: `` That 's a real flagstaff , you see , '' said Wemmick , `` and on Sundays I run up a real flag .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 4]: Then look here .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 19]: After I have crossed this bridge , I hoist it up-so -- and cut off the communication . ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 19]: The bridge was a plank , and it crossed a chasm about four feet wide and two deep .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 34]: But it was very pleasant to see the pride with which he hoisted it up and made it fast ; smiling as he did so , with a relish and not merely mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 19]: `` At nine o'clock every night , Greenwich time , '' said Wemmick , `` the gun fires .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 7]: There he is , you see !
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 18]: And when you hear him go , I think you 'll say he 's a Stinger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 18]: The piece of ordnance referred to , was mounted in a separate fortress , constructed of lattice-work .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 19]: It was protected from the weather by an ingenious little tarpaulin contrivance in the nature of an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 67]: `` Then , at the back , '' said Wemmick , `` out of sight , so as not to impede the idea of fortifications , -- for it 's a principle with me , if you have an idea , carry it out and keep it up , -- I do n't know whether that 's your opinion -- '' I said , decidedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 49]: -- At the back , there 's a pig , and there are fowls and rabbits ; then , I knock together my own little frame , you see , and grow cucumbers ; and you 'll judge at supper what sort of a salad I can raise .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 46]: So , sir , '' said Wemmick , smiling again , but seriously too , as he shook his head , `` if you can suppose the little place besieged , it would hold out a devil of a time in point of provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 46]: Then , he conducted me to a bower about a dozen yards off , but which was approached by such ingenious twists of path that it took quite a long time to get at ; and in this retreat our glasses were already set forth .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 17]: Our punch was cooling in an ornamental lake , on whose margin the bower was raised .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 69]: This piece of water -LRB- with an island in the middle which might have been the salad for supper -RRB- was of a circular form , and he had constructed a fountain in it , which , when you set a little mill going and took a cork out of a pipe , played to that powerful extent that it made the back of your hand quite wet .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 39]: `` I am my own engineer , and my own carpenter , and my own plumber , and my own gardener , and my own Jack of all Trades , '' said Wemmick , in acknowledging my compliments .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 12]: `` Well ; it 's a good thing , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 12]: It brushes the Newgate cobwebs away , and pleases the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 15]: You would n't mind being at once introduced to the Aged , would you ?
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 8]: It would n't put you out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 14]: I expressed the readiness I felt , and we went into the castle .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 33]: There we found , sitting by a fire , a very old man in a flannel coat : clean , cheerful , comfortable , and well cared for , but intensely deaf .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 26]: `` Well aged parent , '' said Wemmick , shaking hands with him in a cordial and jocose way , `` how am you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 10]: `` All right , John ; all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 5]: replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 23]: `` Here 's Mr. Pip , aged parent , '' said Wemmick , `` and I wish you could hear his name .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 14]: Nod away at him , Mr. Pip ; that 's what he likes .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 13]: Nod away at him , if you please , like winking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 29]: `` This is a fine place of my son 's , sir , '' cried the old man , while I nodded as hard as I possibly could .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 9]: `` This is a pretty pleasure-ground , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 30]: This spot and these beautiful works upon it ought to be kept together by the Nation , after my son 's time , for the people 's enjoyment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 17]: `` You 're as proud of it as Punch ; ai n't you , Aged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 55]: said Wemmick , contemplating the old man , with his hard face really softened ; `` there 's a nod for you ; '' giving him a tremendous one ; `` there 's another for you ; '' giving him a still more tremendous one ; `` you like that , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 25]: If you 're not tired , Mr. Pip -- though I know it 's tiring to strangers -- will you tip him one more ?
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 10]: You ca n't think how it pleases him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 13]: I tipped him several more , and he was in great spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 53]: We left him bestirring himself to feed the fowls , and we sat down to our punch in the arbor ; where Wemmick told me , as he smoked a pipe , that it had taken him a good many years to bring the property up to its present pitch of perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 10]: `` Is it your own , Mr. Wemmick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 22]: `` O yes , '' said Wemmick , `` I have got hold of it , a bit at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 9]: It 's a freehold , by George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 5]: `` Is it indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: I hope Mr. Jaggers admires it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 9]: `` Never seen it , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 6]: `` Never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 5]: Never seen the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 5]: Never heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 14]: No ; the office is one thing , and private life is another .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 29]: When I go into the office , I leave the Castle behind me , and when I come into the Castle , I leave the office behind me .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 20]: If it 's not in any way disagreeable to you , you 'll oblige me by doing the same .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 10]: I do n't wish it professionally spoken about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 15]: Of course I felt my good faith involved in the observance of his request .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 21]: The punch being very nice , we sat there drinking it and talking , until it was almost nine o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 26]: `` Getting near gun-fire , '' said Wemmick then , as he laid down his pipe ; `` it 's the Aged 's treat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 30]: Proceeding into the Castle again , we found the Aged heating the poker , with expectant eyes , as a preliminary to the performance of this great nightly ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 30]: Wemmick stood with his watch in his hand until the moment was come for him to take the red-hot poker from the Aged , and repair to the battery .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 44]: He took it , and went out , and presently the Stinger went off with a Bang that shook the crazy little box of a cottage as if it must fall to pieces , and made every glass and teacup in it ring .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 34]: Upon this , the Aged -- who I believe would have been blown out of his arm-chair but for holding on by the elbows -- cried out exultingly , `` He 's fired !
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 5]: I heerd him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 24]: and I nodded at the old gentleman until it is no figure of speech to declare that I absolutely could not see him .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 17]: The interval between that time and supper Wemmick devoted to showing me his collection of curiosities .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 66]: They were mostly of a felonious character ; comprising the pen with which a celebrated forgery had been committed , a distinguished razor or two , some locks of hair , and several manuscript confessions written under condemnation , -- upon which Mr. Wemmick set particular value as being , to use his own words , `` every one of 'em Lies , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 31]: These were agreeably dispersed among small specimens of china and glass , various neat trifles made by the proprietor of the museum , and some tobacco-stoppers carved by the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 60]: They were all displayed in that chamber of the Castle into which I had been first inducted , and which served , not only as the general sitting-room but as the kitchen too , if I might judge from a saucepan on the hob , and a brazen bijou over the fireplace designed for the suspension of a roasting-jack .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 18]: There was a neat little girl in attendance , who looked after the Aged in the day .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 25]: When she had laid the supper-cloth , the bridge was lowered to give her means of egress , and she withdrew for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 42]: The supper was excellent ; and though the Castle was rather subject to dry-rot insomuch that it tasted like a bad nut , and though the pig might have been farther off , I was heartily pleased with my whole entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 52]: Nor was there any drawback on my little turret bedroom , beyond there being such a very thin ceiling between me and the flagstaff , that when I lay down on my back in bed , it seemed as if I had to balance that pole on my forehead all night .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 19]: Wemmick was up early in the morning , and I am afraid I heard him cleaning my boots .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 32]: After that , he fell to gardening , and I saw him from my gothic window pretending to employ the Aged , and nodding at him in a most devoted manner .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 20]: Our breakfast was as good as the supper , and at half-past eight precisely we started for Little Britain .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 22]: By degrees , Wemmick got dryer and harder as we went along , and his mouth tightened into a post-office again .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 64]: At last , when we got to his place of business and he pulled out his key from his coat-collar , he looked as unconscious of his Walworth property as if the Castle and the drawbridge and the arbor and the lake and the fountain and the Aged , had all been blown into space together by the last discharge of the Stinger .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 33]: Chapter XXVI It fell out as Wemmick had told me it would , that I had an early opportunity of comparing my guardian 's establishment with that of his cashier and clerk .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 48]: My guardian was in his room , washing his hands with his scented soap , when I went into the office from Walworth ; and he called me to him , and gave me the invitation for myself and friends which Wemmick had prepared me to receive .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 19]: `` No ceremony , '' he stipulated , `` and no dinner dress , and say to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 53]: I asked him where we should come to -LRB- for I had no idea where he lived -RRB- , and I believe it was in his general objection to make anything like an admission , that he replied , `` Come here , and I 'll take you home with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 23]: I embrace this opportunity of remarking that he washed his clients off , as if he were a surgeon or a dentist .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 26]: He had a closet in his room , fitted up for the purpose , which smelt of the scented soap like a perfumer 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 47]: It had an unusually large jack-towel on a roller inside the door , and he would wash his hands , and wipe them and dry them all over this towel , whenever he came in from a police court or dismissed a client from his room .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 57]: When I and my friends repaired to him at six o'clock next day , he seemed to have been engaged on a case of a darker complexion than usual , for we found him with his head butted into this closet , not only washing his hands , but laving his face and gargling his throat .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 37]: And even when he had done all that , and had gone all round the jack-towel , he took out his penknife and scraped the case out of his nails before he put his coat on .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 51]: There were some people slinking about as usual when we passed out into the street , who were evidently anxious to speak with him ; but there was something so conclusive in the halo of scented soap which encircled his presence , that they gave it up for that day .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 47]: As we walked along westward , he was recognized ever and again by some face in the crowd of the streets , and whenever that happened he talked louder to me ; but he never otherwise recognized anybody , or took notice that anybody recognized him .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 20]: He conducted us to Gerrard Street , Soho , to a house on the south side of that street .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 20]: Rather a stately house of its kind , but dolefully in want of painting , and with dirty windows .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 27]: He took out his key and opened the door , and we all went into a stone hall , bare , gloomy , and little used .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 20]: So , up a dark brown staircase into a series of three dark brown rooms on the first floor .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 31]: There were carved garlands on the panelled walls , and as he stood among them giving us welcome , I know what kind of loops I thought they looked like .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 22]: Dinner was laid in the best of these rooms ; the second was his dressing-room ; the third , his bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 20]: He told us that he held the whole house , but rarely used more of it than we saw .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 45]: The table was comfortably laid -- no silver in the service , of course -- and at the side of his chair was a capacious dumb-waiter , with a variety of bottles and decanters on it , and four dishes of fruit for dessert .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 18]: I noticed throughout , that he kept everything under his own hand , and distributed everything himself .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 39]: There was a bookcase in the room ; I saw from the backs of the books , that they were about evidence , criminal law , criminal biography , trials , acts of Parliament , and such things .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 13]: The furniture was all very solid and good , like his watch-chain .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 18]: It had an official look , however , and there was nothing merely ornamental to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 43]: In a corner was a little table of papers with a shaded lamp : so that he seemed to bring the office home with him in that respect too , and to wheel it out of an evening and fall to work .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 40]: As he had scarcely seen my three companions until now , -- for he and I had walked together , -- he stood on the hearth-rug , after ringing the bell , and took a searching look at them .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 18]: To my surprise , he seemed at once to be principally if not solely interested in Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 31]: `` Pip , '' said he , putting his large hand on my shoulder and moving me to the window , `` I do n't know one from the other .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 6]: Who 's the Spider ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 5]: `` The spider ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 12]: said I. `` The blotchy , sprawly , sulky fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 21]: `` That 's Bentley Drummle , '' I replied ; `` the one with the delicate face is Startop . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 28]: Not making the least account of `` the one with the delicate face , '' he returned , `` Bentley Drummle is his name , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 9]: I like the look of that fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 34]: He immediately began to talk to Drummle : not at all deterred by his replying in his heavy reticent way , but apparently led on by it to screw discourse out of him .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 25]: I was looking at the two , when there came between me and them the housekeeper , with the first dish for the table .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 23]: She was a woman of about forty , I supposed , -- but I may have thought her younger than she was .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 24]: Rather tall , of a lithe nimble figure , extremely pale , with large faded eyes , and a quantity of streaming hair .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 87]: I can not say whether any diseased affection of the heart caused her lips to be parted as if she were panting , and her face to bear a curious expression of suddenness and flutter ; but I know that I had been to see Macbeth at the theatre , a night or two before , and that her face looked to me as if it were all disturbed by fiery air , like the faces I had seen rise out of the Witches ' caldron .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 26]: She set the dish on , touched my guardian quietly on the arm with a finger to notify that dinner was ready , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 27]: We took our seats at the round table , and my guardian kept Drummle on one side of him , while Startop sat on the other .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 33]: It was a noble dish of fish that the housekeeper had put on table , and we had a joint of equally choice mutton afterwards , and then an equally choice bird .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 44]: Sauces , wines , all the accessories we wanted , and all of the best , were given out by our host from his dumb-waiter ; and when they had made the circuit of the table , he always put them back again .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 31]: Similarly , he dealt us clean plates and knives and forks , for each course , and dropped those just disused into two baskets on the ground by his chair .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 8]: No other attendant than the housekeeper appeared .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 22]: She set on every dish ; and I always saw in her face , a face rising out of the caldron .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 43]: Years afterwards , I made a dreadful likeness of that woman , by causing a face that had no other natural resemblance to it than it derived from flowing hair to pass behind a bowl of flaming spirits in a dark room .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 82]: Induced to take particular notice of the housekeeper , both by her own striking appearance and by Wemmick 's preparation , I observed that whenever she was in the room she kept her eyes attentively on my guardian , and that she would remove her hands from any dish she put before him , hesitatingly , as if she dreaded his calling her back , and wanted him to speak when she was nigh , if he had anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 24]: I fancied that I could detect in his manner a consciousness of this , and a purpose of always holding her in suspense .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 32]: Dinner went off gayly , and although my guardian seemed to follow rather than originate subjects , I knew that he wrenched the weakest part of our dispositions out of us .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 39]: For myself , I found that I was expressing my tendency to lavish expenditure , and to patronize Herbert , and to boast of my great prospects , before I quite knew that I had opened my lips .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 45]: It was so with all of us , but with no one more than Drummle : the development of whose inclination to gird in a grudging and suspicious way at the rest , was screwed out of him before the fish was taken off .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 43]: It was not then , but when we had got to the cheese , that our conversation turned upon our rowing feats , and that Drummle was rallied for coming up behind of a night in that slow amphibious way of his .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 41]: Drummle upon this , informed our host that he much preferred our room to our company , and that as to skill he was more than our master , and that as to strength he could scatter us like chaff .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 52]: By some invisible agency , my guardian wound him up to a pitch little short of ferocity about this trifle ; and he fell to baring and spanning his arm to show how muscular it was , and we all fell to baring and spanning our arms in a ridiculous manner .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 59]: Now the housekeeper was at that time clearing the table ; my guardian , taking no heed of her , but with the side of his face turned from her , was leaning back in his chair biting the side of his forefinger and showing an interest in Drummle , that , to me , was quite inexplicable .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 24]: Suddenly , he clapped his large hand on the housekeeper 's , like a trap , as she stretched it across the table .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 18]: So suddenly and smartly did he do this , that we all stopped in our foolish contention .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 20]: `` If you talk of strength , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` I 'll show you a wrist .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 9]: Molly , let them see your wrist . ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 20]: Her entrapped hand was on the table , but she had already put her other hand behind her waist .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 22]: `` Master , '' she said , in a low voice , with her eyes attentively and entreatingly fixed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 5]: `` Do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 21]: `` I 'll show you a wrist , '' repeated Mr. Jaggers , with an immovable determination to show it .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 10]: `` Molly , let them see your wrist . ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 8]: `` Master , '' she again murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 4]: `` Please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 32]: `` Molly , '' said Mr. Jaggers , not looking at her , but obstinately looking at the opposite side of the room , `` let them see both your wrists .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 3]: Show them .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 3]: Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 16]: He took his hand from hers , and turned that wrist up on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 18]: She brought her other hand from behind her , and held the two out side by side .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 16]: The last wrist was much disfigured , -- deeply scarred and scarred across and across .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 29]: When she held her hands out she took her eyes from Mr. Jaggers , and turned them watchfully on every one of the rest of us in succession .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 20]: `` There 's power here , '' said Mr. Jaggers , coolly tracing out the sinews with his forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 14]: `` Very few men have the power of wrist that this woman has .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 14]: It 's remarkable what mere force of grip there is in these hands .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 28]: I have had occasion to notice many hands ; but I never saw stronger in that respect , man 's or woman 's , than these . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 28]: While he said these words in a leisurely , critical style , she continued to look at every one of us in regular succession as we sat .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 11]: The moment he ceased , she looked at him again .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 29]: `` That 'll do , Molly , '' said Mr. Jaggers , giving her a slight nod ; `` you have been admired , and can go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 32]: She withdrew her hands and went out of the room , and Mr. Jaggers , putting the decanters on from his dumb-waiter , filled his glass and passed round the wine .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 17]: `` At half-past nine , gentlemen , '' said he , `` we must break up .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 9]: Pray make the best use of your time .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 8]: I am glad to see you all .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 9]: Mr. Drummle , I drink to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 19]: If his object in singling out Drummle were to bring him out still more , it perfectly succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 30]: In a sulky triumph , Drummle showed his morose depreciation of the rest of us , in a more and more offensive degree , until he became downright intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 15]: Through all his stages , Mr. Jaggers followed him with the same strange interest .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 14]: He actually seemed to serve as a zest to Mr. Jaggers 's wine .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 24]: In our boyish want of discretion I dare say we took too much to drink , and I know we talked too much .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 24]: We became particularly hot upon some boorish sneer of Drummle 's , to the effect that we were too free with our money .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 38]: It led to my remarking , with more zeal than discretion , that it came with a bad grace from him , to whom Startop had lent money in my presence but a week or so before .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 14]: `` Well , '' retorted Drummle ; `` he 'll be paid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 36]: `` I do n't mean to imply that he wo n't , '' said I , `` but it might make you hold your tongue about us and our money , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 6]: `` You should think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 3]: retorted Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 5]: `` Oh Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 33]: `` I dare say , '' I went on , meaning to be very severe , `` that you would n't lend money to any of us if we wanted it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 9]: `` You are right , '' said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 11]: `` I would n't lend one of you a sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 9]: I would n't lend anybody a sixpence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 14]: `` Rather mean to borrow under those circumstances , I should say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 9]: `` You should say , '' repeated Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 5]: `` Oh Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 66]: This was so very aggravating -- the more especially as I found myself making no way against his surly obtuseness -- that I said , disregarding Herbert 's efforts to check me , -- `` Come , Mr. Drummle , since we are on the subject , I 'll tell you what passed between Herbert here and me , when you borrowed that money . ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 19]: `` I do n't want to know what passed between Herbert there and you , '' growled Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 22]: And I think he added in a lower growl , that we might both go to the devil and shake ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 21]: `` I 'll tell you , however , '' said I , `` whether you want to know or not .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 33]: We said that as you put it in your pocket very glad to get it , you seemed to be immensely amused at his being so weak as to lend it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 40]: Drummle laughed outright , and sat laughing in our faces , with his hands in his pockets and his round shoulders raised ; plainly signifying that it was quite true , and that he despised us as asses all .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 28]: Hereupon Startop took him in hand , though with a much better grace than I had shown , and exhorted him to be a little more agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 31]: Startop , being a lively , bright young fellow , and Drummle being the exact opposite , the latter was always disposed to resent him as a direct personal affront .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 28]: He now retorted in a coarse , lumpish way , and Startop tried to turn the discussion aside with some small pleasantry that made us all laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 67]: Resenting this little success more than anything , Drummle , without any threat or warning , pulled his hands out of his pockets , dropped his round shoulders , swore , took up a large glass , and would have flung it at his adversary 's head , but for our entertainer 's dexterously seizing it at the instant when it was raised for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 40]: `` Gentlemen , '' said Mr. Jaggers , deliberately putting down the glass , and hauling out his gold repeater by its massive chain , `` I am exceedingly sorry to announce that it 's half past nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 9]: On this hint we all rose to depart .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 24]: Before we got to the street door , Startop was cheerily calling Drummle `` old boy , '' as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 71]: But the old boy was so far from responding , that he would not even walk to Hammersmith on the same side of the way ; so Herbert and I , who remained in town , saw them going down the street on opposite sides ; Startop leading , and Drummle lagging behind in the shadow of the houses , much as he was wont to follow in his boat .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 32]: As the door was not yet shut , I thought I would leave Herbert there for a moment , and run up stairs again to say a word to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 24]: I found him in his dressing-room surrounded by his stock of boots , already hard at it , washing his hands of us .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 32]: I told him I had come up again to say how sorry I was that anything disagreeable should have occurred , and that I hoped he would not blame me much .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 20]: said he , sluicing his face , and speaking through the water-drops ; `` it 's nothing , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 7]: I like that Spider though . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 20]: He had turned towards me now , and was shaking his head , and blowing , and towelling himself .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 21]: `` I am glad you like him , sir , '' said I -- `` but I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 21]: `` No , no , '' my guardian assented ; `` do n't have too much to do with him .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 9]: Keep as clear of him as you can .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 16]: But I like the fellow , Pip ; he is one of the true sort .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 20]: Why , if I was a fortune-teller -- '' Looking out of the towel , he caught my eye .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 30]: `` But I am not a fortune-teller , '' he said , letting his head drop into a festoon of towel , and towelling away at his two ears .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 11]: `` You know what I am , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 6]: Good night , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 7]: `` Good night , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 41]: In about a month after that , the Spider 's time with Mr. Pocket was up for good , and , to the great relief of all the house but Mrs. Pocket , he went home to the family hole .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 48]: Chapter XXVII `` MY DEAR MR PIP : -- `` I write this by request of Mr. Gargery , for to let you know that he is going to London in company with Mr. Wopsle and would be glad if agreeable to be allowed to see you .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 21]: He would call at Barnard 's Hotel Tuesday morning at nine o'clock , when if not agreeable please leave word .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 12]: Your poor sister is much the same as when you left .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 19]: We talk of you in the kitchen every night , and wonder what you are saying and doing .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 20]: If now considered in the light of a liberty , excuse it for the love of poor old days .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 20]: No more , dear Mr. Pip , from your ever obliged , and affectionate servant , `` BIDDY . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 3]: `` P.S. .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 10]: He wishes me most particular to write what larks .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 6]: He says you will understand .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 36]: I hope and do not doubt it will be agreeable to see him , even though a gentleman , for you had ever a good heart , and he is a worthy , worthy man .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 26]: I have read him all , excepting only the last little sentence , and he wishes me most particular to write again what larks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 20]: I received this letter by the post on Monday morning , and therefore its appointment was for next day .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 15]: Let me confess exactly with what feelings I looked forward to Joe 's coming .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 31]: Not with pleasure , though I was bound to him by so many ties ; no ; with considerable disturbance , some mortification , and a keen sense of incongruity .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 18]: If I could have kept him away by paying money , I certainly would have paid money .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 28]: My greatest reassurance was that he was coming to Barnard 's Inn , not to Hammersmith , and consequently would not fall in Bentley Drummle 's way .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 43]: I had little objection to his being seen by Herbert or his father , for both of whom I had a respect ; but I had the sharpest sensitiveness as to his being seen by Drummle , whom I held in contempt .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 24]: So , throughout life , our worst weaknesses and meannesses are usually committed for the sake of the people whom we most despise .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 30]: I had begun to be always decorating the chambers in some quite unnecessary and inappropriate way or other , and very expensive those wrestles with Barnard proved to be .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 35]: By this time , the rooms were vastly different from what I had found them , and I enjoyed the honor of occupying a few prominent pages in the books of a neighboring upholsterer .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 40]: I had got on so fast of late , that I had even started a boy in boots , -- top boots , -- in bondage and slavery to whom I might have been said to pass my days .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 72]: For , after I had made the monster -LRB- out of the refuse of my washerwoman 's family -RRB- , and had clothed him with a blue coat , canary waistcoat , white cravat , creamy breeches , and the boots already mentioned , I had to find him a little to do and a great deal to eat ; and with both of those horrible requirements he haunted my existence .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 45]: This avenging phantom was ordered to be on duty at eight on Tuesday morning in the hall , -LRB- it was two feet square , as charged for floorcloth , -RRB- and Herbert suggested certain things for breakfast that he thought Joe would like .
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 46]: While I felt sincerely obliged to him for being so interested and considerate , I had an odd half-provoked sense of suspicion upon me , that if Joe had been coming to see him , he would n't have been quite so brisk about it .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 38]: However , I came into town on the Monday night to be ready for Joe , and I got up early in the morning , and caused the sitting-room and breakfast-table to assume their most splendid appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 33]: Unfortunately the morning was drizzly , and an angel could not have concealed the fact that Barnard was shedding sooty tears outside the window , like some weak giant of a Sweep .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 32]: As the time approached I should have liked to run away , but the Avenger pursuant to orders was in the hall , and presently I heard Joe on the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 49]: I knew it was Joe , by his clumsy manner of coming up stairs , -- his state boots being always too big for him , -- and by the time it took him to read the names on the other floors in the course of his ascent .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 35]: When at last he stopped outside our door , I could hear his finger tracing over the painted letters of my name , and I afterwards distinctly heard him breathing in at the keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 27]: Finally he gave a faint single rap , and Pepper -- such was the compromising name of the avenging boy -- announced `` Mr. Gargery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 32]: I thought he never would have done wiping his feet , and that I must have gone out to lift him off the mat , but at last he came in .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 10]: `` Joe , how are you , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 10]: `` Pip , how AIR you , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 43]: With his good honest face all glowing and shining , and his hat put down on the floor between us , he caught both my hands and worked them straight up and down , as if I had been the last-patented Pump .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 10]: `` I am glad to see you , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 6]: Give me your hat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 46]: But Joe , taking it up carefully with both hands , like a bird 's - nest with eggs in it , would n't hear of parting with that piece of property , and persisted in standing talking over it in a most uncomfortable way .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 47]: `` Which you have that growed , '' said Joe , `` and that swelled , and that gentle-folked ; '' Joe considered a little before he discovered this word ; `` as to be sure you are a honor to your king and country . ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 11]: `` And you , Joe , look wonderfully well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 15]: `` Thank God , '' said Joe , `` I 'm ekerval to most .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 12]: And your sister , she 's no worse than she were .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 10]: And Biddy , she 's ever right and ready .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 12]: And all friends is no backerder , if not no forarder .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 11]: ` Ceptin Wopsle ; he 's had a drop . ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 41]: All this time -LRB- still with both hands taking great care of the bird 's - nest -RRB- , Joe was rolling his eyes round and round the room , and round and round the flowered pattern of my dressing-gown .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 8]: `` Had a drop , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 24]: `` Why yes , '' said Joe , lowering his voice , `` he 's left the Church and went into the playacting .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 13]: Which the playacting have likeways brought him to London along with me .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 48]: And his wish were , '' said Joe , getting the bird 's - nest under his left arm for the moment , and groping in it for an egg with his right ; `` if no offence , as I would ` and you that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 66]: I took what Joe gave me , and found it to be the crumpled play-bill of a small metropolitan theatre , announcing the first appearance , in that very week , of `` the celebrated Provincial Amateur of Roscian renown , whose unique performance in the highest tragic walk of our National Bard has lately occasioned so great a sensation in local dramatic circles . ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 10]: `` Were you at his performance , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 13]: `` I were , '' said Joe , with emphasis and solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 8]: `` Was there a great sensation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 18]: `` Why , '' said Joe , `` yes , there certainly were a peck of orange-peel .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 7]: Partickler when he see the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 43]: Though I put it to yourself , sir , whether it were calc ` lated to keep a man up to his work with a good hart , to be continiwally cutting in betwixt him and the Ghost with `` Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 45]: A man may have had a misfortun ' and been in the Church , '' said Joe , lowering his voice to an argumentative and feeling tone , `` but that is no reason why you should put him out at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 27]: Which I meantersay , if the ghost of a man 's own father can not be allowed to claim his attention , what can , Sir ?
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 35]: Still more , when his mourning ` at is unfortunately made so small as that the weight of the black feathers brings it off , try to keep it on how you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 17]: A ghost-seeing effect in Joe 's own countenance informed me that Herbert had entered the room .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 30]: So , I presented Joe to Herbert , who held out his hand ; but Joe backed from it , and held on by the bird 's - nest .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 84]: `` Your servant , Sir , '' said Joe , `` which I hope as you and Pip '' -- here his eye fell on the Avenger , who was putting some toast on table , and so plainly denoted an intention to make that young gentleman one of the family , that I frowned it down and confused him more -- `` I meantersay , you two gentlemen , -- which I hope as you get your elths in this close spot ?
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 65]: For the present may be a werry good inn , according to London opinions , '' said Joe , confidentially , `` and I believe its character do stand i ; but I would n't keep a pig in it myself , -- not in the case that I wished him to fatten wholesome and to eat with a meller flavor on him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 96]: Having borne this flattering testimony to the merits of our dwelling-place , and having incidentally shown this tendency to call me `` sir , '' Joe , being invited to sit down to table , looked all round the room for a suitable spot on which to deposit his hat , -- as if it were only on some very few rare substances in nature that it could find a resting place , -- and ultimately stood it on an extreme corner of the chimney-piece , from which it ever afterwards fell off at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 13]: `` Do you take tea , or coffee , Mr. Gargery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 10]: asked Herbert , who always presided of a morning .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 27]: `` Thankee , Sir , '' said Joe , stiff from head to foot , `` I 'll take whichever is most agreeable to yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 9]: `` What do you say to coffee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 37]: `` Thankee , Sir , '' returned Joe , evidently dispirited by the proposal , `` since you are so kind as make chice of coffee , I will not run contrairy to your own opinions .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 13]: But do n't you never find it a little ` eating ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 13]: `` Say tea then , '' said Herbert , pouring it out .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 30]: Here Joe 's hat tumbled off the mantel-piece , and he started out of his chair and picked it up , and fitted it to the same exact spot .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: As if it were an absolute point of good breeding that it should tumble off again soon .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 12]: `` When did you come to town , Mr. Gargery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 7]: `` Were it yesterday afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 23]: said Joe , after coughing behind his hand , as if he had had time to catch the whooping-cough since he came .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 6]: `` No it were not .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 4]: Yes it were .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 20]: It were yesterday afternoon '' -LRB- with an appearance of mingled wisdom , relief , and strict impartiality -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 10]: `` Have you seen anything of London yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 25]: `` Why , yes , Sir , '' said Joe , `` me and Wopsle went off straight to look at the Blacking Ware'us .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 44]: But we did n't find that it come up to its likeness in the red bills at the shop doors ; which I meantersay , '' added Joe , in an explanatory manner , `` as it is there drawd too architectooralooral . ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 42]: I really believe Joe would have prolonged this word -LRB- mightily expressive to my mind of some architecture that I know -RRB- into a perfect Chorus , but for his attention being providentially attracted by his hat , which was toppling .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 25]: Indeed , it demanded from him a constant attention , and a quickness of eye and hand , very like that exacted by wicket-keeping .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 89]: He made extraordinary play with it , and showed the greatest skill ; now , rushing at it and catching it neatly as it dropped ; now , merely stopping it midway , beating it up , and humoring it in various parts of the room and against a good deal of the pattern of the paper on the wall , before he felt it safe to close with it ; finally splashing it into the slop-basin , where I took the liberty of laying hands upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 21]: As to his shirt-collar , and his coat-collar , they were perplexing to reflect upon , -- insoluble mysteries both .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 18]: Why should a man scrape himself to that extent , before he could consider himself full dressed ?
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 16]: Why should he suppose it necessary to be purified by suffering for his holiday clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 75]: Then he fell into such unaccountable fits of meditation , with his fork midway between his plate and his mouth ; had his eyes attracted in such strange directions ; was afflicted with such remarkable coughs ; sat so far from the table , and dropped so much more than he ate , and pretended that he had n't dropped it ; that I was heartily glad when Herbert left us for the City .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 37]: I had neither the good sense nor the good feeling to know that this was all my fault , and that if I had been easier with Joe , Joe would have been easier with me .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 24]: I felt impatient of him and out of temper with him ; in which condition he heaped coals of fire on my head .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 14]: `` Us two being now alone , sir , '' -- began Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 19]: `` Joe , '' I interrupted , pettishly , `` how can you call me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 14]: Joe looked at me for a single instant with something faintly like reproach .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 25]: Utterly preposterous as his cravat was , and as his collars were , I was conscious of a sort of dignity in the look .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 47]: `` Us two being now alone , '' resumed Joe , `` and me having the intentions and abilities to stay not many minutes more , I will now conclude -- leastways begin -- to mention what have led to my having had the present honor .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 48]: For was it not , '' said Joe , with his old air of lucid exposition , `` that my only wish were to be useful to you , I should not have had the honor of breaking wittles in the company and abode of gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 19]: I was so unwilling to see the look again , that I made no remonstrance against this tone .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 16]: `` Well , sir , '' pursued Joe , `` this is how it were .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 47]: I were at the Bargemen t ` other night , Pip ; '' -- whenever he subsided into affection , he called me Pip , and whenever he relapsed into politeness he called me sir ; `` when there come up in his shay-cart , Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 56]: Which that same identical , '' said Joe , going down a new track , `` do comb my ` air the wrong way sometimes , awful , by giving out up and down town as it were him which ever had your infant companionation and were looked upon as a playfellow by yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 3]: `` Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 7]: It was you , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 28]: `` Which I fully believed it were , Pip , '' said Joe , slightly tossing his head , `` though it signify little now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 66]: Well , Pip ; this same identical , which his manners is given to blusterous , come to me at the Bargemen -LRB- wot a pipe and a pint of beer do give refreshment to the workingman , sir , and do not over stimilate -RRB- , and his word were , ` Joseph , Miss Havisham she wish to speak to you . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 8]: `` Miss Havisham , Joe ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 18]: ` She wish , ' were Pumblechook 's word , ` to speak to you . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 10]: Joe sat and rolled his eyes at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 5]: `` Yes , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 6]: Go on , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 41]: `` Next day , sir , '' said Joe , looking at me as if I were a long way off , `` having cleaned myself , I go and I see Miss A. '' `` Miss A. , Joe ?
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 4]: Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 34]: `` Which I say , sir , '' replied Joe , with an air of legal formality , as if he were making his will , `` Miss A. , or otherways Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 11]: Her expression air then as follering : ` Mr. Gargery .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 9]: You air in correspondence with Mr. Pip ? '
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 17]: Having had a letter from you , I were able to say ` I am . '
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 33]: -LRB- When I married your sister , sir , I said ` I will ; ' and when I answered your friend , Pip , I said ` I am . ' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 29]: ` Would you tell him , then , ' said she , ` that which Estella has come home and would be glad to see him . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 12]: I felt my face fire up as I looked at Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 29]: I hope one remote cause of its firing may have been my consciousness that if I had known his errand , I should have given him more encouragement .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 28]: `` Biddy , '' pursued Joe , `` when I got home and asked her fur to write the message to you , a little hung back .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 33]: Biddy says , `` I know he will be very glad to have it by word of mouth , it is holiday time , you want to see him , go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 38]: I have now concluded , sir , '' said Joe , rising from his chair , `` and , Pip , I wish you ever well and ever prospering to a greater and a greater height . ''
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 11]: `` But you are not going now , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 9]: `` Yes I am , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 12]: `` But you are coming back to dinner , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 10]: `` No I am not , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 23]: Our eyes met , and all the `` ir '' melted out of that manly heart as he gave me his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 48]: `` Pip , dear old chap , life is made of ever so many partings welded together , as I may say , and one man 's a blacksmith , and one 's a whitesmith , and one 's a goldsmith , and one 's a coppersmith .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 14]: Diwisions among such must come , and must be met as they come .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 14]: If there 's been any fault at all to-day , it 's mine .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 30]: You and me is not two figures to be together in London ; nor yet anywheres else but what is private , and beknown , and understood among friends .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 28]: It ai n't that I am proud , but that I want to be right , as you shall never see me no more in these clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 7]: I 'm wrong in these clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 17]: I 'm wrong out of the forge , the kitchen , or off th ' meshes .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 32]: You wo n't find half so much fault in me if you think of me in my forge dress , with my hammer in my hand , or even my pipe .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 58]: You wo n't find half so much fault in me if , supposing as you should ever wish to see me , you come and put your head in at the forge window and see Joe the blacksmith , there , at the old anvil , in the old burnt apron , sticking to the old work .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 21]: I 'm awful dull , but I hope I 've beat out something nigh the rights of this at last .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 18]: And so GOD bless you , dear old Pip , old chap , GOD bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 17]: I had not been mistaken in my fancy that there was a simple dignity in him .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 27]: The fashion of his dress could no more come in its way when he spoke these words than it could come in its way in Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 12]: He touched me gently on the forehead , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 28]: As soon as I could recover myself sufficiently , I hurried out after him and looked for him in the neighboring streets ; but he was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 36]: Chapter XXVIII It was clear that I must repair to our town next day , and in the first flow of my repentance , it was equally clear that I must stay at Joe 's .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 52]: But , when I had secured my box-place by to-morrow 's coach , and had been down to Mr. Pocket 's and back , I was not by any means convinced on the last point , and began to invent reasons and make excuses for putting up at the Blue Boar .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 42]: I should be an inconvenience at Joe 's ; I was not expected , and my bed would not be ready ; I should be too far from Miss Havisham 's , and she was exacting and might n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 20]: All other swindlers upon earth are nothing to the self-swindlers , and with such pretences did I cheat myself .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 5]: Surely a curious thing .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 34]: That I should innocently take a bad half-crown of somebody else 's manufacture is reasonable enough ; but that I should knowingly reckon the spurious coin of my own make as good money !
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 50]: An obliging stranger , under pretence of compactly folding up my bank-notes for security 's sake , abstracts the notes and gives me nutshells ; but what is his sleight of hand to mine , when I fold up my own nutshells and pass them on myself as notes !
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 26]: Having settled that I must go to the Blue Boar , my mind was much disturbed by indecision whether or not to take the Avenger .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 48]: It was tempting to think of that expensive Mercenary publicly airing his boots in the archway of the Blue Boar 's posting-yard ; it was almost solemn to imagine him casually produced in the tailor 's shop , and confounding the disrespectful senses of Trabb 's boy .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 54]: On the other hand , Trabb 's boy might worm himself into his intimacy and tell him things ; or , reckless and desperate wretch as I knew he could be , might hoot him in the High Street , My patroness , too , might hear of him , and not approve .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 12]: On the whole , I resolved to leave the Avenger behind .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 37]: It was the afternoon coach by which I had taken my place , and , as winter had now come round , I should not arrive at my destination until two or three hours after dark .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 12]: Our time of starting from the Cross Keys was two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 40]: I arrived on the ground with a quarter of an hour to spare , attended by the Avenger , -- if I may connect that expression with one who never attended on me if he could possibly help it .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 16]: At that time it was customary to carry Convicts down to the dock-yards by stage-coach .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 64]: As I had often heard of them in the capacity of outside passengers , and had more than once seen them on the high road dangling their ironed legs over the coach roof , I had no cause to be surprised when Herbert , meeting me in the yard , came up and told me there were two convicts going down with me .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 23]: But I had a reason that was an old reason now for constitutionally faltering whenever I heard the word `` convict . ''
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 10]: `` You do n't mind them , Handel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 5]: `` O no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 14]: `` I thought you seemed as if you did n't like them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 19]: `` I ca n't pretend that I do like them , and I suppose you do n't particularly .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 8]: But I do n't mind them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 3]: `` See !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 15]: There they are , '' said Herbert , `` coming out of the Tap .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 10]: What a degraded and vile sight it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 30]: They had been treating their guard , I suppose , for they had a gaoler with them , and all three came out wiping their mouths on their hands .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 24]: The two convicts were handcuffed together , and had irons on their legs , -- irons of a pattern that I knew well .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 10]: They wore the dress that I likewise knew well .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 68]: Their keeper had a brace of pistols , and carried a thick-knobbed bludgeon under his arm ; but he was on terms of good understanding with them , and stood with them beside him , looking on at the putting-to of the horses , rather with an air as if the convicts were an interesting Exhibition not formally open at the moment , and he the Curator .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 45]: One was a taller and stouter man than the other , and appeared as a matter of course , according to the mysterious ways of the world , both convict and free , to have had allotted to him the smaller suit of clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 29]: His arms and legs were like great pincushions of those shapes , and his attire disguised him absurdly ; but I knew his half-closed eye at one glance .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 32]: There stood the man whom I had seen on the settle at the Three Jolly Bargemen on a Saturday night , and who had brought me down with his invisible gun !
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 25]: It was easy to make sure that as yet he knew me no more than if he had never seen me in his life .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 47]: He looked across at me , and his eye appraised my watch-chain , and then he incidentally spat and said something to the other convict , and they laughed and slued themselves round with a clink of their coupling manacle , and looked at something else .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 67]: The great numbers on their backs , as if they were street doors ; their coarse mangy ungainly outer surface , as if they were lower animals ; their ironed legs , apologetically garlanded with pocket-handkerchiefs ; and the way in which all present looked at them and kept from them ; made them -LRB- as Herbert had said -RRB- a most disagreeable and degraded spectacle .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 9]: But this was not the worst of it .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 42]: It came out that the whole of the back of the coach had been taken by a family removing from London , and that there were no places for the two prisoners but on the seat in front behind the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 64]: Hereupon , a choleric gentleman , who had taken the fourth place on that seat , flew into a most violent passion , and said that it was a breach of contract to mix him up with such villainous company , and that it was poisonous , and pernicious , and infamous , and shameful , and I do n't know what else .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 54]: At this time the coach was ready and the coachman impatient , and we were all preparing to get up , and the prisoners had come over with their keeper , -- bringing with them that curious flavor of bread-poultice , baize , rope-yarn , and hearthstone , which attends the convict presence .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 28]: `` Do n't take it so much amiss , sir , '' pleaded the keeper to the angry passenger ; `` I 'll sit next you myself .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 11]: I 'll put 'em on the outside of the row .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 9]: They wo n't interfere with you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 9]: You need n't know they 're there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 15]: `` And do n't blame me , '' growled the convict I had recognized .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 8]: `` I do n't want to go .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 8]: I am quite ready to stay behind .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 15]: As fur as I am concerned any one 's welcome to my place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 11]: `` Or mine , '' said the other , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 18]: `` I would n't have incommoded none of you , if I 'd had my way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 16]: Then they both laughed , and began cracking nuts , and spitting the shells about .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 24]: -- As I really think I should have liked to do myself , if I had been in their place and so despised .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 30]: At length , it was voted that there was no help for the angry gentleman , and that he must either go in his chance company or remain behind .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 52]: So he got into his place , still making complaints , and the keeper got into the place next him , and the convicts hauled themselves up as well as they could , and the convict I had recognized sat behind me with his breath on the hair of my head .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 7]: `` Good by , Handel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 7]: Herbert called out as we started .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 20]: I thought what a blessed fortune it was , that he had found another name for me than Pip .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 30]: It is impossible to express with what acuteness I felt the convict 's breathing , not only on the back of my head , but all along my spine .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 24]: The sensation was like being touched in the marrow with some pungent and searching acid , it set my very teeth on edge .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 42]: He seemed to have more breathing business to do than another man , and to make more noise in doing it ; and I was conscious of growing high-shouldered on one side , in my shrinking endeavors to fend him off .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 13]: The weather was miserably raw , and the two cursed the cold .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 30]: It made us all lethargic before we had gone far , and when we had left the Half-way House behind , we habitually dozed and shivered and were silent .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 37]: I dozed off , myself , in considering the question whether I ought to restore a couple of pounds sterling to this creature before losing sight of him , and how it could best be done .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 29]: In the act of dipping forward as if I were going to bathe among the horses , I woke in a fright and took the question up again .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 46]: But I must have lost it longer than I had thought , since , although I could recognize nothing in the darkness and the fitful lights and shadows of our lamps , I traced marsh country in the cold damp wind that blew at us .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 23]: Cowering forward for warmth and to make me a screen against the wind , the convicts were closer to me than before .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 28]: The very first words I heard them interchange as I became conscious , were the words of my own thought , `` Two One Pound notes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 8]: `` How did he get 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 8]: said the convict I had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: `` How should I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 8]: `` He had 'em stowed away somehows .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 9]: Giv him by friends , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 25]: `` I wish , '' said the other , with a bitter curse upon the cold , `` that I had 'em here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 10]: `` Two one pound notes , or friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 6]: `` Two one pound notes .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 20]: I 'd sell all the friends I ever had for one , and think it a blessed good bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 2]: Well ?
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 6]: So he says -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 46]: `` So he says , '' resumed the convict I had recognized , -- `` it was all said and done in half a minute , behind a pile of timber in the Dock-yard , -- ` You 're a going to be discharged ? '
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 5]: Yes , I was .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 24]: Would I find out that boy that had fed him and kep his secret , and give him them two one pound notes ?
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 5]: Yes , I would .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: And I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 10]: `` More fool you , '' growled the other .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 15]: `` I 'd have spent 'em on a Man , in wittles and drink .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 8]: He must have been a green one .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 10]: Mean to say he knowed nothing of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 7]: `` Not a ha ` porth .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 6]: Different gangs and different ships .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 15]: He was tried again for prison breaking , and got made a Lifer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 7]: `` And was that -- Honor !
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 16]: -- the only time you worked out , in this part of the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 6]: `` The only time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: `` What might have been your opinion of the place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 6]: `` A most beastly place .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 19]: Mudbank , mist , swamp , and work ; work , swamp , mist , and mudbank . ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 23]: They both execrated the place in very strong language , and gradually growled themselves out , and had nothing left to say .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 37]: After overhearing this dialogue , I should assuredly have got down and been left in the solitude and darkness of the highway , but for feeling certain that the man had no suspicion of my identity .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 39]: Indeed , I was not only so changed in the course of nature , but so differently dressed and so differently circumstanced , that it was not at all likely he could have known me without accidental help .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 40]: Still , the coincidence of our being together on the coach , was sufficiently strange to fill me with a dread that some other coincidence might at any moment connect me , in his hearing , with my name .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 24]: For this reason , I resolved to alight as soon as we touched the town , and put myself out of his hearing .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 6]: This device I executed successfully .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 51]: My little portmanteau was in the boot under my feet ; I had but to turn a hinge to get it out ; I threw it down before me , got down after it , and was left at the first lamp on the first stones of the town pavement .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: As to the convicts , they went their way with the coach , and I knew at what point they would be spirited off to the river .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 32]: In my fancy , I saw the boat with its convict crew waiting for them at the slime-washed stairs , -- again heard the gruff `` Give way , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 21]: like and order to dogs , -- again saw the wicked Noah 's Ark lying out on the black water .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 28]: I could not have said what I was afraid of , for my fear was altogether undefined and vague , but there was great fear upon me .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 30]: As I walked on to the hotel , I felt that a dread , much exceeding the mere apprehension of a painful or disagreeable recognition , made me tremble .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 27]: I am confident that it took no distinctness of shape , and that it was the revival for a few minutes of the terror of childhood .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 32]: The coffee-room at the Blue Boar was empty , and I had not only ordered my dinner there , but had sat down to it , before the waiter knew me .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 25]: As soon as he had apologized for the remissness of his memory , he asked me if he should send Boots for Mr. Pumblechook ?
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 12]: `` No , '' said I , `` certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 118]: The waiter -LRB- it was he who had brought up the Great Remonstrance from the Commercials , on the day when I was bound -RRB- appeared surprised , and took the earliest opportunity of putting a dirty old copy of a local newspaper so directly in my way , that I took it up and read this paragraph : -- Our readers will learn , not altogether without interest , in reference to the recent romantic rise in fortune of a young artificer in iron of this neighborhood -LRB- what a theme , by the way , for the magic pen of our as yet not universally acknowledged townsman TOOBY , the poet of our columns ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 46]: that the youth 's earliest patron , companion , and friend , was a highly respected individual not entirely unconnected with the corn and seed trade , and whose eminently convenient and commodious business premises are situate within a hundred miles of the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 39]: It is not wholly irrespective of our personal feelings that we record HIM as the Mentor of our young Telemachus , for it is good to know that our town produced the founder of the latter 's fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 19]: Does the thought-contracted brow of the local Sage or the lustrous eye of local Beauty inquire whose fortunes ?
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: We believe that Quintin Matsys was the BLACKSMITH of Antwerp .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 2]: VERB .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 2]: SAP .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 57]: I entertain a conviction , based upon large experience , that if in the days of my prosperity I had gone to the North Pole , I should have met somebody there , wandering Esquimaux or civilized man , who would have told me that Pumblechook was my earliest patron and the founder of my fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 12]: Chapter XXIX Betimes in the morning I was up and out .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 56]: It was too early yet to go to Miss Havisham 's , so I loitered into the country on Miss Havisham 's side of town , -- which was not Joe 's side ; I could go there to-morrow , -- thinking about my patroness , and painting brilliant pictures of her plans for me .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 27]: She had adopted Estella , she had as good as adopted me , and it could not fail to be her intention to bring us together .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 59]: She reserved it for me to restore the desolate house , admit the sunshine into the dark rooms , set the clocks a-going and the cold hearths a-blazing , tear down the cobwebs , destroy the vermin , -- in short , do all the shining deeds of the young Knight of romance , and marry the Princess .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 60]: I had stopped to look at the house as I passed ; and its seared red brick walls , blocked windows , and strong green ivy clasping even the stacks of chimneys with its twigs and tendons , as if with sinewy old arms , had made up a rich attractive mystery , of which I was the hero .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 16]: Estella was the inspiration of it , and the heart of it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 56]: But , though she had taken such strong possession of me , though my fancy and my hope were so set upon her , though her influence on my boyish life and character had been all-powerful , I did not , even that romantic morning , invest her with any attributes save those she possessed .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 29]: I mention this in this place , of a fixed purpose , because it is the clew by which I am to be followed into my poor labyrinth .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 17]: According to my experience , the conventional notion of a lover can not be always true .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 27]: The unqualified truth is , that when I loved Estella with the love of a man , I loved her simply because I found her irresistible .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 44]: Once for all ; I knew to my sorrow , often and often , if not always , that I loved her against reason , against promise , against peace , against hope , against happiness , against all discouragement that could be .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 36]: Once for all ; I loved her none the less because I knew it , and it had no more influence in restraining me than if I had devoutly believed her to be human perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 17]: I so shaped out my walk as to arrive at the gate at my old time .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 37]: When I had rung at the bell with an unsteady hand , I turned my back upon the gate , while I tried to get my breath and keep the beating of my heart moderately quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 30]: I heard the side-door open , and steps come across the courtyard ; but I pretended not to hear , even when the gate swung on its rusty hinges .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 13]: Being at last touched on the shoulder , I started and turned .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 20]: I started much more naturally then , to find myself confronted by a man in a sober gray dress .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 20]: The last man I should have expected to see in that place of porter at Miss Havisham 's door .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 4]: `` Orlick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 13]: `` Ah , young master , there 's more changes than yours .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 7]: But come in , come in .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 13]: It 's opposed to my orders to hold the gate open . ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 17]: I entered and he swung it , and locked it , and took the key out .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 17]: said he , facing round , after doggedly preceding me a few steps towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 6]: `` Here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 8]: `` How did you come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 14]: `` I come her , '' he retorted , `` on my legs .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 12]: I had my box brought alongside me in a barrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 8]: `` Are you here for good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 15]: `` I ai n't here for harm , young master , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 8]: I was not so sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 32]: I had leisure to entertain the retort in my mind , while he slowly lifted his heavy glance from the pavement , up my legs and arms , to my face .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 9]: `` Then you have left the forge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 9]: `` Do this look like a forge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 15]: replied Orlick , sending his glance all round him with an air of injury .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 10]: `` Now , do it look like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 12]: I asked him how long he had left Gargery 's forge ?
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 24]: `` One day is so like another here , '' he replied , `` that I do n't know without casting it up .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 12]: However , I come here some time since you left . ''
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 11]: `` I could have told you that , Orlick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 5]: said he , dryly .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 12]: `` But then you 've got to be a scholar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 34]: By this time we had come to the house , where I found his room to be one just within the side-door , with a little window in it looking on the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 21]: In its small proportions , it was not unlike the kind of place usually assigned to a gate-porter in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 30]: Certain keys were hanging on the wall , to which he now added the gate key ; and his patchwork-covered bed was in a little inner division or recess .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 55]: The whole had a slovenly , confined , and sleepy look , like a cage for a human dormouse ; while he , looming dark and heavy in the shadow of a corner by the window , looked like the human dormouse for whom it was fitted up , -- as indeed he was .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 23]: `` I never saw this room before , '' I remarked ; `` but there used to be no Porter here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 43]: `` No , '' said he ; `` not till it got about that there was no protection on the premises , and it come to be considered dangerous , with convicts and Tag and Rag and Bobtail going up and down .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 27]: And then I was recommended to the place as a man who could give another man as good as he brought , and I took it .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 8]: It 's easier than bellowsing and hammering .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 9]: -- That 's loaded , that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 23]: My eye had been caught by a gun with a brass-bound stock over the chimney-piece , and his eye had followed mine .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 23]: `` Well , '' said I , not desirous of more conversation , `` shall I go up to Miss Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 9]: `` Burn me , if I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 20]: he retorted , first stretching himself and then shaking himself ; `` my orders ends here , young master .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 25]: I give this here bell a rap with this here hammer , and you go on along the passage till you meet somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 9]: `` I am expected , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 12]: `` Burn me twice over , if I can say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 26]: Upon that , I turned down the long passage which I had first trodden in my thick boots , and he made his bell sound .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 34]: At the end of the passage , while the bell was still reverberating , I found Sarah Pocket , who appeared to have now become constitutionally green and yellow by reason of me .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 10]: `` You , is it , Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 7]: `` It is , Miss Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 16]: I am glad to tell you that Mr. Pocket and family are all well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 7]: `` Are they any wiser ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 21]: said Sarah , with a dismal shake of the head ; `` they had better be wiser , than well .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 6]: Ah , Matthew , Matthew !
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 8]: You know your way , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 17]: Tolerably , for I had gone up the staircase in the dark , many a time .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 27]: I ascended it now , in lighter boots than of yore , and tapped in my old way at the door of Miss Havisham 's room .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 20]: `` Pip 's rap , '' I heard her say , immediately ; `` come in , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 37]: She was in her chair near the old table , in the old dress , with her two hands crossed on her stick , her chin resting on them , and her eyes on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 39]: Sitting near her , with the white shoe , that had never been worn , in her hand , and her head bent as she looked at it , was an elegant lady whom I had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 32]: `` Come in , Pip , '' Miss Havisham continued to mutter , without looking round or up ; `` come in , Pip , how do you do , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 14]: so you kiss my hand as if I were a queen , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 4]: -- Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 25]: She looked up at me suddenly , only moving her eyes , and repeated in a grimly playful manner , -- `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 38]: `` I heard , Miss Havisham , '' said I , rather at a loss , `` that you were so kind as to wish me to come and see you , and I came directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 31]: The lady whom I had never seen before , lifted up her eyes and looked archly at me , and then I saw that the eyes were Estella 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 38]: But she was so much changed , was so much more beautiful , so much more womanly , in all things winning admiration , had made such wonderful advance , that I seemed to have made none .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 22]: I fancied , as I looked at her , that I slipped hopelessly back into the coarse and common boy again .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 20]: O the sense of distance and disparity that came upon me , and the inaccessibility that came about her !
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 6]: She gave me her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 29]: I stammered something about the pleasure I felt in seeing her again , and about my having looked forward to it , for a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 11]: `` Do you find her much changed , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 31]: asked Miss Havisham , with her greedy look , and striking her stick upon a chair that stood between them , as a sign to me to sit down there .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 38]: `` When I came in , Miss Havisham , I thought there was nothing of Estella in the face or figure ; but now it all settles down so curiously into the old -- '' `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 12]: You are not going to say into the old Estella ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 4]: Miss Havisham interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 16]: `` She was proud and insulting , and you wanted to go away from her .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 6]: Do n't you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 21]: I said confusedly that that was long ago , and that I knew no better then , and the like .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 27]: Estella smiled with perfect composure , and said she had no doubt of my having been quite right , and of her having been very disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 6]: `` Is he changed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 5]: Miss Havisham asked her .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 12]: `` Very much , '' said Estella , looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 7]: `` Less coarse and common ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 10]: said Miss Havisham , playing with Estella 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 27]: Estella laughed , and looked at the shoe in her hand , and laughed again , and looked at me , and put the shoe down .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 14]: She treated me as a boy still , but she lured me on .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 39]: We sat in the dreamy room among the old strange influences which had so wrought upon me , and I learnt that she had but just come home from France , and that she was going to London .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 39]: Proud and wilful as of old , she had brought those qualities into such subjection to her beauty that it was impossible and out of nature -- or I thought so -- to separate them from her beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 87]: Truly it was impossible to dissociate her presence from all those wretched hankerings after money and gentility that had disturbed my boyhood , -- from all those ill-regulated aspirations that had first made me ashamed of home and Joe , -- from all those visions that had raised her face in the glowing fire , struck it out of the iron on the anvil , extracted it from the darkness of night to look in at the wooden window of the forge , and flit away .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 29]: In a word , it was impossible for me to separate her , in the past or in the present , from the innermost life of my life .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 28]: It was settled that I should stay there all the rest of the day , and return to the hotel at night , and to London to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 46]: When we had conversed for a while , Miss Havisham sent us two out to walk in the neglected garden : on our coming in by and by , she said , I should wheel her about a little , as in times of yore .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 58]: So , Estella and I went out into the garden by the gate through which I had strayed to my encounter with the pale young gentleman , now Herbert ; I , trembling in spirit and worshipping the very hem of her dress ; she , quite composed and most decidedly not worshipping the hem of mine .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 46]: As we drew near to the place of encounter , she stopped and said , -- `` I must have been a singular little creature to hide and see that fight that day ; but I did , and I enjoyed it very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 8]: `` You rewarded me very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 10]: she replied , in an incidental and forgetful way .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 31]: `` I remember I entertained a great objection to your adversary , because I took it ill that he should be brought here to pester me with his company . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 10]: `` He and I are great friends now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 4]: `` Are you ?
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 14]: I think I recollect though , that you read with his father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 28]: I made the admission with reluctance , for it seemed to have a boyish look , and she already treated me more than enough like a boy .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 19]: `` Since your change of fortune and prospects , you have changed your companions , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 38]: `` Naturally , '' said I. `` And necessarily , '' she added , in a haughty tone ; `` what was fit company for you once , would be quite unfit company for you now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 33]: In my conscience , I doubt very much whether I had any lingering intention left of going to see Joe ; but if I had , this observation put it to flight .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 16]: `` You had no idea of your impending good fortune , in those times ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 17]: said Estella , with a slight wave of her hand , signifying in the fighting times .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 6]: `` Not the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 36]: The air of completeness and superiority with which she walked at my side , and the air of youthfulness and submission with which I walked at hers , made a contrast that I strongly felt .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 32]: It would have rankled in me more than it did , if I had not regarded myself as eliciting it by being so set apart for her and assigned to her .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 35]: The garden was too overgrown and rank for walking in with ease , and after we had made the round of it twice or thrice , we came out again into the brewery yard .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 40]: I showed her to a nicety where I had seen her walking on the casks , that first old day , and she said , with a cold and careless look in that direction , `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 30]: I reminded her where she had come out of the house and given me my meat and drink , and she said , `` I do n't remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 10]: `` Not remember that you made me cry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 18]: said I. `` No , '' said she , and shook her head and looked about her .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 31]: I verily believe that her not remembering and not minding in the least , made me cry again , inwardly , -- and that is the sharpest crying of all .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 39]: `` You must know , '' said Estella , condescending to me as a brilliant and beautiful woman might , `` that I have no heart , -- if that has anything to do with my memory . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 17]: I got through some jargon to the effect that I took the liberty of doubting that .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 5]: That I knew better .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 10]: That there could be no such beauty without it .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 36]: I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in , I have no doubt , '' said Estella , `` and of course if it ceased to beat I should cease to be .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 7]: But you know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 13]: I have no softness there , no -- sympathy-sentiment -- nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 20]: What was it that was borne in upon my mind when she stood still and looked attentively at me ?
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 9]: Anything that I had seen in Miss Havisham ?
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 65]: In some of her looks and gestures there was that tinge of resemblance to Miss Havisham which may often be noticed to have been acquired by children , from grown person with whom they have been much associated and secluded , and which , when childhood is passed , will produce a remarkable occasional likeness of expression between faces that are otherwise quite different .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 11]: And yet I could not trace this to Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 18]: I looked again , and though she was still looking at me , the suggestion was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 48]: `` I am serious , '' said Estella , not so much with a frown -LRB- for her brow was smooth -RRB- as with a darkening of her face ; `` if we are to be thrown much together , you had better believe it at once .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 9]: imperiously stopping me as I opened my lips .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 9]: `` I have not bestowed my tenderness anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 9]: I have never had any such thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 53]: In another moment we were in the brewery , so long disused , and she pointed to the high gallery where I had seen her going out on that same first day , and told me she remembered to have been up there , and to have seen me standing scared below .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 22]: As my eyes followed her white hand , again the same dim suggestion that I could not possibly grasp crossed me .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 13]: My involuntary start occasioned her to lay her hand upon my arm .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 10]: Instantly the ghost passed once more and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 4]: What was it ?
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 3]: asked Estella .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 7]: `` Are you scared again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 23]: `` I should be , if I believed what you said just now , '' I replied , to turn it off .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 6]: `` Then you do n't ?
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 8]: It is said , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 27]: Miss Havisham will soon be expecting you at your old post , though I think that might be laid aside now , with other old belongings .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 15]: Let us make one more round of the garden , and then go in .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 23]: You shall not shed tears for my cruelty to-day ; you shall be my Page , and give me your shoulder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 9]: Her handsome dress had trailed upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 20]: She held it in one hand now , and with the other lightly touched my shoulder as we walked .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 20]: We walked round the ruined garden twice or thrice more , and it was all in bloom for me .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 36]: If the green and yellow growth of weed in the chinks of the old wall had been the most precious flowers that ever blew , it could not have been more cherished in my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 80]: There was no discrepancy of years between us to remove her far from me ; we were of nearly the same age , though of course the age told for more in her case than in mine ; but the air of inaccessibility which her beauty and her manner gave her , tormented me in the midst of my delight , and at the height of the assurance I felt that our patroness had chosen us for one another .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 3]: Wretched boy !
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 37]: At last we went back into the house , and there I heard , with surprise , that my guardian had come down to see Miss Havisham on business , and would come back to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 35]: The old wintry branches of chandeliers in the room where the mouldering table was spread had been lighted while we were out , and Miss Havisham was in her chair and waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 28]: It was like pushing the chair itself back into the past , when we began the old slow circuit round about the ashes of the bridal feast .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 40]: But , in the funereal room , with that figure of the grave fallen back in the chair fixing its eyes upon her , Estella looked more bright and beautiful than before , and I was under stronger enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 23]: The time so melted away , that our early dinner-hour drew close at hand , and Estella left us to prepare herself .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 36]: We had stopped near the centre of the long table , and Miss Havisham , with one of her withered arms stretched out of the chair , rested that clenched hand upon the yellow cloth .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 34]: As Estella looked back over her shoulder before going out at the door , Miss Havisham kissed that hand to her , with a ravenous intensity that was of its kind quite dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 32]: Then , Estella being gone and we two left alone , she turned to me , and said in a whisper , -- `` Is she beautiful , graceful , well-grown ?
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 6]: Do you admire her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 11]: `` Everybody must who sees her , Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 23]: She drew an arm round my neck , and drew my head close down to hers as she sat in the chair .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 10]: `` Love her , love her , love her !
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 7]: How does she use you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 30]: Before I could answer -LRB- if I could have answered so difficult a question at all -RRB- she repeated , `` Love her , love her , love her !
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 8]: If she favors you , love her .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 8]: If she wounds you , love her .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 32]: If she tears your heart to pieces , -- and as it gets older and stronger it will tear deeper , -- love her , love her , love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 17]: Never had I seen such passionate eagerness as was joined to her utterance of these words .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 20]: I could feel the muscles of the thin arm round my neck swell with the vehemence that possessed her .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 6]: `` Hear me , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 8]: I adopted her , to be loved .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 11]: I bred her and educated her , to be loved .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 14]: I developed her into what she is , that she might be loved .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 4]: Love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 53]: She said the word often enough , and there could be no doubt that she meant to say it ; but if the often repeated word had been hate instead of love -- despair -- revenge -- dire death -- it could not have sounded from her lips more like a curse .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 23]: `` I 'll tell you , '' said she , in the same hurried passionate whisper , `` what real love is .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 38]: It is blind devotion , unquestioning self-humiliation , utter submission , trust and belief against yourself and against the whole world , giving up your whole heart and soul to the smiter -- as I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 22]: When she came to that , and to a wild cry that followed that , I caught her round the waist .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 36]: For she rose up in the chair , in her shroud of a dress , and struck at the air as if she would as soon have struck herself against the wall and fallen dead .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 8]: All this passed in a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 29]: As I drew her down into her chair , I was conscious of a scent that I knew , and turning , saw my guardian in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 35]: He always carried -LRB- I have not yet mentioned it , I think -RRB- a pocket-handkerchief of rich silk and of imposing proportions , which was of great value to him in his profession .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 65]: I have seen him so terrify a client or a witness by ceremoniously unfolding this pocket-handkerchief as if he were immediately going to blow his nose , and then pausing , as if he knew he should not have time to do it before such client or witness committed himself , that the self-committal has followed directly , quite as a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 22]: When I saw him in the room he had this expressive pocket-handkerchief in both hands , and was looking at us .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 22]: On meeting my eye , he said plainly , by a momentary and silent pause in that attitude , `` Indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 3]: Singular ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 13]: and then put the handkerchief to its right use with wonderful effect .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 21]: Miss Havisham had seen him as soon as I , and was -LRB- like everybody else -RRB- afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 19]: She made a strong attempt to compose herself , and stammered that he was as punctual as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 16]: `` As punctual as ever , '' he repeated , coming up to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 8]: -LRB- How do you do , Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 10]: Shall I give you a ride , Miss Havisham ?
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 4]: Once round ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 9]: And so you are here , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 21]: I told him when I had arrived , and how Miss Havisham had wished me to come and see Estella .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 8]: To which he replied , `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 6]: Very fine young lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 34]: Then he pushed Miss Havisham in her chair before him , with one of his large hands , and put the other in his trousers-pocket as if the pocket were full of secrets .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 5]: `` Well , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 10]: How often have you seen Miss Estella before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 10]: said he , when he came to a stop .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 5]: `` How often ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 4]: How many times ?
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 5]: Ten thousand times ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 6]: Certainly not so many . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: `` Twice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 28]: `` Jaggers , '' interposed Miss Havisham , much to my relief , `` leave my Pip alone , and go with him to your dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 14]: He complied , and we groped our way down the dark stairs together .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 50]: While we were still on our way to those detached apartments across the paved yard at the back , he asked me how often I had seen Miss Havisham eat and drink ; offering me a breadth of choice , as usual , between a hundred times and once .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 10]: I considered , and said , `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 16]: `` And never will , Pip , '' he retorted , with a frowning smile .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 21]: `` She has never allowed herself to be seen doing either , since she lived this present life of hers .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 19]: She wanders about in the night , and then lays hands on such food as she takes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 18]: `` Pray , sir , '' said I , `` may I ask you a question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 17]: `` You may , '' said he , `` and I may decline to answer it .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 5]: Put your question . ''
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 5]: `` Estella 's name .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 7]: Is it Havisham or -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 6]: I had nothing to add .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 5]: `` Or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 6]: `` Is it Havisham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 6]: `` It is Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 15]: This brought us to the dinner-table , where she and Sarah Pocket awaited us .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 18]: Mr. Jaggers presided , Estella sat opposite to him , I faced my green and yellow friend .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 42]: We dined very well , and were waited on by a maid-servant whom I had never seen in all my comings and goings , but who , for anything I know , had been in that mysterious house the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 31]: After dinner a bottle of choice old port was placed before my guardian -LRB- he was evidently well acquainted with the vintage -RRB- , and the two ladies left us .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 21]: Anything to equal the determined reticence of Mr. Jaggers under that roof I never saw elsewhere , even in him .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 21]: He kept his very looks to himself , and scarcely directed his eyes to Estella 's face once during dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 26]: When she spoke to him , he listened , and in due course answered , but never looked at her , that I could see .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 30]: On the other hand , she often looked at him , with interest and curiosity , if not distrust , but his face never , showed the least consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 65]: Throughout dinner he took a dry delight in making Sarah Pocket greener and yellower , by often referring in conversation with me to my expectations ; but here , again , he showed no consciousness , and even made it appear that he extorted -- and even did extort , though I do n't know how -- those references out of my innocent self .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 36]: And when he and I were left alone together , he sat with an air upon him of general lying by in consequence of information he possessed , that really was too much for me .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 13]: He cross-examined his very wine when he had nothing else in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 68]: He held it between himself and the candle , tasted the port , rolled it in his mouth , swallowed it , looked at his glass again , smelt the port , tried it , drank it , filled again , and cross-examined the glass again , until I was as nervous as if I had known the wine to be telling him something to my disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 63]: Three or four times I feebly thought I would start conversation ; but whenever he saw me going to ask him anything , he looked at me with his glass in his hand , and rolling his wine about in his mouth , as if requesting me to take notice that it was of no use , for he could n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 64]: I think Miss Pocket was conscious that the sight of me involved her in the danger of being goaded to madness , and perhaps tearing off her cap , -- which was a very hideous one , in the nature of a muslin mop , -- and strewing the ground with her hair , -- which assuredly had never grown on her head .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 22]: She did not appear when we afterwards went up to Miss Havisham 's room , and we four played at whist .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 74]: In the interval , Miss Havisham , in a fantastic way , had put some of the most beautiful jewels from her dressing-table into Estella 's hair , and about her bosom and arms ; and I saw even my guardian look at her from under his thick eyebrows , and raise them a little , when her loveliness was before him , with those rich flushes of glitter and color in it .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 77]: Of the manner and extent to which he took our trumps into custody , and came out with mean little cards at the ends of hands , before which the glory of our Kings and Queens was utterly abased , I say nothing ; nor , of the feeling that I had , respecting his looking upon us personally in the light of three very obvious and poor riddles that he had found out long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 18]: What I suffered from , was the incompatibility between his cold presence and my feelings towards Estella .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 89]: It was not that I knew I could never bear to speak to him about her , that I knew I could never bear to hear him creak his boots at her , that I knew I could never bear to see him wash his hands of her ; it was , that my admiration should be within a foot or two of him , -- it was , that my feelings should be in the same place with him , -- that , was the agonizing circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 47]: We played until nine o'clock , and then it was arranged that when Estella came to London I should be forewarned of her coming and should meet her at the coach ; and then I took leave of her , and touched her and left her .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 13]: My guardian lay at the Boar in the next room to mine .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 21]: Far into the night , Miss Havisham 's words , `` Love her , love her , love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 5]: sounded in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 28]: I adapted them for my own repetition , and said to my pillow , `` I love her , I love her , I love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 4]: hundreds of times .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 24]: Then , a burst of gratitude came upon me , that she should be destined for me , once the blacksmith 's boy .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 31]: Then I thought if she were , as I feared , by no means rapturously grateful for that destiny yet , when would she begin to be interested in me ?
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 15]: When should I awaken the heart within her that was mute and sleeping now ?
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 9]: I thought those were high and great emotions .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 27]: But I never thought there was anything low and small in my keeping away from Joe , because I knew she would be contemptuous of him .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 26]: It was but a day gone , and Joe had brought the tears into my eyes ; they had soon dried , God forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 3]: soon dried .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 47]: Chapter XXX After well considering the matter while I was dressing at the Blue Boar in the morning , I resolved to tell my guardian that I doubted Orlick 's being the right sort of man to fill a post of trust at Miss Havisham 's .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 47]: `` Why of course he is not the right sort of man , Pip , '' said my guardian , comfortably satisfied beforehand on the general head , `` because the man who fills the post of trust never is the right sort of man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 43]: It seemed quite to put him into spirits to find that this particular post was not exceptionally held by the right sort of man , and he listened in a satisfied manner while I told him what knowledge I had of Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 29]: `` Very good , Pip , '' he observed , when I had concluded , `` I 'll go round presently , and pay our friend off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 28]: Rather alarmed by this summary action , I was for a little delay , and even hinted that our friend himself might be difficult to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 34]: `` Oh no he wo n't , '' said my guardian , making his pocket-handkerchief-point , with perfect confidence ; `` I should like to see him argue the question with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 76]: As we were going back together to London by the midday coach , and as I breakfasted under such terrors of Pumblechook that I could scarcely hold my cup , this gave me an opportunity of saying that I wanted a walk , and that I would go on along the London road while Mr. Jaggers was occupied , if he would let the coachman know that I would get into my place when overtaken .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 14]: I was thus enabled to fly from the Blue Boar immediately after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 45]: By then making a loop of about a couple of miles into the open country at the back of Pumblechook 's premises , I got round into the High Street again , a little beyond that pitfall , and felt myself in comparative security .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 29]: It was interesting to be in the quiet old town once more , and it was not disagreeable to be here and there suddenly recognized and stared after .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 72]: One or two of the tradespeople even darted out of their shops and went a little way down the street before me , that they might turn , as if they had forgotten something , and pass me face to face , -- on which occasions I do n't know whether they or I made the worse pretence ; they of not doing it , or I of not seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 34]: Still my position was a distinguished one , and I was not at all dissatisfied with it , until Fate threw me in the way of that unlimited miscreant , Trabb 's boy .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 29]: Casting my eyes along the street at a certain point of my progress , I beheld Trabb 's boy approaching , lashing himself with an empty blue bag .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 85]: Deeming that a serene and unconscious contemplation of him would best beseem me , and would be most likely to quell his evil mind , I advanced with that expression of countenance , and was rather congratulating myself on my success , when suddenly the knees of Trabb 's boy smote together , his hair uprose , his cap fell off , he trembled violently in every limb , staggered out into the road , and crying to the populace , `` Hold me !
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 6]: I 'm so frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 19]: feigned to be in a paroxysm of terror and contrition , occasioned by the dignity of my appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 28]: As I passed him , his teeth loudly chattered in his head , and with every mark of extreme humiliation , he prostrated himself in the dust .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 13]: This was a hard thing to bear , but this was nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 28]: I had not advanced another two hundred yards when , to my inexpressible terror , amazement , and indignation , I again beheld Trabb 's boy approaching .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 8]: He was coming round a narrow corner .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 32]: His blue bag was slung over his shoulder , honest industry beamed in his eyes , a determination to proceed to Trabb 's with cheerful briskness was indicated in his gait .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 46]: With a shock he became aware of me , and was severely visited as before ; but this time his motion was rotatory , and he staggered round and round me with knees more afflicted , and with uplifted hands as if beseeching for mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 20]: His sufferings were hailed with the greatest joy by a knot of spectators , and I felt utterly confounded .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 28]: I had not got as much further down the street as the post-office , when I again beheld Trabb 's boy shooting round by a back way .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 8]: This time , he was entirely changed .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 59]: He wore the blue bag in the manner of my great-coat , and was strutting along the pavement towards me on the opposite side of the street , attended by a company of delighted young friends to whom he from time to time exclaimed , with a wave of his hand , `` Do n't know yah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 77]: Words can not state the amount of aggravation and injury wreaked upon me by Trabb 's boy , when passing abreast of me , he pulled up his shirt-collar , twined his side-hair , stuck an arm akimbo , and smirked extravagantly by , wriggling his elbows and body , and drawling to his attendants , `` Do n't know yah , do n't know yah , ` pon my soul do n't know yah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 60]: The disgrace attendant on his immediately afterwards taking to crowing and pursuing me across the bridge with crows , as from an exceedingly dejected fowl who had known me when I was a blacksmith , culminated the disgrace with which I left the town , and was , so to speak , ejected by it into the open country .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 30]: But unless I had taken the life of Trabb 's boy on that occasion , I really do not even now see what I could have done save endure .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 32]: To have struggled with him in the street , or to have exacted any lower recompense from him than his heart 's best blood , would have been futile and degrading .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 37]: Moreover , he was a boy whom no man could hurt ; an invulnerable and dodging serpent who , when chased into a corner , flew out again between his captor 's legs , scornfully yelping .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 54]: I wrote , however , to Mr. Trabb by next day 's post , to say that Mr. Pip must decline to deal further with one who could so far forget what he owed to the best interests of society , as to employ a boy who excited Loathing in every respectable mind .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 38]: The coach , with Mr. Jaggers inside , came up in due time , and I took my box-seat again , and arrived in London safe , -- but not sound , for my heart was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 36]: As soon as I arrived , I sent a penitential codfish and barrel of oysters to Joe -LRB- as reparation for not having gone myself -RRB- , and then went on to Barnard 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 15]: I found Herbert dining on cold meat , and delighted to welcome me back .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 31]: Having despatched The Avenger to the coffee-house for an addition to the dinner , I felt that I must open my breast that very evening to my friend and chum .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 36]: As confidence was out of the question with The Avenger in the hall , which could merely be regarded in the light of an antechamber to the keyhole , I sent him to the Play .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 32]: A better proof of the severity of my bondage to that taskmaster could scarcely be afforded , than the degrading shifts to which I was constantly driven to find him employment .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 21]: So mean is extremity , that I sometimes sent him to Hyde Park corner to see what o'clock it was .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 32]: Dinner done and we sitting with our feet upon the fender , I said to Herbert , `` My dear Herbert , I have something very particular to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 19]: `` My dear Handel , '' he returned , `` I shall esteem and respect your confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 18]: `` It concerns myself , Herbert , '' said I , `` and one other person . ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 37]: Herbert crossed his feet , looked at the fire with his head on one side , and having looked at it in vain for some time , looked at me because I did n't go on .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 24]: `` Herbert , '' said I , laying my hand upon his knee , `` I love -- I adore -- Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 16]: Instead of being transfixed , Herbert replied in an easy matter-ofcourse way , `` Exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 5]: `` Well , Herbert ?
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 6]: Is that all you say ?
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 8]: `` What next , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 8]: `` Of course I know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 8]: `` How do you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 11]: said I. `` How do I know it , Handel ?
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 6]: Why , from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 7]: `` I never told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 4]: `` Told me !
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 22]: You have never told me when you have got your hair cut , but I have had senses to perceive it .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 13]: You have always adored her , ever since I have known you .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 10]: You brought your adoration and your portmanteau here together .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 3]: Told me !
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 11]: Why , you have always told me all day long .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 32]: When you told me your own story , you told me plainly that you began adoring her the first time you saw her , when you were very young indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 30]: `` Very well , then , '' said I , to whom this was a new and not unwelcome light , `` I have never left off adoring her .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 14]: And she has come back , a most beautiful and most elegant creature .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 6]: And I saw her yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 14]: And if I adored her before , I now doubly adore her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 25]: `` Lucky for you then , Handel , '' said Herbert , `` that you are picked out for her and allotted to her .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 23]: Without encroaching on forbidden ground , we may venture to say that there can be no doubt between ourselves of that fact .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 16]: Have you any idea yet , of Estella 's views on the adoration question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 6]: I shook my head gloomily .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 26]: She is thousands of miles away , from me , '' said I. `` Patience , my dear Handel : time enough , time enough .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 9]: But you have something more to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 27]: `` I am ashamed to say it , '' I returned , `` and yet it 's no worse to say it than to think it .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 7]: You call me a lucky fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 6]: Of course , I am .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 22]: I was a blacksmith 's boy but yesterday ; I am -- what shall I say I am -- to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 52]: `` Say a good fellow , if you want a phrase , '' returned Herbert , smiling , and clapping his hand on the back of mine -- `` a good fellow , with impetuosity and hesitation , boldness and diffidence , action and dreaming , curiously mixed in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 17]: I stopped for a moment to consider whether there really was this mixture in my character .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 19]: On the whole , I by no means recognized the analysis , but thought it not worth disputing .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 29]: `` When I ask what I am to call myself to-day , Herbert , '' I went on , `` I suggest what I have in my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 6]: You say I am lucky .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 26]: I know I have done nothing to raise myself in life , and that Fortune alone has raised me ; that is being very lucky .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 22]: And yet , when I think of Estella -- '' -LRB- `` And when do n't you , you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 22]: Herbert threw in , with his eyes on the fire ; which I thought kind and sympathetic of him . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 27]: -- Then , my dear Herbert , I can not tell you how dependent and uncertain I feel , and how exposed to hundreds of chances .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 31]: Avoiding forbidden ground , as you did just now , I may still say that on the constancy of one person -LRB- naming no person -RRB- all my expectations depend .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 20]: And at the best , how indefinite and unsatisfactory , only to know so vaguely what they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 26]: In saying this , I relieved my mind of what had always been there , more or less , though no doubt most since yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 42]: `` Now , Handel , '' Herbert replied , in his gay , hopeful way , `` it seems to me that in the despondency of the tender passion , we are looking into our gift-horse 's mouth with a magnifying-glass .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 27]: Likewise , it seems to me that , concentrating our attention on the examination , we altogether overlook one of the best points of the animal .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 27]: Did n't you tell me that your guardian , Mr. Jaggers , told you in the beginning , that you were not endowed with expectations only ?
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 54]: And even if he had not told you so , -- though that is a very large If , I grant , -- could you believe that of all men in London , Mr. Jaggers is the man to hold his present relations towards you unless he were sure of his ground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 13]: I said I could not deny that this was a strong point .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 32]: I said it -LRB- people often do so , in such cases -RRB- like a rather reluctant concession to truth and justice ; -- as if I wanted to deny it !
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 50]: `` I should think it was a strong point , '' said Herbert , `` and I should think you would be puzzled to imagine a stronger ; as to the rest , you must bide your guardian 's time , and he must bide his client 's time .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 21]: You 'll be one-and-twenty before you know where you are , and then perhaps you 'll get some further enlightenment .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 19]: At all events , you 'll be nearer getting it , for it must come at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 9]: `` What a hopeful disposition you have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 9]: said I , gratefully admiring his cheery ways .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 18]: `` I ought to have , '' said Herbert , `` for I have not much else .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 28]: I must acknowledge , by the by , that the good sense of what I have just said is not my own , but my father 's .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 35]: The only remark I ever heard him make on your story , was the final one , `` The thing is settled and done , or Mr. Jaggers would not be in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 41]: And now before I say anything more about my father , or my father 's son , and repay confidence with confidence , I want to make myself seriously disagreeable to you for a moment , -- positively repulsive . ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 16]: `` You wo n't succeed , '' said I. `` O yes I shall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 15]: `` One , two , three , and now I am in for it .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 63]: Handel , my good fellow ; '' -- though he spoke in this light tone , he was very much in earnest , -- `` I have been thinking since we have been talking with our feet on this fender , that Estella surely can not be a condition of your inheritance , if she was never referred to by your guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 28]: Am I right in so understanding what you have told me , as that he never referred to her , directly or indirectly , in any way ?
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 20]: Never even hinted , for instance , that your patron might have views as to your marriage ultimately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 4]: `` Never . ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 22]: `` Now , Handel , I am quite free from the flavor of sour grapes , upon my soul and honor !
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 14]: Not being bound to her , can you not detach yourself from her ?
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 10]: -- I told you I should be disagreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 67]: I turned my head aside , for , with a rush and a sweep , like the old marsh winds coming up from the sea , a feeling like that which had subdued me on the morning when I left the forge , when the mists were solemnly rising , and when I laid my hand upon the village finger-post , smote upon my heart again .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 10]: There was silence between us for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 50]: `` Yes ; but my dear Handel , '' Herbert went on , as if we had been talking , instead of silent , `` its having been so strongly rooted in the breast of a boy whom nature and circumstances made so romantic , renders it very serious .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 11]: Think of her bringing-up , and think of Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 17]: Think of what she is herself -LRB- now I am repulsive and you abominate me -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 8]: This may lead to miserable things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 27]: `` I know it , Herbert , '' said I , with my head still turned away , `` but I ca n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 8]: `` You ca n't detach yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 3]: Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 9]: `` You ca n't try , Handel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 3]: Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 33]: said Herbert , getting up with a lively shake as if he had been asleep , and stirring the fire , `` now I 'll endeavor to make myself agreeable again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 67]: So he went round the room and shook the curtains out , put the chairs in their places , tidied the books and so forth that were lying about , looked into the hall , peeped into the letter-box , shut the door , and came back to his chair by the fire : where he sat down , nursing his left leg in both arms .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 22]: `` I was going to say a word or two , Handel , concerning my father and my father 's son .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 28]: I am afraid it is scarcely necessary for my father 's son to remark that my father 's establishment is not particularly brilliant in its housekeeping . ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 17]: `` There is always plenty , Herbert , '' said I , to say something encouraging .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 4]: `` O yes !
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 25]: and so the dustman says , I believe , with the strongest approval , and so does the marine-store shop in the back street .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 22]: Gravely , Handel , for the subject is grave enough , you know how it is as well as I do .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 27]: I suppose there was a time once when my father had not given matters up ; but if ever there was , the time is gone .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 40]: May I ask you if you have ever had an opportunity of remarking , down in your part of the country , that the children of not exactly suitable marriages are always most particularly anxious to be married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 20]: This was such a singular question , that I asked him in return , `` Is it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 19]: `` I do n't know , '' said Herbert , `` that 's what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 9]: Because it is decidedly the case with us .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 21]: My poor sister Charlotte , who was next me and died before she was fourteen , was a striking example .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 6]: Little Jane is the same .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 26]: In her desire to be matrimonially established , you might suppose her to have passed her short existence in the perpetual contemplation of domestic bliss .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 20]: Little Alick in a frock has already made arrangements for his union with a suitable young person at Kew .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 15]: And indeed , I think we are all engaged , except the baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 6]: `` Then you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 18]: said I. `` I am , '' said Herbert ; `` but it 's a secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 18]: I assured him of my keeping the secret , and begged to be favored with further particulars .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 20]: He had spoken so sensibly and feelingly of my weakness that I wanted to know something about his strength .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 8]: `` May I ask the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 9]: `` Name of Clara , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 6]: `` Live in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 39]: perhaps I ought to mention , '' said Herbert , who had become curiously crestfallen and meek , since we entered on the interesting theme , `` that she is rather below my mother 's nonsensical family notions .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 11]: Her father had to do with the victualling of passenger-ships .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 10]: I think he was a species of purser . ''
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 7]: `` What is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 13]: said I. `` He 's an invalid now , '' replied Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 6]: `` Living on -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 10]: `` On the first floor , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 21]: Which was not at all what I meant , for I had intended my question to apply to his means .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 22]: `` I have never seen him , for he has always kept his room overhead , since I have known Clara .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 7]: But I have heard him constantly .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 19]: He makes tremendous rows , -- roars , and pegs at the floor with some frightful instrument . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 19]: In looking at me and then laughing heartily , Herbert for the time recovered his usual lively manner .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 10]: `` Do n't you expect to see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 34]: said I. `` O yes , I constantly expect to see him , '' returned Herbert , `` because I never hear him , without expecting him to come tumbling through the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 13]: But I do n't know how long the rafters may hold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 35]: When he had once more laughed heartily , he became meek again , and told me that the moment he began to realize Capital , it was his intention to marry this young lady .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 29]: He added as a self-evident proposition , engendering low spirits , `` But you ca n't marry , you know , while you 're looking about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 30]: As we contemplated the fire , and as I thought what a difficult vision to realize this same Capital sometimes was , I put my hands in my pockets .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 39]: A folded piece of paper in one of them attracting my attention , I opened it and found it to be the play-bill I had received from Joe , relative to the celebrated provincial amateur of Roscian renown .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 18]: `` And bless my heart , '' I involuntarily added aloud , `` it 's to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 19]: This changed the subject in an instant , and made us hurriedly resolve to go to the play .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 86]: So , when I had pledged myself to comfort and abet Herbert in the affair of his heart by all practicable and impracticable means , and when Herbert had told me that his affianced already knew me by reputation and that I should be presented to her , and when we had warmly shaken hands upon our mutual confidence , we blew out our candles , made up our fire , locked our door , and issued forth in quest of Mr. Wopsle and Denmark .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 29]: Chapter XXXI On our arrival in Denmark , we found the king and queen of that country elevated in two arm-chairs on a kitchen-table , holding a Court .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 70]: The whole of the Danish nobility were in attendance ; consisting of a noble boy in the wash-leather boots of a gigantic ancestor , a venerable Peer with a dirty face who seemed to have risen from the people late in life , and the Danish chivalry with a comb in its hair and a pair of white silk legs , and presenting on the whole a feminine appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 26]: My gifted townsman stood gloomily apart , with folded arms , and I could have wished that his curls and forehead had been more probable .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 10]: Several curious little circumstances transpired as the action proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 41]: The late king of the country not only appeared to have been troubled with a cough at the time of his decease , but to have taken it with him to the tomb , and to have brought it back .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 49]: The royal phantom also carried a ghostly manuscript round its truncheon , to which it had the appearance of occasionally referring , and that too , with an air of anxiety and a tendency to lose the place of reference which were suggestive of a state of mortality .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 24]: It was this , I conceive , which led to the Shade 's being advised by the gallery to `` turn over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 9]: -- a recommendation which it took extremely ill .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 41]: It was likewise to be noted of this majestic spirit , that whereas it always appeared with an air of having been out a long time and walked an immense distance , it perceptibly came from a closely contiguous wall .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 9]: This occasioned its terrors to be received derisively .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 80]: The Queen of Denmark , a very buxom lady , though no doubt historically brazen , was considered by the public to have too much brass about her ; her chin being attached to her diadem by a broad band of that metal -LRB- as if she had a gorgeous toothache -RRB- , her waist being encircled by another , and each of her arms by another , so that she was openly mentioned as `` the kettle-drum . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 63]: The noble boy in the ancestral boots was inconsistent , representing himself , as it were in one breath , as an able seaman , a strolling actor , a grave-digger , a clergyman , and a person of the utmost importance at a Court fencing-match , on the authority of whose practised eye and nice discrimination the finest strokes were judged .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 40]: This gradually led to a want of toleration for him , and even -- on his being detected in holy orders , and declining to perform the funeral service -- to the general indignation taking the form of nuts .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 76]: Lastly , Ophelia was a prey to such slow musical madness , that when , in course of time , she had taken off her white muslin scarf , folded it up , and buried it , a sulky man who had been long cooling his impatient nose against an iron bar in the front row of the gallery , growled , `` Now the baby 's put to bed let 's have supper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 14]: Which , to say the least of it , was out of keeping .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 12]: Upon my unfortunate townsman all these incidents accumulated with playful effect .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 22]: Whenever that undecided Prince had to ask a question or state a doubt , the public helped him out with it .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 46]: As for example ; on the question whether 't was nobler in the mind to suffer , some roared yes , and some no , and some inclining to both opinions said `` Toss up for it ; '' and quite a Debating Society arose .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 29]: When he asked what should such fellows as he do crawling between earth and heaven , he was encouraged with loud cries of `` Hear , hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 67]: When he appeared with his stocking disordered -LRB- its disorder expressed , according to usage , by one very neat fold in the top , which I suppose to be always got up with a flat iron -RRB- , a conversation took place in the gallery respecting the paleness of his leg , and whether it was occasioned by the turn the ghost had given him .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 38]: On his taking the recorders , -- very like a little black flute that had just been played in the orchestra and handed out at the door , -- he was called upon unanimously for Rule Britannia .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 36]: When he recommended the player not to saw the air thus , the sulky man said , `` And do n't you do it , neither ; you 're a deal worse than him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 19]: And I grieve to add that peals of laughter greeted Mr. Wopsle on every one of these occasions .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 37]: But his greatest trials were in the churchyard , which had the appearance of a primeval forest , with a kind of small ecclesiastical wash-house on one side , and a turnpike gate on the other .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 28]: Mr. Wopsle in a comprehensive black cloak , being descried entering at the turnpike , the gravedigger was admonished in a friendly way , `` Look out !
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 20]: Here 's the undertaker a coming , to see how you 're a getting on with your work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 57]: I believe it is well known in a constitutional country that Mr. Wopsle could not possibly have returned the skull , after moralizing over it , without dusting his fingers on a white napkin taken from his breast ; but even that innocent and indispensable action did not pass without the comment , `` Wai-ter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 47]: The arrival of the body for interment -LRB- in an empty black box with the lid tumbling open -RRB- , was the signal for a general joy , which was much enhanced by the discovery , among the bearers , of an individual obnoxious to identification .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 44]: The joy attended Mr. Wopsle through his struggle with Laertes on the brink of the orchestra and the grave , and slackened no more until he had tumbled the king off the kitchen-table , and had died by inches from the ankles upward .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 24]: We had made some pale efforts in the beginning to applaud Mr. Wopsle ; but they were too hopeless to be persisted in .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 20]: Therefore we had sat , feeling keenly for him , but laughing , nevertheless , from ear to ear .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 86]: I laughed in spite of myself all the time , the whole thing was so droll ; and yet I had a latent impression that there was something decidedly fine in Mr. Wopsle 's elocution , -- not for old associations ' sake , I am afraid , but because it was very slow , very dreary , very up-hill and down-hill , and very unlike any way in which any man in any natural circumstances of life or death ever expressed himself about anything .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 35]: When the tragedy was over , and he had been called for and hooted , I said to Herbert , `` Let us go at once , or perhaps we shall meet him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 18]: We made all the haste we could down stairs , but we were not quick enough either .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 42]: Standing at the door was a Jewish man with an unnatural heavy smear of eyebrow , who caught my eyes as we advanced , and said , when we came up with him , -- `` Mr. Pip and friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 8]: Identity of Mr. Pip and friend confessed .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 19]: `` Mr. Waldengarver , '' said the man , `` would be glad to have the honor . ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 4]: `` Waldengarver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 15]: I repeated -- when Herbert murmured in my ear , `` Probably Wopsle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 5]: said I. `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 6]: Shall we follow you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 8]: `` A few steps , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 21]: When we were in a side alley , he turned and asked , `` How did you think he looked ?
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 6]: -- I dressed him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 48]: I do n't know what he had looked like , except a funeral ; with the addition of a large Danish sun or star hanging round his neck by a blue ribbon , that had given him the appearance of being insured in some extraordinary Fire Office .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 9]: But I said he had looked very nice .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 20]: `` When he come to the grave , '' said our conductor , `` he showed his cloak beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 33]: But , judging from the wing , it looked to me that when he see the ghost in the queen 's apartment , he might have made more of his stockings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 25]: I modestly assented , and we all fell through a little dirty swing door , into a sort of hot packing-case immediately behind it .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 41]: Here Mr. Wopsle was divesting himself of his Danish garments , and here there was just room for us to look at him over one another 's shoulders , by keeping the packing-case door , or lid , wide open .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 16]: `` Gentlemen , '' said Mr. Wopsle , `` I am proud to see you .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 13]: I hope , Mr. Pip , you will excuse my sending round .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 33]: I had the happiness to know you in former times , and the Drama has ever had a claim which has ever been acknowledged , on the noble and the affluent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 21]: Meanwhile , Mr. Waldengarver , in a frightful perspiration , was trying to get himself out of his princely sables .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 23]: `` Skin the stockings off Mr. Waldengarver , '' said the owner of that property , `` or you 'll bust 'em .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 10]: Bust 'em , and you 'll bust five-and-thirty shillings .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 9]: Shakspeare never was complimented with a finer pair .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 14]: Keep quiet in your chair now , and leave 'em to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 45]: With that , he went upon his knees , and began to flay his victim ; who , on the first stocking coming off , would certainly have fallen over backward with his chair , but for there being no room to fall anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 14]: I had been afraid until then to say a word about the play .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 32]: But then , Mr. Waldengarver looked up at us complacently , and said , -- `` Gentlemen , how did it seem to you , to go , in front ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 17]: Herbert said from behind -LRB- at the same time poking me -RRB- , `` Capitally . ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 7]: So I said `` Capitally . ''
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 14]: `` How did you like my reading of the character , gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 13]: said Mr. Waldengarver , almost , if not quite , with patronage .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 16]: Herbert said from behind -LRB- again poking me -RRB- , `` Massive and concrete . ''
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 26]: So I said boldly , as if I had originated it , and must beg to insist upon it , `` Massive and concrete . ''
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 45]: `` I am glad to have your approbation , gentlemen , '' said Mr. Waldengarver , with an air of dignity , in spite of his being ground against the wall at the time , and holding on by the seat of the chair .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 32]: `` But I 'll tell you one thing , Mr. Waldengarver , '' said the man who was on his knees , `` in which you 're out in your reading .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 3]: Now mind !
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 13]: I do n't care who says contrairy ; I tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 16]: You 're out in your reading of Hamlet when you get your legs in profile .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 79]: The last Hamlet as I dressed , made the same mistakes in his reading at rehearsal , till I got him to put a large red wafer on each of his shins , and then at that rehearsal -LRB- which was the last -RRB- I went in front , sir , to the back of the pit , and whenever his reading brought him into profile , I called out `` I do n't see no wafers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 9]: And at night his reading was lovely . ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 50]: Mr. Waldengarver smiled at me , as much as to say `` a faithful Dependent -- I overlook his folly ; '' and then said aloud , `` My view is a little classic and thoughtful for them here ; but they will improve , they will improve . ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 14]: Herbert and I said together , O , no doubt they would improve .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 38]: `` Did you observe , gentlemen , '' said Mr. Waldengarver , `` that there was a man in the gallery who endeavored to cast derision on the service , -- I mean , the representation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 14]: We basely replied that we rather thought we had noticed such a man .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 12]: I added , `` He was drunk , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 16]: `` O dear no , sir , '' said Mr. Wopsle , `` not drunk .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 9]: His employer would see to that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 11]: His employer would not allow him to be drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 7]: `` You know his employer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 17]: Mr. Wopsle shut his eyes , and opened them again ; performing both ceremonies very slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 60]: `` You must have observed , gentlemen , '' said he , `` an ignorant and a blatant ass , with a rasping throat and a countenance expressive of low malignity , who went through -- I will not say sustained -- the rôle -LRB- if I may use a French expression -RRB- of Claudius , King of Denmark .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 7]: That is his employer , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 6]: Such is the profession ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 69]: Without distinctly knowing whether I should have been more sorry for Mr. Wopsle if he had been in despair , I was so sorry for him as it was , that I took the opportunity of his turning round to have his braces put on , -- which jostled us out at the doorway , -- to ask Herbert what he thought of having him home to supper ?
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 58]: Herbert said he thought it would be kind to do so ; therefore I invited him , and he went to Barnard 's with us , wrapped up to the eyes , and we did our best for him , and he sat until two o'clock in the morning , reviewing his success and developing his plans .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 47]: I forget in detail what they were , but I have a general recollection that he was to begin with reviving the Drama , and to end with crushing it ; inasmuch as his decease would leave it utterly bereft and without a chance or hope .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 60]: Miserably I went to bed after all , and miserably thought of Estella , and miserably dreamed that my expectations were all cancelled , and that I had to give my hand in marriage to Herbert 's Clara , or play Hamlet to Miss Havisham 's Ghost , before twenty thousand people , without knowing twenty words of it .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 57]: Chapter XXXII One day when I was busy with my books and Mr. Pocket , I received a note by the post , the mere outside of which threw me into a great flutter ; for , though I had never seen the handwriting in which it was addressed , I divined whose hand it was .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 44]: It had no set beginning , as Dear Mr. Pip , or Dear Pip , or Dear Sir , or Dear Anything , but ran thus : -- `` I am to come to London the day after to-morrow by the midday coach .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 10]: I believe it was settled you should meet me ?
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 17]: At all events Miss Havisham has that impression , and I write in obedience to it .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 6]: She sends you her regard .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 5]: Yours , ESTELLA . ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 36]: If there had been time , I should probably have ordered several suits of clothes for this occasion ; but as there was not , I was fain to be content with those I had .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 17]: My appetite vanished instantly , and I knew no peace or rest until the day arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 40]: Not that its arrival brought me either ; for , then I was worse than ever , and began haunting the coach-office in Wood Street , Cheapside , before the coach had left the Blue Boar in our town .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 62]: For all that I knew this perfectly well , I still felt as if it were not safe to let the coach-office be out of my sight longer than five minutes at a time ; and in this condition of unreason I had performed the first half-hour of a watch of four or five hours , when Wemmick ran against me .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 16]: `` Halloa , Mr. Pip , '' said he ; `` how do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 11]: I should hardly have thought this was your beat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 26]: I explained that I was waiting to meet somebody who was coming up by coach , and I inquired after the Castle and the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 15]: `` Both flourishing thankye , '' said Wemmick , `` and particularly the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 6]: He 's in wonderful feather .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 7]: He 'll be eighty-two next birthday .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 28]: I have a notion of firing eighty-two times , if the neighborhood should n't complain , and that cannon of mine should prove equal to the pressure .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 8]: However , this is not London talk .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 10]: Where do you think I am going to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 6]: `` To the office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 11]: said I , for he was tending in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 17]: `` Next thing to it , '' returned Wemmick , `` I am going to Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 42]: We are in a banker 's - parcel case just at present , and I have been down the road taking a squint at the scene of action , and thereupon must have a word or two with our client . ''
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 9]: `` Did your client commit the robbery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 16]: `` Bless your soul and body , no , '' answered Wemmick , very drily .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 8]: `` But he is accused of it .
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 7]: So might you or I be .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 13]: Either of us might be accused of it , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 11]: `` Only neither of us is , '' I remarked .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 4]: `` Yah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 22]: said Wemmick , touching me on the breast with his forefinger ; `` you 're a deep one , Mr. Pip !
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 10]: Would you like to have a look at Newgate ?
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 7]: Have you time to spare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 31]: I had so much time to spare , that the proposal came as a relief , notwithstanding its irreconcilability with my latent desire to keep my eye on the coach-office .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 63]: Muttering that I would make the inquiry whether I had time to walk with him , I went into the office , and ascertained from the clerk with the nicest precision and much to the trying of his temper , the earliest moment at which the coach could be expected , -- which I knew beforehand , quite as well as he .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 28]: I then rejoined Mr. Wemmick , and affecting to consult my watch , and to be surprised by the information I had received , accepted his offer .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 37]: We were at Newgate in a few minutes , and we passed through the lodge where some fetters were hanging up on the bare walls among the prison rules , into the interior of the jail .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 35]: At that time jails were much neglected , and the period of exaggerated reaction consequent on all public wrongdoing -- and which is always its heaviest and longest punishment -- was still far off .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 38]: So felons were not lodged and fed better than soldiers , -LRB- to say nothing of paupers , -RRB- and seldom set fire to their prisons with the excusable object of improving the flavor of their soup .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 51]: It was visiting time when Wemmick took me in , and a potman was going his rounds with beer ; and the prisoners , behind bars in yards , were buying beer , and talking to friends ; and a frowzy , ugly , disorderly , depressing scene it was .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 19]: It struck me that Wemmick walked among the prisoners much as a gardener might walk among his plants .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 29]: This was first put into my head by his seeing a shoot that had come up in the night , and saying , `` What , Captain Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 4]: Are you there ?
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 5]: Ah , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 12]: and also , `` Is that Black Bill behind the cistern ?
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 18]: Why I did n't look for you these two months ; how do you find yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 62]: Equally in his stopping at the bars and attending to anxious whisperers , -- always singly , -- Wemmick with his post-office in an immovable state , looked at them while in conference , as if he were taking particular notice of the advance they had made , since last observed , towards coming out in full blow at their trial .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 39]: He was highly popular , and I found that he took the familiar department of Mr. Jaggers 's business ; though something of the state of Mr. Jaggers hung about him too , forbidding approach beyond certain limits .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 43]: His personal recognition of each successive client was comprised in a nod , and in his settling his hat a little easier on his head with both hands , and then tightening the post-office , and putting his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 42]: In one or two instances there was a difficulty respecting the raising of fees , and then Mr. Wemmick , backing as far as possible from the insufficient money produced , said , `` it 's no use , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 6]: I 'm only a subordinate .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 6]: I ca n't take it .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 11]: Do n't go on in that way with a subordinate .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 64]: If you are unable to make up your quantum , my boy , you had better address yourself to a principal ; there are plenty of principals in the profession , you know , and what is not worth the while of one , may be worth the while of another ; that 's my recommendation to you , speaking as a subordinate .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 7]: Do n't try on useless measures .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 4]: Why should you ?
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 7]: Now , who 's next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 28]: Thus , we walked through Wemmick 's greenhouse , until he turned to me and said , `` Notice the man I shall shake hands with . ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 20]: I should have done so , without the preparation , as he had shaken hands with no one yet .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 89]: Almost as soon as he had spoken , a portly upright man -LRB- whom I can see now , as I write -RRB- in a well-worn olive-colored frock-coat , with a peculiar pallor overspreading the red in his complexion , and eyes that went wandering about when he tried to fix them , came up to a corner of the bars , and put his hand to his hat -- which had a greasy and fatty surface like cold broth -- with a half-serious and half-jocose military salute .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 7]: `` Colonel , to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 11]: said Wemmick ; `` how are you , Colonel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 8]: `` All right , Mr. Wemmick . ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 21]: `` Everything was done that could be done , but the evidence was too strong for us , Colonel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 18]: `` Yes , it was too strong , sir , -- but I do n't care . ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 18]: `` No , no , '' said Wemmick , coolly , `` you do n't care . ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 13]: Then , turning to me , `` Served His Majesty this man .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 12]: Was a soldier in the line and bought his discharge . ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 7]: I said , `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 35]: and the man 's eyes looked at me , and then looked over my head , and then looked all round me , and then he drew his hand across his lips and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 20]: `` I think I shall be out of this on Monday , sir , '' he said to Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 16]: `` Perhaps , '' returned my friend , `` but there 's no knowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 30]: `` I am glad to have the chance of bidding you good by , Mr. Wemmick , '' said the man , stretching out his hand between two bars .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 12]: `` Thankye , '' said Wemmick , shaking hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 8]: `` Same to you , Colonel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 48]: `` If what I had upon me when taken had been real , Mr. Wemmick , '' said the man , unwilling to let his hand go , `` I should have asked the favor of your wearing another ring -- in acknowledgment of your attentions . ''
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 14]: `` I 'll accept the will for the deed , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 12]: `` By the by ; you were quite a pigeon-fancier . ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 8]: The man looked up at the sky .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 12]: `` I am told you had a remarkable breed of tumblers .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 23]: Could you commission any friend of yours to bring me a pair , of you 've no further use for 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 9]: `` It shall be done , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 16]: `` All right , '' said Wemmick , `` they shall be taken care of .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 5]: Good afternoon , Colonel .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 4]: Good by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 24]: They shook hands again , and as we walked away Wemmick said to me , `` A Coiner , a very good workman .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 18]: The Recorder 's report is made to-day , and he is sure to be executed on Monday .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 22]: Still you see , as far as it goes , a pair of pigeons are portable property all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 43]: With that , he looked back , and nodded at this dead plant , and then cast his eyes about him in walking out of the yard , as if he were considering what other pot would go best in its place .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 37]: As we came out of the prison through the lodge , I found that the great importance of my guardian was appreciated by the turnkeys , no less than by those whom they held in charge .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 47]: `` Well , Mr. Wemmick , '' said the turnkey , who kept us between the two studded and spiked lodge gates , and who carefully locked one before he unlocked the other , `` what 's Mr. Jaggers going to do with that water-side murder ?
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 19]: Is he going to make it manslaughter , or what 's he going to make of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you ask him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 3]: returned Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 9]: `` O yes , I dare say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 4]: said the turnkey .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 26]: `` Now , that 's the way with them here , Mr. Pip , '' remarked Wemmick , turning to me with his post-office elongated .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 28]: `` They do n't mind what they ask of me , the subordinate ; but you 'll never catch 'em asking any questions of my principal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 18]: `` Is this young gentleman one of the ` prentices or articled ones of your office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 13]: asked the turnkey , with a grin at Mr. Wemmick 's humor .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 10]: `` There he goes again , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 9]: cried Wemmick , `` I told you so !
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 12]: Asks another question of the subordinate before his first is dry !
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 11]: Well , supposing Mr. Pip is one of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 21]: `` Why then , '' said the turnkey , grinning again , `` he knows what Mr. Jaggers is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 4]: `` Yah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 38]: cried Wemmick , suddenly hitting out at the turnkey in a facetious way , `` you 're dumb as one of your own keys when you have to do with my principal , you know you are .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 24]: Let us out , you old fox , or I 'll get him to bring an action against you for false imprisonment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 30]: The turnkey laughed , and gave us good day , and stood laughing at us over the spikes of the wicket when we descended the steps into the street .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 49]: `` Mind you , Mr. Pip , '' said Wemmick , gravely in my ear , as he took my arm to be more confidential ; `` I do n't know that Mr. Jaggers does a better thing than the way in which he keeps himself so high .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 6]: He 's always so high .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 12]: His constant height is of a piece with his immense abilities .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 22]: That Colonel durst no more take leave of him , than that turnkey durst ask him his intentions respecting a case .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 20]: Then , between his height and them , he slips in his subordinate , -- do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 12]: -- and so he has 'em , soul and body . ''
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 19]: I was very much impressed , and not for the first time , by my guardian 's subtlety .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 28]: To confess the truth , I very heartily wished , and not for the first time , that I had had some other guardian of minor abilities .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 45]: Mr. Wemmick and I parted at the office in Little Britain , where suppliants for Mr. Jaggers 's notice were lingering about as usual , and I returned to my watch in the street of the coach-office , with some three hours on hand .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 83]: I consumed the whole time in thinking how strange it was that I should be encompassed by all this taint of prison and crime ; that , in my childhood out on our lonely marshes on a winter evening , I should have first encountered it ; that , it should have reappeared on two occasions , starting out like a stain that was faded but not gone ; that , it should in this new way pervade my fortune and advancement .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 38]: While my mind was thus engaged , I thought of the beautiful young Estella , proud and refined , coming towards me , and I thought with absolute abhorrence of the contrast between the jail and her .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 49]: I wished that Wemmick had not met me , or that I had not yielded to him and gone with him , so that , of all days in the year on this day , I might not have had Newgate in my breath and on my clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 33]: I beat the prison dust off my feet as I sauntered to and fro , and I shook it out of my dress , and I exhaled its air from my lungs .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 51]: So contaminated did I feel , remembering who was coming , that the coach came quickly after all , and I was not yet free from the soiling consciousness of Mr. Wemmick 's conservatory , when I saw her face at the coach window and her hand waving to me .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 14]: What was the nameless shadow which again in that one instant had passed ?
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 24]: Chapter XXXIII In her furred travelling-dress , Estella seemed more delicately beautiful than she had ever seemed yet , even in my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 30]: Her manner was more winning than she had cared to let it be to me before , and I thought I saw Miss Havisham 's influence in the change .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 41]: We stood in the Inn Yard while she pointed out her luggage to me , and when it was all collected I remembered -- having forgotten everything but herself in the meanwhile -- that I knew nothing of her destination .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 12]: `` I am going to Richmond , '' she told me .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 27]: `` Our lesson is , that there are two Richmonds , one in Surrey and one in Yorkshire , and that mine is the Surrey Richmond .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 6]: The distance is ten miles .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 14]: I am to have a carriage , and you are to take me .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 16]: This is my purse , and you are to pay my charges out of it .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 8]: O , you must take the purse !
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 15]: We have no choice , you and I , but to obey our instructions .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 36]: We are not free to follow our own devices , you and I. '' As she looked at me in giving me the purse , I hoped there was an inner meaning in her words .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 10]: She said them slightingly , but not with displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 12]: `` A carriage will have to be sent for , Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 8]: Will you rest here a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 31]: `` Yes , I am to rest here a little , and I am to drink some tea , and you are to take care of me the while . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 47]: She drew her arm through mine , as if it must be done , and I requested a waiter who had been staring at the coach like a man who had never seen such a thing in his life , to show us a private sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 66]: Upon that , he pulled out a napkin , as if it were a magic clew without which he could n't find the way up stairs , and led us to the black hole of the establishment , fitted up with a diminishing mirror -LRB- quite a superfluous article , considering the hole 's proportions -RRB- , an anchovy sauce-cruet , and somebody 's pattens .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 35]: On my objecting to this retreat , he took us into another room with a dinner-table for thirty , and in the grate a scorched leaf of a copy-book under a bushel of coal-dust .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 45]: Having looked at this extinct conflagration and shaken his head , he took my order ; which , proving to be merely , `` Some tea for the lady , '' sent him out of the room in a very low state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 54]: I was , and I am , sensible that the air of this chamber , in its strong combination of stable with soup-stock , might have led one to infer that the coaching department was not doing well , and that the enterprising proprietor was boiling down the horses for the refreshment department .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 15]: Yet the room was all in all to me , Estella being in it .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 14]: I thought that with her I could have been happy there for life .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 21]: -LRB- I was not at all happy there at the time , observe , and I knew it well . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 11]: `` Where are you going to , at Richmond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 4]: I asked Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 53]: `` I am going to live , '' said she , `` at a great expense , with a lady there , who has the power -- or says she has -- of taking me about , and introducing me , and showing people to me and showing me to people . ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 13]: `` I suppose you will be glad of variety and admiration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 8]: `` Yes , I suppose so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 23]: She answered so carelessly , that I said , `` You speak of yourself as if you were some one else . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 11]: `` Where did you learn how I speak of others ?
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 32]: Come , come , '' said Estella , smiling delightfully , `` you must not expect me to go to school to you ; I must talk in my own way .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 9]: How do you thrive with Mr. Pocket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 22]: `` I live quite pleasantly there ; at least -- '' It appeared to me that I was losing a chance .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 5]: `` At least ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 3]: repeated Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 13]: `` As pleasantly as I could anywhere , away from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 20]: `` You silly boy , '' said Estella , quite composedly , `` how can you talk such nonsense ?
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 18]: Your friend Mr. Matthew , I believe , is superior to the rest of his family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 5]: `` Very superior indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 29]: He is nobody 's enemy -- '' -- `` Do n't add but his own , '' interposed Estella , `` for I hate that class of man .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 18]: But he really is disinterested , and above small jealousy and spite , I have heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 13]: `` I am sure I have every reason to say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 50]: `` You have not every reason to say so of the rest of his people , '' said Estella , nodding at me with an expression of face that was at once grave and rallying , `` for they beset Miss Havisham with reports and insinuations to your disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 28]: They watch you , misrepresent you , write letters about you -LRB- anonymous sometimes -RRB- , and you are the torment and the occupation of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 15]: You can scarcely realize to yourself the hatred those people feel for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 11]: `` They do me no harm , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 9]: Instead of answering , Estella burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 16]: This was very singular to me , and I looked at her in considerable perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 48]: When she left off -- and she had not laughed languidly , but with real enjoyment -- I said , in my diffident way with her , -- `` I hope I may suppose that you would not be amused if they did me any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 15]: `` No , no you may be sure of that , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 12]: `` You may be certain that I laugh because they fail .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 15]: O , those people with Miss Havisham , and the tortures they undergo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 41]: She laughed again , and even now when she had told me why , her laughter was very singular to me , for I could not doubt its being genuine , and yet it seemed too much for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 25]: I thought there must really be something more here than I knew ; she saw the thought in my mind , and answered it .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 10]: `` It is not easy for even you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 33]: said Estella , `` to know what satisfaction it gives me to see those people thwarted , or what an enjoyable sense of the ridiculous I have when they are made ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 15]: For you were not brought up in that strange house from a mere baby .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 3]: I was .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 33]: You had not your little wits sharpened by their intriguing against you , suppressed and defenceless , under the mask of sympathy and pity and what not that is soft and soothing .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 3]: I had .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 38]: You did not gradually open your round childish eyes wider and wider to the discovery of that impostor of a woman who calculates her stores of peace of mind for when she wakes up in the night .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 4]: I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 20]: It was no laughing matter with Estella now , nor was she summoning these remembrances from any shallow place .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 20]: I would not have been the cause of that look of hers for all my expectations in a heap .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 12]: `` Two things I can tell you , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 50]: `` First , notwithstanding the proverb that constant dropping will wear away a stone , you may set your mind at rest that these people never will -- never would , in hundred years -- impair your ground with Miss Havisham , in any particular , great or small .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 30]: Second , I am beholden to you as the cause of their being so busy and so mean in vain , and there is my hand upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 29]: As she gave it to me playfully , -- for her darker mood had been but Momentary , -- I held it and put it to my lips .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 16]: `` You ridiculous boy , '' said Estella , `` will you never take warning ?
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 21]: Or do you kiss my hand in the same spirit in which I once let you kiss my cheek ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 7]: `` What spirit was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 9]: said I. `` I must think a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 11]: A spirit of contempt for the fawners and plotters . ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 14]: `` If I say yes , may I kiss the cheek again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 11]: `` You should have asked before you touched the hand .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 9]: But , yes , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 14]: I leaned down , and her calm face was like a statue 's .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 38]: `` Now , '' said Estella , gliding away the instant I touched her cheek , `` you are to take care that I have some tea , and you are to take me to Richmond . ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 34]: Her reverting to this tone as if our association were forced upon us , and we were mere puppets , gave me pain ; but everything in our intercourse did give me pain .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 35]: Whatever her tone with me happened to be , I could put no trust in it , and build no hope on it ; and yet I went on against trust and against hope .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 7]: Why repeat it a thousand times ?
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 5]: So it always was .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 34]: I rang for the tea , and the waiter , reappearing with his magic clew , brought in by degrees some fifty adjuncts to that refreshment , but of tea not a glimpse .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 102]: A teaboard , cups and saucers , plates , knives and forks -LRB- including carvers -RRB- , spoons -LRB- various -RRB- , saltcellars , a meek little muffin confined with the utmost precaution under a strong iron cover , Moses in the bulrushes typified by a soft bit of butter in a quantity of parsley , a pale loaf with a powdered head , two proof impressions of the bars of the kitchen fireplace on triangular bits of bread , and ultimately a fat family urn ; which the waiter staggered in with , expressing in his countenance burden and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 25]: After a prolonged absence at this stage of the entertainment , he at length came back with a casket of precious appearance containing twigs .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 27]: These I steeped in hot water , and so from the whole of these appliances extracted one cup of I do n't know what for Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 56]: The bill paid , and the waiter remembered , and the ostler not forgotten , and the chambermaid taken into consideration , -- in a word , the whole house bribed into a state of contempt and animosity , and Estella 's purse much lightened , -- we got into our post-coach and drove away .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 22]: Turning into Cheapside and rattling up Newgate Street , we were soon under the walls of which I was so ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 7]: `` What place is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 4]: Estella asked me .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 17]: I made a foolish pretence of not at first recognizing it , and then told her .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 19]: As she looked at it , and drew in her head again , murmuring , `` Wretches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 12]: I would not have confessed to my visit for any consideration .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 39]: `` Mr. Jaggers , '' said I , by way of putting it neatly on somebody else , `` has the reputation of being more in the secrets of that dismal place than any man in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 23]: `` He is more in the secrets of every place , I think , '' said Estella , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 14]: `` You have been accustomed to see him often , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 18]: `` I have been accustomed to see him at uncertain intervals , ever since I can remember .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 17]: But I know him no better now , than I did before I could speak plainly .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 8]: What is your own experience of him ?
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 7]: Do you advance with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 20]: `` Once habituated to his distrustful manner , '' said I , `` I have done very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 6]: `` Are you intimate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 12]: `` I have dined with him at his private house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 18]: `` I fancy , '' said Estella , shrinking `` that must be a curious place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 8]: `` It is a curious place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 48]: I should have been chary of discussing my guardian too freely even with her ; but I should have gone on with the subject so far as to describe the dinner in Gerrard Street , if we had not then come into a sudden glare of gas .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 47]: It seemed , while it lasted , to be all alight and alive with that inexplicable feeling I had had before ; and when we were out of it , I was as much dazed for a few moments as if I had been in lightning .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 38]: So we fell into other talk , and it was principally about the way by which we were travelling , and about what parts of London lay on this side of it , and what on that .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 42]: The great city was almost new to her , she told me , for she had never left Miss Havisham 's neighborhood until she had gone to France , and she had merely passed through London then in going and returning .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 16]: I asked her if my guardian had any charge of her while she remained here ?
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 10]: To that she emphatically said `` God forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 4]: and no more .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 34]: It was impossible for me to avoid seeing that she cared to attract me ; that she made herself winning , and would have won me even if the task had needed pains .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 64]: Yet this made me none the happier , for even if she had not taken that tone of our being disposed of by others , I should have felt that she held my heart in her hand because she wilfully chose to do it , and not because it would have wrung any tenderness in her to crush it and throw it away .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 35]: When we passed through Hammersmith , I showed her where Mr. Matthew Pocket lived , and said it was no great way from Richmond , and that I hoped I should see her sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 35]: `` O yes , you are to see me ; you are to come when you think proper ; you are to be mentioned to the family ; indeed you are already mentioned . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 16]: I inquired was it a large household she was going to be a member of ?
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 12]: `` No ; there are only two ; mother and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 18]: The mother is a lady of some station , though not averse to increasing her income . ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 14]: `` I wonder Miss Havisham could part with you again so soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 64]: `` It is a part of Miss Havisham 's plans for me , Pip , '' said Estella , with a sigh , as if she were tired ; `` I am to write to her constantly and see her regularly and report how I go on , -- I and the jewels , -- for they are nearly all mine now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 14]: It was the first time she had ever called me by my name .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 16]: Of course she did so purposely , and knew that I should treasure it up .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 51]: We came to Richmond all too soon , and our destination there was a house by the green , -- a staid old house , where hoops and powder and patches , embroidered coats , rolled stockings , ruffles and swords , had had their court days many a time .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 57]: Some ancient trees before the house were still cut into fashions as formal and unnatural as the hoops and wigs and stiff skirts ; but their own allotted places in the great procession of the dead were not far off , and they would soon drop into them and go the silent way of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 62]: A bell with an old voice -- which I dare say in its time had often said to the house , Here is the green farthingale , Here is the diamond-hilted sword , Here are the shoes with red heels and the blue solitaire -- sounded gravely in the moonlight , and two cherry-colored maids came fluttering out to receive Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 27]: The doorway soon absorbed her boxes , and she gave me her hand and a smile , and said good night , and was absorbed likewise .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 36]: And still I stood looking at the house , thinking how happy I should be if I lived there with her , and knowing that I never was happy with her , but always miserable .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 30]: I got into the carriage to be taken back to Hammersmith , and I got in with a bad heart-ache , and I got out with a worse heart-ache .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 38]: At our own door , I found little Jane Pocket coming home from a little party escorted by her little lover ; and I envied her little lover , in spite of his being subject to Flopson .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 38]: Mr. Pocket was out lecturing ; for , he was a most delightful lecturer on domestic economy , and his treatises on the management of children and servants were considered the very best text-books on those themes .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 46]: But Mrs. Pocket was at home , and was in a little difficulty , on account of the baby 's having been accommodated with a needle-case to keep him quiet during the unaccountable absence -LRB- with a relative in the Foot Guards -RRB- of Millers .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 31]: And more needles were missing than it could be regarded as quite wholesome for a patient of such tender years either to apply externally or to take as a tonic .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 43]: Mr. Pocket being justly celebrated for giving most excellent practical advice , and for having a clear and sound perception of things and a highly judicious mind , I had some notion in my heart-ache of begging him to accept my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 37]: But happening to look up at Mrs. Pocket as she sat reading her book of dignities after prescribing Bed as a sovereign remedy for baby , I thought -- Well -- No , I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 26]: Chapter XXXIV As I had grown accustomed to my expectations , I had insensibly begun to notice their effect upon myself and those around me .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 28]: Their influence on my own character I disguised from my recognition as much as possible , but I knew very well that it was not all good .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 14]: I lived in a state of chronic uneasiness respecting my behavior to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 11]: My conscience was not by any means comfortable about Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 60]: When I woke up in the night , -- like Camilla , -- I used to think , with a weariness on my spirits , that I should have been happier and better if I had never seen Miss Havisham 's face , and had risen to manhood content to be partners with Joe in the honest old forge .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 36]: Many a time of an evening , when I sat alone looking at the fire , I thought , after all there was no fire like the forge fire and the kitchen fire at home .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 32]: Yet Estella was so inseparable from all my restlessness and disquiet of mind , that I really fell into confusion as to the limits of my own part in its production .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 37]: That is to say , supposing I had had no expectations , and yet had had Estella to think of , I could not make out to my satisfaction that I should have done much better .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 49]: Now , concerning the influence of my position on others , I was in no such difficulty , and so I perceived -- though dimly enough perhaps -- that it was not beneficial to anybody , and , above all , that it was not beneficial to Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 31]: My lavish habits led his easy nature into expenses that he could not afford , corrupted the simplicity of his life , and disturbed his peace with anxieties and regrets .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 48]: I was not at all remorseful for having unwittingly set those other branches of the Pocket family to the poor arts they practised ; because such littlenesses were their natural bent , and would have been evoked by anybody else , if I had left them slumbering .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 45]: But Herbert 's was a very different case , and it often caused me a twinge to think that I had done him evil service in crowding his sparely furnished chambers with incongruous upholstery work , and placing the Canary-breasted Avenger at his disposal .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 23]: So now , as an infallible way of making little ease great ease , I began to contract a quantity of debt .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 15]: I could hardly begin but Herbert must begin too , so he soon followed .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 68]: At Startop 's suggestion , we put ourselves down for election into a club called The Finches of the Grove : the object of which institution I have never divined , if it were not that the members should dine expensively once a fortnight , to quarrel among themselves as much as possible after dinner , and to cause six waiters to get drunk on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 55]: I know that these gratifying social ends were so invariably accomplished , that Herbert and I understood nothing else to be referred to in the first standing toast of the society : which ran `` Gentlemen , may the present promotion of good feeling ever reign predominant among the Finches of the Grove . ''
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 65]: The Finches spent their money foolishly -LRB- the Hotel we dined at was in Covent Garden -RRB- , and the first Finch I saw when I had the honor of joining the Grove was Bentley Drummle , at that time floundering about town in a cab of his own , and doing a great deal of damage to the posts at the street corners .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 37]: Occasionally , he shot himself out of his equipage headforemost over the apron ; and I saw him on one occasion deliver himself at the door of the Grove in this unintentional way -- like coals .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 34]: But here I anticipate a little , for I was not a Finch , and could not be , according to the sacred laws of the society , until I came of age .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 34]: In my confidence in my own resources , I would willingly have taken Herbert 's expenses on myself ; but Herbert was proud , and I could make no such proposal to him .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 16]: So he got into difficulties in every direction , and continued to look about him .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 112]: When we gradually fell into keeping late hours and late company , I noticed that he looked about him with a desponding eye at breakfast-time ; that he began to look about him more hopefully about mid-day ; that he drooped when he came into dinner ; that he seemed to descry Capital in the distance , rather clearly , after dinner ; that he all but realized Capital towards midnight ; and that at about two o'clock in the morning , he became so deeply despondent again as to talk of buying a rifle and going to America , with a general purpose of compelling buffaloes to make his fortune .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 26]: I was usually at Hammersmith about half the week , and when I was at Hammersmith I haunted Richmond , whereof separately by and by .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 38]: Herbert would often come to Hammersmith when I was there , and I think at those seasons his father would occasionally have some passing perception that the opening he was looking for , had not appeared yet .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 25]: But in the general tumbling up of the family , his tumbling out in life somewhere , was a thing to transact itself somehow .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 22]: In the meantime Mr. Pocket grew grayer , and tried oftener to lift himself out of his perplexities by the hair .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 47]: While Mrs. Pocket tripped up the family with her footstool , read her book of dignities , lost her pocket-handkerchief , told us about her grandpapa , and taught the young idea how to shoot , by shooting it into bed whenever it attracted her notice .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 44]: As I am now generalizing a period of my life with the object of clearing my way before me , I can scarcely do so better than by at once completing the description of our usual manners and customs at Barnard 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 26]: We spent as much money as we could , and got as little for it as people could make up their minds to give us .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 19]: We were always more or less miserable , and most of our acquaintance were in the same condition .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 23]: There was a gay fiction among us that we were constantly enjoying ourselves , and a skeleton truth that we never did .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 19]: To the best of my belief , our case was in the last aspect a rather common one .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 19]: Every morning , with an air ever new , Herbert went into the City to look about him .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 57]: I often paid him a visit in the dark back-room in which he consorted with an ink-jar , a hat-peg , a coal-box , a string-box , an almanac , a desk and stool , and a ruler ; and I do not remember that I ever saw him do anything else but look about him .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 26]: If we all did what we undertake to do , as faithfully as Herbert did , we might live in a Republic of the Virtues .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 39]: He had nothing else to do , poor fellow , except at a certain hour of every afternoon to `` go to Lloyd 's '' -- in observance of a ceremony of seeing his principal , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 21]: He never did anything else in connection with Lloyd 's that I could find out , except come back again .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 48]: When he felt his case unusually serious , and that he positively must find an opening , he would go on ` Change at a busy time , and walk in and out , in a kind of gloomy country dance figure , among the assembled magnates .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 53]: `` For , '' says Herbert to me , coming home to dinner on one of those special occasions , `` I find the truth to be , Handel , that an opening wo n't come to one , but one must go to it , -- so I have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 22]: If we had been less attached to one another , I think we must have hated one another regularly every morning .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 45]: I detested the chambers beyond expression at that period of repentance , and could not endure the sight of the Avenger 's livery ; which had a more expensive and a less remunerative appearance then than at any other time in the four-and-twenty hours .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 99]: As we got more and more into debt , breakfast became a hollower and hollower form , and , being on one occasion at breakfast-time threatened -LRB- by letter -RRB- with legal proceedings , `` not unwholly unconnected , '' as my local paper might put it , `` with jewelery , '' I went so far as to seize the Avenger by his blue collar and shake him off his feet , -- so that he was actually in the air , like a booted Cupid , -- for presuming to suppose that we wanted a roll .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 43]: At certain times -- meaning at uncertain times , for they depended on our humor -- I would say to Herbert , as if it were a remarkable discovery , -- `` My dear Herbert , we are getting on badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 36]: `` My dear Handel , '' Herbert would say to me , in all sincerity , if you will believe me , those very words were on my lips , by a strange coincidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 19]: `` Then , Herbert , '' I would respond , `` let us look into out affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 13]: We always derived profound satisfaction from making an appointment for this purpose .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 28]: I always thought this was business , this was the way to confront the thing , this was the way to take the foe by the throat .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 8]: And I know Herbert thought so too .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 42]: We ordered something rather special for dinner , with a bottle of something similarly out of the common way , in order that our minds might be fortified for the occasion , and we might come well up to the mark .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 26]: Dinner over , we produced a bundle of pens , a copious supply of ink , and a goodly show of writing and blotting paper .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 12]: For there was something very comfortable in having plenty of stationery .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 44]: I would then take a sheet of paper , and write across the top of it , in a neat hand , the heading , `` Memorandum of Pip 's debts '' ; with Barnard 's Inn and the date very carefully added .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 25]: Herbert would also take a sheet of paper , and write across it with similar formalities , `` Memorandum of Herbert 's debts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 46]: Each of us would then refer to a confused heap of papers at his side , which had been thrown into drawers , worn into holes in pockets , half burnt in lighting candles , stuck for weeks into the looking-glass , and otherwise damaged .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 30]: The sound of our pens going refreshed us exceedingly , insomuch that I sometimes found it difficult to distinguish between this edifying business proceeding and actually paying the money .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 13]: In point of meritorious character , the two things seemed about equal .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 17]: When we had written a little while , I would ask Herbert how he got on ?
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 21]: Herbert probably would have been scratching his head in a most rueful manner at the sight of his accumulating figures .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 24]: `` They are mounting up , Handel , '' Herbert would say ; `` upon my life , they are mounting up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 19]: `` Be firm , Herbert , '' I would retort , plying my own pen with great assiduity .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 8]: `` Look the thing in the face .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 5]: Look into your affairs .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 7]: Stare them out of countenance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 17]: `` So I would , Handel , only they are staring me out of countenance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 18]: However , my determined manner would have its effect , and Herbert would fall to work again .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 36]: After a time he would give up once more , on the plea that he had not got Cobbs 's bill , or Lobbs 's , or Nobbs 's , as the case might be .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 19]: `` Then , Herbert , estimate ; estimate it in round numbers , and put it down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 10]: `` What a fellow of resource you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 8]: my friend would reply , with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 10]: `` Really your business powers are very remarkable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 5]: I thought so too .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 29]: I established with myself , on these occasions , the reputation of a first-rate man of business , -- prompt , decisive , energetic , clear , cool-headed .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 24]: When I had got all my responsibilities down upon my list , I compared each with the bill , and ticked it off .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 13]: My self-approval when I ticked an entry was quite a luxurious sensation .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 32]: When I had no more ticks to make , I folded all my bills up uniformly , docketed each on the back , and tied the whole into a symmetrical bundle .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 33]: Then I did the same for Herbert -LRB- who modestly said he had not my administrative genius -RRB- , and felt that I had brought his affairs into a focus for him .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 18]: My business habits had one other bright feature , which I called `` leaving a Margin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 34]: For example ; supposing Herbert 's debts to be one hundred and sixty-four pounds four-and-twopence , I would say , `` Leave a margin , and put them down at two hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 26]: Or , supposing my own to be four times as much , I would leave a margin , and put them down at seven hundred .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 34]: I had the highest opinion of the wisdom of this same Margin , but I am bound to acknowledge that on looking back , I deem it to have been an expensive device .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 39]: For , we always ran into new debt immediately , to the full extent of the margin , and sometimes , in the sense of freedom and solvency it imparted , got pretty far on into another margin .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 34]: But there was a calm , a rest , a virtuous hush , consequent on these examinations of our affairs that gave me , for the time , an admirable opinion of myself .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 47]: Soothed by my exertions , my method , and Herbert 's compliments , I would sit with his symmetrical bundle and my own on the table before me among the stationary , and feel like a Bank of some sort , rather than a private individual .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 19]: We shut our outer door on these solemn occasions , in order that we might not be interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 30]: I had fallen into my serene state one evening , when we heard a letter dropped through the slit in the said door , and fall on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 31]: `` It 's for you , Handel , '' said Herbert , going out and coming back with it , `` and I hope there is nothing the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 12]: This was in allusion to its heavy black seal and border .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 67]: The letter was signed Trabb & Co. , and its contents were simply , that I was an honored sir , and that they begged to inform me that Mrs. J. Gargery had departed this life on Monday last at twenty minutes past six in the evening , and that my attendance was requested at the interment on Monday next at three o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 30]: Chapter XXXV It was the first time that a grave had opened in my road of life , and the gap it made in the smooth ground was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 19]: The figure of my sister in her chair by the kitchen fire , haunted me night and day .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 59]: That the place could possibly be , without her , was something my mind seemed unable to compass ; and whereas she had seldom or never been in my thoughts of late , I had now the strangest ideas that she was coming towards me in the street , or that she would presently knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 54]: In my rooms too , with which she had never been at all associated , there was at once the blankness of death and a perpetual suggestion of the sound of her voice or the turn of her face or figure , as if she were still alive and had been often there .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 18]: Whatever my fortunes might have been , I could scarcely have recalled my sister with much tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 16]: But I suppose there is a shock of regret which may exist without much tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 59]: Under its influence -LRB- and perhaps to make up for the want of the softer feeling -RRB- I was seized with a violent indignation against the assailant from whom she had suffered so much ; and I felt that on sufficient proof I could have revengefully pursued Orlick , or any one else , to the last extremity .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 38]: Having written to Joe , to offer him consolation , and to assure him that I would come to the funeral , I passed the intermediate days in the curious state of mind I have glanced at .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 24]: I went down early in the morning , and alighted at the Blue Boar in good time to walk over to the forge .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 35]: It was fine summer weather again , and , as I walked along , the times when I was a little helpless creature , and my sister did not spare me , vividly returned .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 17]: But they returned with a gentle tone upon them that softened even the edge of Tickler .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 43]: For now , the very breath of the beans and clover whispered to my heart that the day must come when it would be well for my memory that others walking in the sunshine should be softened as they thought of me .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 26]: At last I came within sight of the house , and saw that Trabb and Co. had put in a funereal execution and taken possession .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 85]: Two dismally absurd persons , each ostentatiously exhibiting a crutch done up in a black bandage , -- as if that instrument could possibly communicate any comfort to anybody , -- were posted at the front door ; and in one of them I recognized a postboy discharged from the Boar for turning a young couple into a sawpit on their bridal morning , in consequence of intoxication rendering it necessary for him to ride his horse clasped round the neck with both arms .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 68]: All the children of the village , and most of the women , were admiring these sable warders and the closed windows of the house and forge ; and as I came up , one of the two warders -LRB- the postboy -RRB- knocked at the door , -- implying that I was far too much exhausted by grief to have strength remaining to knock for myself .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 29]: Another sable warder -LRB- a carpenter , who had once eaten two geese for a wager -RRB- opened the door , and showed me into the best parlor .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 39]: Here , Mr. Trabb had taken unto himself the best table , and had got all the leaves up , and was holding a kind of black Bazaar , with the aid of a quantity of black pins .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 33]: At the moment of my arrival , he had just finished putting somebody 's hat into black long-clothes , like an African baby ; so he held out his hand for mine .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 25]: But I , misled by the action , and confused by the occasion , shook hands with him with every testimony of warm affection .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 44]: Poor dear Joe , entangled in a little black cloak tied in a large bow under his chin , was seated apart at the upper end of the room ; where , as chief mourner , he had evidently been stationed by Trabb .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 18]: When I bent down and said to him , `` Dear Joe , how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 31]: he said , `` Pip , old chap , you knowed her when she were a fine figure of a -- '' and clasped my hand and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 23]: Biddy , looking very neat and modest in her black dress , went quietly here and there , and was very helpful .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 44]: When I had spoken to Biddy , as I thought it not a time for talking I went and sat down near Joe , and there began to wonder in what part of the house it -- she -- my sister -- was .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 88]: The air of the parlor being faint with the smell of sweet-cake , I looked about for the table of refreshments ; it was scarcely visible until one had got accustomed to the gloom , but there was a cut-up plum cake upon it , and there were cut-up oranges , and sandwiches , and biscuits , and two decanters that I knew very well as ornaments , but had never seen used in all my life ; one full of port , and one of sherry .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 37]: Standing at this table , I became conscious of the servile Pumblechook in a black cloak and several yards of hatband , who was alternately stuffing himself , and making obsequious movements to catch my attention .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 32]: The moment he succeeded , he came over to me -LRB- breathing sherry and crumbs -RRB- , and said in a subdued voice , `` May I , dear sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 3]: and did .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 19]: I then descried Mr. and Mrs. Hubble ; the last-named in a decent speechless paroxysm in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 27]: We were all going to `` follow , '' and were all in course of being tied up separately -LRB- by Trabb -RRB- into ridiculous bundles .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 108]: `` Which I meantersay , Pip , '' Joe whispered me , as we were being what Mr. Trabb called `` formed '' in the parlor , two and two , -- and it was dreadfully like a preparation for some grim kind of dance ; `` which I meantersay , sir , as I would in preference have carried her to the church myself , along with three or four friendly ones wot come to it with willing harts and arms , but it were considered wot the neighbors would look down on such and would be of opinions as it were wanting in respect . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 7]: `` Pocket-handkerchiefs out , all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 13]: cried Mr. Trabb at this point , in a depressed business-like voice .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 4]: `` Pocket-handkerchiefs out !
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 5]: We are ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 37]: So we all put our pocket-handkerchiefs to our faces , as if our noses were bleeding , and filed out two and two ; Joe and I ; Biddy and Pumblechook ; Mr. and Mrs. Hubble .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 75]: The remains of my poor sister had been brought round by the kitchen door , and , it being a point of Undertaking ceremony that the six bearers must be stifled and blinded under a horrible black velvet housing with a white border , the whole looked like a blind monster with twelve human legs , shuffling and blundering along , under the guidance of two keepers , -- the postboy and his comrade .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 54]: The neighborhood , however , highly approved of these arrangements , and we were much admired as we went through the village ; the more youthful and vigorous part of the community making dashes now and then to cut us off , and lying in wait to intercept us at points of vantage .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 29]: At such times the more exuberant among them called out in an excited manner on our emergence round some corner of expectancy , `` Here they come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 6]: `` Here they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 7]: and we were all but cheered .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 37]: In this progress I was much annoyed by the abject Pumblechook , who , being behind me , persisted all the way as a delicate attention in arranging my streaming hatband , and smoothing my cloak .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 30]: My thoughts were further distracted by the excessive pride of Mr. and Mrs. Hubble , who were surpassingly conceited and vainglorious in being members of so distinguished a procession .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 58]: And now the range of marshes lay clear before us , with the sails of the ships on the river growing out of it ; and we went into the churchyard , close to the graves of my unknown parents , Philip Pirrip , late of this parish , and Also Georgiana , Wife of the Above .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 34]: And there , my sister was laid quietly in the earth , while the larks sang high above it , and the light wind strewed it with beautiful shadows of clouds and trees .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 87]: Of the conduct of the worldly minded Pumblechook while this was doing , I desire to say no more than it was all addressed to me ; and that even when those noble passages were read which remind humanity how it brought nothing into the world and can take nothing out , and how it fleeth like a shadow and never continueth long in one stay , I heard him cough a reservation of the case of a young gentleman who came unexpectedly into large property .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 46]: When we got back , he had the hardihood to tell me that he wished my sister could have known I had done her so much honor , and to hint that she would have considered it reasonably purchased at the price of her death .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 53]: After that , he drank all the rest of the sherry , and Mr. Hubble drank the port , and the two talked -LRB- which I have since observed to be customary in such cases -RRB- as if they were of quite another race from the deceased , and were notoriously immortal .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 42]: Finally , he went away with Mr. and Mrs. Hubble , -- to make an evening of it , I felt sure , and to tell the Jolly Bargemen that he was the founder of my fortunes and my earliest benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 40]: When they were all gone , and when Trabb and his men -- but not his Boy ; I looked for him -- had crammed their mummery into bags , and were gone too , the house felt wholesomer .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 59]: Soon afterwards , Biddy , Joe , and I , had a cold dinner together ; but we dined in the best parlor , not in the old kitchen , and Joe was so exceedingly particular what he did with his knife and fork and the saltcellar and what not , that there was great restraint upon us .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 43]: But after dinner , when I made him take his pipe , and when I had loitered with him about the forge , and when we sat down together on the great block of stone outside it , we got on better .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 41]: I noticed that after the funeral Joe changed his clothes so far , as to make a compromise between his Sunday dress and working dress ; in which the dear fellow looked natural , and like the Man he was .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 40]: He was very much pleased by my asking if I might sleep in my own little room , and I was pleased too ; for I felt that I had done rather a great thing in making the request .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 25]: When the shadows of evening were closing in , I took an opportunity of getting into the garden with Biddy for a little talk .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 22]: `` Biddy , '' said I , `` I think you might have written to me about these sad matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 8]: `` Do you , Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 3]: said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 12]: `` I should have written if I had thought that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 27]: `` Do n't suppose that I mean to be unkind , Biddy , when I say I consider that you ought to have thought that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 8]: `` Do you , Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 32]: She was so quiet , and had such an orderly , good , and pretty way with her , that I did not like the thought of making her cry again .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 20]: After looking a little at her downcast eyes as she walked beside me , I gave up that point .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 18]: `` I suppose it will be difficult for you to remain here now , Biddy dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 24]: I ca n't do so , Mr. Pip , '' said Biddy , in a tone of regret but still of quiet conviction .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 17]: `` I have been speaking to Mrs. Hubble , and I am going to her to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 22]: I hope we shall be able to take some care of Mr. Gargery , together , until he settles down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 10]: `` How are you going to live , Biddy ?
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 16]: If you want any mo -- '' `` How am I going to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 14]: repeated Biddy , striking in , with a momentary flush upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you , Mr. Pip .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 19]: I am going to try to get the place of mistress in the new school nearly finished here .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 28]: I can be well recommended by all the neighbors , and I hope I can be industrious and patient , and teach myself while I teach others .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 55]: You know , Mr. Pip , '' pursued Biddy , with a smile , as she raised her eyes to my face , `` the new schools are not like the old , but I learnt a good deal from you after that time , and have had time since then to improve . ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 15]: `` I think you would always improve , Biddy , under any circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 13]: Except in my bad side of human nature , '' murmured Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 13]: It was not so much a reproach as an irresistible thinking aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 10]: I thought I would give up that point too .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 17]: So , I walked a little further with Biddy , looking silently at her downcast eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 16]: `` I have not heard the particulars of my sister 's death , Biddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 9]: `` They are very slight , poor thing .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 49]: She had been in one of her bad states -- though they had got better of late , rather than worse -- for four days , when she came out of it in the evening , just at tea-time , and said quite plainly , ` Joe . '
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 23]: As she had never said any word for a long while , I ran and fetched in Mr. Gargery from the forge .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 27]: She made signs to me that she wanted him to sit down close to her , and wanted me to put her arms round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 22]: So I put them round his neck , and she laid her head down on his shoulder quite content and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 22]: And so she presently said ` Joe ' again , and once ` Pardon , ' and once ` Pip . '
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 36]: And so she never lifted her head up any more , and it was just an hour later when we laid it down on her own bed , because we found she was gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 26]: Biddy cried ; the darkening garden , and the lane , and the stars that were coming out , were blurred in my own sight .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 9]: `` Nothing was ever discovered , Biddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 11]: `` Do you know what is become of Orlick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 19]: `` I should think from the color of his clothes that he is working in the quarries . ''
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 9]: `` Of course you have seen him then ?
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 14]: -- Why are you looking at that dark tree in the lane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 13]: `` I saw him there , on the night she died . ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 12]: `` That was not the last time either , Biddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 16]: `` No ; I have seen him there , since we have been walking here .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 47]: -- It is of no use , '' said Biddy , laying her hand upon my arm , as I was for running out , `` you know I would not deceive you ; he was not there a minute , and he is gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 23]: It revived my utmost indignation to find that she was still pursued by this fellow , and I felt inveterate against him .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 26]: I told her so , and told her that I would spend any money or take any pains to drive him out of that country .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 73]: By degrees she led me into more temperate talk , and she told me how Joe loved me , and how Joe never complained of anything , -- she did n't say , of me ; she had no need ; I knew what she meant , -- but ever did his duty in his way of life , with a strong hand , a quiet tongue , and a gentle heart .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 41]: `` Indeed , it would be hard to say too much for him , '' said I ; `` and Biddy , we must often speak of these things , for of course I shall be often down here now .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 11]: I am not going to leave poor Joe alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 7]: Biddy said never a single word .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 10]: `` Biddy , do n't you hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 30]: `` Not to mention your calling me Mr. Pip , -- which appears to me to be in bad taste , Biddy , -- what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 7]: `` What do I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 5]: asked Biddy , timidly .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 26]: `` Biddy , '' said I , in a virtuously self-asserting manner , `` I must request to know what you mean by this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 5]: `` By this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 3]: said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 11]: `` Now , do n't echo , '' I retorted .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 10]: `` You used not to echo , Biddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 5]: `` Used not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 3]: said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 5]: `` O Mr. Pip !
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 3]: Used ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 11]: I rather thought I would give up that point too .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 16]: After another silent turn in the garden , I fell back on the main position .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 31]: `` Biddy , '' said I , `` I made a remark respecting my coming down here often , to see Joe , which you received with a marked silence .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 12]: Have the goodness , Biddy , to tell me why . ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 18]: `` Are you quite sure , then , that you WILL come to see him often ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 24]: asked Biddy , stopping in the narrow garden walk , and looking at me under the stars with a clear and honest eye .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 6]: `` O dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 16]: said I , as if I found myself compelled to give up Biddy in despair .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 12]: `` This really is a very bad side of human nature !
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 12]: Do n't say any more , if you please , Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 7]: This shocks me very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 53]: For which cogent reason I kept Biddy at a distance during supper , and when I went up to my own old little room , took as stately a leave of her as I could , in my murmuring soul , deem reconcilable with the churchyard and the event of the day .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 38]: As often as I was restless in the night , and that was every quarter of an hour , I reflected what an unkindness , what an injury , what an injustice , Biddy had done me .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 9]: Early in the morning I was to go .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 24]: Early in the morning I was out , and looking in , unseen , at one of the wooden windows of the forge .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 45]: There I stood , for minutes , looking at Joe , already at work with a glow of health and strength upon his face that made it show as if the bright sun of the life in store for him were shining on it .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 7]: `` Good by , dear Joe !
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 20]: -- No , do n't wipe it off -- for God 's sake , give me your blackened hand !
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 10]: -- I shall be down soon and often . ''
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 20]: `` Never too soon , sir , '' said Joe , `` and never too often , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 22]: Biddy was waiting for me at the kitchen door , with a mug of new milk and a crust of bread .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 28]: `` Biddy , '' said I , when I gave her my hand at parting , `` I am not angry , but I am hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 28]: `` No , do n't be hurt , '' she pleaded quite pathetically ; `` let only me be hurt , if I have been ungenerous . ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 12]: Once more , the mists were rising as I walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 39]: If they disclosed to me , as I suspect they did , that I should not come back , and that Biddy was quite right , all I can say is , -- they were quite right too .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 77]: Chapter XXXVI Herbert and I went on from bad to worse , in the way of increasing our debts , looking into our affairs , leaving Margins , and the like exemplary transactions ; and Time went on , whether or no , as he has a way of doing ; and I came of age , -- in fulfilment of Herbert 's prediction , that I should do so before I knew where I was .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 11]: Herbert himself had come of age eight months before me .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 25]: As he had nothing else than his majority to come into , the event did not make a profound sensation in Barnard 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 36]: But we had looked forward to my one-and-twentieth birthday , with a crowd of speculations and anticipations , for we had both considered that my guardian could hardly help saying something definite on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 17]: I had taken care to have it well understood in Little Britain when my birthday was .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 38]: On the day before it , I received an official note from Wemmick , informing me that Mr. Jaggers would be glad if I would call upon him at five in the afternoon of the auspicious day .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 31]: This convinced us that something great was to happen , and threw me into an unusual flutter when I repaired to my guardian 's office , a model of punctuality .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 31]: In the outer office Wemmick offered me his congratulations , and incidentally rubbed the side of his nose with a folded piece of tissue-paper that I liked the look of .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 19]: But he said nothing respecting it , and motioned me with a nod into my guardian 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 26]: It was November , and my guardian was standing before his fire leaning his back against the chimney-piece , with his hands under his coattails .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 18]: `` Well , Pip , '' said he , `` I must call you Mr. Pip to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 6]: Congratulations , Mr. Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 19]: We shook hands , -- he was always a remarkably short shaker , -- and I thanked him .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 13]: `` Take a chair , Mr. Pip , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 40]: As I sat down , and he preserved his attitude and bent his brows at his boots , I felt at a disadvantage , which reminded me of that old time when I had been put upon a tombstone .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 32]: The two ghastly casts on the shelf were not far from him , and their expression was as if they were making a stupid apoplectic attempt to attend to the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 35]: `` Now my young friend , '' my guardian began , as if I were a witness in the box , `` I am going to have a word or two with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 8]: `` If you please , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 46]: `` What do you suppose , '' said Mr. Jaggers , bending forward to look at the ground , and then throwing his head back to look at the ceiling , -- `` what do you suppose you are living at the rate of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 9]: `` At the rate of , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 22]: `` At , '' repeated Mr. Jaggers , still looking at the ceiling , `` the -- rate -- of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 22]: And then looked all round the room , and paused with his pocket-handkerchief in his hand , half-way to his nose .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 26]: I had looked into my affairs so often , that I had thoroughly destroyed any slight notion I might ever have had of their bearings .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 12]: Reluctantly , I confessed myself quite unable to answer the question .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 17]: This reply seemed agreeable to Mr. Jaggers , who said , `` I thought so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 10]: and blew his nose with an air of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 18]: `` Now , I have asked you a question , my friend , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 9]: `` Have you anything to ask me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 26]: `` Of course it would be a great relief to me to ask you several questions , sir ; but I remember your prohibition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 9]: `` Ask one , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 13]: `` Is my benefactor to be made known to me to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 4]: Ask another . ''
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 12]: `` Is that confidence to be imparted to me soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 18]: `` Waive that , a moment , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` and ask another . ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 30]: I looked about me , but there appeared to be now no possible escape from the inquiry , `` Have -- I -- anything to receive , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 19]: On that , Mr. Jaggers said , triumphantly , `` I thought we should come to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 12]: and called to Wemmick to give him that piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 10]: Wemmick appeared , handed it in , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 18]: `` Now , Mr. Pip , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` attend , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 28]: You have been drawing pretty freely here ; your name occurs pretty often in Wemmick 's cash-book ; but you are in debt , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 12]: `` I am afraid I must say yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 13]: `` You know you must say yes ; do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 33]: `` I do n't ask you what you owe , because you do n't know ; and if you did know , you would n't tell me ; you would say less .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 42]: Yes , yes , my friend , '' cried Mr. Jaggers , waving his forefinger to stop me as I made a show of protesting : `` it 's likely enough that you think you would n't , but you would .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 12]: You 'll excuse me , but I know better than you .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 11]: Now , take this piece of paper in your hand .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 5]: You have got it ?
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 12]: Now , unfold it and tell me what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 17]: `` This is a bank-note , '' said I , `` for five hundred pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 17]: `` That is a bank-note , '' repeated Mr. Jaggers , `` for five hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 12]: And a very handsome sum of money too , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 6]: You consider it so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 8]: `` How could I do otherwise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 10]: But answer the question , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 4]: `` Undoubtedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 13]: `` You consider it , undoubtedly , a handsome sum of money .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 14]: Now , that handsome sum of money , Pip , is your own .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 16]: It is a present to you on this day , in earnest of your expectations .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 31]: And at the rate of that handsome sum of money per annum , and at no higher rate , you are to live until the donor of the whole appears .
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 49]: That is to say , you will now take your money affairs entirely into your own hands , and you will draw from Wemmick one hundred and twenty-five pounds per quarter , until you are in communication with the fountain-head , and no longer with the mere agent .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 13]: As I have told you before , I am the mere agent .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 13]: I execute my instructions , and I am paid for doing so .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 19]: I think them injudicious , but I am not paid for giving any opinion on their merits . ''
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 26]: I was beginning to express my gratitude to my benefactor for the great liberality with which I was treated , when Mr. Jaggers stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 55]: `` I am not paid , Pip , '' said he , coolly , `` to carry your words to any one ; '' and then gathered up his coat-tails , as he had gathered up the subject , and stood frowning at his boots as if he suspected them of designs against him .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 29]: After a pause , I hinted , -- `` There was a question just now , Mr. Jaggers , which you desired me to waive for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 13]: I hope I am doing nothing wrong in asking it again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 32]: I might have known that he would never help me out ; but it took me aback to have to shape the question afresh , as if it were quite new .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 36]: `` Is it likely , '' I said , after hesitating , `` that my patron , the fountain-head you have spoken of , Mr. Jaggers , will soon -- '' there I delicately stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 6]: `` Will soon what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 4]: asked Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 13]: `` That 's no question as it stands , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 29]: `` Will soon come to London , '' said I , after casting about for a precise form of words , `` or summon me anywhere else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 39]: `` Now , here , '' replied Mr. Jaggers , fixing me for the first time with his dark deep-set eyes , `` we must revert to the evening when we first encountered one another in your village .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 10]: What did I tell you then , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 20]: `` You told me , Mr. Jaggers , that it might be years hence when that person appeared . ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 16]: `` Just so , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` that 's my answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 25]: As we looked full at one another , I felt my breath come quicker in my strong desire to get something out of him .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 37]: And as I felt that it came quicker , and as I felt that he saw that it came quicker , I felt that I had less chance than ever of getting anything out of him .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 15]: `` Do you suppose it will still be years hence , Mr. Jaggers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 68]: Mr. Jaggers shook his head , -- not in negativing the question , but in altogether negativing the notion that he could anyhow be got to answer it , -- and the two horrible casts of the twitched faces looked , when my eyes strayed up to them , as if they had come to a crisis in their suspended attention , and were going to sneeze .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 30]: said Mr. Jaggers , warming the backs of his legs with the backs of his warmed hands , `` I 'll be plain with you , my friend Pip .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 10]: That 's a question I must not be asked .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 19]: You 'll understand that better , when I tell you it 's a question that might compromise me .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 16]: I 'll go a little further with you ; I 'll say something more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 28]: He bent down so low to frown at his boots , that he was able to rub the calves of his legs in the pause he made .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 25]: `` When that person discloses , '' said Mr. Jaggers , straightening himself , `` you and that person will settle your own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 15]: When that person discloses , my part in this business will cease and determine .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 18]: When that person discloses , it will not be necessary for me to know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 11]: And that 's all I have got to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 18]: We looked at one another until I withdrew my eyes , and looked thoughtfully at the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 65]: From this last speech I derived the notion that Miss Havisham , for some reason or no reason , had not taken him into her confidence as to her designing me for Estella ; that he resented this , and felt a jealousy about it ; or that he really did object to that scheme , and would have nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 27]: When I raised my eyes again , I found that he had been shrewdly looking at me all the time , and was doing so still .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 28]: `` If that is all you have to say , sir , '' I remarked , `` there can be nothing left for me to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 21]: He nodded assent , and pulled out his thief-dreaded watch , and asked me where I was going to dine ?
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 10]: I replied at my own chambers , with Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 24]: As a necessary sequence , I asked him if he would favor us with his company , and he promptly accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 43]: But he insisted on walking home with me , in order that I might make no extra preparation for him , and first he had a letter or two to write , and -LRB- of course -RRB- had his hands to wash .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 15]: So I said I would go into the outer office and talk to Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 48]: The fact was , that when the five hundred pounds had come into my pocket , a thought had come into my head which had been often there before ; and it appeared to me that Wemmick was a good person to advise with concerning such thought .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 15]: He had already locked up his safe , and made preparations for going home .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 66]: He had left his desk , brought out his two greasy office candlesticks and stood them in line with the snuffers on a slab near the door , ready to be extinguished ; he had raked his fire low , put his hat and great-coat ready , and was beating himself all over the chest with his safe-key , as an athletic exercise after business .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 16]: `` Mr. Wemmick , '' said I , `` I want to ask your opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 10]: I am very desirous to serve a friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 23]: Wemmick tightened his post-office and shook his head , as if his opinion were dead against any fatal weakness of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 34]: `` This friend , '' I pursued , `` is trying to get on in commercial life , but has no money , and finds it difficult and disheartening to make a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 12]: Now I want somehow to help him to a beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 6]: `` With money down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 11]: said Wemmick , in a tone drier than any sawdust .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 41]: `` With some money down , '' I replied , for an uneasy remembrance shot across me of that symmetrical bundle of papers at home -- `` with some money down , and perhaps some anticipation of my expectations . ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 39]: `` Mr. Pip , '' said Wemmick , `` I should like just to run over with you on my fingers , if you please , the names of the various bridges up as high as Chelsea Reach .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 31]: Let 's see ; there 's London , one ; Southwark , two ; Blackfriars , three ; Waterloo , four ; Westminster , five ; Vauxhall , six . ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 23]: He had checked off each bridge in its turn , with the handle of his safe-key on the palm of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 16]: `` There 's as many as six , you see , to choose from . ''
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 54]: `` I do n't understand you , '' said I. `` Choose your bridge , Mr. Pip , '' returned Wemmick , `` and take a walk upon your bridge , and pitch your money into the Thames over the centre arch of your bridge , and you know the end of it .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 28]: Serve a friend with it , and you may know the end of it too , -- but it 's a less pleasant and profitable end . ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 19]: I could have posted a newspaper in his mouth , he made it so wide after saying this .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 19]: `` This is very discouraging , '' said I. `` Meant to be so , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 34]: `` Then is it your opinion , '' I inquired , with some little indignation , `` that a man should never -- '' '' -- Invest portable property in a friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 3]: said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 6]: `` Certainly he should not .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 32]: Unless he wants to get rid of the friend , -- and then it becomes a question how much portable property it may be worth to get rid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 18]: `` And that , '' said I , `` is your deliberate opinion , Mr. Wemmick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 17]: `` That , '' he returned , `` is my deliberate opinion in this office . ''
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 28]: said I , pressing him , for I thought I saw him near a loophole here ; `` but would that be your opinion at Walworth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 23]: `` Mr. Pip , '' he replied , with gravity , `` Walworth is one place , and this office is another .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 14]: Much as the Aged is one person , and Mr. Jaggers is another .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 7]: They must not be confounded together .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 22]: My Walworth sentiments must be taken at Walworth ; none but my official sentiments can be taken in this office . ''
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 28]: `` Very well , '' said I , much relieved , `` then I shall look you up at Walworth , you may depend upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 23]: `` Mr. Pip , '' he returned , `` you will be welcome there , in a private and personal capacity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 24]: We had held this conversation in a low voice , well knowing my guardian 's ears to be the sharpest of the sharp .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 26]: As he now appeared in his doorway , towelling his hands , Wemmick got on his great-coat and stood by to snuff out the candles .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 26]: We all three went into the street together , and from the door-step Wemmick turned his way , and Mr. Jaggers and I turned ours .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 41]: I could not help wishing more than once that evening , that Mr. Jaggers had had an Aged in Gerrard Street , or a Stinger , or a Something , or a Somebody , to unbend his brows a little .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 33]: It was an uncomfortable consideration on a twenty-first birthday , that coming of age at all seemed hardly worth while in such a guarded and suspicious world as he made of it .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 26]: He was a thousand times better informed and cleverer than Wemmick , and yet I would a thousand times rather have had Wemmick to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 53]: And Mr. Jaggers made not me alone intensely melancholy , because , after he was gone , Herbert said of himself , with his eyes fixed on the fire , that he thought he must have committed a felony and forgotten the details of it , he felt so dejected and guilty .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 29]: Chapter XXXVII Deeming Sunday the best day for taking Mr. Wemmick 's Walworth sentiments , I devoted the next ensuing Sunday afternoon to a pilgrimage to the Castle .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 45]: On arriving before the battlements , I found the Union Jack flying and the drawbridge up ; but undeterred by this show of defiance and resistance , I rang at the gate , and was admitted in a most pacific manner by the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 48]: `` My son , sir , '' said the old man , after securing the drawbridge , `` rather had it in his mind that you might happen to drop in , and he left word that he would soon be home from his afternoon 's walk .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 12]: He is very regular in his walks , is my son .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 10]: Very regular in everything , is my son . ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 24]: I nodded at the old gentleman as Wemmick himself might have nodded , and we went in and sat down by the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 39]: `` You made acquaintance with my son , sir , '' said the old man , in his chirping way , while he warmed his hands at the blaze , `` at his office , I expect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 3]: I nodded .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 3]: `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 17]: I have heerd that my son is a wonderful hand at his business , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 4]: I nodded hard .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 8]: `` Yes ; so they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 7]: His business is the Law ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 4]: I nodded harder .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 35]: `` Which makes it more surprising in my son , '' said the old man , `` for he was not brought up to the Law , but to the Wine -- Coopering . ''
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 23]: Curious to know how the old gentleman stood informed concerning the reputation of Mr. Jaggers , I roared that name at him .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 30]: He threw me into the greatest confusion by laughing heartily and replying in a very sprightly manner , `` No , to be sure ; you 're right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 23]: And to this hour I have not the faintest notion what he meant , or what joke he thought I had made .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 39]: As I could not sit there nodding at him perpetually , without making some other attempt to interest him , I shouted at inquiry whether his own calling in life had been `` the Wine -- Coopering . ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 35]: By dint of straining that term out of myself several times and tapping the old gentleman on the chest to associate it with him , I at last succeeded in making my meaning understood .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 16]: `` No , '' said the old gentleman ; `` the warehousing , the warehousing .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 35]: First , over yonder ; '' he appeared to mean up the chimney , but I believe he intended to refer me to Liverpool ; `` and then in the City of London here .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 25]: However , having an infirmity -- for I am hard of hearing , sir -- '' I expressed in pantomime the greatest astonishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 43]: -- Yes , hard of hearing ; having that infirmity coming upon me , my son he went into the Law , and he took charge of me , and he by little and little made out this elegant and beautiful property .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 36]: But returning to what you said , you know , '' pursued the old man , again laughing heartily , `` what I say is , No to be sure ; you 're right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 63]: I was modestly wondering whether my utmost ingenuity would have enabled me to say anything that would have amused him half as much as this imaginary pleasantry , when I was startled by a sudden click in the wall on one side of the chimney , and the ghostly tumbling open of a little wooden flap with `` JOHN '' upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 21]: The old man , following my eyes , cried with great triumph , `` My son 's come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 9]: and we both went out to the drawbridge .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 34]: It was worth any money to see Wemmick waving a salute to me from the other side of the moat , when we might have shaken hands across it with the greatest ease .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 44]: The Aged was so delighted to work the drawbridge , that I made no offer to assist him , but stood quiet until Wemmick had come across , and had presented me to Miss Skiffins ; a lady by whom he was accompanied .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 23]: Miss Skiffins was of a wooden appearance , and was , like her escort , in the post-office branch of the service .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 24]: She might have been some two or three years younger than Wemmick , and I judged her to stand possessed of portable property .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 47]: The cut of her dress from the waist upward , both before and behind , made her figure very like a boy 's kite ; and I might have pronounced her gown a little too decidedly orange , and her gloves a little too intensely green .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 20]: But she seemed to be a good sort of fellow , and showed a high regard for the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 59]: I was not long in discovering that she was a frequent visitor at the Castle ; for , on our going in , and my complimenting Wemmick on his ingenious contrivance for announcing himself to the Aged , he begged me to give my attention for a moment to the other side of the chimney , and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 45]: Presently another click came , and another little door tumbled open with `` Miss Skiffins '' on it ; then Miss Skiffins shut up and John tumbled open ; then Miss Skiffins and John both tumbled open together , and finally shut up together .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 41]: On Wemmick 's return from working these mechanical appliances , I expressed the great admiration with which I regarded them , and he said , `` Well , you know , they 're both pleasant and useful to the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 43]: And by George , sir , it 's a thing worth mentioning , that of all the people who come to this gate , the secret of those pulls is only known to the Aged , Miss Skiffins , and me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 24]: `` And Mr. Wemmick made them , '' added Miss Skiffins , `` with his own hands out of his own head . ''
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 51]: While Miss Skiffins was taking off her bonnet -LRB- she retained her green gloves during the evening as an outward and visible sign that there was company -RRB- , Wemmick invited me to take a walk with him round the property , and see how the island looked in wintertime .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 30]: Thinking that he did this to give me an opportunity of taking his Walworth sentiments , I seized the opportunity as soon as we were out of the Castle .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 22]: Having thought of the matter with care , I approached my subject as if I had never hinted at it before .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 29]: I informed Wemmick that I was anxious in behalf of Herbert Pocket , and I told him how we had first met , and how we had fought .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 35]: I glanced at Herbert 's home , and at his character , and at his having no means but such as he was dependent on his father for ; those , uncertain and unpunctual .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 44]: I alluded to the advantages I had derived in my first rawness and ignorance from his society , and I confessed that I feared I had but ill repaid them , and that he might have done better without me and my expectations .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 51]: Keeping Miss Havisham in the background at a great distance , I still hinted at the possibility of my having competed with him in his prospects , and at the certainty of his possessing a generous soul , and being far above any mean distrusts , retaliations , or designs .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 103]: For all these reasons -LRB- I told Wemmick -RRB- , and because he was my young companion and friend , and I had a great affection for him , I wished my own good fortune to reflect some rays upon him , and therefore I sought advice from Wemmick 's experience and knowledge of men and affairs , how I could best try with my resources to help Herbert to some present income , -- say of a hundred a year , to keep him in good hope and heart , -- and gradually to buy him on to some small partnership .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 39]: I begged Wemmick , in conclusion , to understand that my help must always be rendered without Herbert 's knowledge or suspicion , and that there was no one else in the world with whom I could advise .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 47]: I wound up by laying my hand upon his shoulder , and saying , `` I ca n't help confiding in you , though I know it must be troublesome to you ; but that is your fault , in having ever brought me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 32]: Wemmick was silent for a little while , and then said with a kind of start , `` Well you know , Mr. Pip , I must tell you one thing .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 8]: This is devilish good of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 33]: `` Say you 'll help me to be good then , '' said I. `` Ecod , '' replied Wemmick , shaking his head , `` that 's not my trade . ''
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 19]: `` Nor is this your trading-place , '' said I. `` You are right , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 9]: `` You hit the nail on the head .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 24]: Mr. Pip , I 'll put on my considering-cap , and I think all you want to do may be done by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 13]: Skiffins -LRB- that 's her brother -RRB- is an accountant and agent .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 13]: I 'll look him up and go to work for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 9]: `` I thank you ten thousand times . ''
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 45]: `` On the contrary , '' said he , `` I thank you , for though we are strictly in our private and personal capacity , still it may be mentioned that there are Newgate cobwebs about , and it brushes them away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 23]: After a little further conversation to the same effect , we returned into the Castle where we found Miss Skiffins preparing tea .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 36]: The responsible duty of making the toast was delegated to the Aged , and that excellent old gentleman was so intent upon it that he seemed to me in some danger of melting his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 17]: It was no nominal meal that we were going to make , but a vigorous reality .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 63]: The Aged prepared such a hay-stack of buttered toast , that I could scarcely see him over it as it simmered on an iron stand hooked on to the top-bar ; while Miss Skiffins brewed such a jorum of tea , that the pig in the back premises became strongly excited , and repeatedly expressed his desire to participate in the entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 45]: The flag had been struck , and the gun had been fired , at the right moment of time , and I felt as snugly cut off from the rest of Walworth as if the moat were thirty feet wide by as many deep .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 41]: Nothing disturbed the tranquillity of the Castle , but the occasional tumbling open of John and Miss Skiffins : which little doors were a prey to some spasmodic infirmity that made me sympathetically uncomfortable until I got used to it .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 63]: I inferred from the methodical nature of Miss Skiffins 's arrangements that she made tea there every Sunday night ; and I rather suspected that a classic brooch she wore , representing the profile of an undesirable female with a very straight nose and a very new moon , was a piece of portable property that had been given her by Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 30]: We ate the whole of the toast , and drank tea in proportion , and it was delightful to see how warm and greasy we all got after it .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 20]: The Aged especially , might have passed for some clean old chief of a savage tribe , just oiled .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 50]: After a short pause of repose , Miss Skiffins -- in the absence of the little servant who , it seemed , retired to the bosom of her family on Sunday afternoons -- washed up the tea-things , in a trifling lady-like amateur manner that compromised none of us .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 32]: Then , she put on her gloves again , and we drew round the fire , and Wemmick said , `` Now , Aged Parent , tip us the paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 34]: Wemmick explained to me while the Aged got his spectacles out , that this was according to custom , and that it gave the old gentleman infinite satisfaction to read the news aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 29]: `` I wo n't offer an apology , '' said Wemmick , `` for he is n't capable of many pleasures -- are you , Aged P. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 20]: `` All right , John , all right , '' returned the old man , seeing himself spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 32]: `` Only tip him a nod every now and then when he looks off his paper , '' said Wemmick , `` and he 'll be as happy as a king .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 9]: We are all attention , Aged One . ''
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 10]: `` All right , John , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 19]: returned the cheerful old man , so busy and so pleased , that it really was quite charming .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 29]: The Aged 's reading reminded me of the classes at Mr. Wopsle 's great-aunt 's , with the pleasanter peculiarity that it seemed to come through a keyhole .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 37]: As he wanted the candles close to him , and as he was always on the verge of putting either his head or the newspaper into them , he required as much watching as a powder-mill .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 24]: But Wemmick was equally untiring and gentle in his vigilance , and the Aged read on , quite unconscious of his many rescues .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 22]: Whenever he looked at us , we all expressed the greatest interest and amazement , and nodded until he resumed again .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 48]: As Wemmick and Miss Skiffins sat side by side , and as I sat in a shadowy corner , I observed a slow and gradual elongation of Mr. Wemmick 's mouth , powerfully suggestive of his slowly and gradually stealing his arm round Miss Skiffins 's waist .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 57]: In course of time I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins ; but at that moment Miss Skiffins neatly stopped him with the green glove , unwound his arm again as if it were an article of dress , and with the greatest deliberation laid it on the table before her .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 45]: Miss Skiffins 's composure while she did this was one of the most remarkable sights I have ever seen , and if I could have thought the act consistent with abstraction of mind , I should have deemed that Miss Skiffins performed it mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 21]: By and by , I noticed Wemmick 's arm beginning to disappear again , and gradually fading out of view .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 10]: Shortly afterwards , his mouth began to widen again .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 29]: After an interval of suspense on my part that was quite enthralling and almost painful , I saw his hand appear on the other side of Miss Skiffins .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 30]: Instantly , Miss Skiffins stopped it with the neatness of a placid boxer , took off that girdle or cestus as before , and laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 45]: Taking the table to represent the path of virtue , I am justified in stating that during the whole time of the Aged 's reading , Wemmick 's arm was straying from the path of virtue and being recalled to it by Miss Skiffins .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 12]: At last , the Aged read himself into a light slumber .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 37]: This was the time for Wemmick to produce a little kettle , a tray of glasses , and a black bottle with a porcelain-topped cork , representing some clerical dignitary of a rubicund and social aspect .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 24]: With the aid of these appliances we all had something warm to drink , including the Aged , who was soon awake again .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 17]: Miss Skiffins mixed , and I observed that she and Wemmick drank out of one glass .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 45]: Of course I knew better than to offer to see Miss Skiffins home , and under the circumstances I thought I had best go first ; which I did , taking a cordial leave of the Aged , and having passed a pleasant evening .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 53]: Before a week was out , I received a note from Wemmick , dated Walworth , stating that he hoped he had made some advance in that matter appertaining to our private and personal capacities , and that he would be glad if I could come and see him again upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 45]: So , I went out to Walworth again , and yet again , and yet again , and I saw him by appointment in the City several times , but never held any communication with him on the subject in or near Little Britain .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 44]: The upshot was , that we found a worthy young merchant or shipping-broker , not long established in business , who wanted intelligent help , and who wanted capital , and who in due course of time and receipt would want a partner .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 58]: Between him and me , secret articles were signed of which Herbert was the subject , and I paid him half of my five hundred pounds down , and engaged for sundry other payments : some , to fall due at certain dates out of my income : some , contingent on my coming into my property .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 8]: Miss Skiffins 's brother conducted the negotiation .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 11]: Wemmick pervaded it throughout , but never appeared in it .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 22]: The whole business was so cleverly managed , that Herbert had not the least suspicion of my hand being in it .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 66]: I never shall forget the radiant face with which he came home one afternoon , and told me , as a mighty piece of news , of his having fallen in with one Clarriker -LRB- the young merchant 's name -RRB- , and of Clarriker 's having shown an extraordinary inclination towards him , and of his belief that the opening had come at last .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 44]: Day by day as his hopes grew stronger and his face brighter , he must have thought me a more and more affectionate friend , for I had the greatest difficulty in restraining my tears of triumph when I saw him so happy .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 61]: At length , the thing being done , and he having that day entered Clarriker 's House , and he having talked to me for a whole evening in a flush of pleasure and success , I did really cry in good earnest when I went to bed , to think that my expectations had done some good to somebody .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 20]: A great event in my life , the turning point of my life , now opens on my view .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 29]: But , before I proceed to narrate it , and before I pass on to all the changes it involved , I must give one chapter to Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 16]: It is not much to give to the theme that so long filled my heart .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 34]: Chapter XXXVIII If that staid old house near the Green at Richmond should ever come to be haunted when I am dead , it will be haunted , surely , by my ghost .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 23]: O the many , many nights and days through which the unquiet spirit within me haunted that house when Estella lived there !
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 22]: Let my body be where it would , my spirit was always wandering , wandering , wandering , about that house .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 26]: The lady with whom Estella was placed , Mrs. Brandley by name , was a widow , with one daughter several years older than Estella .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 38]: The mother looked young , and the daughter looked old ; the mother 's complexion was pink , and the daughter 's was yellow ; the mother set up for frivolity , and the daughter for theology .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 22]: They were in what is called a good position , and visited , and were visited by , numbers of people .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 34]: Little , if any , community of feeling subsisted between them and Estella , but the understanding was established that they were necessary to her , and that she was necessary to them .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 17]: Mrs. Brandley had been a friend of Miss Havisham 's before the time of her seclusion .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 27]: In Mrs. Brandley 's house and out of Mrs. Brandley 's house , I suffered every kind and degree of torture that Estella could cause me .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 28]: The nature of my relations with her , which placed me on terms of familiarity without placing me on terms of favor , conduced to my distraction .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 34]: She made use of me to tease other admirers , and she turned the very familiarity between herself and me to the account of putting a constant slight on my devotion to her .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 46]: If I had been her secretary , steward , half-brother , poor relation , -- if I had been a younger brother of her appointed husband , -- I could not have seemed to myself further from my hopes when I was nearest to her .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 50]: The privilege of calling her by her name and hearing her call me by mine became , under the circumstances an aggravation of my trials ; and while I think it likely that it almost maddened her other lovers , I know too certainly that it almost maddened me .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 6]: She had admirers without end .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 26]: No doubt my jealousy made an admirer of every one who went near her ; but there were more than enough of them without that .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 64]: I saw her often at Richmond , I heard of her often in town , and I used often to take her and the Brandleys on the water ; there were picnics , fête days , plays , operas , concerts , parties , all sorts of pleasures , through which I pursued her , -- and they were all miseries to me .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 33]: I never had one hour 's happiness in her society , and yet my mind all round the four-and-twenty hours was harping on the happiness of having her with me unto death .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 44]: Throughout this part of our intercourse , -- and it lasted , as will presently be seen , for what I then thought a long time , -- she habitually reverted to that tone which expressed that our association was forced upon us .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 29]: There were other times when she would come to a sudden check in this tone and in all her many tones , and would seem to pity me .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 39]: `` Pip , Pip , '' she said one evening , coming to such a check , when we sat apart at a darkening window of the house in Richmond ; `` will you never take warning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 5]: `` Of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 5]: `` Of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 16]: `` Warning not to be attracted by you , do you mean , Estella ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 5]: `` Do I mean !
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 14]: If you do n't know what I mean , you are blind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 57]: I should have replied that Love was commonly reputed blind , but for the reason that I always was restrained -- and this was not the least of my miseries -- by a feeling that it was ungenerous to press myself upon her , when she knew that she could not choose but obey Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 34]: My dread always was , that this knowledge on her part laid me under a heavy disadvantage with her pride , and made me the subject of a rebellious struggle in her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 33]: `` At any rate , '' said I , `` I have no warning given me just now , for you wrote to me to come to you , this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 19]: `` That 's true , '' said Estella , with a cold careless smile that always chilled me .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 38]: After looking at the twilight without , for a little while , she went on to say : -- `` The time has come round when Miss Havisham wishes to have me for a day at Satis .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 16]: You are to take me there , and bring me back , if you will .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 30]: She would rather I did not travel alone , and objects to receiving my maid , for she has a sensitive horror of being talked of by such people .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 6]: Can you take me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 9]: `` Can I take you , Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 5]: `` You can then ?
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 9]: The day after to-morrow , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 20]: You are to pay all charges out of my purse , You hear the condition of your going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 9]: `` And must obey , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 35]: This was all the preparation I received for that visit , or for others like it ; Miss Havisham never wrote to me , nor had I ever so much as seen her handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 39]: We went down on the next day but one , and we found her in the room where I had first beheld her , and it is needless to add that there was no change in Satis House .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 40]: She was even more dreadfully fond of Estella than she had been when I last saw them together ; I repeat the word advisedly , for there was something positively dreadful in the energy of her looks and embraces .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 42]: She hung upon Estella 's beauty , hung upon her words , hung upon her gestures , and sat mumbling her own trembling fingers while she looked at her , as though she were devouring the beautiful creature she had reared .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 23]: From Estella she looked at me , with a searching glance that seemed to pry into my heart and probe its wounds .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 16]: `` How does she use you , Pip ; how does she use you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 16]: she asked me again , with her witch-like eagerness , even in Estella 's hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 118]: But , when we sat by her flickering fire at night , she was most weird ; for then , keeping Estella 's hand drawn through her arm and clutched in her own hand , she extorted from her , by dint of referring back to what Estella had told her in her regular letters , the names and conditions of the men whom she had fascinated ; and as Miss Havisham dwelt upon this roll , with the intensity of a mind mortally hurt and diseased , she sat with her other hand on her crutch stick , and her chin on that , and her wan bright eyes glaring at me , a very spectre .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 62]: I saw in this , wretched though it made me , and bitter the sense of dependence and even of degradation that it awakened , -- I saw in this that Estella was set to wreak Miss Havisham 's revenge on men , and that she was not to be given to me until she had gratified it for a term .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 15]: I saw in this , a reason for her being beforehand assigned to me .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 42]: Sending her out to attract and torment and do mischief , Miss Havisham sent her with the malicious assurance that she was beyond the reach of all admirers , and that all who staked upon that cast were secured to lose .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 26]: I saw in this that I , too , was tormented by a perversion of ingenuity , even while the prize was reserved for me .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 34]: I saw in this the reason for my being staved off so long and the reason for my late guardian 's declining to commit himself to the formal knowledge of such a scheme .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 55]: In a word , I saw in this Miss Havisham as I had her then and there before my eyes , and always had had her before my eyes ; and I saw in this , the distinct shadow of the darkened and unhealthy house in which her life was hidden from the sun .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 16]: The candles that lighted that room of hers were placed in sconces on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 24]: They were high from the ground , and they burnt with the steady dulness of artificial light in air that is seldom renewed .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 78]: As I looked round at them , and at the pale gloom they made , and at the stopped clock , and at the withered articles of bridal dress upon the table and the ground , and at her own awful figure with its ghostly reflection thrown large by the fire upon the ceiling and the wall , I saw in everything the construction that my mind had come to , repeated and thrown back to me .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 76]: My thoughts passed into the great room across the landing where the table was spread , and I saw it written , as it were , in the falls of the cobwebs from the centre-piece , in the crawlings of the spiders on the cloth , in the tracks of the mice as they betook their little quickened hearts behind the panels , and in the gropings and pausings of the beetles on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 19]: It happened on the occasion of this visit that some sharp words arose between Estella and Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 12]: It was the first time I had ever seen them opposed .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 42]: We were seated by the fire , as just now described , and Miss Havisham still had Estella 's arm drawn through her own , and still clutched Estella 's hand in hers , when Estella gradually began to detach herself .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 24]: She had shown a proud impatience more than once before , and had rather endured that fierce affection than accepted or returned it .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 18]: said Miss Havisham , flashing her eyes upon her , `` are you tired of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 32]: `` Only a little tired of myself , '' replied Estella , disengaging her arm , and moving to the great chimney-piece , where she stood looking down at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 9]: `` Speak the truth , you ingrate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 20]: cried Miss Havisham , passionately striking her stick upon the floor ; `` you are tired of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 16]: Estella looked at her with perfect composure , and again looked down at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 24]: Her graceful figure and her beautiful face expressed a self-possessed indifference to the wild heat of the other , that was almost cruel .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 7]: `` You stock and stone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 8]: `` You cold , cold heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 30]: said Estella , preserving her attitude of indifference as she leaned against the great chimney-piece and only moving her eyes ; `` do you reproach me for being cold ?
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 3]: You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 6]: `` Are you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 5]: was the fierce retort .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 9]: `` You should know , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 9]: `` I am what you have made me .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 27]: Take all the praise , take all the blame ; take all the success , take all the failure ; in short , take me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 12]: `` O , look at her , look at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 23]: cried Miss Havisham , bitterly ; `` Look at her so hard and thankless , on the hearth where she was reared !
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 29]: Where I took her into this wretched breast when it was first bleeding from its stabs , and where I have lavished years of tenderness upon her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 38]: `` At least I was no party to the compact , '' said Estella , `` for if I could walk and speak , when it was made , it was as much as I could do .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 6]: But what would you have ?
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 15]: You have been very good to me , and I owe everything to you .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 6]: What would you have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 8]: `` Love , '' replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 6]: `` You have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 10]: `` I have not , '' said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 52]: `` Mother by adoption , '' retorted Estella , never departing from the easy grace of her attitude , never raising her voice as the other did , never yielding either to anger or tenderness , -- `` mother by adoption , I have said that I owe everything to you .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 7]: All I possess is freely yours .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 15]: All that you have given me , is at your command to have again .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 7]: Beyond that , I have nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 25]: And if you ask me to give you , what you never gave me , my gratitude and duty can not do impossibilities . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 9]: `` Did I never give her love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 9]: cried Miss Havisham , turning wildly to me .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 29]: `` Did I never give her a burning love , inseparable from jealousy at all times , and from sharp pain , while she speaks thus to me !
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 13]: Let her call me mad , let her call me mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 19]: `` Why should I call you mad , '' returned Estella , `` I , of all people ?
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 20]: Does any one live , who knows what set purposes you have , half as well as I do ?
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 21]: Does any one live , who knows what a steady memory you have , half as well as I do ?
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 40]: I who have sat on this same hearth on the little stool that is even now beside you there , learning your lessons and looking up into your face , when your face was strange and frightened me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 5]: `` Soon forgotten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 4]: moaned Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 6]: `` Times soon forgotten ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 22]: `` No , not forgotten , '' retorted Estella , -- `` not forgotten , but treasured up in my memory .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 10]: When have you found me false to your teaching ?
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 10]: When have you found me unmindful of your lessons ?
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 25]: When have you found me giving admission here , '' she touched her bosom with her hand , `` to anything that you excluded ?
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 6]: Be just to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 8]: `` So proud , so proud ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 14]: moaned Miss Havisham , pushing away her gray hair with both her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 9]: `` Who taught me to be proud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 3]: returned Estella .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 11]: `` Who praised me when I learnt my lesson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 8]: `` So hard , so hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 9]: moaned Miss Havisham , with her former action .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 9]: `` Who taught me to be hard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 3]: returned Estella .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 11]: `` Who praised me when I learnt my lesson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 11]: `` But to be proud and hard to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 12]: Miss Havisham quite shrieked , as she stretched out her arms .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 16]: `` Estella , Estella , Estella , to be proud and hard to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 34]: Estella looked at her for a moment with a kind of calm wonder , but was not otherwise disturbed ; when the moment was past , she looked down at the fire again .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 33]: `` I can not think , '' said Estella , raising her eyes after a silence `` why you should be so unreasonable when I come to see you after a separation .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 10]: I have never forgotten your wrongs and their causes .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 11]: I have never been unfaithful to you or your schooling .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 14]: I have never shown any weakness that I can charge myself with . ''
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 11]: `` Would it be weakness to return my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 4]: exclaimed Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 13]: `` But yes , yes , she would call it so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 32]: `` I begin to think , '' said Estella , in a musing way , after another moment of calm wonder , `` that I almost understand how this comes about .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 77]: If you had brought up your adopted daughter wholly in the dark confinement of these rooms , and had never let her know that there was such a thing as the daylight by which she had never once seen your face , -- if you had done that , and then , for a purpose had wanted her to understand the daylight and know all about it , you would have been disappointed and angry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 28]: Miss Havisham , with her head in her hands , sat making a low moaning , and swaying herself on her chair , but gave no answer .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 115]: `` Or , '' said Estella , -- `` which is a nearer case , -- if you had taught her , from the dawn of her intelligence , with your utmost energy and might , that there was such a thing as daylight , but that it was made to be her enemy and destroyer , and she must always turn against it , for it had blighted you and would else blight her ; -- if you had done this , and then , for a purpose , had wanted her to take naturally to the daylight and she could not do it , you would have been disappointed and angry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 25]: Miss Havisham sat listening -LRB- or it seemed so , for I could not see her face -RRB- , but still made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 18]: `` So , '' said Estella , `` I must be taken as I have been made .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 20]: The success is not mine , the failure is not mine , but the two together make me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 26]: Miss Havisham had settled down , I hardly knew how , upon the floor , among the faded bridal relics with which it was strewn .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 35]: I took advantage of the moment -- I had sought one from the first -- to leave the room , after beseeching Estella 's attention to her , with a movement of my hand .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 20]: When I left , Estella was yet standing by the great chimney-piece , just as she had stood throughout .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 26]: Miss Havisham 's gray hair was all adrift upon the ground , among the other bridal wrecks , and was a miserable sight to see .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 33]: It was with a depressed heart that I walked in the starlight for an hour and more , about the courtyard , and about the brewery , and about the ruined garden .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 65]: When I at last took courage to return to the room , I found Estella sitting at Miss Havisham 's knee , taking up some stitches in one of those old articles of dress that were dropping to pieces , and of which I have often been reminded since by the faded tatters of old banners that I have seen hanging up in cathedrals .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 39]: Afterwards , Estella and I played at cards , as of yore , -- only we were skilful now , and played French games , -- and so the evening wore away , and I went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 10]: I lay in that separate building across the courtyard .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 24]: It was the first time I had ever lain down to rest in Satis House , and sleep refused to come near me .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 7]: A thousand Miss Havishams haunted me .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 48]: She was on this side of my pillow , on that , at the head of the bed , at the foot , behind the half-opened door of the dressing-room , in the dressing-room , in the room overhead , in the room beneath , -- everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 41]: At last , when the night was slow to creep on towards two o'clock , I felt that I absolutely could no longer bear the place as a place to lie down in , and that I must get up .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 38]: I therefore got up and put on my clothes , and went out across the yard into the long stone passage , designing to gain the outer courtyard and walk there for the relief of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 32]: But I was no sooner in the passage than I extinguished my candle ; for I saw Miss Havisham going along it in a ghostly manner , making a low cry .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 15]: I followed her at a distance , and saw her go up the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 34]: She carried a bare candle in her hand , which she had probably taken from one of the sconces in her own room , and was a most unearthly object by its light .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 52]: Standing at the bottom of the staircase , I felt the mildewed air of the feast-chamber , without seeing her open the door , and I heard her walking there , and so across into her own room , and so across again into that , never ceasing the low cry .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 40]: After a time , I tried in the dark both to get out , and to go back , but I could do neither until some streaks of day strayed in and showed me where to lay my hands .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 33]: During the whole interval , whenever I went to the bottom of the staircase , I heard her footstep , saw her light pass above , and heard her ceaseless low cry .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 42]: Before we left next day , there was no revival of the difference between her and Estella , nor was it ever revived on any similar occasion ; and there were four similar occasions , to the best of my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 29]: Nor , did Miss Havisham 's manner towards Estella in anywise change , except that I believed it to have something like fear infused among its former characteristics .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 27]: It is impossible to turn this leaf of my life , without putting Bentley Drummle 's name upon it ; or I would , very gladly .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 73]: On a certain occasion when the Finches were assembled in force , and when good feeling was being promoted in the usual manner by nobody 's agreeing with anybody else , the presiding Finch called the Grove to order , forasmuch as Mr. Drummle had not yet toasted a lady ; which , according to the solemn constitution of the society , it was the brute 's turn to do that day .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 34]: I thought I saw him leer in an ugly way at me while the decanters were going round , but as there was no love lost between us , that might easily be .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 19]: What was my indignant surprise when he called upon the company to pledge him to `` Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 5]: `` Estella who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 11]: said I. `` Never you mind , '' retorted Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 6]: `` Estella of where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 12]: said I. `` You are bound to say of where . ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 8]: Which he was , as a Finch .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 24]: `` Of Richmond , gentlemen , '' said Drummle , putting me out of the question , `` and a peerless beauty . ''
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 13]: Much he knew about peerless beauties , a mean , miserable idiot !
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 4]: I whispered Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 21]: `` I know that lady , '' said Herbert , across the table , when the toast had been honored .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 3]: said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 15]: `` And so do I , '' I added , with a scarlet face .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 3]: said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 6]: `` O , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 103]: This was the only retort -- except glass or crockery -- that the heavy creature was capable of making ; but , I became as highly incensed by it as if it had been barbed with wit , and I immediately rose in my place and said that I could not but regard it as being like the honorable Finch 's impudence to come down to that Grove , -- we always talked about coming down to that Grove , as a neat Parliamentary turn of expression , -- down to that Grove , proposing a lady of whom he knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 16]: Mr. Drummle , upon this , starting up , demanded what I meant by that ?
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 19]: Whereupon I made him the extreme reply that I believed he knew where I was to be found .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 27]: Whether it was possible in a Christian country to get on without blood , after this , was a question on which the Finches were divided .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 37]: The debate upon it grew so lively , indeed , that at least six more honorable members told six more , during the discussion , that they believed they knew where they were to be found .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 66]: However , it was decided at last -LRB- the Grove being a Court of Honor -RRB- that if Mr. Drummle would bring never so slight a certificate from the lady , importing that he had the honor of her acquaintance , Mr. Pip must express his regret , as a gentleman and a Finch , for `` having been betrayed into a warmth which . ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 46]: Next day was appointed for the production -LRB- lest our honor should take cold from delay -RRB- , and next day Drummle appeared with a polite little avowal in Estella 's hand , that she had had the honor of dancing with him several times .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 40]: This left me no course but to regret that I had been `` betrayed into a warmth which , '' and on the whole to repudiate , as untenable , the idea that I was to be found anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 39]: Drummle and I then sat snorting at one another for an hour , while the Grove engaged in indiscriminate contradiction , and finally the promotion of good feeling was declared to have gone ahead at an amazing rate .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 14]: I tell this lightly , but it was no light thing to me .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 36]: For , I can not adequately express what pain it gave me to think that Estella should show any favor to a contemptible , clumsy , sulky booby , so very far below the average .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 40]: To the present moment , I believe it to have been referable to some pure fire of generosity and disinterestedness in my love for her , that I could not endure the thought of her stooping to that hound .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 28]: No doubt I should have been miserable whomsoever she had favored ; but a worthier object would have caused me a different kind and degree of distress .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 34]: It was easy for me to find out , and I did soon find out , that Drummle had begun to follow her closely , and that she allowed him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 23]: A little while , and he was always in pursuit of her , and he and I crossed one another every day .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 47]: He held on , in a dull persistent way , and Estella held him on ; now with encouragement , now with discouragement , now almost flattering him , now openly despising him , now knowing him very well , now scarcely remembering who he was .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 27]: The Spider , as Mr. Jaggers had called him , was used to lying in wait , however , and had the patience of his tribe .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 36]: Added to that , he had a blockhead confidence in his money and in his family greatness , which sometimes did him good service , -- almost taking the place of concentration and determined purpose .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 28]: So , the Spider , doggedly watching Estella , outwatched many brighter insects , and would often uncoil himself and drop at the right nick of time .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 55]: At a certain Assembly Ball at Richmond -LRB- there used to be Assembly Balls at most places then -RRB- , where Estella had outshone all other beauties , this blundering Drummle so hung about her , and with so much toleration on her part , that I resolved to speak to her concerning him .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 32]: I took the next opportunity ; which was when she was waiting for Mrs. Blandley to take her home , and was sitting apart among some flowers , ready to go .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 17]: I was with her , for I almost always accompanied them to and from such places .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 8]: `` Are you tired , Estella ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 6]: `` Rather , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 6]: `` You should be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 27]: `` Say rather , I should not be ; for I have my letter to Satis House to write , before I go to sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 7]: `` Recounting to-night 's triumph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 12]: said I. `` Surely a very poor one , Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 10]: I did n't know there had been any . ''
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 27]: `` Estella , '' said I , `` do look at that fellow in the corner yonder , who is looking over here at us . ''
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 9]: `` Why should I look at him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 10]: returned Estella , with her eyes on me instead .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 26]: `` What is there in that fellow in the corner yonder , -- to use your words , -- that I need look at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 29]: `` Indeed , that is the very question I want to ask you , '' said I. `` For he has been hovering about you all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 27]: `` Moths , and all sorts of ugly creatures , '' replied Estella , with a glance towards him , `` hover about a lighted candle .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 7]: Can the candle help it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 17]: `` No , '' I returned ; `` but can not the Estella help it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 12]: said she , laughing , after a moment , `` perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 5]: Anything you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 10]: `` But , Estella , do hear me speak .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 16]: It makes me wretched that you should encourage a man so generally despised as Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 7]: You know he is despised . ''
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 11]: `` You know he is as ungainly within as without .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 11]: A deficient , ill-tempered , lowering , stupid fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 26]: `` You know he has nothing to recommend him but money and a ridiculous roll of addle-headed predecessors ; now , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 19]: said she again ; and each time she said it , she opened her lovely eyes the wider .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 27]: To overcome the difficulty of getting past that monosyllable , I took it from her , and said , repeating it with emphasis , `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 11]: Then , that is why it makes me wretched . ''
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 57]: Now , if I could have believed that she favored Drummle with any idea of making me-me -- wretched , I should have been in better heart about it ; but in that habitual way of hers , she put me so entirely out of the question , that I could believe nothing of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 25]: `` Pip , '' said Estella , casting her glance over the room , `` do n't be foolish about its effect on you .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 15]: It may have its effect on others , and may be meant to have .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 7]: It 's not worth discussing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 41]: `` Yes it is , '' said I , `` because I can not bear that people should say , ` she throws away her graces and attractions on a mere boor , the lowest in the crowd . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 10]: `` I can bear it , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 13]: do n't be so proud , Estella , and so inflexible . ''
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 11]: `` Calls me proud and inflexible in this breath ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 7]: said Estella , opening her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 15]: `` And in his last breath reproached me for stooping to a boor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 40]: `` There is no doubt you do , '' said I , something hurriedly , `` for I have seen you give him looks and smiles this very night , such as you never give to -- me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 33]: `` Do you want me then , '' said Estella , turning suddenly with a fixed and serious , if not angry , look , `` to deceive and entrap you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 11]: `` Do you deceive and entrap him , Estella ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 14]: `` Yes , and many others , -- all of them but you .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 5]: Here is Mrs. Brandley .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 7]: I 'll say no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 83]: And now that I have given the one chapter to the theme that so filled my heart , and so often made it ache and ache again , I pass on unhindered , to the event that had impended over me longer yet ; the event that had begun to be prepared for , before I knew that the world held Estella , and in the days when her baby intelligence was receiving its first distortions from Miss Havisham 's wasting hands .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 81]: In the Eastern story , the heavy slab that was to fall on the bed of state in the flush of conquest was slowly wrought out of the quarry , the tunnel for the rope to hold it in its place was slowly carried through the leagues of rock , the slab was slowly raised and fitted in the roof , the rope was rove to it and slowly taken through the miles of hollow to the great iron ring .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 64]: All being made ready with much labor , and the hour come , the sultan was aroused in the dead of the night , and the sharpened axe that was to sever the rope from the great iron ring was put into his hand , and he struck with it , and the rope parted and rushed away , and the ceiling fell .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 43]: So , in my case ; all the work , near and afar , that tended to the end , had been accomplished ; and in an instant the blow was struck , and the roof of my stronghold dropped upon me .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 9]: Chapter XXXIX I was three-and-twenty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 25]: Not another word had I heard to enlighten me on the subject of my expectations , and my twenty-third birthday was a week gone .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 17]: We had left Barnard 's Inn more than a year , and lived in the Temple .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 11]: Our chambers were in Garden-court , down by the river .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 24]: Mr. Pocket and I had for some time parted company as to our original relations , though we continued on the best terms .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 44]: Notwithstanding my inability to settle to anything , -- which I hope arose out of the restless and incomplete tenure on which I held my means , -- I had a taste for reading , and read regularly so many hours a day .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 29]: That matter of Herbert 's was still progressing , and everything with me was as I have brought it down to the close of the last preceding chapter .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 10]: Business had taken Herbert on a journey to Marseilles .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 13]: I was alone , and had a dull sense of being alone .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 33]: Dispirited and anxious , long hoping that to-morrow or next week would clear my way , and long disappointed , I sadly missed the cheerful face and ready response of my friend .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 26]: It was wretched weather ; stormy and wet , stormy and wet ; and mud , mud , mud , deep in all the streets .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 36]: Day after day , a vast heavy veil had been driving over London from the East , and it drove still , as if in the East there were an Eternity of cloud and wind .
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 54]: So furious had been the gusts , that high buildings in town had had the lead stripped off their roofs ; and in the country , trees had been torn up , and sails of windmills carried away ; and gloomy accounts had come in from the coast , of shipwreck and death .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 29]: Violent blasts of rain had accompanied these rages of wind , and the day just closed as I sat down to read had been the worst of all .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 37]: Alterations have been made in that part of the Temple since that time , and it has not now so lonely a character as it had then , nor is it so exposed to the river .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 34]: We lived at the top of the last house , and the wind rushing up the river shook the house that night , like discharges of cannon , or breakings of a sea .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 35]: When the rain came with it and dashed against the windows , I thought , raising my eyes to them as they rocked , that I might have fancied myself in a storm-beaten lighthouse .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 127]: Occasionally , the smoke came rolling down the chimney as though it could not bear to go out into such a night ; and when I set the doors open and looked down the staircase , the staircase lamps were blown out ; and when I shaded my face with my hands and looked through the black windows -LRB- opening them ever so little was out of the question in the teeth of such wind and rain -RRB- , I saw that the lamps in the court were blown out , and that the lamps on the bridges and the shore were shuddering , and that the coal-fires in barges on the river were being carried away before the wind like red-hot splashes in the rain .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 18]: I read with my watch upon the table , purposing to close my book at eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 31]: As I shut it , Saint Paul 's , and all the many church-clocks in the City -- some leading , some accompanying , some following -- struck that hour .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 33]: The sound was curiously flawed by the wind ; and I was listening , and thinking how the wind assailed and tore it , when I heard a footstep on the stair .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 22]: What nervous folly made me start , and awfully connect it with the footstep of my dead sister , matters not .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 21]: It was past in a moment , and I listened again , and heard the footstep stumble in coming on .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 22]: Remembering then , that the staircase-lights were blown out , I took up my reading-lamp and went out to the stair-head .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 15]: Whoever was below had stopped on seeing my lamp , for all was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 13]: `` There is some one down there , is there not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 7]: I called out , looking down .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said a voice from the darkness beneath .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 8]: `` What floor do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 4]: `` The top .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 4]: Mr. Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 6]: `` That is my name .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 8]: -- There is nothing the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 10]: `` Nothing the matter , '' returned the voice .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 6]: And the man came on .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 19]: I stood with my lamp held out over the stair-rail , and he came slowly within its light .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 38]: It was a shaded lamp , to shine upon a book , and its circle of light was very contracted ; so that he was in it for a mere instant , and then out of it .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 32]: In the instant , I had seen a face that was strange to me , looking up with an incomprehensible air of being touched and pleased by the sight of me .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 26]: Moving the lamp as the man moved , I made out that he was substantially dressed , but roughly , like a voyager by sea .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 7]: That he had long iron-gray hair .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 7]: That his age was about sixty .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 24]: That he was a muscular man , strong on his legs , and that he was browned and hardened by exposure to weather .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 40]: As he ascended the last stair or two , and the light of my lamp included us both , I saw , with a stupid kind of amazement , that he was holding out both his hands to me .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 8]: `` Pray what is your business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 5]: `` My business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 5]: he repeated , pausing .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 11]: I will explain my business , by your leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 9]: `` Do you wish to come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' he replied ; `` I wish to come in , master . ''
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 26]: I had asked him the question inhospitably enough , for I resented the sort of bright and gratified recognition that still shone in his face .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 18]: I resented it , because it seemed to imply that he expected me to respond to it .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 33]: But I took him into the room I had just left , and , having set the lamp on the table , asked him as civilly as I could to explain himself .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 42]: He looked about him with the strangest air , -- an air of wondering pleasure , as if he had some part in the things he admired , -- and he pulled off a rough outer coat , and his hat .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 24]: Then , I saw that his head was furrowed and bald , and that the long iron-gray hair grew only on its sides .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 12]: But , I saw nothing that in the least explained him .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 20]: On the contrary , I saw him next moment , once more holding out both his hands to me .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 10]: said I , half suspecting him to be mad .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 18]: He stopped in his looking at me , and slowly rubbed his right hand over his head .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 52]: `` It 's disapinting to a man , '' he said , in a coarse broken voice , `` arter having looked for ` ard so distant , and come so fur ; but you 're not to blame for that , -- neither on us is to blame for that .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 8]: I 'll speak in half a minute .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 9]: Give me half a minute , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 23]: He sat down on a chair that stood before the fire , and covered his forehead with his large brown veinous hands .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 21]: I looked at him attentively then , and recoiled a little from him ; but I did not know him .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 21]: `` There 's no one nigh , '' said he , looking over his shoulder ; `` is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 23]: `` Why do you , a stranger coming into my rooms at this time of the night , ask that question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 45]: said I. `` You 're a game one , '' he returned , shaking his head at me with a deliberate affection , at once most unintelligible and most exasperating ; `` I 'm glad you 've grow 'd up , a game one !
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 8]: But do n't catch hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 11]: You 'd be sorry arterwards to have done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 13]: I relinquished the intention he had detected , for I knew him !
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 15]: Even yet I could not recall a single feature , but I knew him !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 62]: If the wind and the rain had driven away the intervening years , had scattered all the intervening objects , had swept us to the churchyard where we first stood face to face on such different levels , I could not have known my convict more distinctly than I knew him now as he sat in the chair before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 57]: No need to take a file from his pocket and show it to me ; no need to take the handkerchief from his neck and twist it round his head ; no need to hug himself with both his arms , and take a shivering turn across the room , looking back at me for recognition .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 29]: I knew him before he gave me one of those aids , though , a moment before , I had not been conscious of remotely suspecting his identity .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 16]: He came back to where I stood , and again held out both his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 26]: Not knowing what to do , -- for , in my astonishment I had lost my self-possession , -- I reluctantly gave him my hands .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 19]: He grasped them heartily , raised them to his lips , kissed them , and still held them .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 12]: `` You acted noble , my boy , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 5]: `` Noble , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 8]: And I have never forgot it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 28]: At a change in his manner as if he were even going to embrace me , I laid a hand upon his breast and put him away .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 4]: `` Stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 6]: said I. `` Keep off !
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 31]: If you are grateful to me for what I did when I was a little child , I hope you have shown your gratitude by mending your way of life .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 14]: If you have come here to thank me , it was not necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 64]: Still , however you have found me out , there must be something good in the feeling that has brought you here , and I will not repulse you ; but surely you must understand that -- I -- '' My attention was so attracted by the singularity of his fixed look at me , that the words died away on my tongue .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 26]: `` You was a saying , '' he observed , when we had confronted one another in silence , `` that surely I must understand .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 8]: What , surely must I understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 22]: `` That I can not wish to renew that chance intercourse with you of long ago , under these different circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 12]: I am glad to believe you have repented and recovered yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 8]: I am glad to tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 19]: I am glad that , thinking I deserve to be thanked , you have come to thank me .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 11]: But our ways are different ways , none the less .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 9]: You are wet , and you look weary .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 9]: Will you drink something before you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 23]: He had replaced his neckerchief loosely , and had stood , keenly observant of me , biting a long end of it .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 36]: `` I think , '' he answered , still with the end at his mouth and still observant of me , `` that I will drink -LRB- I thank you -RRB- afore I go . ''
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 9]: There was a tray ready on a side-table .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 18]: I brought it to the table near the fire , and asked him what he would have ?
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 23]: He touched one of the bottles without looking at it or speaking , and I made him some hot rum and water .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 47]: I tried to keep my hand steady while I did so , but his look at me as he leaned back in his chair with the long draggled end of his neckerchief between his teeth -- evidently forgotten -- made my hand very difficult to master .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 22]: When at last I put the glass to him , I saw with amazement that his eyes were full of tears .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 18]: Up to this time I had remained standing , not to disguise that I wished him gone .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 19]: But I was softened by the softened aspect of the man , and felt a touch of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 39]: `` I hope , '' said I , hurriedly putting something into a glass for myself , and drawing a chair to the table , `` that you will not think I spoke harshly to you just now .
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 18]: I had no intention of doing it , and I am sorry for it if I did .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 8]: I wish you well and happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 35]: As I put my glass to my lips , he glanced with surprise at the end of his neckerchief , dropping from his mouth when he opened it , and stretched out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 20]: I gave him mine , and then he drank , and drew his sleeve across his eyes and forehead .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 7]: `` How are you living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 36]: `` I 've been a sheep-farmer , stock-breeder , other trades besides , away in the new world , '' said he ; `` many a thousand mile of stormy water off from this . ''
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 9]: `` I hope you have done well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 7]: `` I 've done wonderfully well .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 24]: There 's others went out alonger me as has done well too , but no man has done nigh as well as me .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 7]: I 'm famous for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 9]: `` I am glad to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 14]: `` I hope to hear you say so , my dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 31]: Without stopping to try to understand those words or the tone in which they were spoken , I turned off to a point that had just come into my mind .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 25]: `` Have you ever seen a messenger you once sent to me , '' I inquired , `` since he undertook that trust ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 7]: `` Never set eyes upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 8]: I war n't likely to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 14]: `` He came faithfully , and he brought me the two one-pound notes .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 22]: I was a poor boy then , as you know , and to a poor boy they were a little fortune .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 20]: But , like you , I have done well since , and you must let me pay them back .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 13]: You can put them to some other poor boy 's use . ''
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 6]: I took out my purse .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 29]: He watched me as I laid my purse upon the table and opened it , and he watched me as I separated two one-pound notes from its contents .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 18]: They were clean and new , and I spread them out and handed them over to him .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 37]: Still watching me , he laid them one upon the other , folded them long-wise , gave them a twist , set fire to them at the lamp , and dropped the ashes into the tray .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 54]: `` May I make so bold , '' he said then , with a smile that was like a frown , and with a frown that was like a smile , `` as ask you how you have done well , since you and me was out on them lone shivering marshes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 26]: He emptied his glass , got up , and stood at the side of the fire , with his heavy brown hand on the mantel-shelf .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 42]: He put a foot up to the bars , to dry and warm it , and the wet boot began to steam ; but , he neither looked at it , nor at the fire , but steadily looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 10]: It was only now that I began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 43]: When my lips had parted , and had shaped some words that were without sound , I forced myself to tell him -LRB- though I could not do it distinctly -RRB- , that I had been chosen to succeed to some property .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 10]: `` Might a mere warmint ask what property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 10]: I faltered , `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 10]: `` Might a mere warmint ask whose property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 11]: I faltered again , `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 25]: `` Could I make a guess , I wonder , '' said the Convict , `` at your income since you come of age !
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 7]: As to the first figure now .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 3]: Five ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 35]: With my heart beating like a heavy hammer of disordered action , I rose out of my chair , and stood with my hand upon the back of it , looking wildly at him .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 10]: `` Concerning a guardian , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 18]: `` There ought to have been some guardian , or such-like , whiles you was a minor .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 5]: Some lawyer , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 12]: As to the first letter of that lawyer 's name now .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 6]: Would it be J ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 47]: All the truth of my position came flashing on me ; and its disappointments , dangers , disgraces , consequences of all kinds , rushed in in such a multitude that I was borne down by them and had to struggle for every breath I drew .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 53]: `` Put it , '' he resumed , `` as the employer of that lawyer whose name begun with a J , and might be Jaggers , -- put it as he had come over sea to Portsmouth , and had landed there , and had wanted to come on to you .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 15]: ` However , you have found me out , ' you says just now .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 8]: However , did I find you out ?
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 18]: Why , I wrote from Portsmouth to a person in London , for particulars of your address .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 5]: That person 's name ?
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 5]: Why , Wemmick . ''
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 17]: I could not have spoken one word , though it had been to save my life .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 49]: I stood , with a hand on the chair-back and a hand on my breast , where I seemed to be suffocating , -- I stood so , looking wildly at him , until I grasped at the chair , when the room began to surge and turn .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 45]: He caught me , drew me to the sofa , put me up against the cushions , and bent on one knee before me , bringing the face that I now well remembered , and that I shuddered at , very near to mine .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 16]: `` Yes , Pip , dear boy , I 've made a gentleman on you !
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 8]: It 's me wot has done it !
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 20]: I swore that time , sure as ever I earned a guinea , that guinea should go to you .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 20]: I swore arterwards , sure as ever I spec ` lated and got rich , you should get rich .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 21]: I lived rough , that you should live smooth ; I worked hard , that you should be above work .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 6]: What odds , dear boy ?
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 12]: Do I tell it , fur you to feel a obligation ?
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 4]: Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 42]: I tell it , fur you to know as that there hunted dunghill dog wot you kep life in , got his head so high that he could make a gentleman , -- and , Pip , you 're him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 38]: The abhorrence in which I held the man , the dread I had of him , the repugnance with which I shrank from him , could not have been exceeded if he had been some terrible beast .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 8]: `` Look ` ee here , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 6]: I 'm your second father .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 13]: You 're my son , -- more to me nor any son .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 12]: I 've put away money , only for you to spend .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 37]: When I was a hired-out shepherd in a solitary hut , not seeing no faces but faces of sheep till I half forgot wot men 's and women 's faces wos like , I see yourn .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 42]: I drops my knife many a time in that hut when I was a-eating my dinner or my supper , and I says , ` Here 's the boy again , a looking at me whiles I eats and drinks ! '
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 20]: I see you there a many times , as plain as ever I see you on them misty marshes .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 7]: ` Lord strike me dead ! '
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 42]: I says each time , -- and I goes out in the air to say it under the open heavens , -- ` but wot , if I gets liberty and money , I 'll make that boy a gentleman ! '
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 5]: And I done it .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 9]: Why , look at you , dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 12]: Look at these here lodgings o'yourn , fit for a lord !
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 3]: A lord ?
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 14]: You shall show money with lords for wagers , and beat 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 28]: In his heat and triumph , and in his knowledge that I had been nearly fainting , he did not remark on my reception of all this .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 10]: It was the one grain of relief I had .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 7]: `` Look ` ee here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 54]: he went on , taking my watch out of my pocket , and turning towards him a ring on my finger , while I recoiled from his touch as if he had been a snake , `` a gold ` un and a beauty : that 's a gentleman 's , I hope !
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 17]: A diamond all set round with rubies ; that 's a gentleman 's , I hope !
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 9]: Look at your linen ; fine and beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 12]: Look at your clothes ; better ai n't to be got !
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 24]: And your books too , '' turning his eyes round the room , `` mounting up , on their shelves , by hundreds !
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 9]: And you read 'em ; do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 14]: I see you 'd been a reading of 'em when I come in .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 10]: You shall read 'em to me , dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 25]: And if they 're in foreign languages wot I do n't understand , I shall be just as proud as if I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 21]: Again he took both my hands and put them to his lips , while my blood ran cold within me .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 67]: `` Do n't you mind talking , Pip , '' said he , after again drawing his sleeve over his eyes and forehead , as the click came in his throat which I well remembered , -- and he was all the more horrible to me that he was so much in earnest ; `` you ca n't do better nor keep quiet , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 22]: You ai n't looked slowly forward to this as I have ; you wos n't prepared for this as I wos .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 12]: But did n't you never think it might be me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 18]: `` O no , no , no , '' I returned , `` Never , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 12]: `` Well , you see it wos me , and single-handed .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 14]: Never a soul in it but my own self and Mr. Jaggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 8]: `` Was there no one else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 20]: `` No , '' said he , with a glance of surprise : `` who else should there be ?
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 12]: And , dear boy , how good looking you have growed !
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 8]: There 's bright eyes somewheres -- eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 15]: Is n't there bright eyes somewheres , wot you love the thoughts on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 5]: O Estella , Estella !
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 15]: `` They shall be yourn , dear boy , if money can buy 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 30]: Not that a gentleman like you , so well set up as you , ca n't win 'em off of his own game ; but money shall back you !
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 13]: Let me finish wot I was a telling you , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 39]: From that there hut and that there hiring-out , I got money left me by my master -LRB- which died , and had been the same as me -RRB- , and got my liberty and went for myself .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 13]: In every single thing I went for , I went for you .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 28]: ` Lord strike a blight upon it , ' I says , wotever it was I went for , ` if it ai n't for him ! '
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 5]: It all prospered wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 16]: As I giv ' you to understand just now , I 'm famous for it .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 40]: It was the money left me , and the gains of the first few year wot I sent home to Mr. Jaggers -- all for you -- when he first come arter you , agreeable to my letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 7]: O that he had never come !
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 20]: That he had left me at the forge , -- far from contented , yet , by comparison happy !
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 30]: `` And then , dear boy , it was a recompense to me , look ` ee here , to know in secret that I was making a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 23]: The blood horses of them colonists might fling up the dust over me as I was walking ; what do I say ?
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 19]: I says to myself , ` I 'm making a better gentleman nor ever you 'll be ! '
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 39]: When one of 'em says to another , ` He was a convict , a few year ago , and is a ignorant common fellow now , for all he 's lucky , ' what do I say ?
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 28]: I says to myself , ` If I ai n't a gentleman , nor yet ai n't got no learning , I 'm the owner of such .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 18]: All on you owns stock and land ; which on you owns a brought-up London gentleman ? '
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 8]: This way I kep myself a going .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 35]: And this way I held steady afore my mind that I would for certain come one day and see my boy , and make myself known to him , on his own ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 8]: He laid his hand on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 19]: I shuddered at the thought that for anything I knew , his hand might be stained with blood .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 22]: `` It war n't easy , Pip , for me to leave them parts , nor yet it war n't safe .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 29]: But I held to it , and the harder it was , the stronger I held , for I was determined , and my mind firm made up .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 6]: At last I done it .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 8]: Dear boy , I done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 12]: I tried to collect my thoughts , but I was stunned .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 42]: Throughout , I had seemed to myself to attend more to the wind and the rain than to him ; even now , I could not separate his voice from those voices , though those were loud and his was silent .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 8]: `` Where will you put me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 5]: he asked , presently .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 11]: `` I must be put somewheres , dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 5]: `` To sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 5]: said I. `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 25]: And to sleep long and sound , '' he answered ; `` for I 've been sea-tossed and sea-washed , months and months . ''
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 26]: `` My friend and companion , '' said I , rising from the sofa , `` is absent ; you must have his room . ''
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 12]: `` He wo n't come back to-morrow ; will he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 23]: `` No , '' said I , answering almost mechanically , in spite of my utmost efforts ; `` not to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 38]: `` Because , look ` ee here , dear boy , '' he said , dropping his voice , and laying a long finger on my breast in an impressive manner , `` caution is necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 6]: `` How do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 3]: Caution ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 10]: `` By G -- , it 's Death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 6]: `` What 's death ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 7]: `` I was sent for life .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 7]: It 's death to come back .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 22]: There 's been overmuch coming back of late years , and I should of a certainty be hanged if took . ''
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 41]: Nothing was needed but this ; the wretched man , after loading wretched me with his gold and silver chains for years , had risked his life to come to me , and I held it there in my keeping !
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 41]: If I had loved him instead of abhorring him ; if I had been attracted to him by the strongest admiration and affection , instead of shrinking from him with the strongest repugnance ; it could have been no worse .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 23]: On the contrary , it would have been better , for his preservation would then have naturally and tenderly addressed my heart .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 29]: My first care was to close the shutters , so that no light might be seen from without , and then to close and make fast the doors .
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 36]: While I did so , he stood at the table drinking rum and eating biscuit ; and when I saw him thus engaged , I saw my convict on the marshes at his meal again .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 19]: It almost seemed to me as if he must stoop down presently , to file at his leg .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 43]: When I had gone into Herbert 's room , and had shut off any other communication between it and the staircase than through the room in which our conversation had been held , I asked him if he would go to bed ?
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 23]: He said yes , but asked me for some of my `` gentleman 's linen '' to put on in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 32]: I brought it out , and laid it ready for him , and my blood again ran cold when he again took me by both hands to give me good night .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 38]: I got away from him , without knowing how I did it , and mended the fire in the room where we had been together , and sat down by it , afraid to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 48]: For an hour or more , I remained too stunned to think ; and it was not until I began to think , that I began fully to know how wrecked I was , and how the ship in which I had sailed was gone to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 60]: Miss Havisham 's intentions towards me , all a mere dream ; Estella not designed for me ; I only suffered in Satis House as a convenience , a sting for the greedy relations , a model with a mechanical heart to practise on when no other practice was at hand ; those were the first smarts I had .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 52]: But , sharpest and deepest pain of all , -- it was for the convict , guilty of I knew not what crimes , and liable to be taken out of those rooms where I sat thinking , and hanged at the Old Bailey door , that I had deserted Joe .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 45]: I would not have gone back to Joe now , I would not have gone back to Biddy now , for any consideration ; simply , I suppose , because my sense of my own worthless conduct to them was greater than every consideration .
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 34]: No wisdom on earth could have given me the comfort that I should have derived from their simplicity and fidelity ; but I could never , never , undo what I had done .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 14]: In every rage of wind and rush of rain , I heard pursuers .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 17]: Twice , I could have sworn there was a knocking and whispering at the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 25]: With these fears upon me , I began either to imagine or recall that I had had mysterious warnings of this man 's approach .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 21]: That , for weeks gone by , I had passed faces in the streets which I had thought like his .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 20]: That these likenesses had grown more numerous , as he , coming over the sea , had drawn nearer .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 31]: That his wicked spirit had somehow sent these messengers to mine , and that now on this stormy night he was as good as his word , and with me .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 57]: Crowding up with these reflections came the reflection that I had seen him with my childish eyes to be a desperately violent man ; that I had heard that other convict reiterate that he had tried to murder him ; that I had seen him down in the ditch tearing and fighting like a wild beast .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 37]: Out of such remembrances I brought into the light of the fire a half-formed terror that it might not be safe to be shut up there with him in the dead of the wild solitary night .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 25]: This dilated until it filled the room , and impelled me to take a candle and go in and look at my dreadful burden .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 20]: He had rolled a handkerchief round his head , and his face was set and lowering in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 19]: But he was asleep , and quietly too , though he had a pistol lying on the pillow .
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 30]: Assured of this , I softly removed the key to the outside of his door , and turned it on him before I again sat down by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 12]: Gradually I slipped from the chair and lay on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 48]: When I awoke without having parted in my sleep with the perception of my wretchedness , the clocks of the Eastward churches were striking five , the candles were wasted out , the fire was dead , and the wind and rain intensified the thick black darkness .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 13]: THIS IS THE END OF THE SECOND STAGE OF PIP 'S EXPECTATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 51]: Chapter XL It was fortunate for me that I had to take precautions to ensure -LRB- so far as I could -RRB- the safety of my dreaded visitor ; for , this thought pressing on me when I awoke , held other thoughts in a confused concourse at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 12]: The impossibility of keeping him concealed in the chambers was self-evident .
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 17]: It could not be done , and the attempt to do it would inevitably engender suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 49]: True , I had no Avenger in my service now , but I was looked after by an inflammatory old female , assisted by an animated rag-bag whom she called her niece , and to keep a room secret from them would be to invite curiosity and exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 39]: They both had weak eyes , which I had long attributed to their chronically looking in at keyholes , and they were always at hand when not wanted ; indeed that was their only reliable quality besides larceny .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 27]: Not to get up a mystery with these people , I resolved to announce in the morning that my uncle had unexpectedly come from the country .
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 22]: This course I decided on while I was yet groping about in the darkness for the means of getting a light .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 29]: Not stumbling on the means after all , I was fain to go out to the adjacent Lodge and get the watchman there to come with his lantern .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 26]: Now , in groping my way down the black staircase I fell over something , and that something was a man crouching in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 45]: As the man made no answer when I asked him what he did there , but eluded my touch in silence , I ran to the Lodge and urged the watchman to come quickly ; telling him of the incident on the way back .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 45]: The wind being as fierce as ever , we did not care to endanger the light in the lantern by rekindling the extinguished lamps on the staircase , but we examined the staircase from the bottom to the top and found no one there .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 51]: It then occurred to me as possible that the man might have slipped into my rooms ; so , lighting my candle at the watchman 's , and leaving him standing at the door , I examined them carefully , including the room in which my dreaded guest lay asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 14]: All was quiet , and assuredly no other man was in those chambers .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 64]: It troubled me that there should have been a lurker on the stairs , on that night of all nights in the year , and I asked the watchman , on the chance of eliciting some hopeful explanation as I handed him a dram at the door , whether he had admitted at his gate any gentleman who had perceptibly been dining out ?
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 14]: Yes , he said ; at different times of the night , three .
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 24]: One lived in Fountain Court , and the other two lived in the Lane , and he had seen them all go home .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 53]: Again , the only other man who dwelt in the house of which my chambers formed a part had been in the country for some weeks , and he certainly had not returned in the night , because we had seen his door with his seal on it as we came up-stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 32]: `` The night being so bad , sir , '' said the watchman , as he gave me back my glass , `` uncommon few have come in at my gate .
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 29]: Besides them three gentlemen that I have named , I do n't call to mind another since about eleven o'clock , when a stranger asked for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 8]: `` My uncle , '' I muttered .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 8]: `` You saw him , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 4]: Oh yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 8]: `` Likewise the person with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 6]: `` Person with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 15]: `` I judged the person to be with him , '' returned the watchman .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 27]: `` The person stopped , when he stopped to make inquiry of me , and the person took this way when he took this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 7]: `` What sort of person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 35]: The watchman had not particularly noticed ; he should say a working person ; to the best of his belief , he had a dust-colored kind of clothes on , under a dark coat .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 25]: The watchman made more light of the matter than I did , and naturally ; not having my reason for attaching weight to it .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 31]: When I had got rid of him , which I thought it well to do without prolonging explanations , my mind was much troubled by these two circumstances taken together .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 91]: Whereas they were easy of innocent solution apart , -- as , for instance , some diner out or diner at home , who had not gone near this watchman 's gate , might have strayed to my staircase and dropped asleep there , -- and my nameless visitor might have brought some one with him to show him the way , -- still , joined , they had an ugly look to one as prone to distrust and fear as the changes of a few hours had made me .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 27]: I lighted my fire , which burnt with a raw pale flare at that time of the morning , and fell into a doze before it .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 15]: I seemed to have been dozing a whole night when the clocks struck six .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 64]: As there was full an hour and a half between me and daylight , I dozed again ; now , waking up uneasily , with prolix conversations about nothing , in my ears ; now , making thunder of the wind in the chimney ; at length , falling off into a profound sleep from which the daylight woke me with a start .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 21]: All this time I had never been able to consider my own situation , nor could I do so yet .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 10]: I had not the power to attend to it .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 16]: I was greatly dejected and distressed , but in an incoherent wholesale sort of way .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 18]: As to forming any plan for the future , I could as soon have formed an elephant .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 87]: When I opened the shutters and looked out at the wet wild morning , all of a leaden hue ; when I walked from room to room ; when I sat down again shivering , before the fire , waiting for my laundress to appear ; I thought how miserable I was , but hardly knew why , or how long I had been so , or on what day of the week I made the reflection , or even who I was that made it .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 38]: At last , the old woman and the niece came in , -- the latter with a head not easily distinguishable from her dusty broom , -- and testified surprise at sight of me and the fire .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 28]: To whom I imparted how my uncle had come in the night and was then asleep , and how the breakfast preparations were to be modified accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 46]: Then I washed and dressed while they knocked the furniture about and made a dust ; and so , in a sort of dream or sleep-waking , I found myself sitting by the fire again , waiting for -- Him -- to come to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 12]: By and by , his door opened and he came out .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 23]: I could not bring myself to bear the sight of him , and I thought he had a worse look by daylight .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 30]: `` I do not even know , '' said I , speaking low as he took his seat at the table , `` by what name to call you .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 11]: I have given out that you are my uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 8]: `` That 's it , dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 5]: Call me uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 14]: `` You assumed some name , I suppose , on board ship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 6]: `` Yes , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 8]: I took the name of Provis . ''
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 10]: `` Do you mean to keep that name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 23]: `` Why , yes , dear boy , it 's as good as another , -- unless you 'd like another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 8]: `` What is your real name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 7]: I asked him in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 18]: `` Magwitch , '' he answered , in the same tone ; `` chrisen 'd Abel . ''
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 10]: `` What were you brought up to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 8]: `` A warmint , dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 16]: He answered quite seriously , and used the word as if it denoted some profession .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 32]: `` When you came into the Temple last night -- '' said I , pausing to wonder whether that could really have been last night , which seemed so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 7]: `` Yes , dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 24]: `` When you came in at the gate and asked the watchman the way here , had you any one with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 4]: `` With me ?
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 6]: No , dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 9]: `` But there was some one there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 23]: `` I did n't take particular notice , '' he said , dubiously , `` not knowing the ways of the place .
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 16]: But I think there was a person , too , come in alonger me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 8]: `` Are you known in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 6]: `` I hope not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 19]: said he , giving his neck a jerk with his forefinger that made me turn hot and sick .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 10]: `` Were you known in London , once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 9]: `` Not over and above , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 8]: I was in the provinces mostly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 8]: `` Were you-tried -- in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 5]: `` Which time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 8]: said he , with a sharp look .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 6]: `` The last time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 3]: He nodded .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 8]: `` First knowed Mr. Jaggers that way .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 6]: Jaggers was for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 44]: It was on my lips to ask him what he was tried for , but he took up a knife , gave it a flourish , and with the words , `` And what I done is worked out and paid for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 6]: fell to at his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 23]: He ate in a ravenous way that was very disagreeable , and all his actions were uncouth , noisy , and greedy .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 50]: Some of his teeth had failed him since I saw him eat on the marshes , and as he turned his food in his mouth , and turned his head sideways to bring his strongest fangs to bear upon it , he looked terribly like a hungry old dog .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 41]: If I had begun with any appetite , he would have taken it away , and I should have sat much as I did , -- repelled from him by an insurmountable aversion , and gloomily looking at the cloth .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 35]: `` I 'm a heavy grubber , dear boy , '' he said , as a polite kind of apology when he made an end of his meal , `` but I always was .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 22]: If it had been in my constitution to be a lighter grubber , I might ha ' got into lighter trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 8]: Similarly , I must have my smoke .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 40]: When I was first hired out as shepherd t ` other side the world , it 's my belief I should ha ' turned into a molloncolly-mad sheep myself , if I had n't a had my smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 45]: As he said so , he got up from table , and putting his hand into the breast of the pea-coat he wore , brought out a short black pipe , and a handful of loose tobacco of the kind that is called Negro-head .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 21]: Having filled his pipe , he put the surplus tobacco back again , as if his pocket were a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 50]: Then , he took a live coal from the fire with the tongs , and lighted his pipe at it , and then turned round on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire , and went through his favorite action of holding out both his hands for mine .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 35]: `` And this , '' said he , dandling my hands up and down in his , as he puffed at his pipe , -- `` and this is the gentleman what I made !
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 5]: The real genuine One !
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 12]: It does me good fur to look at you , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 20]: All I stip ` late , is , to stand by and look at you , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 27]: I released my hands as soon as I could , and found that I was beginning slowly to settle down to the contemplation of my condition .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 40]: What I was chained to , and how heavily , became intelligible to me , as I heard his hoarse voice , and sat looking up at his furrowed bald head with its iron gray hair at the sides .
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 27]: `` I must n't see my gentleman a footing it in the mire of the streets ; there must n't be no mud on his boots .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 8]: My gentleman must have horses , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 21]: Horses to ride , and horses to drive , and horses for his servant to ride and drive as well .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 19]: Shall colonists have their horses -LRB- and blood ` uns , if you please , good Lord ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 6]: and not my London gentleman ?
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 18]: We 'll show 'em another pair of shoes than that , Pip ; wo n't us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 22]: He took out of his pocket a great thick pocket-book , bursting with papers , and tossed it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 14]: `` There 's something worth spending in that there book , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 4]: It 's yourn .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 12]: All I 've got ai n't mine ; it 's yourn .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 8]: Do n't you be afeerd on it .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 8]: There 's more where that come from .
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 19]: I 've come to the old country fur to see my gentleman spend his money like a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 6]: That 'll be my pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 12]: My pleasure ` ull be fur to see him do it .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 6]: And blast you all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 56]: he wound up , looking round the room and snapping his fingers once with a loud snap , `` blast you every one , from the judge in his wig , to the colonist a stirring up the dust , I 'll show a better gentleman than the whole kit on you put together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 4]: `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 20]: said I , almost in a frenzy of fear and dislike , `` I want to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 10]: I want to know what is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 28]: I want to know how you are to be kept out of danger , how long you are going to stay , what projects you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 36]: `` Look ` ee here , Pip , '' said he , laying his hand on my arm in a suddenly altered and subdued manner ; `` first of all , look ` ee here .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 8]: I forgot myself half a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 14]: What I said was low ; that 's what it was ; low .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 7]: Look ` ee here , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 4]: Look over it .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 10]: I ai n't a going to be low . ''
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 24]: `` First , '' I resumed , half groaning , `` what precautions can be taken against your being recognized and seized ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 24]: `` No , dear boy , '' he said , in the same tone as before , `` that do n't go first .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 4]: Lowness goes first .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 21]: I ai n't took so many year to make a gentleman , not without knowing what 's due to him .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 7]: Look ` ee here , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 12]: I was low ; that 's what I was ; low .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 8]: Look over it , dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 23]: Some sense of the grimly-ludicrous moved me to a fretful laugh , as I replied , `` I have looked over it .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 12]: In Heaven 's name , do n't harp upon it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 13]: `` Yes , but look ` ee here , '' he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 17]: `` Dear boy , I ai n't come so fur , not fur to be low .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 8]: Now , go on , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 21]: You was a saying -- '' `` How are you to be guarded from the danger you have incurred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 13]: `` Well , dear boy , the danger ai n't so great .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 15]: Without I was informed agen , the danger ai n't so much to signify .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 14]: There 's Jaggers , and there 's Wemmick , and there 's you .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 8]: Who else is there to inform ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 15]: `` Is there no chance person who might identify you in the street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 15]: said I. `` Well , '' he returned , `` there ai n't many .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 37]: Nor yet I do n't intend to advertise myself in the newspapers by the name of A.M. come back from Botany Bay ; and years have rolled away , and who 's to gain by it ?
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 9]: Still , look ` ee here , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 27]: If the danger had been fifty times as great , I should ha ' come to see you , mind you , just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 9]: `` And how long do you remain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 5]: `` How long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 21]: said he , taking his black pipe from his mouth , and dropping his jaw as he stared at me .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 8]: `` I 'm not a going back .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 7]: I 've come for good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 8]: `` Where are you to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 11]: said I. `` What is to be done with you ?
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 7]: Where will you be safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 38]: `` Dear boy , '' he returned , `` there 's disguising wigs can be bought for money , and there 's hair powder , and spectacles , and black clothes , -- shorts and what not .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 19]: Others has done it safe afore , and what others has done afore , others can do agen .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 21]: As to the where and how of living , dear boy , give me your own opinions on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 28]: `` You take it smoothly now , '' said I , `` but you were very serious last night , when you swore it was Death . ''
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 51]: `` And so I swear it is Death , '' said he , putting his pipe back in his mouth , `` and Death by the rope , in the open street not fur from this , and it 's serious that you should fully understand it to be so .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 9]: What then , when that 's once done ?
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 4]: Here I am .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 16]: To go back now ` ud be as bad as to stand ground -- worse .
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 20]: Besides , Pip , I 'm here , because I 've meant it by you , years and years .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 37]: As to what I dare , I 'm a old bird now , as has dared all manner of traps since first he was fledged , and I 'm not afeerd to perch upon a scarecrow .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 35]: If there 's Death hid inside of it , there is , and let him come out , and I 'll face him , and then I 'll believe in him and not afore .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 13]: And now let me have a look at my gentleman agen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 27]: Once more , he took me by both hands and surveyed me with an air of admiring proprietorship : smoking with great complacency all the while .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 38]: It appeared to me that I could do no better than secure him some quiet lodging hard by , of which he might take possession when Herbert returned : whom I expected in two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 42]: That the secret must be confided to Herbert as a matter of unavoidable necessity , even if I could have put the immense relief I should derive from sharing it with him out of the question , was plain to me .
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 45]: But it was by no means so plain to Mr. Provis -LRB- I resolved to call him by that name -RRB- , who reserved his consent to Herbert 's participation until he should have seen him and formed a favorable judgment of his physiognomy .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 34]: `` And even then , dear boy , '' said he , pulling a greasy little clasped black Testament out of his pocket , `` we 'll have him on his oath . ''
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 52]: To state that my terrible patron carried this little black book about the world solely to swear people on in cases of emergency , would be to state what I never quite established ; but this I can say , that I never knew him put it to any other use .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 49]: The book itself had the appearance of having been stolen from some court of justice , and perhaps his knowledge of its antecedents , combined with his own experience in that wise , gave him a reliance on its powers as a sort of legal spell or charm .
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 42]: On this first occasion of his producing it , I recalled how he had made me swear fidelity in the churchyard long ago , and how he had described himself last night as always swearing to his resolutions in his solitude .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 39]: As he was at present dressed in a seafaring slop suit , in which he looked as if he had some parrots and cigars to dispose of , I next discussed with him what dress he should wear .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 40]: He cherished an extraordinary belief in the virtues of `` shorts '' as a disguise , and had in his own mind sketched a dress for himself that would have made him something between a dean and a dentist .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 40]: It was with considerable difficulty that I won him over to the assumption of a dress more like a prosperous farmer 's ; and we arranged that he should cut his hair close , and wear a little powder .
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 33]: Lastly , as he had not yet been seen by the laundress or her niece , he was to keep himself out of their view until his change of dress was made .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 46]: It would seem a simple matter to decide on these precautions ; but in my dazed , not to say distracted , state , it took so long , that I did not get out to further them until two or three in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 24]: He was to remain shut up in the chambers while I was gone , and was on no account to open the door .
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 56]: There being to my knowledge a respectable lodging-house in Essex Street , the back of which looked into the Temple , and was almost within hail of my windows , I first of all repaired to that house , and was so fortunate as to secure the second floor for my uncle , Mr. Provis .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 21]: I then went from shop to shop , making such purchases as were necessary to the change in his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 18]: This business transacted , I turned my face , on my own account , to Little Britain .
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 22]: Mr. Jaggers was at his desk , but , seeing me enter , got up immediately and stood before his fire .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 14]: `` Now , Pip , '' said he , `` be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 10]: `` I will , sir , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 16]: For , coming along I had thought well of what I was going to say .
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 19]: `` Do n't commit yourself , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` and do n't commit any one .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 6]: You understand -- any one .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 20]: Do n't tell me anything : I do n't want to know anything ; I am not curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 12]: Of course I saw that he knew the man was come .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 25]: `` I merely want , Mr. Jaggers , '' said I , `` to assure myself that what I have been told is true .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 18]: I have no hope of its being untrue , but at least I may verify it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 4]: Mr. Jaggers nodded .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 14]: `` But did you say ` told ' or ` informed ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 27]: he asked me , with his head on one side , and not looking at me , but looking in a listening way at the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 9]: `` Told would seem to imply verbal communication .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 18]: You ca n't have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 11]: `` I will say , informed , Mr. Jaggers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 4]: `` Good . ''
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 24]: `` I have been informed by a person named Abel Magwitch , that he is the benefactor so long unknown to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 18]: `` That is the man , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` in New South Wales . ''
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 6]: `` And only he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 12]: said I. `` And only he , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 33]: `` I am not so unreasonable , sir , as to think you at all responsible for my mistakes and wrong conclusions ; but I always supposed it was Miss Havisham . ''
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 38]: `` As you say , Pip , '' returned Mr. Jaggers , turning his eyes upon me coolly , and taking a bite at his forefinger , `` I am not at all responsible for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 19]: `` And yet it looked so like it , sir , '' I pleaded with a downcast heart .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 23]: `` Not a particle of evidence , Pip , '' said Mr. Jaggers , shaking his head and gathering up his skirts .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 12]: `` Take nothing on its looks ; take everything on evidence .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 7]: There 's no better rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 24]: `` I have no more to say , '' said I , with a sigh , after standing silent for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 14]: `` I have verified my information , and there 's an end . ''
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 46]: `` And Magwitch -- in New South Wales -- having at last disclosed himself , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` you will comprehend , Pip , how rigidly throughout my communication with you , I have always adhered to the strict line of fact .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 14]: There has never been the least departure from the strict line of fact .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 8]: You are quite aware of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 6]: `` Quite , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 41]: `` I communicated to Magwitch -- in New South Wales -- when he first wrote to me -- from New South Wales -- the caution that he must not expect me ever to deviate from the strict line of fact .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 8]: I also communicated to him another caution .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 24]: He appeared to me to have obscurely hinted in his letter at some distant idea he had of seeing you in England here .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 62]: I cautioned him that I must hear no more of that ; that he was not at all likely to obtain a pardon ; that he was expatriated for the term of his natural life ; and that his presenting himself in this country would be an act of felony , rendering him liable to the extreme penalty of the law .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 25]: I gave Magwitch that caution , '' said Mr. Jaggers , looking hard at me ; `` I wrote it to New South Wales .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 10]: He guided himself by it , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 58]: `` No doubt , '' said I. `` I have been informed by Wemmick , '' pursued Mr. Jaggers , still looking hard at me , `` that he has received a letter , under date Portsmouth , from a colonist of the name of Purvis , or -- '' `` Or Provis , '' I suggested .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 9]: `` Or Provis -- thank you , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 5]: Perhaps it is Provis ?
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 8]: Perhaps you know it 's Provis ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' said I. `` You know it 's Provis .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 29]: A letter , under date Portsmouth , from a colonist of the name of Provis , asking for the particulars of your address , on behalf of Magwitch .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 14]: Wemmick sent him the particulars , I understand , by return of post .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 20]: Probably it is through Provis that you have received the explanation of Magwitch -- in New South Wales ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 10]: `` It came through Provis , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 22]: `` Good day , Pip , '' said Mr. Jaggers , offering his hand ; `` glad to have seen you .
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 53]: In writing by post to Magwitch -- in New South Wales -- or in communicating with him through Provis , have the goodness to mention that the particulars and vouchers of our long account shall be sent to you , together with the balance ; for there is still a balance remaining .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 6]: Good day , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 18]: We shook hands , and he looked hard at me as long as he could see me .
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 52]: I turned at the door , and he was still looking hard at me , while the two vile casts on the shelf seemed to be trying to get their eyelids open , and to force out of their swollen throats , `` O , what a man he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 20]: Wemmick was out , and though he had been at his desk he could have done nothing for me .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 25]: I went straight back to the Temple , where I found the terrible Provis drinking rum and water and smoking negro-head , in safety .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 17]: Next day the clothes I had ordered all came home , and he put them on .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 22]: Whatever he put on , became him less -LRB- it dismally seemed to me -RRB- than what he had worn before .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 19]: To my thinking , there was something in him that made it hopeless to attempt to disguise him .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 24]: The more I dressed him and the better I dressed him , the more he looked like the slouching fugitive on the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 65]: This effect on my anxious fancy was partly referable , no doubt , to his old face and manner growing more familiar to me ; but I believe too that he dragged one of his legs as if there were still a weight of iron on it , and that from head to foot there was Convict in the very grain of the man .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 52]: The influences of his solitary hut-life were upon him besides , and gave him a savage air that no dress could tame ; added to these were the influences of his subsequent branded life among men , and , crowning all , his consciousness that he was dodging and hiding now .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 141]: In all his ways of sitting and standing , and eating and drinking , -- of brooding about in a high-shouldered reluctant style , -- of taking out his great horn-handled jackknife and wiping it on his legs and cutting his food , -- of lifting light glasses and cups to his lips , as if they were clumsy pannikins , -- of chopping a wedge off his bread , and soaking up with it the last fragments of gravy round and round his plate , as if to make the most of an allowance , and then drying his finger-ends on it , and then swallowing it , -- in these ways and a thousand other small nameless instances arising every minute in the day , there was Prisoner , Felon , Bondsman , plain as plain could be .
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 24]: It had been his own idea to wear that touch of powder , and I had conceded the powder after overcoming the shorts .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 63]: But I can compare the effect of it , when on , to nothing but the probable effect of rouge upon the dead ; so awful was the manner in which everything in him that it was most desirable to repress , started through that thin layer of pretence , and seemed to come blazing out at the crown of his head .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 17]: It was abandoned as soon as tried , and he wore his grizzled hair cut short .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 25]: Words can not tell what a sense I had , at the same time , of the dreadful mystery that he was to me .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 73]: When he fell asleep of an evening , with his knotted hands clenching the sides of the easy-chair , and his bald head tattooed with deep wrinkles falling forward on his breast , I would sit and look at him , wondering what he had done , and loading him with all the crimes in the Calendar , until the impulse was powerful on me to start up and fly from him .
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 53]: Every hour so increased my abhorrence of him , that I even think I might have yielded to this impulse in the first agonies of being so haunted , notwithstanding all he had done for me and the risk he ran , but for the knowledge that Herbert must soon come back .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 44]: Once , I actually did start out of bed in the night , and begin to dress myself in my worst clothes , hurriedly intending to leave him there with everything else I possessed , and enlist for India as a private soldier .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 36]: I doubt if a ghost could have been more terrible to me , up in those lonely rooms in the long evenings and long nights , with the wind and the rain always rushing by .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 37]: A ghost could not have been taken and hanged on my account , and the consideration that he could be , and the dread that he would be , were no small addition to my horrors .
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 79]: When he was not asleep , or playing a complicated kind of Patience with a ragged pack of cards of his own , -- a game that I never saw before or since , and in which he recorded his winnings by sticking his jackknife into the table , -- when he was not engaged in either of these pursuits , he would ask me to read to him , -- `` Foreign language , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 59]: While I complied , he , not comprehending a single word , would stand before the fire surveying me with the air of an Exhibitor , and I would see him , between the fingers of the hand with which I shaded my face , appealing in dumb show to the furniture to take notice of my proficiency .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 51]: The imaginary student pursued by the misshapen creature he had impiously made , was not more wretched than I , pursued by the creature who had made me , and recoiling from him with a stronger repulsion , the more he admired me and the fonder he was of me .
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 17]: This is written of , I am sensible , as if it had lasted a year .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 6]: It lasted about five days .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 23]: Expecting Herbert all the time , I dared not go out , except when I took Provis for an airing after dark .
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 47]: At length , one evening when dinner was over and I had dropped into a slumber quite worn out , -- for my nights had been agitated and my rest broken by fearful dreams , -- I was roused by the welcome footstep on the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 29]: Provis , who had been asleep too , staggered up at the noise I made , and in an instant I saw his jackknife shining in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 3]: `` Quiet !
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 5]: It 's Herbert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 22]: I said ; and Herbert came bursting in , with the airy freshness of six hundred miles of France upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 23]: `` Handel , my dear fellow , how are you , and again how are you , and again how are you ?
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 9]: I seem to have been gone a twelvemonth !
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 17]: Why , so I must have been , for you have grown quite thin and pale !
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 6]: Handel , my -- Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 6]: I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 19]: He was stopped in his running on and in his shaking hands with me , by seeing Provis .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 25]: Provis , regarding him with a fixed attention , was slowly putting up his jackknife , and groping in another pocket for something else .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 30]: `` Herbert , my dear friend , '' said I , shutting the double doors , while Herbert stood staring and wondering , `` something very strange has happened .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 9]: This is -- a visitor of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 10]: `` It 's all right , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 19]: said Provis coming forward , with his little clasped black book , and then addressing himself to Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 8]: `` Take it in your right hand .
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 17]: Lord strike you dead on the spot , if ever you split in any way sumever !
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 4]: Kiss it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 15]: `` Do so , as he wishes it , '' I said to Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 37]: So , Herbert , looking at me with a friendly uneasiness and amazement , complied , and Provis immediately shaking hands with him , said , `` Now you 're on your oath , you know .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 18]: And never believe me on mine , if Pip sha n't make a gentleman on you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 37]: Chapter XLI In vain should I attempt to describe the astonishment and disquiet of Herbert , when he and I and Provis sat down before the fire , and I recounted the whole of the secret .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 33]: Enough , that I saw my own feelings reflected in Herbert 's face , and not least among them , my repugnance towards the man who had done so much for me .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 29]: What would alone have set a division between that man and us , if there had been no other dividing circumstance , was his triumph in my story .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 54]: Saving his troublesome sense of having been `` low ' on one occasion since his return , -- on which point he began to hold forth to Herbert , the moment my revelation was finished , -- he had no perception of the possibility of my finding any fault with my good fortune .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 37]: His boast that he had made me a gentleman , and that he had come to see me support the character on his ample resources , was made for me quite as much as for himself .
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 34]: And that it was a highly agreeable boast to both of us , and that we must both be very proud of it , was a conclusion quite established in his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 47]: `` Though , look ` ee here , Pip 's comrade , '' he said to Herbert , after having discoursed for some time , `` I know very well that once since I come back -- for half a minute -- I 've been low .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 13]: I said to Pip , I knowed as I had been low .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 10]: But do n't you fret yourself on that score .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 33]: I ai n't made Pip a gentleman , and Pip ai n't a going to make you a gentleman , not fur me not to know what 's due to ye both .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 21]: Dear boy , and Pip 's comrade , you two may count upon me always having a gen-teel muzzle on .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 31]: Muzzled I have been since that half a minute when I was betrayed into lowness , muzzled I am at the present time , muzzled I ever will be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 25]: Herbert said , `` Certainly , '' but looked as if there were no specific consolation in this , and remained perplexed and dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 32]: We were anxious for the time when he would go to his lodging and leave us together , but he was evidently jealous of leaving us together , and sat late .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 23]: It was midnight before I took him round to Essex Street , and saw him safely in at his own dark door .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 23]: When it closed upon him , I experienced the first moment of relief I had known since the night of his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 41]: Never quite free from an uneasy remembrance of the man on the stairs , I had always looked about me in taking my guest out after dark , and in bringing him back ; and I looked about me now .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 44]: Difficult as it is in a large city to avoid the suspicion of being watched , when the mind is conscious of danger in that regard , I could not persuade myself that any of the people within sight cared about my movements .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 24]: The few who were passing passed on their several ways , and the street was empty when I turned back into the Temple .
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 19]: Nobody had come out at the gate with us , nobody went in at the gate with me .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 59]: As I crossed by the fountain , I saw his lighted back windows looking bright and quiet , and , when I stood for a few moments in the doorway of the building where I lived , before going up the stairs , Garden Court was as still and lifeless as the staircase was when I ascended it .
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 23]: Herbert received me with open arms , and I had never felt before so blessedly what it is to have a friend .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 26]: When he had spoken some sound words of sympathy and encouragement , we sat down to consider the question , What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 104]: The chair that Provis had occupied still remaining where it had Stood , -- for he had a barrack way with him of hanging about one spot , in one unsettled manner , and going through one round of observances with his pipe and his negro-head and his jackknife and his pack of cards , and what not , as if it were all put down for him on a slate , -- I say his chair remaining where it had stood , Herbert unconsciously took it , but next moment started out of it , pushed it away , and took another .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 27]: He had no occasion to say after that that he had conceived an aversion for my patron , neither had I occasion to confess my own .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 9]: We interchanged that confidence without shaping a syllable .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 26]: `` What , '' said I to Herbert , when he was safe in another chair , -- `` what is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 23]: `` My poor dear Handel , '' he replied , holding his head , `` I am too stunned to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 13]: `` So was I , Herbert , when the blow first fell .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 7]: Still , something must be done .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 21]: He is intent upon various new expenses , -- horses , and carriages , and lavish appearances of all kinds .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 7]: He must be stopped somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 16]: `` You mean that you ca n't accept -- '' `` How can I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 7]: I interposed , as Herbert paused .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 5]: `` Think of him !
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 5]: Look at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 9]: An involuntary shudder passed over both of us .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 24]: `` Yet I am afraid the dreadful truth is , Herbert , that he is attached to me , strongly attached to me .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 8]: Was there ever such a fate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 10]: `` My poor dear Handel , '' Herbert repeated .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 29]: `` Then , '' said I , `` after all , stopping short here , never taking another penny from him , think what I owe him already !
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 39]: Then again : I am heavily in debt , -- very heavily for me , who have now no expectations , -- and I have been bred to no calling , and I am fit for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 8]: `` Well , well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 3]: Herbert remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 9]: `` Do n't say fit for nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 7]: `` What am I fit for ?
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 21]: I know only one thing that I am fit for , and that is , to go for a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 24]: And I might have gone , my dear Herbert , but for the prospect of taking counsel with your friendship and affection . ''
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 27]: Of course I broke down there : and of course Herbert , beyond seizing a warm grip of my hand , pretended not to know it .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 18]: `` Anyhow , my dear Handel , '' said he presently , `` soldiering wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 31]: If you were to renounce this patronage and these favors , I suppose you would do so with some faint hope of one day repaying what you have already had .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 12]: Not very strong , that hope , if you went soldiering !
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 6]: Besides , it 's absurd .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 15]: You would be infinitely better in Clarriker 's house , small as it is .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 12]: I am working up towards a partnership , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 3]: Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 7]: He little suspected with whose money .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 11]: `` But there is another question , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 17]: `` This is an ignorant , determined man , who has long had one fixed idea .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 26]: More than that , he seems to me -LRB- I may misjudge him -RRB- to be a man of a desperate and fierce character . ''
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 10]: `` I know he is , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 14]: `` Let me tell you what evidence I have seen of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 21]: And I told him what I had not mentioned in my narrative , of that encounter with the other convict .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 14]: `` See , then , '' said Herbert ; `` think of this !
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 18]: He comes here at the peril of his life , for the realization of his fixed idea .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 34]: In the moment of realization , after all his toil and waiting , you cut the ground from under his feet , destroy his idea , and make his gains worthless to him .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 14]: Do you see nothing that he might do , under the disappointment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 22]: `` I have seen it , Herbert , and dreamed of it , ever since the fatal night of his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 20]: Nothing has been in my thoughts so distinctly as his putting himself in the way of being taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 24]: `` Then you may rely upon it , '' said Herbert , `` that there would be great danger of his doing it .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 27]: That is his power over you as long as he remains in England , and that would be his reckless course if you forsook him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 56]: I was so struck by the horror of this idea , which had weighed upon me from the first , and the working out of which would make me regard myself , in some sort , as his murderer , that I could not rest in my chair , but began pacing to and fro .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 32]: I said to Herbert , meanwhile , that even if Provis were recognized and taken , in spite of himself , I should be wretched as the cause , however innocently .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 44]: Yes ; even though I was so wretched in having him at large and near me , and even though I would far rather have worked at the forge all the days of my life than I would ever have come to this !
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 15]: But there was no staving off the question , What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 24]: `` The first and the main thing to be done , '' said Herbert , `` is to get him out of England .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 18]: You will have to go with him , and then he may be induced to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 16]: `` But get him where I will , could I prevent his coming back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 40]: `` My good Handel , is it not obvious that with Newgate in the next street , there must be far greater hazard in your breaking your mind to him and making him reckless , here , than elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 28]: If a pretext to get him away could be made out of that other convict , or out of anything else in his life , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 6]: `` There , again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 24]: said I , stopping before Herbert , with my open hands held out , as if they contained the desperation of the case .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 8]: `` I know nothing of his life .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 49]: It has almost made me mad to sit here of a night and see him before me , so bound up with my fortunes and misfortunes , and yet so unknown to me , except as the miserable wretch who terrified me two days in my childhood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 24]: Herbert got up , and linked his arm in mine , and we slowly walked to and fro together , studying the carpet .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 27]: `` Handel , '' said Herbert , stopping , `` you feel convinced that you can take no further benefits from him ; do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 3]: `` Fully .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 14]: Surely you would , too , if you were in my place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 13]: `` And you feel convinced that you must break with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 9]: `` Herbert , can you ask me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 37]: `` And you have , and are bound to have , that tenderness for the life he has risked on your account , that you must save him , if possible , from throwing it away .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 17]: Then you must get him out of England before you stir a finger to extricate yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 24]: That done , extricate yourself , in Heaven 's name , and we 'll see it out together , dear old boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 22]: It was a comfort to shake hands upon it , and walk up and down again , with only that done .
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 20]: `` Now , Herbert , '' said I , `` with reference to gaining some knowledge of his history .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 10]: There is but one way that I know of .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 8]: I must ask him point blank . ''
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 18]: Ask him , '' said Herbert , `` when we sit at breakfast in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 20]: For he had said , on taking leave of Herbert , that he would come to breakfast with us .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 10]: With this project formed , we went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 39]: I had the wildest dreams concerning him , and woke unrefreshed ; I woke , too , to recover the fear which I had lost in the night , of his being found out as a returned transport .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 8]: Waking , I never lost that fear .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 20]: He came round at the appointed time , took out his jackknife , and sat down to his meal .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 37]: He was full of plans `` for his gentleman 's coming out strong , and like a gentleman , '' and urged me to begin speedily upon the pocket-book which he had left in my possession .
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 40]: He considered the chambers and his own lodging as temporary residences , and advised me to look out at once for a `` fashionable crib '' near Hyde Park , in which he could have `` a shake-down . ''
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 62]: When he had made an end of his breakfast , and was wiping his knife on his leg , I said to him , without a word of preface , -- `` After you were gone last night , I told my friend of the struggle that the soldiers found you engaged in on the marshes , when we came up .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 4]: You remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 4]: `` Remember ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 6]: `` I think so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 14]: `` We want to know something about that man -- and about you .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 23]: It is strange to know no more about either , and particularly you , than I was able to tell last night .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 15]: Is not this as good a time as another for our knowing more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 6]: he said , after consideration .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 15]: `` You 're on your oath , you know , Pip 's comrade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 7]: `` Assuredly , '' replied Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 14]: `` As to anything I say , you know , '' he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 8]: `` The oath applies to all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 9]: `` I understand it to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 7]: `` And look ` ee here !
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 15]: Wotever I done is worked out and paid for , '' he insisted again .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 6]: `` So be it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 40]: He took out his black pipe and was going to fill it with negro-head , when , looking at the tangle of tobacco in his hand , he seemed to think it might perplex the thread of his narrative .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 47]: He put it back again , stuck his pipe in a button-hole of his coat , spread a hand on each knee , and after turning an angry eye on the fire for a few silent moments , looked round at us and said what follows .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 10]: Chapter XLII `` Dear boy and Pip 's comrade .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 19]: I am not a going fur to tell you my life like a song , or a story-book .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 21]: But to give it you short and handy , I 'll put it at once into a mouthful of English .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 21]: In jail and out of jail , in jail and out of jail , in jail and out of jail .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 7]: There , you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 23]: That 's my life pretty much , down to such times as I got shipped off , arter Pip stood my friend .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 14]: `` I 've been done everything to , pretty well -- except hanged .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 12]: I 've been locked up as much as a silver tea-kittle .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 36]: I 've been carted here and carted there , and put out of this town , and put out of that town , and stuck in the stocks , and whipped and worried and drove .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 17]: I 've no more notion where I was born than you have -- if so much .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 17]: I first become aware of myself down in Essex , a thieving turnips for my living .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 28]: Summun had run away from me -- a man -- a tinker -- and he 'd took the fire with him , and left me wery cold .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 14]: `` I know 'd my name to be Magwitch , chrisen 'd Abel .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 6]: How did I know it ?
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 20]: Much as I know 'd the birds ' names in the hedges to be chaffinch , sparrer , thrush .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 25]: I might have thought it was all lies together , only as the birds ' names come out true , I supposed mine did .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 46]: `` So fur as I could find , there war n't a soul that see young Abel Magwitch , with us little on him as in him , but wot caught fright at him , and either drove him off , or took him up .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 25]: I was took up , took up , took up , to that extent that I reg ` larly grow 'd up took up .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 56]: `` This is the way it was , that when I was a ragged little creetur as much to be pitied as ever I see -LRB- not that I looked in the glass , for there war n't many insides of furnished houses known to me -RRB- , I got the name of being hardened .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 19]: `` This is a terrible hardened one , '' they says to prison wisitors , picking out me .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 12]: `` May be said to live in jails , this boy .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 56]: `` Then they looked at me , and I looked at them , and they measured my head , some on 'em , -- they had better a measured my stomach , -- and others on 'em giv me tracts what I could n't read , and made me speeches what I could n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 10]: They always went on agen me about the Devil .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 9]: But what the Devil was I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 12]: I must put something into my stomach , must n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 16]: -- Howsomever , I 'm a getting low , and I know what 's due .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 17]: Dear boy and Pip 's comrade , do n't you be afeerd of me being low .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 95]: `` Tramping , begging , thieving , working sometimes when I could , -- though that war n't as often as you may think , till you put the question whether you would ha ' been over-ready to give me work yourselves , -- a bit of a poacher , a bit of a laborer , a bit of a wagoner , a bit of a haymaker , a bit of a hawker , a bit of most things that do n't pay and lead to trouble , I got to be a man .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 45]: A deserting soldier in a Traveller 's Rest , what lay hid up to the chin under a lot of taturs , learnt me to read ; and a travelling Giant what signed his name at a penny a time learnt me to write .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 22]: I war n't locked up as often now as formerly , but I wore out my good share of key-metal still .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 46]: `` At Epsom races , a matter of over twenty years ago , I got acquainted wi ' a man whose skull I 'd crack wi ' this poker , like the claw of a lobster , if I 'd got it on this hob .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 40]: His right name was Compeyson ; and that 's the man , dear boy , what you see me a pounding in the ditch , according to what you truly told your comrade arter I was gone last night .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 23]: `` He set up fur a gentleman , this Compeyson , and he 'd been to a public boarding-school and had learning .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 18]: He was a smooth one to talk , and was a dab at the ways of gentlefolks .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 5]: He was good-looking too .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 26]: It was the night afore the great race , when I found him on the heath , in a booth that I know 'd on .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 57]: Him and some more was a sitting among the tables when I went in , and the landlord -LRB- which had a knowledge of me , and was a sporting one -RRB- called him out , and said , ` I think this is a man that might suit you , ' -- meaning I was .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 16]: `` Compeyson , he looks at me very noticing , and I look at him .

Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 19]: ` To judge from appearances , you 're out of luck , ' says Compeyson to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 15]: ` Yes , master , and I 've never been in it much . '
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 14]: -LRB- I had come out of Kingston Jail last on a vagrancy committal .

Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 17]: ` Luck changes , ' says Compeyson ; ` perhaps yours is going to change . '
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 12]: `` I says , ` I hope it may be so .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 6]: There 's room . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 7]: ` What can you do ? '
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 4]: says Compeyson . ''
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 18]: ` Eat and drink , ' I says ; ` if you 'll find the materials . '
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 23]: `` Compeyson laughed , looked at me again very noticing , giv me five shillings , and appointed me for next night .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 3]: Same place .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 23]: `` I went to Compeyson next night , same place , and Compeyson took me on to be his man and pardner .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 14]: And what was Compeyson 's business in which we was to go pardners ?
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 17]: Compeyson 's business was the swindling , handwriting forging , stolen bank-note passing , and such-like .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 36]: All sorts of traps as Compeyson could set with his head , and keep his own legs out of and get the profits from and let another man in for , was Compeyson 's business .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 28]: He 'd no more heart than a iron file , he was as cold as death , and he had the head of the Devil afore mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 26]: `` There was another in with Compeyson , as was called Arthur , -- not as being so chrisen 'd , but as a surname .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 14]: He was in a Decline , and was a shadow to look at .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 45]: Him and Compeyson had been in a bad thing with a rich lady some years afore , and they 'd made a pot of money by it ; but Compeyson betted and gamed , and he 'd have run through the king 's taxes .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 49]: So , Arthur was a dying , and a dying poor and with the horrors on him , and Compeyson 's wife -LRB- which Compeyson kicked mostly -RRB- was a having pity on him when she could , and Compeyson was a having pity on nothing and nobody .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 40]: `` I might a took warning by Arthur , but I did n't ; and I wo n't pretend I was partick ` ler -- for where ` ud be the good on it , dear boy and comrade ?
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 17]: So I begun wi ' Compeyson , and a poor tool I was in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 42]: Arthur lived at the top of Compeyson 's house -LRB- over nigh Brentford it was -RRB- , and Compeyson kept a careful account agen him for board and lodging , in case he should ever get better to work it out .
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 7]: But Arthur soon settled the account .

Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 21]: `` Says Compeyson : ` Why , you fool , do n't you know she 's got a living body ?
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 27]: And how should she be up there , without coming through the door , or in at the window , and up the stairs ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 38]: ` I do n't know how she 's there , ' says Arthur , shivering dreadful with the horrors , ` but she 's standing in the corner at the foot of the bed , awful mad .

Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 7]: But he never come nigh himself .

Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 3]: he says .

Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 4]: ` Yes . '

Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 9]: ` Yes , yes , all right . '

Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 6]: She 's lifting me up .

Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 11]: Then he lifted himself up hard , and was dead .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 13]: `` Compeyson took it easy as a good riddance for both sides .

Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 52]: `` Not to go into the things that Compeyson planned , and I done -- which ` ud take a week -- I 'll simply say to you , dear boy , and Pip 's comrade , that that man got me into such nets as made me his black slave .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 23]: I was always in debt to him , always under his thumb , always a working , always a getting into danger .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 30]: He was younger than me , but he 'd got craft , and he 'd got learning , and he overmatched me five hundred times told and no mercy .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 14]: My Missis as I had the hard time wi ' -- Stop though !
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 59]: I ai n't brought her in -- '' He looked about him in a confused way , as if he had lost his place in the book of his remembrance ; and he turned his face to the fire , and spread his hands broader on his knees , and lifted them off and put them on again .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 20]: `` There ai n't no need to go into it , '' he said , looking round once more .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 26]: `` The time wi ' Compeyson was a ` most as hard a time as ever I had ; that said , all 's said .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 19]: Did I tell you as I was tried , alone , for misdemeanor , while with Compeyson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 5]: I answered , No .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 11]: he said , `` I was , and got convicted .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 28]: As to took up on suspicion , that was twice or three times in the four or five year that it lasted ; but evidence was wanting .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 31]: At last , me and Compeyson was both committed for felony , -- on a charge of putting stolen notes in circulation , -- and there was other charges behind .
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 18]: Compeyson says to me , ` Separate defences , no communication , ' and that was all .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 29]: And I was so miserable poor , that I sold all the clothes I had , except what hung on my back , afore I could get Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 45]: `` When we was put in the dock , I noticed first of all what a gentleman Compeyson looked , wi ' his curly hair and his black clothes and his white pocket-handkercher , and what a common sort of a wretch I looked .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 29]: When the prosecution opened and the evidence was put short , aforehand , I noticed how heavy it all bore on me , and how light on him .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 59]: When the evidence was giv in the box , I noticed how it was always me that had come for ` ard , and could be swore to , how it was always me that the money had been paid to , how it was always me that had seemed to work the thing and get the profit .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 119]: But when the defence come on , then I see the plan plainer ; for , says the counsellor for Compeyson , ` My lord and gentlemen , here you has afore you , side by side , two persons as your eyes can separate wide ; one , the younger , well brought up , who will be spoke to as such ; one , the elder , ill brought up , who will be spoke to as such ; one , the younger , seldom if ever seen in these here transactions , and only suspected ; t ` other , the elder , always seen in 'em and always wi ` his guilt brought home .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 34]: Can you doubt , if there is but one in it , which is the one , and , if there is two in it , which is much the worst one ? '
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 3]: And such-like .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 57]: And when it come to character , war n't it Compeyson as had been to the school , and war n't it his schoolfellows as was in this position and in that , and war n't it him as had been know 'd by witnesses in such clubs and societies , and nowt to his disadvantage ?
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 29]: And war n't it me as had been tried afore , and as had been know 'd up hill and down dale in Bridewells and Lock -- Ups !
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 33]: And when it come to speech-making , war n't it Compeyson as could speak to 'em wi ' his face dropping every now and then into his white pocket-handkercher , -- ah !
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 36]: and wi ' verses in his speech , too , -- and war n't it me as could only say , ` Gentlemen , this man at my side is a most precious rascal ' ?
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 48]: And when the verdict come , war n't it Compeyson as was recommended to mercy on account of good character and bad company , and giving up all the information he could agen me , and war n't it me as got never a word but Guilty ?
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 23]: And when I says to Compeyson , ` Once out of this court , I 'll smash that face of yourn ! '
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 20]: ai n't it Compeyson as prays the Judge to be protected , and gets two turnkeys stood betwixt us ?
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 64]: And when we 're sentenced , ai n't it him as gets seven year , and me fourteen , and ai n't it him as the Judge is sorry for , because he might a done so well , and ai n't it me as the Judge perceives to be a old offender of wiolent passion , likely to come to worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 55]: He had worked himself into a state of great excitement , but he checked it , took two or three short breaths , swallowed as often , and stretching out his hand towards me said , in a reassuring manner , `` I ai n't a going to be low , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 28]: He had so heated himself that he took out his handkerchief and wiped his face and head and neck and hands , before he could go on .
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 22]: `` I had said to Compeyson that I 'd smash that face of his , and I swore Lord smash mine !
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 4]: to do it .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 21]: We was in the same prison-ship , but I could n't get at him for long , though I tried .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 31]: At last I come behind him and hit him on the cheek to turn him round and get a smashing one at him , when I was seen and seized .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 22]: The black-hole of that ship war n't a strong one , to a judge of black-holes that could swim and dive .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 34]: I escaped to the shore , and I was a hiding among the graves there , envying them as was in 'em and all over , when I first see my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 26]: He regarded me with a look of affection that made him almost abhorrent to me again , though I had felt great pity for him .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 19]: `` By my boy , I was giv to understand as Compeyson was out on them marshes too .
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 29]: Upon my soul , I half believe he escaped in his terror , to get quit of me , not knowing it was me as had got ashore .
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 5]: I hunted him down .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 5]: I smashed his face .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 28]: ` And now , ' says I ` as the worst thing I can do , caring nothing for myself , I 'll drag you back . '
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 31]: And I 'd have swum off , towing him by the hair , if it had come to that , and I 'd a got him aboard without the soldiers .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 21]: `` Of course he 'd much the best of it to the last , -- his character was so good .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 22]: He had escaped when he was made half wild by me and my murderous intentions ; and his punishment was light .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 16]: I was put in irons , brought to trial again , and sent for life .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 18]: I did n't stop for life , dear boy and Pip 's comrade , being here . ''
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 42]: `` He wiped himself again , as he had done before , and then slowly took his tangle of tobacco from his pocket , and plucked his pipe from his button-hole , and slowly filled it , and began to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 6]: `` Is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 7]: I asked , after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 9]: `` Is who dead , dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 4]: `` Compeyson . ''
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 22]: `` He hopes I am , if he 's alive , you may be sure , '' with a fierce look .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 10]: `` I never heerd no more of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 14]: Herbert had been writing with his pencil in the cover of a book .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 35]: He softly pushed the book over to me , as Provis stood smoking with his eyes on the fire , and I read in it : -- `` Young Havisham 's name was Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 14]: Compeyson is the man who professed to be Miss Havisham 's lover . ''
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 37]: I shut the book and nodded slightly to Herbert , and put the book by ; but we neither of us said anything , and both looked at Provis as he stood smoking by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 21]: Chapter XLIII Why should I pause to ask how much of my shrinking from Provis might be traced to Estella ?
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 64]: Why should I loiter on my road , to compare the state of mind in which I had tried to rid myself of the stain of the prison before meeting her at the coach-office , with the state of mind in which I now reflected on the abyss between Estella in her pride and beauty , and the returned transport whom I harbored ?
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 30]: The road would be none the smoother for it , the end would be none the better for it , he would not be helped , nor I extenuated .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 31]: A new fear had been engendered in my mind by his narrative ; or rather , his narrative had given form and purpose to the fear that was already there .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 17]: If Compeyson were alive and should discover his return , I could hardly doubt the consequence .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 59]: That , Compeyson stood in mortal fear of him , neither of the two could know much better than I ; and that any such man as that man had been described to be would hesitate to release himself for good from a dreaded enemy by the safe means of becoming an informer was scarcely to be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 23]: Never had I breathed , and never would I breathe -- or so I resolved -- a word of Estella to Provis .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 23]: But , I said to Herbert that , before I could go abroad , I must see both Estella and Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 20]: This was when we were left alone on the night of the day when Provis told us his story .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 14]: I resolved to go out to Richmond next day , and I went .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 24]: On my presenting myself at Mrs. Brandley 's , Estella 's maid was called to tell that Estella had gone into the country .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 2]: Where ?
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 7]: To Satis House , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 23]: Not as usual , I said , for she had never yet gone there without me ; when was she coming back ?
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 35]: There was an air of reservation in the answer which increased my perplexity , and the answer was , that her maid believed she was only coming back at all for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 29]: I could make nothing of this , except that it was meant that I should make nothing of it , and I went home again in complete discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 47]: Another night consultation with Herbert after Provis was gone home -LRB- I always took him home , and always looked well about me -RRB- , led us to the conclusion that nothing should be said about going abroad until I came back from Miss Havisham 's .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 52]: In the mean time , Herbert and I were to consider separately what it would be best to say ; whether we should devise any pretence of being afraid that he was under suspicious observation ; or whether I , who had never yet been abroad , should propose an expedition .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 16]: We both knew that I had but to propose anything , and he would consent .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 18]: We agreed that his remaining many days in his present hazard was not to be thought of .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 35]: Next day I had the meanness to feign that I was under a binding promise to go down to Joe ; but I was capable of almost any meanness towards Joe or his name .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 25]: Provis was to be strictly careful while I was gone , and Herbert was to take the charge of him that I had taken .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 35]: I was to be absent only one night , and , on my return , the gratification of his impatience for my starting as a gentleman on a greater scale was to be begun .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 41]: It occurred to me then , and as I afterwards found to Herbert also , that he might be best got away across the water , on that pretence , -- as , to make purchases , or the like .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 63]: Having thus cleared the way for my expedition to Miss Havisham 's , I set off by the early morning coach before it was yet light , and was out on the open country road when the day came creeping on , halting and whimpering and shivering , and wrapped in patches of cloud and rags of mist , like a beggar .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 37]: When we drove up to the Blue Boar after a drizzly ride , whom should I see come out under the gateway , toothpick in hand , to look at the coach , but Bentley Drummle !
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 15]: As he pretended not to see me , I pretended not to see him .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 35]: It was a very lame pretence on both sides ; the lamer , because we both went into the coffee-room , where he had just finished his breakfast , and where I ordered mine .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 23]: It was poisonous to me to see him in the town , for I very well knew why he had come there .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 74]: Pretending to read a smeary newspaper long out of date , which had nothing half so legible in its local news , as the foreign matter of coffee , pickles , fish sauces , gravy , melted butter , and wine with which it was sprinkled all over , as if it had taken the measles in a highly irregular form , I sat at my table while he stood before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 16]: By degrees it became an enormous injury to me that he stood before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 13]: And I got up , determined to have my share of it .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 32]: I had to put my hand behind his legs for the poker when I went up to the fireplace to stir the fire , but still pretended not to know him .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 7]: `` Is this a cut ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 4]: said Mr. Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 15]: said I , poker in hand ; `` it 's you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 5]: How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 14]: I was wondering who it was , who kept the fire off . ''
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 31]: With that , I poked tremendously , and having done so , planted myself side by side with Mr. Drummle , my shoulders squared and my back to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 8]: `` You have just come down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 13]: said Mr. Drummle , edging me a little away with his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' said I , edging him a little away with my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 8]: `` Beastly place , '' said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 11]: `` Your part of the country , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I assented .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 12]: `` I am told it 's very like your Shropshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 12]: `` Not in the least like it , '' said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 28]: Here Mr. Drummle looked at his boots and I looked at mine , and then Mr. Drummle looked at my boots , and I looked at his .
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 8]: `` Have you been here long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 13]: I asked , determined not to yield an inch of the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 21]: `` Long enough to be tired of it , '' returned Drummle , pretending to yawn , but equally determined .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 8]: `` Do you stay here long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 10]: `` Ca n't say , '' answered Mr. Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 67]: `` Ca n't say , '' said I. I felt here , through a tingling in my blood , that if Mr. Drummle 's shoulder had claimed another hair 's breadth of room , I should have jerked him into the window ; equally , that if my own shoulder had urged a similar claim , Mr. Drummle would have jerked me into the nearest box .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 5]: He whistled a little .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 15]: So did I. `` Large tract of marshes about here , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 3]: said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 5]: What of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 20]: Mr. Drummle looked at me , and then at my boots , and then said , `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 3]: and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 9]: `` Are you amused , Mr. Drummle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 11]: `` No , '' said he , `` not particularly .
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 11]: I am going out for a ride in the saddle .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 9]: I mean to explore those marshes for amusement .
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 8]: Out-of-the-way villages there , they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 10]: Curious little public-houses -- and smithies -- and that .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 3]: Waiter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 9]: `` Is that horse of mine ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 10]: `` Brought round to the door , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 4]: `` I say .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 6]: Look here , you sir .
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 14]: The lady wo n't ride to-day ; the weather wo n't do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 7]: `` Very good , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 19]: `` And I do n't dine , because I 'm going to dine at the lady 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 7]: `` Very good , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 65]: Then , Drummle glanced at me , with an insolent triumph on his great-jowled face that cut me to the heart , dull as he was , and so exasperated me , that I felt inclined to take him in my arms -LRB- as the robber in the story-book is said to have taken the old lady -RRB- and seat him on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 26]: One thing was manifest to both of us , and that was , that until relief came , neither of us could relinquish the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 29]: There we stood , well squared up before it , shoulder to shoulder and foot to foot , with our hands behind us , not budging an inch .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 42]: The horse was visible outside in the drizzle at the door , my breakfast was put on the table , Drummle 's was cleared away , the waiter invited me to begin , I nodded , we both stood our ground .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 10]: `` Have you been to the Grove since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 3]: said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 23]: `` No , '' said I , `` I had quite enough of the Finches the last time I was there . ''
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 12]: `` Was that when we had a difference of opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' I replied , very shortly .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 5]: `` Come , come !
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 11]: They let you off easily enough , '' sneered Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 10]: `` You should n't have lost your temper . ''
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 20]: `` Mr. Drummle , '' said I , `` you are not competent to give advice on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 25]: When I lose my temper -LRB- not that I admit having done so on that occasion -RRB- , I do n't throw glasses . ''
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 8]: `` I do , '' said Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 42]: After glancing at him once or twice , in an increased state of smouldering ferocity , I said , -- `` Mr. Drummle , I did not seek this conversation , and I do n't think it an agreeable one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 27]: `` I am sure it 's not , '' said he , superciliously over his shoulder ; `` I do n't think anything about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 28]: `` And therefore , '' I went on , `` with your leave , I will suggest that we hold no kind of communication in future . ''
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 27]: `` Quite my opinion , '' said Drummle , `` and what I should have suggested myself , or done -- more likely -- without suggesting .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 7]: But do n't lose your temper .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 9]: Have n't you lost enough without that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 3]: `` Waiter !
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 11]: , '' said Drummle , by way of answering me .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 4]: The waiter reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 7]: `` Look here , you sir .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 23]: You quite understand that the young lady do n't ride to-day , and that I dine at the young lady 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 7]: `` Quite so , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 57]: When the waiter had felt my fast-cooling teapot with the palm of his hand , and had looked imploringly at me , and had gone out , Drummle , careful not to move the shoulder next me , took a cigar from his pocket and bit the end off , but showed no sign of stirring .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 58]: Choking and boiling as I was , I felt that we could not go a word further , without introducing Estella 's name , which I could not endure to hear him utter ; and therefore I looked stonily at the opposite wall , as if there were no one present , and forced myself to silence .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 65]: How long we might have remained in this ridiculous position it is impossible to say , but for the incursion of three thriving farmers -- laid on by the waiter , I think -- who came into the coffee-room unbuttoning their great-coats and rubbing their hands , and before whom , as they charged at the fire , we were obliged to give way .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 27]: I saw him through the window , seizing his horse 's mane , and mounting in his blundering brutal manner , and sidling and backing away .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 27]: I thought he was gone , when he came back , calling for a light for the cigar in his mouth , which he had forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 81]: A man in a dust-colored dress appeared with what was wanted , -- I could not have said from where : whether from the inn yard , or the street , or where not , -- and as Drummle leaned down from the saddle and lighted his cigar and laughed , with a jerk of his head towards the coffee-room windows , the slouching shoulders and ragged hair of this man whose back was towards me reminded me of Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 68]: Too heavily out of sorts to care much at the time whether it were he or no , or after all to touch the breakfast , I washed the weather and the journey from my face and hands , and went out to the memorable old house that it would have been so much the better for me never to have entered , never to have seen .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 47]: Chapter XLIV In the room where the dressing-table stood , and where the wax -- candles burnt on the wall , I found Miss Havisham and Estella ; Miss Havisham seated on a settee near the fire , and Estella on a cushion at her feet .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 11]: Estella was knitting , and Miss Havisham was looking on .
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 18]: They both raised their eyes as I went in , and both saw an alteration in me .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 10]: I derived that , from the look they interchanged .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 18]: `` And what wind , '' said Miss Havisham , `` blows you here , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 15]: Though she looked steadily at me , I saw that she was rather confused .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 54]: Estella , pausing a moment in her knitting with her eyes upon me , and then going on , I fancied that I read in the action of her fingers , as plainly as if she had told me in the dumb alphabet , that she perceived I had discovered my real benefactor .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 34]: `` Miss Havisham , '' said I , `` I went to Richmond yesterday , to speak to Estella ; and finding that some wind had blown her here , I followed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 31]: Miss Havisham motioning to me for the third or fourth time to sit down , I took the chair by the dressing-table , which I had often seen her occupy .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 22]: With all that ruin at my feet and about me , it seemed a natural place for me , that day .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 25]: `` What I had to say to Estella , Miss Havisham , I will say before you , presently -- in a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 12]: It will not surprise you , it will not displease you .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 15]: I am as unhappy as you can ever have meant me to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 9]: Miss Havisham continued to look steadily at me .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 28]: I could see in the action of Estella 's fingers as they worked that she attended to what I said ; but she did not look up .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 10]: `` I have found out who my patron is .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 24]: It is not a fortunate discovery , and is not likely ever to enrich me in reputation , station , fortune , anything .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 12]: There are reasons why I must say no more of that .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 11]: It is not my secret , but another 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 33]: As I was silent for a while , looking at Estella and considering how to go on , Miss Havisham repeated , `` It is not your secret , but another 's .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 71]: `` When you first caused me to be brought here , Miss Havisham , when I belonged to the village over yonder , that I wish I had never left , I suppose I did really come here , as any other chance boy might have come , -- as a kind of servant , to gratify a want or a whim , and to be paid for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 20]: `` Ay , Pip , '' replied Miss Havisham , steadily nodding her head ; `` you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 38]: `` And that Mr. Jaggers -- '' `` Mr. Jaggers , '' said Miss Havisham , taking me up in a firm tone , `` had nothing to do with it , and knew nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 17]: His being my lawyer , and his being the lawyer of your patron is a coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 16]: He holds the same relation towards numbers of people , and it might easily arise .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 20]: Be that as it may , it did arise , and was not brought about by any one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 19]: Any one might have seen in her haggard face that there was no suppression or evasion so far .
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 23]: `` But when I fell into the mistake I have so long remained in , at least you led me on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 21]: said I. `` Yes , '' she returned , again nodding steadily , `` I let you go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 6]: `` Was that kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 49]: `` Who am I , '' cried Miss Havisham , striking her stick upon the floor and flashing into wrath so suddenly that Estella glanced up at her in surprise , -- `` who am I , for God 's sake , that I should be kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 18]: It was a weak complaint to have made , and I had not meant to make it .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 13]: I told her so , as she sat brooding after this outburst .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 8]: `` Well , well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 5]: `` What else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 36]: `` I was liberally paid for my old attendance here , '' I said , to soothe her , `` in being apprenticed , and I have asked these questions only for my own information .
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 13]: What follows has another -LRB- and I hope more disinterested -RRB- purpose .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 32]: In humoring my mistake , Miss Havisham , you punished -- practised on -- perhaps you will supply whatever term expresses your intention , without offence -- your self-seeking relations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 8]: Why , they would have it so !
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 4]: So would you .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 25]: What has been my history , that I should be at the pains of entreating either them or you not to have it so !
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 6]: You made your own snares .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 6]: I never made them . ''
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 29]: Waiting until she was quiet again , -- for this , too , flashed out of her in a wild and sudden way , -- I went on .
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 27]: `` I have been thrown among one family of your relations , Miss Havisham , and have been constantly among them since I went to London .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 15]: I know them to have been as honestly under my delusion as I myself .
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 72]: And I should be false and base if I did not tell you , whether it is acceptable to you or no , and whether you are inclined to give credence to it or no , that you deeply wrong both Mr. Matthew Pocket and his son Herbert , if you suppose them to be otherwise than generous , upright , open , and incapable of anything designing or mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 11]: `` They are your friends , '' said Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 41]: `` They made themselves my friends , '' said I , `` when they supposed me to have superseded them ; and when Sarah Pocket , Miss Georgiana , and Mistress Camilla were not my friends , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 22]: This contrasting of them with the rest seemed , I was glad to see , to do them good with her .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 25]: She looked at me keenly for a little while , and then said quietly , -- `` What do you want for them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 18]: `` Only , '' said I , `` that you would not confound them with the others .
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 22]: They may be of the same blood , but , believe me , they are not of the same nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 20]: Still looking at me keenly , Miss Havisham repeated , -- `` What do you want for them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 44]: `` I am not so cunning , you see , '' I said , in answer , conscious that I reddened a little , `` as that I could hide from you , even if I desired , that I do want something .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 42]: Miss Havisham , if you would spare the money to do my friend Herbert a lasting service in life , but which from the nature of the case must be done without his knowledge , I could show you how . ''
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 11]: `` Why must it be done without his knowledge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 19]: she asked , settling her hands upon her stick , that she might regard me the more attentively .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 33]: `` Because , '' said I , `` I began the service myself , more than two years ago , without his knowledge , and I do n't want to be betrayed .
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 15]: Why I fail in my ability to finish it , I can not explain .
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 17]: It is a part of the secret which is another person 's and not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 15]: She gradually withdrew her eyes from me , and turned them on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 56]: After watching it for what appeared in the silence and by the light of the slowly wasting candles to be a long time , she was roused by the collapse of some of the red coals , and looked towards me again -- at first , vacantly -- then , with a gradually concentrating attention .
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 7]: All this time Estella knitted on .
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 31]: When Miss Havisham had fixed her attention on me , she said , speaking as if there had been no lapse in our dialogue , -- `` What else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 27]: `` Estella , '' said I , turning to her now , and trying to command my trembling voice , `` you know I love you .
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 12]: You know that I have loved you long and dearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 30]: She raised her eyes to my face , on being thus addressed , and her fingers plied their work , and she looked at me with an unmoved countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 17]: I saw that Miss Havisham glanced from me to her , and from her to me .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 14]: `` I should have said this sooner , but for my long mistake .
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 14]: It induced me to hope that Miss Havisham meant us for one another .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 19]: While I thought you could not help yourself , as it were , I refrained from saying it .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 8]: But I must say it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 17]: Preserving her unmoved countenance , and with her fingers still going , Estella shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 19]: `` I know , '' said I , in answer to that action , -- `` I know .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 14]: I have no hope that I shall ever call you mine , Estella .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 23]: I am ignorant what may become of me very soon , how poor I may be , or where I may go .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 6]: Still , I love you .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 15]: I have loved you ever since I first saw you in this house . ''
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 17]: Looking at me perfectly unmoved and with her fingers busy , she shook her head again .
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 52]: `` It would have been cruel in Miss Havisham , horribly cruel , to practise on the susceptibility of a poor boy , and to torture me through all these years with a vain hope and an idle pursuit , if she had reflected on the gravity of what she did .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 7]: But I think she did not .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 19]: I think that , in the endurance of her own trial , she forgot mine , Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 27]: I saw Miss Havisham put her hand to her heart and hold it there , as she sat looking by turns at Estella and at me .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 38]: `` It seems , '' said Estella , very calmly , `` that there are sentiments , fancies , -- I do n't know how to call them , -- which I am not able to comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 23]: When you say you love me , I know what you mean , as a form of words ; but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 12]: You address nothing in my breast , you touch nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 11]: I do n't care for what you say at all .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 16]: I have tried to warn you of this ; now , have I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 11]: I said in a miserable manner , `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 16]: But you would not be warned , for you thought I did not mean it .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 9]: Now , did you not think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 11]: `` I thought and hoped you could not mean it .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 12]: You , so young , untried , and beautiful , Estella !
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 8]: Surely it is not in Nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 11]: `` It is in my nature , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 22]: And then she added , with a stress upon the words , `` It is in the nature formed within me .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 17]: I make a great difference between you and all other people when I say so much .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 7]: I can do no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 24]: `` Is it not true , '' said I , `` that Bentley Drummle is in town here , and pursuing you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 20]: `` It is quite true , '' she replied , referring to him with the indifference of utter contempt .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 23]: `` That you encourage him , and ride out with him , and that he dines with you this very day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 20]: She seemed a little surprised that I should know it , but again replied , `` Quite true . ''
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 10]: `` You can not love him , Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 21]: Her fingers stopped for the first time , as she retorted rather angrily , `` What have I told you ?
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 20]: Do you still think , in spite of it , that I do not mean what I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 10]: `` You would never marry him , Estella ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 18]: She looked towards Miss Havisham , and considered for a moment with her work in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 12]: Then she said , `` Why not tell you the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 10]: I am going to be married to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 34]: I dropped my face into my hands , but was able to control myself better than I could have expected , considering what agony it gave me to hear her say those words .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 31]: When I raised my face again , there was such a ghastly look upon Miss Havisham 's , that it impressed me , even in my passionate hurry and grief .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 18]: `` Estella , dearest Estella , do not let Miss Havisham lead you into this fatal step .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 27]: Put me aside for ever , -- you have done so , I well know , -- but bestow yourself on some worthier person than Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 36]: Miss Havisham gives you to him , as the greatest slight and injury that could be done to the many far better men who admire you , and to the few who truly love you .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 40]: Among those few there may be one who loves you even as dearly , though he has not loved you as long , as I. Take him , and I can bear it better , for your sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 33]: My earnestness awoke a wonder in her that seemed as if it would have been touched with compassion , if she could have rendered me at all intelligible to her own mind .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 22]: `` I am going , '' she said again , in a gentler voice , `` to be married to him .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 15]: The preparations for my marriage are making , and I shall be married soon .
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 13]: Why do you injuriously introduce the name of my mother by adoption ?
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 7]: It is my own act . ''
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 16]: `` Your own act , Estella , to fling yourself away upon a brute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 10]: `` On whom should I fling myself away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 7]: she retorted , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 29]: `` Should I fling myself away upon the man who would the soonest feel -LRB- if people do feel such things -RRB- that I took nothing to him ?
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 4]: It is done .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 12]: I shall do well enough , and so will my husband .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 53]: As to leading me into what you call this fatal step , Miss Havisham would have had me wait , and not marry yet ; but I am tired of the life I have led , which has very few charms for me , and I am willing enough to change it .
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 4]: Say no more .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 8]: We shall never understand each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 12]: `` Such a mean brute , such a stupid brute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 6]: I urged , in despair .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 24]: `` Do n't be afraid of my being a blessing to him , '' said Estella ; `` I shall not be that .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 5]: Here is my hand .
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 14]: Do we part on this , you visionary boy -- or man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 5]: `` O Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 48]: I answered , as my bitter tears fell fast on her hand , do what I would to restrain them ; `` even if I remained in England and could hold my head up with the rest , how could I see you Drummle 's wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 11]: `` Nonsense , '' she returned , -- `` nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 8]: This will pass in no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 6]: `` Never , Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 14]: `` You will get me out of your thoughts in a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 6]: `` Out of my thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 11]: You are part of my existence , part of myself .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 28]: You have been in every line I have ever read since I first came here , the rough common boy whose poor heart you wounded even then .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 56]: You have been in every prospect I have ever seen since , -- on the river , on the sails of the ships , on the marshes , in the clouds , in the light , in the darkness , in the wind , in the woods , in the sea , in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 18]: You have been the embodiment of every graceful fancy that my mind has ever become acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 43]: The stones of which the strongest London buildings are made are not more real , or more impossible to be displaced by your hands , than your presence and influence have been to me , there and everywhere , and will be .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 34]: Estella , to the last hour of my life , you can not choose but remain part of my character , part of the little good in me , part of the evil .
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 46]: But , in this separation , I associate you only with the good ; and I will faithfully hold you to that always , for you must have done me far more good than harm , let me feel now what sharp distress I may .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 10]: O God bless you , God forgive you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 19]: In what ecstasy of unhappiness I got these broken words out of myself , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 18]: The rhapsody welled up within me , like blood from an inward wound , and gushed out .
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 17]: I held her hand to my lips some lingering moments , and so I left her .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 53]: But ever afterwards , I remembered , -- and soon afterwards with stronger reason , -- that while Estella looked at me merely with incredulous wonder , the spectral figure of Miss Havisham , her hand still covering her heart , seemed all resolved into a ghastly stare of pity and remorse .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 6]: All done , all gone !
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 32]: So much was done and gone , that when I went out at the gate , the light of the day seemed of a darker color than when I went in .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 25]: For a while , I hid myself among some lanes and by-paths , and then struck off to walk all the way to London .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 59]: For , I had by that time come to myself so far as to consider that I could not go back to the inn and see Drummle there ; that I could not bear to sit upon the coach and be spoken to ; that I could do nothing half so good for myself as tire myself out .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 10]: It was past midnight when I crossed London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 36]: Pursuing the narrow intricacies of the streets which at that time tended westward near the Middlesex shore of the river , my readiest access to the Temple was close by the river-side , through Whitefriars .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 31]: I was not expected till to-morrow ; but I had my keys , and , if Herbert were gone to bed , could get to bed myself without disturbing him .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 56]: As it seldom happened that I came in at that Whitefriars gate after the Temple was closed , and as I was very muddy and weary , I did not take it ill that the night-porter examined me with much attention as he held the gate a little way open for me to pass in .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 9]: To help his memory I mentioned my name .
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 14]: `` I was not quite sure , sir , but I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 7]: Here 's a note , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 20]: The messenger that brought it , said would you be so good as read it by my lantern ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 11]: Much surprised by the request , I took the note .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 28]: It was directed to Philip Pip , Esquire , and on the top of the superscription were the words , `` PLEASE READ THIS , HERE . ''
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 28]: I opened it , the watchman holding up his light , and read inside , in Wemmick 's writing , -- `` DO N'T GO HOME . ''
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 43]: Chapter XLV Turning from the Temple gate as soon as I had read the warning , I made the best of my way to Fleet Street , and there got a late hackney chariot and drove to the Hummums in Covent Garden .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 54]: In those times a bed was always to be got there at any hour of the night , and the chamberlain , letting me in at his ready wicket , lighted the candle next in order on his shelf , and showed me straight into the bedroom next in order on his list .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 59]: It was a sort of vault on the ground floor at the back , with a despotic monster of a four-post bedstead in it , straddling over the whole place , putting one of his arbitrary legs into the fireplace and another into the doorway , and squeezing the wretched little washing-stand in quite a Divinely Righteous manner .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 30]: As I had asked for a night-light , the chamberlain had brought me in , before he left me , the good old constitutional rushlight of those virtuous days .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 58]: -- an object like the ghost of a walking-cane , which instantly broke its back if it were touched , which nothing could ever be lighted at , and which was placed in solitary confinement at the bottom of a high tin tower , perforated with round holes that made a staringly wide-awake pattern on the walls .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 39]: When I had got into bed , and lay there footsore , weary , and wretched , I found that I could no more close my own eyes than I could close the eyes of this foolish Argus .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 18]: And thus , in the gloom and death of the night , we stared at one another .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 5]: What a doleful night !
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 9]: How anxious , how dismal , how long !
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 70]: There was an inhospitable smell in the room , of cold soot and hot dust ; and , as I looked up into the corners of the tester over my head , I thought what a number of blue-bottle flies from the butchers ' , and earwigs from the market , and grubs from the country , must be holding on up there , lying by for next summer .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 43]: This led me to speculate whether any of them ever tumbled down , and then I fancied that I felt light falls on my face , -- a disagreeable turn of thought , suggesting other and more objectionable approaches up my back .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 22]: When I had lain awake a little while , those extraordinary voices with which silence teems began to make themselves audible .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 24]: The closet whispered , the fireplace sighed , the little washing-stand ticked , and one guitar-string played occasionally in the chest of drawers .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 33]: At about the same time , the eyes on the wall acquired a new expression , and in every one of those staring rounds I saw written , DO N'T GO HOME .
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 18]: Whatever night-fancies and night-noises crowded on me , they never warded off this DO N'T GO HOME .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 17]: It plaited itself into whatever I thought of , as a bodily pain would have done .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 46]: Not long before , I had read in the newspapers , how a gentleman unknown had come to the Hummums in the night , and had gone to bed , and had destroyed himself , and had been found in the morning weltering in blood .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 65]: It came into my head that he must have occupied this very vault of mine , and I got out of bed to assure myself that there were no red marks about ; then opened the door to look out into the passages , and cheer myself with the companionship of a distant light , near which I knew the chamberlain to be dozing .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 61]: But all this time , why I was not to go home , and what had happened at home , and when I should go home , and whether Provis was safe at home , were questions occupying my mind so busily , that one might have supposed there could be no more room in it for any other theme .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 65]: Even when I thought of Estella , and how we had parted that day forever , and when I recalled all the circumstances of our parting , and all her looks and tones , and the action of her fingers while she knitted , -- even then I was pursuing , here and there and everywhere , the caution , Do n't go home .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 26]: When at last I dozed , in sheer exhaustion of mind and body , it became a vast shadowy verb which I had to conjugate .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 38]: Imperative mood , present tense : Do not thou go home , let him not go home , let us not go home , do not ye or you go home , let not them go home .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 57]: Then potentially : I may not and I can not go home ; and I might not , could not , would not , and should not go home ; until I felt that I was going distracted , and rolled over on the pillow , and looked at the staring rounds upon the wall again .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 46]: I had left directions that I was to be called at seven ; for it was plain that I must see Wemmick before seeing any one else , and equally plain that this was a case in which his Walworth sentiments only could be taken .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 35]: It was a relief to get out of the room where the night had been so miserable , and I needed no second knocking at the door to startle me from my uneasy bed .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 11]: The Castle battlements arose upon my view at eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 48]: The little servant happening to be entering the fortress with two hot rolls , I passed through the postern and crossed the drawbridge in her company , and so came without announcement into the presence of Wemmick as he was making tea for himself and the Aged .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 13]: An open door afforded a perspective view of the Aged in bed .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 7]: `` Halloa , Mr. Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 3]: said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 9]: `` You did come home , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' I returned ; `` but I did n't go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 14]: `` That 's all right , '' said he , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 18]: `` I left a note for you at each of the Temple gates , on the chance .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 8]: Which gate did you come to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 4]: I told him .
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 52]: `` I 'll go round to the others in the course of the day and destroy the notes , '' said Wemmick ; `` it 's a good rule never to leave documentary evidence if you can help it , because you do n't know when it may be put in .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 10]: I 'm going to take a liberty with you .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 12]: Would you mind toasting this sausage for the Aged P. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 10]: I said I should be delighted to do it .
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 36]: `` Then you can go about your work , Mary Anne , '' said Wemmick to the little servant ; `` which leaves us to ourselves , do n't you see , Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 9]: he added , winking , as she disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 36]: I thanked him for his friendship and caution , and our discourse proceeded in a low tone , while I toasted the Aged 's sausage and he buttered the crumb of the Aged 's roll .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 21]: `` Now , Mr. Pip , you know , '' said Wemmick , `` you and I understand one another .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 21]: We are in our private and personal capacities , and we have been engaged in a confidential transaction before to-day .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 6]: Official sentiments are one thing .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 6]: We are extra official . ''
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 4]: I cordially assented .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 27]: I was so very nervous , that I had already lighted the Aged 's sausage like a torch , and been obliged to blow it out .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 57]: `` I accidentally heard , yesterday morning , '' said Wemmick , `` being in a certain place where I once took you , -- even between you and me , it 's as well not to mention names when avoidable -- '' `` Much better not , '' said I. `` I understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 132]: `` I heard there by chance , yesterday morning , '' said Wemmick , `` that a certain person not altogether of uncolonial pursuits , and not unpossessed of portable property , -- I do n't know who it may really be , -- we wo n't name this person -- '' `` Not necessary , '' said I. '' -- Had made some little stir in a certain part of the world where a good many people go , not always in gratification of their own inclinations , and not quite irrespective of the government expense -- '' In watching his face , I made quite a firework of the Aged 's sausage , and greatly discomposed both my own attention and Wemmick 's ; for which I apologized . ''
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 15]: -- By disappearing from such place , and being no more heard of thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 16]: From which , '' said Wemmick , `` conjectures had been raised and theories formed .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 25]: I also heard that you at your chambers in Garden Court , Temple , had been watched , and might be watched again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 5]: `` By whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 24]: said I. `` I would n't go into that , '' said Wemmick , evasively , `` it might clash with official responsibilities .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 19]: I heard it , as I have in my time heard other curious things in the same place .
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 10]: I do n't tell it you on information received .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 5]: I heard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 25]: He took the toasting-fork and sausage from me as he spoke , and set forth the Aged 's breakfast neatly on a little tray .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 52]: Previous to placing it before him , he went into the Aged 's room with a clean white cloth , and tied the same under the old gentleman 's chin , and propped him up , and put his nightcap on one side , and gave him quite a rakish air .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 26]: Then he placed his breakfast before him with great care , and said , `` All right , ai n't you , Aged P. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 20]: To which the cheerful Aged replied , `` All right , John , my boy , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 39]: As there seemed to be a tacit understanding that the Aged was not in a presentable state , and was therefore to be considered invisible , I made a pretence of being in complete ignorance of these proceedings .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 45]: `` This watching of me at my chambers -LRB- which I have once had reason to suspect -RRB- , '' I said to Wemmick when he came back , `` is inseparable from the person to whom you have adverted ; is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 5]: Wemmick looked very serious .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 14]: `` I could n't undertake to say that , of my own knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 14]: I mean , I could n't undertake to say it was at first .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 20]: But it either is , or it will be , or it 's in great danger of being . ''
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 48]: As I saw that he was restrained by fealty to Little Britain from saying as much as he could , and as I knew with thankfulness to him how far out of his way he went to say what he did , I could not press him .
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 45]: But I told him , after a little meditation over the fire , that I would like to ask him a question , subject to his answering or not answering , as he deemed right , and sure that his course would be right .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 40]: He paused in his breakfast , and crossing his arms , and pinching his shirt-sleeves -LRB- his notion of in-door comfort was to sit without any coat -RRB- , he nodded to me once , to put my question .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 18]: `` You have heard of a man of bad character , whose true name is Compeyson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 7]: He answered with one other nod .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 6]: `` Is he living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 4]: One other nod .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 7]: `` Is he in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 25]: He gave me one other nod , compressed the post-office exceedingly , gave me one last nod , and went on with his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 36]: `` Now , '' said Wemmick , `` questioning being over , '' which he emphasized and repeated for my guidance , `` I come to what I did , after hearing what I heard .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 24]: I went to Garden Court to find you ; not finding you , I went to Clarriker 's to find Mr. Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 7]: `` And him you found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 7]: said I , with great anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 6]: `` And him I found .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 64]: Without mentioning any names or going into any details , I gave him to understand that if he was aware of anybody -- Tom , Jack , or Richard -- being about the chambers , or about the immediate neighborhood , he had better get Tom , Jack , or Richard out of the way while you were out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 11]: `` He would be greatly puzzled what to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 42]: `` He was puzzled what to do ; not the less , because I gave him my opinion that it was not safe to try to get Tom , Jack , or Richard too far out of the way at present .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 9]: Mr. Pip , I 'll tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 19]: Under existing circumstances , there is no place like a great city when you are once in it .
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 7]: Do n't break cover too soon .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 3]: Lie close .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 17]: Wait till things slacken , before you try the open , even for foreign air . ''
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 16]: I thanked him for his valuable advice , and asked him what Herbert had done ?
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 25]: `` Mr. Herbert , '' said Wemmick , `` after being all of a heap for half an hour , struck out a plan .
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 29]: He mentioned to me as a secret , that he is courting a young lady who has , as no doubt you are aware , a bedridden Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 30]: Which Pa , having been in the Purser line of life , lies a-bed in a bow-window where he can see the ships sail up and down the river .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 12]: You are acquainted with the young lady , most probably ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 8]: `` Not personally , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 77]: The truth was , that she had objected to me as an expensive companion who did Herbert no good , and that , when Herbert had first proposed to present me to her , she had received the proposal with such very moderate warmth , that Herbert had felt himself obliged to confide the state of the case to me , with a view to the lapse of a little time before I made her acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 86]: When I had begun to advance Herbert 's prospects by stealth , I had been able to bear this with cheerful philosophy : he and his affianced , for their part , had naturally not been very anxious to introduce a third person into their interviews ; and thus , although I was assured that I had risen in Clara 's esteem , and although the young lady and I had long regularly interchanged messages and remembrances by Herbert , I had never seen her .
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 11]: However , I did not trouble Wemmick with these particulars .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 72]: `` The house with the bow-window , '' said Wemmick , `` being by the river-side , down the Pool there between Limehouse and Greenwich , and being kept , it seems , by a very respectable widow who has a furnished upper floor to let , Mr. Herbert put it to me , what did I think of that as a temporary tenement for Tom , Jack , or Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 17]: Now , I thought very well of it , for three reasons I 'll give you .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 7]: That is to say : Firstly .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 23]: It 's altogether out of all your beats , and is well away from the usual heap of streets great and small .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 2]: Secondly .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 25]: Without going near it yourself , you could always hear of the safety of Tom , Jack , or Richard , through Mr. Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 2]: Thirdly .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 35]: After a while and when it might be prudent , if you should want to slip Tom , Jack , or Richard on board a foreign packet-boat , there he is -- ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 19]: Much comforted by these considerations , I thanked Wemmick again and again , and begged him to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 5]: `` Well , sir !
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 46]: Mr. Herbert threw himself into the business with a will , and by nine o'clock last night he housed Tom , Jack , or Richard , -- whichever it may be , -- you and I do n't want to know , -- quite successfully .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 32]: At the old lodgings it was understood that he was summoned to Dover , and , in fact , he was taken down the Dover road and cornered out of it .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 46]: Now , another great advantage of all this is , that it was done without you , and when , if any one was concerning himself about your movements , you must be known to be ever so many miles off and quite otherwise engaged .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 30]: This diverts suspicion and confuses it ; and for the same reason I recommended that , even if you came back last night , you should not go home .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 12]: It brings in more confusion , and you want confusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 21]: Wemmick , having finished his breakfast , here looked at his watch , and began to get his coat on .
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 64]: `` And now , Mr. Pip , '' said he , with his hands still in the sleeves , `` I have probably done the most I can do ; but if I can ever do more , -- from a Walworth point of view , and in a strictly private and personal capacity , -- I shall be glad to do it .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 5]: Here 's the address .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 45]: There can be no harm in your going here to-night , and seeing for yourself that all is well with Tom , Jack , or Richard , before you go home , -- which is another reason for your not going home last night .
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 14]: But , after you have gone home , do n't go back here .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 41]: You are very welcome , I am sure , Mr. Pip '' ; his hands were now out of his sleeves , and I was shaking them ; `` and let me finally impress one important point upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 29]: He laid his hands upon my shoulders , and added in a solemn whisper : `` Avail yourself of this evening to lay hold of his portable property .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 10]: You do n't know what may happen to him .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 11]: Do n't let anything happen to the portable property . ''
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 18]: Quite despairing of making my mind clear to Wemmick on this point , I forbore to try .
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 16]: `` Time 's up , '' said Wemmick , `` and I must be off .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 22]: If you had nothing more pressing to do than to keep here till dark , that 's what I should advise .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 42]: You look very much worried , and it would do you good to have a perfectly quiet day with the Aged , -- he 'll be up presently , -- and a little bit of -- you remember the pig ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 17]: `` Of course , '' said I. `` Well ; and a little bit of him .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 16]: That sausage you toasted was his , and he was in all respects a first-rater .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 13]: Do try him , if it is only for old acquaintance sake .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 7]: Good by , Aged Parent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 5]: in a cheery shout .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 13]: `` All right , John ; all right , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 7]: piped the old man from within .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 30]: I soon fell asleep before Wemmick 's fire , and the Aged and I enjoyed one another 's society by falling asleep before it more or less all day .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 33]: We had loin of pork for dinner , and greens grown on the estate ; and I nodded at the Aged with a good intention whenever I failed to do it drowsily .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 46]: When it was quite dark , I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast ; and I inferred from the number of teacups , as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall , that Miss Skiffins was expected .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 39]: Chapter XLVI Eight o'clock had struck before I got into the air , that was scented , not disagreeably , by the chips and shavings of the long-shore boat-builders , and mast , oar , and block makers .
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 52]: All that water-side region of the upper and lower Pool below Bridge was unknown ground to me ; and when I struck down by the river , I found that the spot I wanted was not where I had supposed it to be , and was anything but easy to find .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 28]: It was called Mill Pond Bank , Chinks 's Basin ; and I had no other guide to Chinks 's Basin than the Old Green Copper Rope-walk .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 80]: It matters not what stranded ships repairing in dry docks I lost myself among , what old hulls of ships in course of being knocked to pieces , what ooze and slime and other dregs of tide , what yards of ship-builders and ship-breakers , what rusty anchors blindly biting into the ground , though for years off duty , what mountainous country of accumulated casks and timber , how many ropewalks that were not the Old Green Copper .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 26]: After several times falling short of my destination and as often overshooting it , I came unexpectedly round a corner , upon Mill Pond Bank .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 94]: It was a fresh kind of place , all circumstances considered , where the wind from the river had room to turn itself round ; and there were two or three trees in it , and there was the stump of a ruined windmill , and there was the Old Green Copper Ropewalk , -- whose long and narrow vista I could trace in the moonlight , along a series of wooden frames set in the ground , that looked like superannuated haymaking-rakes which had grown old and lost most of their teeth .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 47]: Selecting from the few queer houses upon Mill Pond Bank a house with a wooden front and three stories of bow-window -LRB- not bay-window , which is another thing -RRB- , I looked at the plate upon the door , and read there , Mrs. Whimple .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 22]: That being the name I wanted , I knocked , and an elderly woman of a pleasant and thriving appearance responded .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 22]: She was immediately deposed , however , by Herbert , who silently led me into the parlor and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 93]: It was an odd sensation to see his very familiar face established quite at home in that very unfamiliar room and region ; and I found myself looking at him , much as I looked at the corner-cupboard with the glass and china , the shells upon the chimney-piece , and the colored engravings on the wall , representing the death of Captain Cook , a ship-launch , and his Majesty King George the Third in a state coachman 's wig , leather-breeches , and top-boots , on the terrace at Windsor .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 24]: `` All is well , Handel , '' said Herbert , `` and he is quite satisfied , though eager to see you .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 34]: My dear girl is with her father ; and if you 'll wait till she comes down , I 'll make you known to her , and then we 'll go up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 6]: That 's her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 20]: I had become aware of an alarming growling overhead , and had probably expressed the fact in my countenance .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 25]: `` I am afraid he is a sad old rascal , '' said Herbert , smiling , `` but I have never seen him .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 6]: Do n't you smell rum ?
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 7]: He is always at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 5]: `` At rum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 21]: said I. `` Yes , '' returned Herbert , `` and you may suppose how mild it makes his gout .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 21]: He persists , too , in keeping all the provisions up stairs in his room , and serving them out .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 15]: He keeps them on shelves over his head , and will weigh them all .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 11]: His room must be like a chandler 's shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 18]: While he thus spoke , the growling noise became a prolonged roar , and then died away .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 23]: `` What else can be the consequence , '' said Herbert , in explanation , `` if he will cut the cheese ?
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 28]: A man with the gout in his right hand -- and everywhere else -- ca n't expect to get through a Double Gloucester without hurting himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 16]: He seemed to have hurt himself very much , for he gave another furious roar .
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 33]: `` To have Provis for an upper lodger is quite a godsend to Mrs. Whimple , '' said Herbert , `` for of course people in general wo n't stand that noise .
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 11]: A curious place , Handel ; is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 15]: It was a curious place , indeed ; but remarkably well kept and clean .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 37]: `` Mrs. Whimple , '' said Herbert , when I told him so , `` is the best of housewives , and I really do not know what my Clara would do without her motherly help .
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 23]: For , Clara has no mother of her own , Handel , and no relation in the world but old Gruffandgrim . ''
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 11]: `` Surely that 's not his name , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 17]: `` No , no , '' said Herbert , `` that 's my name for him .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 6]: His name is Mr. Barley .
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 37]: But what a blessing it is for the son of my father and mother to love a girl who has no relations , and who can never bother herself or anybody else about her family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 74]: Herbert had told me on former occasions , and now reminded me , that he first knew Miss Clara Barley when she was completing her education at an establishment at Hammersmith , and that on her being recalled home to nurse her father , he and she had confided their affection to the motherly Mrs. Whimple , by whom it had been fostered and regulated with equal kindness and discretion , ever since .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 42]: It was understood that nothing of a tender nature could possibly be confided to old Barley , by reason of his being totally unequal to the consideration of any subject more psychological than Gout , Rum , and Purser 's stores .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 69]: As we were thus conversing in a low tone while Old Barley 's sustained growl vibrated in the beam that crossed the ceiling , the room door opened , and a very pretty , slight , dark-eyed girl of twenty or so came in with a basket in her hand : whom Herbert tenderly relieved of the basket , and presented , blushing , as `` Clara . ''
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 31]: She really was a most charming girl , and might have passed for a captive fairy , whom that truculent Ogre , Old Barley , had pressed into his service .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 40]: `` Look here , '' said Herbert , showing me the basket , with a compassionate and tender smile , after we had talked a little ; `` here 's poor Clara 's supper , served out every night .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 26]: Here 's her allowance of bread , and here 's her slice of cheese , and here 's her rum , -- which I drink .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 15]: This is Mr. Barley 's breakfast for to-morrow , served out to be cooked .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 30]: Two mutton-chops , three potatoes , some split peas , a little flour , two ounces of butter , a pinch of salt , and all this black pepper .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 25]: It 's stewed up together , and taken hot , and it 's a nice thing for the gout , I should think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 109]: There was something so natural and winning in Clara 's resigned way of looking at these stores in detail , as Herbert pointed them out ; and something so confiding , loving , and innocent in her modest manner of yielding herself to Herbert 's embracing arm ; and something so gentle in her , so much needing protection on Mill Pond Bank , by Chinks 's Basin , and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk , with Old Barley growling in the beam , -- that I would not have undone the engagement between her and Herbert for all the money in the pocket-book I had never opened .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 50]: I was looking at her with pleasure and admiration , when suddenly the growl swelled into a roar again , and a frightful bumping noise was heard above , as if a giant with a wooden leg were trying to bore it through the ceiling to come at us .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 15]: Upon this Clara said to Herbert , `` Papa wants me , darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 4]: and ran away .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 11]: `` There is an unconscionable old shark for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 12]: `` What do you suppose he wants now , Handel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 15]: `` I do n't know , '' said I. `` Something to drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 6]: `` That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 14]: cried Herbert , as if I had made a guess of extraordinary merit .
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 15]: `` He keeps his grog ready mixed in a little tub on the table .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 16]: Wait a moment , and you 'll hear Clara lift him up to take some .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 5]: There he goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 11]: Another roar , with a prolonged shake at the end .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 19]: `` Now , '' said Herbert , as it was succeeded by silence , `` he 's drinking .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 26]: Now , '' said Herbert , as the growl resounded in the beam once more , `` he 's down again on his back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 16]: Clara returned soon afterwards , and Herbert accompanied me up stairs to see our charge .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 45]: As we passed Mr. Barley 's door , he was heard hoarsely muttering within , in a strain that rose and fell like wind , the following Refrain , in which I substitute good wishes for something quite the reverse : -- `` Ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 10]: Bless your eyes , here 's old Bill Barley .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 10]: Here 's old Bill Barley , bless your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 16]: Here 's old Bill Barley on the flat of his back , by the Lord .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 25]: Lying on the flat of his back like a drifting old dead flounder , here 's your old Bill Barley , bless your eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 2]: Ahoy !
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 4]: Bless you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 56]: In this strain of consolation , Herbert informed me the invisible Barley would commune with himself by the day and night together ; Often , while it was light , having , at the same time , one eye at a telescope which was fitted on his bed for the convenience of sweeping the river .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 35]: In his two cabin rooms at the top of the house , which were fresh and airy , and in which Mr. Barley was less audible than below , I found Provis comfortably settled .
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 48]: He expressed no alarm , and seemed to feel none that was worth mentioning ; but it struck me that he was softened , -- indefinably , for I could not have said how , and could never afterwards recall how when I tried , but certainly .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 26]: The opportunity that the day 's rest had given me for reflection had resulted in my fully determining to say nothing to him respecting Compeyson .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 25]: For anything I knew , his animosity towards the man might otherwise lead to his seeking him out and rushing on his own destruction .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 32]: Therefore , when Herbert and I sat down with him by his fire , I asked him first of all whether he relied on Wemmick 's judgment and sources of information ?
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 9]: `` Ay , ay , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 13]: he answered , with a grave nod , `` Jaggers knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 30]: `` Then , I have talked with Wemmick , '' said I , `` and have come to tell you what caution he gave me and what advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 78]: This I did accurately , with the reservation just mentioned ; and I told him how Wemmick had heard , in Newgate prison -LRB- whether from officers or prisoners I could not say -RRB- , that he was under some suspicion , and that my chambers had been watched ; how Wemmick had recommended his keeping close for a time , and my keeping away from him ; and what Wemmick had said about getting him abroad .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 34]: I added , that of course , when the time came , I should go with him , or should follow close upon him , as might be safest in Wemmick 's judgment .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 47]: What was to follow that I did not touch upon ; neither , indeed , was I at all clear or comfortable about it in my own mind , now that I saw him in that softer condition , and in declared peril for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 39]: As to altering my way of living by enlarging my expenses , I put it to him whether in our present unsettled and difficult circumstances , it would not be simply ridiculous , if it were no worse ?
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 13]: He could not deny this , and indeed was very reasonable throughout .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 21]: His coming back was a venture , he said , and he had always known it to be a venture .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 25]: He would do nothing to make it a desperate venture , and he had very little fear of his safety with such good help .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 37]: Herbert , who had been looking at the fire and pondering , here said that something had come into his thoughts arising out of Wemmick 's suggestion , which it might be worth while to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 23]: `` We are both good watermen , Handel , and could take him down the river ourselves when the right time comes .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 31]: No boat would then be hired for the purpose , and no boatmen ; that would save at least a chance of suspicion , and any chance is worth saving .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 42]: Never mind the season ; do n't you think it might be a good thing if you began at once to keep a boat at the Temple stairs , and were in the habit of rowing up and down the river ?
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 13]: You fall into that habit , and then who notices or minds ?
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 22]: Do it twenty or fifty times , and there is nothing special in your doing it the twenty-first or fifty-first . ''
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 13]: I liked this scheme , and Provis was quite elated by it .
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 30]: We agreed that it should be carried into execution , and that Provis should never recognize us if we came below Bridge , and rowed past Mill Pond Bank .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 32]: But we further agreed that he should pull down the blind in that part of his window which gave upon the east , whenever he saw us and all was right .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 42]: Our conference being now ended , and everything arranged , I rose to go ; remarking to Herbert that he and I had better not go home together , and that I would take half an hour 's start of him .
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 30]: `` I do n't like to leave you here , '' I said to Provis , `` though I can not doubt your being safer here than near me .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 4]: Good by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 31]: `` Dear boy , '' he answered , clasping my hands , `` I do n't know when we may meet again , and I do n't like good by .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 5]: Say good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 4]: `` Good night !
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 21]: Herbert will go regularly between us , and when the time comes you may be certain I shall be ready .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 7]: Good night , good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 36]: We thought it best that he should stay in his own rooms ; and we left him on the landing outside his door , holding a light over the stair-rail to light us down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 44]: Looking back at him , I thought of the first night of his return , when our positions were reversed , and when I little supposed my heart could ever be as heavy and anxious at parting from him as it was now .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 24]: Old Barley was growling and swearing when we repassed his door , with no appearance of having ceased or of meaning to cease .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 22]: When we got to the foot of the stairs , I asked Herbert whether he had preserved the name of Provis .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 14]: He replied , certainly not , and that the lodger was Mr. Campbell .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 44]: He also explained that the utmost known of Mr. Campbell there was , that he -LRB- Herbert -RRB- had Mr. Campbell consigned to him , and felt a strong personal interest in his being well cared for , and living a secluded life .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 35]: So , when we went into the parlor where Mrs. Whimple and Clara were seated at work , I said nothing of my own interest in Mr. Campbell , but kept it to myself .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 50]: When I had taken leave of the pretty , gentle , dark-eyed girl , and of the motherly woman who had not outlived her honest sympathy with a little affair of true love , I felt as if the Old Green Copper Ropewalk had grown quite a different place .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 40]: Old Barley might be as old as the hills , and might swear like a whole field of troopers , but there were redeeming youth and trust and hope enough in Chinks 's Basin to fill it to overflowing .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 18]: And then I thought of Estella , and of our parting , and went home very sadly .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 15]: All things were as quiet in the Temple as ever I had seen them .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 28]: The windows of the rooms on that side , lately occupied by Provis , were dark and still , and there was no lounger in Garden Court .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 27]: I walked past the fountain twice or thrice before I descended the steps that were between me and my rooms , but I was quite alone .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 29]: Herbert , coming to my bedside when he came in , -- for I went straight to bed , dispirited and fatigued , -- made the same report .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 36]: Opening one of the windows after that , he looked out into the moonlight , and told me that the pavement was a solemnly empty as the pavement of any cathedral at that same hour .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 10]: Next day I set myself to get the boat .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 29]: It was soon done , and the boat was brought round to the Temple stairs , and lay where I could reach her within a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 20]: Then , I began to go out as for training and practice : sometimes alone , sometimes with Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 28]: I was often out in cold , rain , and sleet , but nobody took much note of me after I had been out a few times .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 24]: At first , I kept above Blackfriars Bridge ; but as the hours of the tide changed , I took towards London Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 32]: It was Old London Bridge in those days , and at certain states of the tide there was a race and fall of water there which gave it a bad reputation .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 35]: But I knew well enough how to `` shoot ' the bridge after seeing it done , and so began to row about among the shipping in the Pool , and down to Erith .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 37]: The first time I passed Mill Pond Bank , Herbert and I were pulling a pair of oars ; and , both in going and returning , we saw the blind towards the east come down .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 29]: Herbert was rarely there less frequently than three times in a week , and he never brought me a single word of intelligence that was at all alarming .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 24]: Still , I knew that there was cause for alarm , and I could not get rid of the notion of being watched .
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 26]: Once received , it is a haunting idea ; how many undesigning persons I suspected of watching me , it would be hard to calculate .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 18]: In short , I was always full of fears for the rash man who was in hiding .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 44]: Herbert had sometimes said to me that he found it pleasant to stand at one of our windows after dark , when the tide was running down , and to think that it was flowing , with everything it bore , towards Clara .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 37]: But I thought with dread that it was flowing towards Magwitch , and that any black mark on its surface might be his pursuers , going swiftly , silently , and surely , to take him .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 10]: Chapter XLVII Some weeks passed without bringing any change .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 11]: We waited for Wemmick , and he made no sign .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 45]: If I had never known him out of Little Britain , and had never enjoyed the privilege of being on a familiar footing at the Castle , I might have doubted him ; not so for a moment , knowing him as I did .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 22]: My worldly affairs began to wear a gloomy appearance , and I was pressed for money by more than one creditor .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 37]: Even I myself began to know the want of money -LRB- I mean of ready money in my own pocket -RRB- , and to relieve it by converting some easily spared articles of jewelery into cash .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 30]: But I had quite determined that it would be a heartless fraud to take more money from my patron in the existing state of my uncertain thoughts and plans .
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 54]: Therefore , I had sent him the unopened pocket-book by Herbert , to hold in his own keeping , and I felt a kind of satisfaction -- whether it was a false kind or a true , I hardly know -- in not having profited by his generosity since his revelation of himself .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 17]: As the time wore on , an impression settled heavily upon me that Estella was married .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 43]: Fearful of having it confirmed , though it was all but a conviction , I avoided the newspapers , and begged Herbert -LRB- to whom I had confided the circumstances of our last interview -RRB- never to speak of her to me .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 28]: Why I hoarded up this last wretched little rag of the robe of hope that was rent and given to the winds , how do I know ?
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 24]: Why did you who read this , commit that not dissimilar inconsistency of your own last year , last month , last week ?
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 38]: It was an unhappy life that I lived ; and its one dominant anxiety , towering over all its other anxieties , like a high mountain above a range of mountains , never disappeared from my view .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 9]: Still , no new cause for fear arose .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 73]: Let me start from my bed as I would , with the terror fresh upon me that he was discovered ; let me sit listening , as I would with dread , for Herbert 's returning step at night , lest it should be fleeter than ordinary , and winged with evil news , -- for all that , and much more to like purpose , the round of things went on .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 31]: Condemned to inaction and a state of constant restlessness and suspense , I rowed about in my boat , and waited , waited , waited , as I best could .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 54]: There were states of the tide when , having been down the river , I could not get back through the eddy-chafed arches and starlings of old London Bridge ; then , I left my boat at a wharf near the Custom House , to be brought up afterwards to the Temple stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 26]: I was not averse to doing this , as it served to make me and my boat a commoner incident among the water-side people there .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 15]: From this slight occasion sprang two meetings that I have now to tell of .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 19]: One afternoon , late in the month of February , I came ashore at the wharf at dusk .
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 20]: I had pulled down as far as Greenwich with the ebb tide , and had turned with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 33]: It had been a fine bright day , but had become foggy as the sun dropped , and I had had to feel my way back among the shipping , pretty carefully .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 18]: Both in going and returning , I had seen the signal in his window , All well .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 52]: As it was a raw evening , and I was cold , I thought I would comfort myself with dinner at once ; and as I had hours of dejection and solitude before me if I went home to the Temple , I thought I would afterwards go to the play .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 31]: The theatre where Mr. Wopsle had achieved his questionable triumph was in that water-side neighborhood -LRB- it is nowhere now -RRB- , and to that theatre I resolved to go .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 27]: I was aware that Mr. Wopsle had not succeeded in reviving the Drama , but , on the contrary , had rather partaken of its decline .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 30]: He had been ominously heard of , through the play-bills , as a faithful Black , in connection with a little girl of noble birth , and a monkey .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 29]: And Herbert had seen him as a predatory Tartar of comic propensities , with a face like a red brick , and an outrageous hat all over bells .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 87]: I dined at what Herbert and I used to call a geographical chop-house , where there were maps of the world in porter-pot rims on every half-yard of the tablecloths , and charts of gravy on every one of the knives , -- to this day there is scarcely a single chop-house within the Lord Mayor 's dominions which is not geographical , -- and wore out the time in dozing over crumbs , staring at gas , and baking in a hot blast of dinners .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 14]: By and by , I roused myself , and went to the play .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 80]: There , I found a virtuous boatswain in His Majesty 's service , -- a most excellent man , though I could have wished his trousers not quite so tight in some places , and not quite so loose in others , -- who knocked all the little men 's hats over their eyes , though he was very generous and brave , and who would n't hear of anybody 's paying taxes , though he was very patriotic .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 70]: He had a bag of money in his pocket , like a pudding in the cloth , and on that property married a young person in bed-furniture , with great rejoicings ; the whole population of Portsmouth -LRB- nine in number at the last census -RRB- turning out on the beach to rub their own hands and shake everybody else 's , and sing `` Fill , fill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 138]: A certain dark-complexioned Swab , however , who would n't fill , or do anything else that was proposed to him , and whose heart was openly stated -LRB- by the boatswain -RRB- to be as black as his figure-head , proposed to two other Swabs to get all mankind into difficulties ; which was so effectually done -LRB- the Swab family having considerable political influence -RRB- that it took half the evening to set things right , and then it was only brought about through an honest little grocer with a white hat , black gaiters , and red nose , getting into a clock , with a gridiron , and listening , and coming out , and knocking everybody down from behind with the gridiron whom he could n't confute with what he had overheard .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 71]: This led to Mr. Wopsle 's -LRB- who had never been heard of before -RRB- coming in with a star and garter on , as a plenipotentiary of great power direct from the Admiralty , to say that the Swabs were all to go to prison on the spot , and that he had brought the boatswain down the Union Jack , as a slight acknowledgment of his public services .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 39]: The boatswain , unmanned for the first time , respectfully dried his eyes on the Jack , and then cheering up , and addressing Mr. Wopsle as Your Honor , solicited permission to take him by the fin .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 43]: Mr. Wopsle , conceding his fin with a gracious dignity , was immediately shoved into a dusty corner , while everybody danced a hornpipe ; and from that corner , surveying the public with a discontented eye , became aware of me .
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 76]: The second piece was the last new grand comic Christmas pantomime , in the first scene of which , it pained me to suspect that I detected Mr. Wopsle with red worsted legs under a highly magnified phosphoric countenance and a shock of red curtain-fringe for his hair , engaged in the manufacture of thunderbolts in a mine , and displaying great cowardice when his gigantic master came home -LRB- very hoarse -RRB- to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 104]: But he presently presented himself under worthier circumstances ; for , the Genius of Youthful Love being in want of assistance , -- on account of the parental brutality of an ignorant farmer who opposed the choice of his daughter 's heart , by purposely falling upon the object , in a flour-sack , out of the first-floor window , -- summoned a sententious Enchanter ; and he , coming up from the antipodes rather unsteadily , after an apparently violent journey , proved to be Mr. Wopsle in a high-crowned hat , with a necromantic work in one volume under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 43]: The business of this enchanter on earth being principally to be talked at , sung at , butted at , danced at , and flashed at with fires of various colors , he had a good deal of time on his hands .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 25]: And I observed , with great surprise , that he devoted it to staring in my direction as if he were lost in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 42]: There was something so remarkable in the increasing glare of Mr. Wopsle 's eye , and he seemed to be turning so many things over in his mind and to grow so confused , that I could not make it out .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 27]: I sat thinking of it long after he had ascended to the clouds in a large watch-case , and still I could not make it out .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 27]: I was still thinking of it when I came out of the theatre an hour afterwards , and found him waiting for me near the door .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 7]: `` How do you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 15]: said I , shaking hands with him as we turned down the street together .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 9]: `` I saw that you saw me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 8]: `` Saw you , Mr. Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 9]: `` Yes , of course I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 7]: But who else was there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 5]: `` Who else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 29]: `` It is the strangest thing , '' said Mr. Wopsle , drifting into his lost look again ; `` and yet I could swear to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 12]: Becoming alarmed , I entreated Mr. Wopsle to explain his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 42]: `` Whether I should have noticed him at first but for your being there , '' said Mr. Wopsle , going on in the same lost way , `` I ca n't be positive ; yet I think I should . ''
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 28]: Involuntarily I looked round me , as I was accustomed to look round me when I went home ; for these mysterious words gave me a chill .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 12]: He ca n't be in sight , '' said Mr. Wopsle .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 9]: `` He went out before I went off .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 6]: I saw him go . ''
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 17]: Having the reason that I had for being suspicious , I even suspected this poor actor .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 11]: I mistrusted a design to entrap me into some admission .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 15]: Therefore I glanced at him as we walked on together , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 36]: `` I had a ridiculous fancy that he must be with you , Mr. Pip , till I saw that you were quite unconscious of him , sitting behind you there like a ghost . ''
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 41]: My former chill crept over me again , but I was resolved not to speak yet , for it was quite consistent with his words that he might be set on to induce me to connect these references with Provis .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 16]: Of course , I was perfectly sure and safe that Provis had not been there .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 19]: `` I dare say you wonder at me , Mr. Pip ; indeed , I see you do .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 7]: But it is so very strange !
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 12]: You 'll hardly believe what I am going to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 13]: I could hardly believe it myself , if you told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 7]: said I. `` No , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 43]: Mr. Pip , you remember in old times a certain Christmas Day , when you were quite a child , and I dined at Gargery 's , and some soldiers came to the door to get a pair of handcuffs mended ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 8]: `` I remember it very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 49]: `` And you remember that there was a chase after two convicts , and that we joined in it , and that Gargery took you on his back , and that I took the lead , and you kept up with me as well as you could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 9]: `` I remember it all very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 11]: Better than he thought , -- except the last clause .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 44]: `` And you remember that we came up with the two in a ditch , and that there was a scuffle between them , and that one of them had been severely handled and much mauled about the face by the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 9]: `` I see it all before me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 71]: `` And that the soldiers lighted torches , and put the two in the centre , and that we went on to see the last of them , over the black marshes , with the torchlight shining on their faces , -- I am particular about that , -- with the torchlight shining on their faces , when there was an outer ring of dark night all about us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' said I. `` I remember all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 16]: `` Then , Mr. Pip , one of those two prisoners sat behind you tonight .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 8]: I saw him over your shoulder . ''
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 4]: `` Steady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 3]: I thought .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 17]: I asked him then , `` Which of the two do you suppose you saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 22]: `` The one who had been mauled , '' he answered readily , `` and I 'll swear I saw him !
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 16]: The more I think of him , the more certain I am of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 7]: `` This is very curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 19]: said I , with the best assumption I could put on of its being nothing more to me .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 6]: `` Very curious indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 35]: I can not exaggerate the enhanced disquiet into which this conversation threw me , or the special and peculiar terror I felt at Compeyson 's having been behind me `` like a ghost . ''
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 77]: For if he had ever been out of my thoughts for a few moments together since the hiding had begun , it was in those very moments when he was closest to me ; and to think that I should be so unconscious and off my guard after all my care was as if I had shut an avenue of a hundred doors to keep him out , and then had found him at my elbow .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 39]: I could not doubt , either , that he was there , because I was there , and that , however slight an appearance of danger there might be about us , danger was always near and active .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 16]: I put such questions to Mr. Wopsle as , When did the man come in ?
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 20]: He could not tell me that ; he saw me , and over my shoulder he saw the man .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 44]: It was not until he had seen him for some time that he began to identify him ; but he had from the first vaguely associated him with me , and known him as somehow belonging to me in the old village time .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 5]: How was he dressed ?
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 13]: Prosperously , but not noticeably otherwise ; he thought , in black .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 7]: Was his face at all disfigured ?
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 6]: No , he believed not .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 40]: I believed not too , for , although in my brooding state I had taken no especial notice of the people behind me , I thought it likely that a face at all disfigured would have attracted my attention .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 38]: When Mr. Wopsle had imparted to me all that he could recall or I extract , and when I had treated him to a little appropriate refreshment , after the fatigues of the evening , we parted .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 19]: It was between twelve and one o'clock when I reached the Temple , and the gates were shut .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 13]: No one was near me when I went in and went home .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 16]: Herbert had come in , and we held a very serious council by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 32]: But there was nothing to be done , saving to communicate to Wemmick what I had that night found out , and to remind him that we waited for his hint .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 24]: As I thought that I might compromise him if I went too often to the Castle , I made this communication by letter .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 24]: I wrote it before I went to bed , and went out and posted it ; and again no one was near me .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 15]: Herbert and I agreed that we could do nothing else but be very cautious .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 53]: And we were very cautious indeed , -- more cautious than before , if that were possible , -- and I for my part never went near Chinks 's Basin , except when I rowed by , and then I only looked at Mill Pond Bank as I looked at anything else .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 22]: Chapter XLVIII The second of the two meetings referred to in the last chapter occurred about a week after the first .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 68]: I had again left my boat at the wharf below Bridge ; the time was an hour earlier in the afternoon ; and , undecided where to dine , I had strolled up into Cheapside , and was strolling along it , surely the most unsettled person in all the busy concourse , when a large hand was laid upon my shoulder by some one overtaking me .
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 15]: It was Mr. Jaggers 's hand , and he passed it through my arm .
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 17]: `` As we are going in the same direction , Pip , we may walk together .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 7]: Where are you bound for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 18]: `` For the Temple , I think , '' said I. `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 35]: `` Well , '' I returned , glad for once to get the better of him in cross-examination , `` I do not know , for I have not made up my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 8]: `` You are going to dine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 12]: `` You do n't mind admitting that , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 16]: `` No , '' I returned , `` I do n't mind admitting that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 7]: `` And are not engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 14]: `` I do n't mind admitting also that I am not engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 16]: `` Then , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` come and dine with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 17]: I was going to excuse myself , when he added , `` Wemmick 's coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 107]: So I changed my excuse into an acceptance , -- the few words I had uttered , serving for the beginning of either , -- and we went along Cheapside and slanted off to Little Britain , while the lights were springing up brilliantly in the shop windows , and the street lamp-lighters , scarcely finding ground enough to plant their ladders on in the midst of the afternoon 's bustle , were skipping up and down and running in and out , opening more red eyes in the gathering fog than my rushlight tower at the Hummums had opened white eyes in the ghostly wall .
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 27]: At the office in Little Britain there was the usual letter-writing , hand-washing , candle-snuffing , and safe-locking , that closed the business of the day .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 73]: As I stood idle by Mr. Jaggers 's fire , its rising and falling flame made the two casts on the shelf look as if they were playing a diabolical game at bo-peep with me ; while the pair of coarse , fat office candles that dimly lighted Mr. Jaggers as he wrote in a corner were decorated with dirty winding-sheets , as if in remembrance of a host of hanged clients .
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 27]: We went to Gerrard Street , all three together , in a hackney-coach : And , as soon as we got there , dinner was served .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 48]: Although I should not have thought of making , in that place , the most distant reference by so much as a look to Wemmick 's Walworth sentiments , yet I should have had no objection to catching his eye now and then in a friendly way .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 8]: But it was not to be done .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 37]: He turned his eyes on Mr. Jaggers whenever he raised them from the table , and was as dry and distant to me as if there were twin Wemmicks , and this was the wrong one .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 17]: `` Did you send that note of Miss Havisham 's to Mr. Pip , Wemmick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 10]: Mr. Jaggers asked , soon after we began dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 25]: `` No , sir , '' returned Wemmick ; `` it was going by post , when you brought Mr. Pip into the office .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 5]: Here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 11]: He handed it to his principal instead of to me .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 39]: `` It 's a note of two lines , Pip , '' said Mr. Jaggers , handing it on , `` sent up to me by Miss Havisham on account of her not being sure of your address .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 20]: She tells me that she wants to see you on a little matter of business you mentioned to her .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 6]: You 'll go down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 21]: `` Yes , '' said I , casting my eyes over the note , which was exactly in those terms .
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 10]: `` When do you think of going down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 33]: `` I have an impending engagement , '' said I , glancing at Wemmick , who was putting fish into the post-office , `` that renders me rather uncertain of my time .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 7]: At once , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 31]: `` If Mr. Pip has the intention of going at once , '' said Wemmick to Mr. Jaggers , `` he need n't write an answer , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 25]: Receiving this as an intimation that it was best not to delay , I settled that I would go to-morrow , and said so .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 23]: Wemmick drank a glass of wine , and looked with a grimly satisfied air at Mr. Jaggers , but not at me .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 5]: `` So , Pip !
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 16]: Our friend the Spider , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` has played his cards .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 7]: He has won the pool . ''
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 11]: It was as much as I could do to assent .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 3]: `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 21]: He is a promising fellow -- in his way -- but he may not have it all his own way .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 18]: The stronger will win in the end , but the stronger has to be found out first .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 43]: If he should turn to , and beat her -- '' `` Surely , '' I interrupted , with a burning face and heart , `` you do not seriously think that he is scoundrel enough for that , Mr. Jaggers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 9]: `` I did n't say so , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 6]: I am putting a case .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 33]: If he should turn to and beat her , he may possibly get the strength on his side ; if it should be a question of intellect , he certainly will not .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 32]: It would be chance work to give an opinion how a fellow of that sort will turn out in such circumstances , because it 's a toss-up between two results . ''
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 9]: `` May I ask what they are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 20]: `` A fellow like our friend the Spider , '' answered Mr. Jaggers , `` either beats or cringes .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 19]: He may cringe and growl , or cringe and not growl ; but he either beats or cringes .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 6]: Ask Wemmick his opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 18]: `` Either beats or cringes , '' said Wemmick , not at all addressing himself to me .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 49]: `` So here 's to Mrs. Bentley Drummle , '' said Mr. Jaggers , taking a decanter of choicer wine from his dumb-waiter , and filling for each of us and for himself , `` and may the question of supremacy be settled to the lady 's satisfaction !
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 15]: To the satisfaction of the lady and the gentleman , it never will be .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 17]: Now , Molly , Molly , Molly , Molly , how slow you are to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 17]: She was at his elbow when he addressed her , putting a dish upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 21]: As she withdrew her hands from it , she fell back a step or two , nervously muttering some excuse .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 16]: And a certain action of her fingers , as she spoke , arrested my attention .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 20]: Only the subject we were speaking of , '' said I , `` was rather painful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 12]: The action of her fingers was like the action of knitting .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 35]: She stood looking at her master , not understanding whether she was free to go , or whether he had more to say to her and would call her back if she did go .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 6]: Her look was very intent .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 18]: Surely , I had seen exactly such eyes and such hands on a memorable occasion very lately !
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 12]: He dismissed her , and she glided out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 14]: But she remained before me as plainly as if she were still there .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 56]: I looked at those hands , I looked at those eyes , I looked at that flowing hair ; and I compared them with other hands , other eyes , other hair , that I knew of , and with what those might be after twenty years of a brutal husband and a stormy life .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 42]: I looked again at those hands and eyes of the housekeeper , and thought of the inexplicable feeling that had come over me when I last walked -- not alone -- in the ruined garden , and through the deserted brewery .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 66]: I thought how the same feeling had come back when I saw a face looking at me , and a hand waving to me from a stage-coach window ; and how it had come back again and had flashed about me like lightning , when I had passed in a carriage -- not alone -- through a sudden glare of light in a dark street .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 56]: I thought how one link of association had helped that identification in the theatre , and how such a link , wanting before , had been riveted for me now , when I had passed by a chance swift from Estella 's name to the fingers with their knitting action , and the attentive eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 13]: And I felt absolutely certain that this woman was Estella 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 26]: Mr. Jaggers had seen me with Estella , and was not likely to have missed the sentiments I had been at no pains to conceal .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 31]: He nodded when I said the subject was painful to me , clapped me on the back , put round the wine again , and went on with his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 27]: Only twice more did the housekeeper reappear , and then her stay in the room was very short , and Mr. Jaggers was sharp with her .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 41]: But her hands were Estella 's hands , and her eyes were Estella 's eyes , and if she had reappeared a hundred times I could have been neither more sure nor less sure that my conviction was the truth .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 57]: It was a dull evening , for Wemmick drew his wine , when it came round , quite as a matter of business , -- just as he might have drawn his salary when that came round , -- and with his eyes on his chief , sat in a state of perpetual readiness for cross-examination .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 24]: As to the quantity of wine , his post-office was as indifferent and ready as any other post-office for its quantity of letters .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 24]: From my point of view , he was the wrong twin all the time , and only externally like the Wemmick of Walworth .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 10]: We took our leave early , and left together .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 72]: Even when we were groping among Mr. Jaggers 's stock of boots for our hats , I felt that the right twin was on his way back ; and we had not gone half a dozen yards down Gerrard Street in the Walworth direction , before I found that I was walking arm in arm with the right twin , and that the wrong twin had evaporated into the evening air .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 8]: said Wemmick , `` that 's over !
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 36]: He 's a wonderful man , without his living likeness ; but I feel that I have to screw myself up when I dine with him , -- and I dine more comfortably unscrewed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 17]: I felt that this was a good statement of the case , and told him so .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 14]: `` Would n't say it to anybody but yourself , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 16]: `` I know that what is said between you and me goes no further . ''
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 18]: I asked him if he had ever seen Miss Havisham 's adopted daughter , Mrs. Bentley Drummle .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 4]: He said no .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 17]: To avoid being too abrupt , I then spoke of the Aged and of Miss Skiffins .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 37]: He looked rather sly when I mentioned Miss Skiffins , and stopped in the street to blow his nose , with a roll of the head , and a flourish not quite free from latent boastfulness .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 31]: `` Wemmick , '' said I , `` do you remember telling me , before I first went to Mr. Jaggers 's private house , to notice that housekeeper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 3]: he replied .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 9]: `` Ah , I dare say I did .
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 16]: Deuce take me , '' he added , suddenly , `` I know I did .
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 10]: I find I am not quite unscrewed yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 11]: `` A wild beast tamed , you called her . ''
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 9]: `` And what do you call her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 4]: `` The same .
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 10]: How did Mr. Jaggers tame her , Wemmick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 6]: `` That 's his secret .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 11]: She has been with him many a long year . ''
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 10]: `` I wish you would tell me her story .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 11]: I feel a particular interest in being acquainted with it .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 15]: You know that what is said between you and me goes no further . ''
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 23]: Wemmick replied , `` I do n't know her story , -- that is , I do n't know all of it .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 10]: But what I do know I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 13]: We are in our private and personal capacities , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 5]: `` Of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 24]: `` A score or so of years ago , that woman was tried at the Old Bailey for murder , and was acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 18]: She was a very handsome young woman , and I believe had some gypsy blood in her .
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 17]: Anyhow , it was hot enough when it was up , as you may suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 7]: `` But she was acquitted . ''
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 29]: `` Mr. Jaggers was for her , '' pursued Wemmick , with a look full of meaning , `` and worked the case in a way quite astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 37]: It was a desperate case , and it was comparatively early days with him then , and he worked it to general admiration ; in fact , it may almost be said to have made him .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 51]: He worked it himself at the police-office , day after day for many days , contending against even a committal ; and at the trial where he could n't work it himself , sat under counsel , and -- every one knew -- put in all the salt and pepper .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 25]: The murdered person was a woman , -- a woman a good ten years older , very much larger , and very much stronger .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 7]: It was a case of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 43]: They both led tramping lives , and this woman in Gerrard Street here had been married very young , over the broomstick -LRB- as we say -RRB- , to a tramping man , and was a perfect fury in point of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 29]: The murdered woman , -- more a match for the man , certainly , in point of years -- was found dead in a barn near Hounslow Heath .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 11]: There had been a violent struggle , perhaps a fight .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 22]: She was bruised and scratched and torn , and had been held by the throat , at last , and choked .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 34]: Now , there was no reasonable evidence to implicate any person but this woman , and on the improbabilities of her having been able to do it Mr. Jaggers principally rested his case .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 35]: You may be sure , '' said Wemmick , touching me on the sleeve , `` that he never dwelt upon the strength of her hands then , though he sometimes does now . ''
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 18]: I had told Wemmick of his showing us her wrists , that day of the dinner party .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 6]: `` Well , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 15]: Wemmick went on ; `` it happened -- happened , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 49]: -- that this woman was so very artfully dressed from the time of her apprehension , that she looked much slighter than she really was ; in particular , her sleeves are always remembered to have been so skilfully contrived that her arms had quite a delicate look .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 36]: She had only a bruise or two about her , -- nothing for a tramp , -- but the backs of her hands were lacerated , and the question was , Was it with finger-nails ?
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 94]: Now , Mr. Jaggers showed that she had struggled through a great lot of brambles which were not as high as her face ; but which she could not have got through and kept her hands out of ; and bits of those brambles were actually found in her skin and put in evidence , as well as the fact that the brambles in question were found on examination to have been broken through , and to have little shreds of her dress and little spots of blood upon them here and there .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 59]: But the boldest point he made was this : it was attempted to be set up , in proof of her jealousy , that she was under strong suspicion of having , at about the time of the murder , frantically destroyed her child by this man -- some three years old -- to revenge herself upon him .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 30]: Mr. Jaggers worked that in this way : `` We say these are not marks of finger-nails , but marks of brambles , and we show you the brambles .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 20]: You say they are marks of finger-nails , and you set up the hypothesis that she destroyed her child .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 9]: You must accept all consequences of that hypothesis .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 25]: For anything we know , she may have destroyed her child , and the child in clinging to her may have scratched her hands .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 3]: What then ?
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 17]: You are not trying her for the murder of her child ; why do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 41]: As to this case , if you will have scratches , we say that , for anything we know , you may have accounted for them , assuming for the sake of argument that you have not invented them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 27]: To sum up , sir , '' said Wemmick , `` Mr. Jaggers was altogether too many for the jury , and they gave in . ''
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 11]: `` Has she been in his service ever since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 29]: `` Yes ; but not only that , '' said Wemmick , `` she went into his service immediately after her acquittal , tamed as she is now .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 25]: She has since been taught one thing and another in the way of her duties , but she was tamed from the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 11]: `` Do you remember the sex of the child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 9]: `` Said to have been a girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 12]: `` You have nothing more to say to me to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 8]: I got your letter and destroyed it .
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 3]: Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 26]: We exchanged a cordial good-night , and I went home , with new matter for my thoughts , though with no relief from the old .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 51]: Chapter XLIX Putting Miss Havisham 's note in my pocket , that it might serve as my credentials for so soon reappearing at Satis House , in case her waywardness should lead her to express any surprise at seeing me , I went down again by the coach next day .
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 43]: But I alighted at the Halfway House , and breakfasted there , and walked the rest of the distance ; for I sought to get into the town quietly by the unfrequented ways , and to leave it in the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 21]: The best light of the day was gone when I passed along the quiet echoing courts behind the High Street .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 45]: The nooks of ruin where the old monks had once had their refectories and gardens , and where the strong walls were now pressed into the service of humble sheds and stables , were almost as silent as the old monks in their graves .
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 92]: The cathedral chimes had at once a sadder and a more remote sound to me , as I hurried on avoiding observation , than they had ever had before ; so , the swell of the old organ was borne to my ears like funeral music ; and the rooks , as they hovered about the gray tower and swung in the bare high trees of the priory garden , seemed to call to me that the place was changed , and that Estella was gone out of it for ever .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 29]: An elderly woman , whom I had seen before as one of the servants who lived in the supplementary house across the back courtyard , opened the gate .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 25]: The lighted candle stood in the dark passage within , as of old , and I took it up and ascended the staircase alone .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 19]: Miss Havisham was not in her own room , but was in the larger room across the landing .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 37]: Looking in at the door , after knocking in vain , I saw her sitting on the hearth in a ragged chair , close before , and lost in the contemplation of , the ashy fire .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 29]: Doing as I had often done , I went in , and stood touching the old chimney-piece , where she could see me when she raised her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 33]: There was an air or utter loneliness upon her , that would have moved me to pity though she had wilfully done me a deeper injury than I could charge her with .
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 38]: As I stood compassionating her , and thinking how , in the progress of time , I too had come to be a part of the wrecked fortunes of that house , her eyes rested on me .
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 16]: She stared , and said in a low voice , `` Is it real ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 7]: `` It is I , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 16]: Mr. Jaggers gave me your note yesterday , and I have lost no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 4]: Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 32]: As I brought another of the ragged chairs to the hearth and sat down , I remarked a new expression on her face , as if she were afraid of me .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 34]: `` I want , '' she said , `` to pursue that subject you mentioned to me when you were last here , and to show you that I am not all stone .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 19]: But perhaps you can never believe , now , that there is anything human in my heart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 42]: When I said some reassuring words , she stretched out her tremulous right hand , as though she was going to touch me ; but she recalled it again before I understood the action , or knew how to receive it .
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 22]: `` You said , speaking for your friend , that you could tell me how to do something useful and good .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 12]: Something that you would like done , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 11]: `` Something that I would like done very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 12]: I began explaining to her that secret history of the partnership .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 32]: I had not got far into it , when I judged from her looks that she was thinking in a discursive way of me , rather than of what I said .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 27]: It seemed to be so ; for , when I stopped speaking , many moments passed before she showed that she was conscious of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 36]: `` Do you break off , '' she asked then , with her former air of being afraid of me , `` because you hate me too much to bear to speak to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 19]: `` No , no , '' I answered , `` how can you think so , Miss Havisham !
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 14]: I stopped because I thought you were not following what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 17]: `` Perhaps I was not , '' she answered , putting a hand to her head .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 12]: `` Begin again , and let me look at something else .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 5]: Now tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 33]: She set her hand upon her stick in the resolute way that sometimes was habitual to her , and looked at the fire with a strong expression of forcing herself to attend .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 31]: I went on with my explanation , and told her how I had hoped to complete the transaction out of my means , but how in this I was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 30]: That part of the subject -LRB- I reminded her -RRB- involved matters which could form no part of my explanation , for they were the weighty secrets of another .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 14]: said she , assenting with her head , but not looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 13]: `` And how much money is wanting to complete the purchase ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 15]: I was rather afraid of stating it , for it sounded a large sum .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 6]: `` Nine hundred pounds . ''
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 24]: `` If I give you the money for this purpose , will you keep my secret as you have kept your own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 6]: `` Quite as faithfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 11]: `` And your mind will be more at rest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 7]: `` Much more at rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 8]: `` Are you very unhappy now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 19]: She asked this question , still without looking at me , but in an unwonted tone of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 14]: I could not reply at the moment , for my voice failed me .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 20]: She put her left arm across the head of her stick , and softly laid her forehead on it .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 23]: `` I am far from happy , Miss Havisham ; but I have other causes of disquiet than any you know of .
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 9]: They are the secrets I have mentioned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 17]: After a little while , she raised her head , and looked at the fire Again .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 22]: `` It is noble in you to tell me that you have other causes of unhappiness , Is it true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 5]: `` Too true . ''
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 14]: `` Can I only serve you , Pip , by serving your friend ?
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 16]: Regarding that as done , is there nothing I can do for you yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 7]: I thank you for the question .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 12]: I thank you even more for the tone of the question .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 6]: But there is nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 19]: She presently rose from her seat , and looked about the blighted room for the means of writing .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 42]: There were none there , and she took from her pocket a yellow set of ivory tablets , mounted in tarnished gold , and wrote upon them with a pencil in a case of tarnished gold that hung from her neck .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 12]: `` You are still on friendly terms with Mr. Jaggers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 3]: `` Quite .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 7]: I dined with him yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 24]: `` This is an authority to him to pay you that money , to lay out at your irresponsible discretion for your friend .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 27]: I keep no money here ; but if you would rather Mr. Jaggers knew nothing of the matter , I will send it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 20]: `` Thank you , Miss Havisham ; I have not the least objection to receiving it from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 33]: She read me what she had written ; and it was direct and clear , and evidently intended to absolve me from any suspicion of profiting by the receipt of the money .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 36]: I took the tablets from her hand , and it trembled again , and it trembled more as she took off the chain to which the pencil was attached , and put it in mine .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 9]: All this she did without looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 9]: `` My name is on the first leaf .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 30]: If you can ever write under my name , `` I forgive her , '' though ever so long after my broken heart is dust pray do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 16]: `` O Miss Havisham , '' said I , `` I can do it now .
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 34]: There have been sore mistakes ; and my life has been a blind and thankless one ; and I want forgiveness and direction far too much , to be bitter with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 76]: She turned her face to me for the first time since she had averted it , and , to my amazement , I may even add to my terror , dropped on her knees at my feet ; with her folded hands raised to me in the manner in which , when her poor heart was young and fresh and whole , they must often have been raised to heaven from her mother 's side .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 24]: To see her with her white hair and her worn face kneeling at my feet gave me a shock through all my frame .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 41]: I entreated her to rise , and got my arms about her to help her up ; but she only pressed that hand of mine which was nearest to her grasp , and hung her head over it and wept .
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 30]: I had never seen her shed a tear before , and , in the hope that the relief might do her good , I bent over her without speaking .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 13]: She was not kneeling now , but was down upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 4]: `` O ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 5]: she cried , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 6]: `` What have I done !
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 6]: What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 20]: `` If you mean , Miss Havisham , what have you done to injure me , let me answer .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 3]: Very little .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 9]: I should have loved her under any circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 5]: Is she married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 19]: It was a needless question , for a new desolation in the desolate house had told me so .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 6]: `` What have I done !
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 6]: What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 21]: She wrung her hands , and crushed her white hair , and returned to this cry over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 7]: `` What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 13]: I knew not how to answer , or how to comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 37]: That she had done a grievous thing in taking an impressionable child to mould into the form that her wild resentment , spurned affection , and wounded pride found vengeance in , I knew full well .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 69]: But that , in shutting out the light of day , she had shut out infinitely more ; that , in seclusion , she had secluded herself from a thousand natural and healing influences ; that , her mind , brooding solitary , had grown diseased , as all minds do and must and will that reverse the appointed order of their Maker , I knew equally well .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 71]: And could I look upon her without compassion , seeing her punishment in the ruin she was , in her profound unfitness for this earth on which she was placed , in the vanity of sorrow which had become a master mania , like the vanity of penitence , the vanity of remorse , the vanity of unworthiness , and other monstrous vanities that have been curses in this world ?
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 36]: `` Until you spoke to her the other day , and until I saw in you a looking-glass that showed me what I once felt myself , I did not know what I had done .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 5]: What have I done !
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 6]: What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 15]: And so again , twenty , fifty times over , What had she done !
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 26]: `` Miss Havisham , '' I said , when her cry had died away , `` you may dismiss me from your mind and conscience .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 51]: But Estella is a different case , and if you can ever undo any scrap of what you have done amiss in keeping a part of her right nature away from her , it will be better to do that than to bemoan the past through a hundred years . ''
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 9]: `` Yes , yes , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 8]: But , Pip -- my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 13]: There was an earnest womanly compassion for me in her new affection .
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 4]: `` My dear !
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 21]: Believe this : when she first came to me , I meant to save her from misery like my own .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 9]: At first , I meant no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 8]: said I. `` I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 66]: `` But as she grew , and promised to be very beautiful , I gradually did worse , and with my praises , and with my jewels , and with my teachings , and with this figure of myself always before her , a warning to back and point my lessons , I stole her heart away , and put ice in its place . ''
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 27]: `` Better , '' I could not help saying , `` to have left her a natural heart , even to be bruised or broken . ''
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 24]: With that , Miss Havisham looked distractedly at me for a while , and then burst out again , What had she done !
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 28]: `` If you knew all my story , '' she pleaded , `` you would have some compassion for me and a better understanding of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 39]: `` Miss Havisham , '' I answered , as delicately as I could , `` I believe I may say that I do know your story , and have known it ever since I first left this neighborhood .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 18]: It has inspired me with great commiseration , and I hope I understand it and its influences .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 19]: Does what has passed between us give me any excuse for asking you a question relative to Estella ?
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 16]: Not as she is , but as she was when she first came here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 22]: She was seated on the ground , with her arms on the ragged chair , and her head leaning on them .
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 18]: She looked full at me when I said this , and replied , `` Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 7]: `` Whose child was Estella ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 7]: `` You do n't know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 6]: She shook her head again .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 14]: `` But Mr. Jaggers brought her here , or sent her here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 6]: `` Brought her here . ''
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 11]: `` Will you tell me how that came about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 61]: She answered in a low whisper and with caution : `` I had been shut up in these rooms a long time -LRB- I do n't know how long ; you know what time the clocks keep here -RRB- , when I told him that I wanted a little girl to rear and love , and save from my fate .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 33]: I had first seen him when I sent for him to lay this place waste for me ; having read of him in the newspapers , before I and the world parted .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 15]: He told me that he would look about him for such an orphan child .
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 15]: One night he brought her here asleep , and I called her Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 9]: `` Might I ask her age then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 5]: `` Two or three .
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 18]: She herself knows nothing , but that she was left an orphan and I adopted her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 26]: So convinced I was of that woman 's being her mother , that I wanted no evidence to establish the fact in my own mind .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 17]: But , to any mind , I thought , the connection here was clear and straight .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 12]: What more could I hope to do by prolonging the interview ?
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 32]: I had succeeded on behalf of Herbert , Miss Havisham had told me all she knew of Estella , I had said and done what I could to ease her mind .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 12]: No matter with what other words we parted ; we parted .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 14]: Twilight was closing in when I went down stairs into the natural air .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 32]: I called to the woman who had opened the gate when I entered , that I would not trouble her just yet , but would walk round the place before leaving .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 29]: For I had a presentiment that I should never be there again , and I felt that the dying light was suited to my last view of it .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 54]: By the wilderness of casks that I had walked on long ago , and on which the rain of years had fallen since , rotting them in many places , and leaving miniature swamps and pools of water upon those that stood on end , I made my way to the ruined garden .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 30]: I went all round it ; round by the corner where Herbert and I had fought our battle ; round by the paths where Estella and I had walked .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 10]: So cold , so lonely , so dreary all !
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 28]: Taking the brewery on my way back , I raised the rusty latch of a little door at the garden end of it , and walked through .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 52]: I was going out at the opposite door , -- not easy to open now , for the damp wood had started and swelled , and the hinges were yielding , and the threshold was encumbered with a growth of fungus , -- when I turned my head to look back .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 28]: A childish association revived with wonderful force in the moment of the slight action , and I fancied that I saw Miss Havisham hanging to the beam .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 37]: So strong was the impression , that I stood under the beam shuddering from head to foot before I knew it was a fancy , -- though to be sure I was there in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 52]: The mournfulness of the place and time , and the great terror of this illusion , though it was but momentary , caused me to feel an indescribable awe as I came out between the open wooden gates where I had once wrung my hair after Estella had wrung my heart .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 52]: Passing on into the front courtyard , I hesitated whether to call the woman to let me out at the locked gate of which she had the key , or first to go up stairs and assure myself that Miss Havisham was as safe and well as I had left her .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 9]: I took the latter course and went up .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 34]: I looked into the room where I had left her , and I saw her seated in the ragged chair upon the hearth close to the fire , with her back towards me .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 23]: In the moment when I was withdrawing my head to go quietly away , I saw a great flaming light spring up .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 38]: In the same moment I saw her running at me , shrieking , with a whirl of fire blazing all about her , and soaring at least as many feet above her head as she was high .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 15]: I had a double-caped great-coat on , and over my arm another thick coat .
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 111]: That I got them off , closed with her , threw her down , and got them over her ; that I dragged the great cloth from the table for the same purpose , and with it dragged down the heap of rottenness in the midst , and all the ugly things that sheltered there ; that we were on the ground struggling like desperate enemies , and that the closer I covered her , the more wildly she shrieked and tried to free herself , -- that this occurred I knew through the result , but not through anything I felt , or thought , or knew I did .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 44]: I knew nothing until I knew that we were on the floor by the great table , and that patches of tinder yet alight were floating in the smoky air , which , a moment ago , had been her faded bridal dress .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 30]: Then , I looked round and saw the disturbed beetles and spiders running away over the floor , and the servants coming in with breathless cries at the door .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 74]: I still held her forcibly down with all my strength , like a prisoner who might escape ; and I doubt if I even knew who she was , or why we had struggled , or that she had been in flames , or that the flames were out , until I saw the patches of tinder that had been her garments no longer alight but falling in a black shower around us .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 17]: She was insensible , and I was afraid to have her moved , or even touched .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 42]: Assistance was sent for , and I held her until it came , as if I unreasonably fancied -LRB- I think I did -RRB- that , if I let her go , the fire would break out again and consume her .
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 42]: When I got up , on the surgeon 's coming to her with other aid , I was astonished to see that both my hands were burnt ; for , I had no knowledge of it through the sense of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 31]: On examination it was pronounced that she had received serious hurts , but that they of themselves were far from hopeless ; the danger lay mainly in the nervous shock .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 33]: By the surgeon 's directions , her bed was carried into that room and laid upon the great table , which happened to be well suited to the dressing of her injuries .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 36]: When I saw her again , an hour afterwards , she lay , indeed , where I had seen her strike her stick , and had heard her say that she would lie one day .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 66]: Though every vestige of her dress was burnt , as they told me , she still had something of her old ghastly bridal appearance ; for , they had covered her to the throat with white cotton-wool , and as she lay with a white sheet loosely overlying that , the phantom air of something that had been and was changed was still upon her .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 33]: I found , on questioning the servants , that Estella was in Paris , and I got a promise from the surgeon that he would write to her by the next post .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 31]: Miss Havisham 's family I took upon myself ; intending to communicate with Mr. Matthew Pocket only , and leave him to do as he liked about informing the rest .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 17]: This I did next day , through Herbert , as soon as I returned to town .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 24]: There was a stage , that evening , when she spoke collectedly of what had happened , though with a certain terrible vivacity .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 35]: Towards midnight she began to wander in her speech ; and after that it gradually set in that she said innumerable times in a low solemn voice , `` What have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 20]: And then , `` When she first came , I meant to save her from misery like mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 20]: And then , `` Take the pencil and write under my name , ` I forgive her ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 43]: She never changed the order of these three sentences , but she sometimes left out a word in one or other of them ; never putting in another word , but always leaving a blank and going on to the next word .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 70]: As I could do no service there , and as I had , nearer home , that pressing reason for anxiety and fear which even her wanderings could not drive out of my mind , I decided , in the course of the night that I would return by the early morning coach , walking on a mile or so , and being taken up clear of the town .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 49]: At about six o'clock of the morning , therefore , I leaned over her and touched her lips with mine , just as they said , not stopping for being touched , `` Take the pencil and write under my name , ` I forgive her . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 20]: Chapter L My hands had been dressed twice or thrice in the night , and again in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 46]: My left arm was a good deal burned to the elbow , and , less severely , as high as the shoulder ; it was very painful , but the flames had set in that direction , and I felt thankful it was no worse .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 16]: My right hand was not so badly burnt but that I could move the fingers .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 46]: It was bandaged , of course , but much less inconveniently than my left hand and arm ; those I carried in a sling ; and I could only wear my coat like a cloak , loose over my shoulders and fastened at the neck .
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 16]: My hair had been caught by the fire , but not my head or face .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 30]: When Herbert had been down to Hammersmith and seen his father , he came back to me at our chambers , and devoted the day to attending on me .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 45]: He was the kindest of nurses , and at stated times took off the bandages , and steeped them in the cooling liquid that was kept ready , and put them on again , with a patient tenderness that I was deeply grateful for .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 46]: At first , as I lay quiet on the sofa , I found it painfully difficult , I might say impossible , to get rid of the impression of the glare of the flames , their hurry and noise , and the fierce burning smell .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 32]: If I dozed for a minute , I was awakened by Miss Havisham 's cries , and by her running at me with all that height of fire above her head .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 33]: This pain of the mind was much harder to strive against than any bodily pain I suffered ; and Herbert , seeing that , did his utmost to hold my attention engaged .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 15]: Neither of us spoke of the boat , but we both thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 42]: That was made apparent by our avoidance of the subject , and by our agreeing -- without agreement -- to make my recovery of the use of my hands a question of so many hours , not of so many weeks .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 20]: My first question when I saw Herbert had been of course , whether all was well down the river ?
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 26]: As he replied in the affirmative , with perfect confidence and cheerfulness , we did not resume the subject until the day was wearing away .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 29]: But then , as Herbert changed the bandages , more by the light of the fire than by the outer light , he went back to it spontaneously .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 15]: `` I sat with Provis last night , Handel , two good hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 6]: `` Where was Clara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 6]: `` Dear little thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 12]: `` She was up and down with Gruffandgrim all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 14]: He was perpetually pegging at the floor the moment she left his sight .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 11]: I doubt if he can hold out long , though .
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 24]: What with rum and pepper , -- and pepper and rum , -- I should think his pegging must be nearly over . ''
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 11]: `` And then you will be married , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 12]: `` How can I take care of the dear child otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 39]: -- Lay your arm out upon the back of the sofa , my dear boy , and I 'll sit down here , and get the bandage off so gradually that you shall not know when it comes .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 6]: I was speaking of Provis .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 10]: Do you know , Handel , he improves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 17]: `` I said to you I thought he was softened when I last saw him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 5]: `` So you did .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 5]: And so he is .
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 15]: He was very communicative last night , and told me more of his life .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 17]: You remember his breaking off here about some woman that he had had great trouble with .
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 7]: -- Did I hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 10]: I had started , but not under his touch .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 8]: His words had given me a start .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 19]: `` I had forgotten that , Herbert , but I remember it now you speak of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 17]: He went into that part of his life , and a dark wild part it is .
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 5]: Shall I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 9]: Or would it worry you just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 7]: `` Tell me by all means .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 4]: Every word . ''
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 29]: Herbert bent forward to look at me more nearly , as if my reply had been rather more hurried or more eager than he could quite account for .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 7]: `` Your head is cool ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 6]: he said , touching it .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 18]: `` Quite , '' said I. `` Tell me what Provis said , my dear Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 41]: `` It seems , '' said Herbert , '' -- there 's a bandage off most charmingly , and now comes the cool one , -- makes you shrink at first , my poor dear fellow , do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 38]: but it will be comfortable presently , -- it seems that the woman was a young woman , and a jealous woman , and a revengeful woman ; revengeful , Handel , to the last degree . ''
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 7]: `` To what last degree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 3]: `` Murder .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 12]: -- Does it strike too cold on that sensitive place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 7]: `` I do n't feel it .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 5]: How did she murder ?
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 6]: Whom did she murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 48]: `` Why , the deed may not have merited quite so terrible a name , '' said Herbert , `` but , she was tried for it , and Mr. Jaggers defended her , and the reputation of that defence first made his name known to Provis .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 23]: It was another and a stronger woman who was the victim , and there had been a struggle -- in a barn .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 35]: Who began it , or how fair it was , or how unfair , may be doubtful ; but how it ended is certainly not doubtful , for the victim was found throttled . ''
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 9]: `` Was the woman brought in guilty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 7]: `` No ; she was acquitted .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 10]: -- My poor Handel , I hurt you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 10]: `` It is impossible to be gentler , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 2]: Yes ?
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 4]: What else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 22]: `` This acquitted young woman and Provis had a little child ; a little child of whom Provis was exceedingly fond .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 59]: On the evening of the very night when the object of her jealousy was strangled as I tell you , the young woman presented herself before Provis for one moment , and swore that she would destroy the child -LRB- which was in her possession -RRB- , and he should never see it again ; then she vanished .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 29]: -- There 's the worst arm comfortably in the sling once more , and now there remains but the right hand , which is a far easier job .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 30]: I can do it better by this light than by a stronger , for my hand is steadiest when I do n't see the poor blistered patches too distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 14]: -- You do n't think your breathing is affected , my dear boy ?
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 7]: You seem to breathe quickly . ''
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 7]: `` Perhaps I do , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 8]: Did the woman keep her oath ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 11]: `` There comes the darkest part of Provis 's life .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 4]: She did . ''
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 10]: `` That is , he says she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 32]: `` Why , of course , my dear boy , '' returned Herbert , in a tone of surprise , and again bending forward to get a nearer look at me .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 6]: `` He says it all .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 7]: I have no other information . ''
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 8]: `` No , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 71]: `` Now , whether , '' pursued Herbert , `` he had used the child 's mother ill , or whether he had used the child 's mother well , Provis does n't say ; but she had shared some four or five years of the wretched life he described to us at this fireside , and he seems to have felt pity for her , and forbearance towards her .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 75]: Therefore , fearing he should be called upon to depose about this destroyed child , and so be the cause of her death , he hid himself -LRB- much as he grieved for the child -RRB- , kept himself dark , as he says , out of the way and out of the trial , and was only vaguely talked of as a certain man called Abel , out of whom the jealousy arose .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 19]: After the acquittal she disappeared , and thus he lost the child and the child 's mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 20]: `` I want to ask -- '' `` A moment , my dear boy , and I have done .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 54]: That evil genius , Compeyson , the worst of scoundrels among many scoundrels , knowing of his keeping out of the way at that time and of his reasons for doing so , of course afterwards held the knowledge over his head as a means of keeping him poorer and working him harder .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 16]: It was clear last night that this barbed the point of Provis 's animosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 25]: `` I want to know , '' said I , `` and particularly , Herbert , whether he told you when this happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 3]: `` Particularly ?
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 13]: Let me remember , then , what he said as to that .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 27]: His expression was , ` a round score o ' year ago , and a ` most directly after I took up wi ' Compeyson . '
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 15]: How old were you when you came upon him in the little churchyard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 9]: `` I think in my seventh year . ''
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 3]: `` Ay .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 35]: It had happened some three or four years then , he said , and you brought into his mind the little girl so tragically lost , who would have been about your age . ''
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 38]: `` Herbert , '' said I , after a short silence , in a hurried way , `` can you see me best by the light of the window , or the light of the fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 13]: `` By the firelight , '' answered Herbert , coming close again .
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 6]: `` Look at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 12]: `` I do look at you , my dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 5]: `` Touch me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 11]: `` I do touch you , my dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 27]: `` You are not afraid that I am in any fever , or that my head is much disordered by the accident of last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 18]: `` N-no , my dear boy , '' said Herbert , after taking time to examine me .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 13]: `` You are rather excited , but you are quite yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 8]: `` I know I am quite myself .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 17]: And the man we have in hiding down the river , is Estella 's Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 26]: Chapter LI What purpose I had in view when I was hot on tracing out and proving Estella 's parentage , I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 30]: It will presently be seen that the question was not before me in a distinct shape until it was put before me by a wiser head than my own .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 53]: But when Herbert and I had held our momentous conversation , I was seized with a feverish conviction that I ought to hunt the matter down , -- that I ought not to let it rest , but that I ought to see Mr. Jaggers , and come at the bare truth .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 48]: I really do not know whether I felt that I did this for Estella 's sake , or whether I was glad to transfer to the man in whose preservation I was so much concerned some rays of the romantic interest that had so long surrounded me .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 12]: Perhaps the latter possibility may be the nearer to the truth .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 17]: Any way , I could scarcely be withheld from going out to Gerrard Street that night .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 34]: Herbert 's representations that , if I did , I should probably be laid up and stricken useless , when our fugitive 's safety would depend upon me , alone restrained my impatience .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 46]: On the understanding , again and again reiterated , that , come what would , I was to go to Mr. Jaggers to-morrow , I at length submitted to keep quiet , and to have my hurts looked after , and to stay at home .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 37]: Early next morning we went out together , and at the corner of Giltspur Street by Smithfield , I left Herbert to go his way into the City , and took my way to Little Britain .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 27]: There were periodical occasions when Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick went over the office accounts , and checked off the vouchers , and put all things straight .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 29]: On these occasions , Wemmick took his books and papers into Mr. Jaggers 's room , and one of the up-stairs clerks came down into the outer office .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 45]: Finding such clerk on Wemmick 's post that morning , I knew what was going on ; but I was not sorry to have Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick together , as Wemmick would then hear for himself that I said nothing to compromise him .
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 19]: My appearance , with my arm bandaged and my coat loose over my shoulders , favored my object .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 64]: Although I had sent Mr. Jaggers a brief account of the accident as soon as I had arrived in town , yet I had to give him all the details now ; and the speciality of the occasion caused our talk to be less dry and hard , and less strictly regulated by the rules of evidence , than it had been before .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 19]: While I described the disaster , Mr. Jaggers stood , according to his wont , before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 30]: Wemmick leaned back in his chair , staring at me , with his hands in the pockets of his trousers , and his pen put horizontally into the post .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 31]: The two brutal casts , always inseparable in my mind from the official proceedings , seemed to be congestively considering whether they did n't smell fire at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 25]: My narrative finished , and their questions exhausted , I then produced Miss Havisham 's authority to receive the nine hundred pounds for Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 37]: Mr. Jaggers 's eyes retired a little deeper into his head when I handed him the tablets , but he presently handed them over to Wemmick , with instructions to draw the check for his signature .
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 36]: While that was in course of being done , I looked on at Wemmick as he wrote , and Mr. Jaggers , poising and swaying himself on his well-polished boots , looked on at me .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 35]: `` I am sorry , Pip , '' said he , as I put the check in my pocket , when he had signed it , `` that we do nothing for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 30]: `` Miss Havisham was good enough to ask me , '' I returned , `` whether she could do nothing for me , and I told her No . ''
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 13]: `` Everybody should know his own business , '' said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 14]: And I saw Wemmick 's lips form the words `` portable property . ''
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 33]: `` I should not have told her No , if I had been you , '' said Mr Jaggers ; `` but every man ought to know his own business best . ''
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 21]: `` Every man 's business , '' said Wemmick , rather reproachfully towards me , `` is portable property . ''
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 39]: As I thought the time was now come for pursuing the theme I had at heart , I said , turning on Mr. Jaggers : -- `` I did ask something of Miss Havisham , however , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 23]: I asked her to give me some information relative to her adopted daughter , and she gave me all she possessed . ''
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 5]: `` Did she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 16]: said Mr. Jaggers , bending forward to look at his boots and then straightening himself .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 3]: `` Hah !
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 17]: I do n't think I should have done so , if I had been Miss Havisham .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 11]: But she ought to know her own business best . ''
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 21]: `` I know more of the history of Miss Havisham 's adopted child than Miss Havisham herself does , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 6]: I know her mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 13]: Mr. Jaggers looked at me inquiringly , and repeated `` Mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 12]: `` I have seen her mother within these three days . ''
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 8]: `` And so have you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 10]: And you have seen her still more recently . ''
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 25]: `` Perhaps I know more of Estella 's history than even you do , '' said I. `` I know her father too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 47]: A certain stop that Mr. Jaggers came to in his manner -- he was too self-possessed to change his manner , but he could not help its being brought to an indefinably attentive stop -- assured me that he did not know who her father was .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 57]: This I had strongly suspected from Provis 's account -LRB- as Herbert had repeated it -RRB- of his having kept himself dark ; which I pieced on to the fact that he himself was not Mr. Jaggers 's client until some four years later , and when he could have no reason for claiming his identity .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 26]: But , I could not be sure of this unconsciousness on Mr. Jaggers 's part before , though I was quite sure of it now .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 3]: `` So !
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 11]: You know the young lady 's father , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' I replied , `` and his name is Provis -- from New South Wales . ''
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 10]: Even Mr. Jaggers started when I said those words .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 40]: It was the slightest start that could escape a man , the most carefully repressed and the sooner checked , but he did start , though he made it a part of the action of taking out his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 41]: How Wemmick received the announcement I am unable to say ; for I was afraid to look at him just then , lest Mr. Jaggers 's sharpness should detect that there had been some communication unknown to him between us .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 36]: `` And on what evidence , Pip , '' asked Mr. Jaggers , very coolly , as he paused with his handkerchief half way to his nose , `` does Provis make this claim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 32]: `` He does not make it , '' said I , `` and has never made it , and has no knowledge or belief that his daughter is in existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 8]: For once , the powerful pocket-handkerchief failed .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 40]: My reply was so Unexpected , that Mr. Jaggers put the handkerchief back into his pocket without completing the usual performance , folded his arms , and looked with stern attention at me , though with an immovable face .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 38]: Then I told him all I knew , and how I knew it ; with the one reservation that I left him to infer that I knew from Miss Havisham what I in fact knew from Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 9]: I was very careful indeed as to that .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 29]: Nor did I look towards Wemmick until I had finished all I had to tell , and had been for some time silently meeting Mr. Jaggers 's look .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 31]: When I did at last turn my eyes in Wemmick 's direction , I found that he had unposted his pen , and was intent upon the table before him .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 16]: said Mr. Jaggers at last , as he moved towards the papers on the table .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 18]: `` What item was it you were at , Wemmick , when Mr. Pip came in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 35]: But I could not submit to be thrown off in that way , and I made a passionate , almost an indignant appeal , to him to be more frank and manly with me .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 40]: I reminded him of the false hopes into which I had lapsed , the length of time they had lasted , and the discovery I had made : and I hinted at the danger that weighed upon my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 25]: I represented myself as being surely worthy of some little confidence from him , in return for the confidence I had just now imparted .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 27]: I said that I did not blame him , or suspect him , or mistrust him , but I wanted assurance of the truth from him .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 76]: And if he asked me why I wanted it , and why I thought I had any right to it , I would tell him , little as he cared for such poor dreams , that I had loved Estella dearly and long , and that although I had lost her , and must live a bereaved life , whatever concerned her was still nearer and dearer to me than anything else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 43]: And seeing that Mr. Jaggers stood quite still and silent , and apparently quite obdurate , under this appeal , I turned to Wemmick , and said , `` Wemmick , I know you to be a man with a gentle heart .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 28]: I have seen your pleasant home , and your old father , and all the innocent , cheerful playful ways with which you refresh your business life .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 35]: And I entreat you to say a word for me to Mr. Jaggers , and to represent to him that , all circumstances considered , he ought to be more open with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 22]: I have never seen two men look more oddly at one another than Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick did after this apostrophe .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 37]: At first , a misgiving crossed me that Wemmick would be instantly dismissed from his employment ; but it melted as I saw Mr. Jaggers relax into something like a smile , and Wemmick become bolder .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 7]: `` What 's all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 16]: `` You with an old father , and you with pleasant and playful ways ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 3]: returned Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 15]: `` If I do n't bring 'em here , what does it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 33]: `` Pip , '' said Mr. Jaggers , laying his hand upon my arm , and smiling openly , `` this man must be the most cunning impostor in all London . ''
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 16]: `` Not a bit of it , '' returned Wemmick , growing bolder and bolder .
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 8]: `` I think you 're another . ''
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 20]: Again they exchanged their former odd looks , each apparently still distrustful that the other was taking him in .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 8]: `` You with a pleasant home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 4]: said Mr. Jaggers .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 19]: `` Since it do n't interfere with business , '' returned Wemmick , `` let it be so .
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 43]: Now , I look at you , sir , I should n't wonder if you might be planning and contriving to have a pleasant home of your own one of these days , when you 're tired of all this work . ''
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 17]: Mr. Jaggers nodded his head retrospectively two or three times , and actually drew a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 35]: `` Pip , '' said he , `` we wo n't talk about ` poor dreams ; ' you know more about such things than I , having much fresher experience of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 7]: But now about this other matter .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 8]: I 'll put a case to you .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 2]: Mind !
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 5]: I admit nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 19]: He waited for me to declare that I quite understood that he expressly said that he admitted nothing .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 15]: `` Now , Pip , '' said Mr. Jaggers , `` put this case .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 60]: Put the case that a woman , under such circumstances as you have mentioned , held her child concealed , and was obliged to communicate the fact to her legal adviser , on his representing to her that he must know , with an eye to the latitude of his defence , how the fact stood about that child .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 29]: Put the case that , at the same time he held a trust to find a child for an eccentric rich lady to adopt and bring up . ''
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 8]: `` I follow you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 31]: `` Put the case that he lived in an atmosphere of evil , and that all he saw of children was their being generated in great numbers for certain destruction .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 60]: Put the case that he often saw children solemnly tried at a criminal bar , where they were held up to be seen ; put the case that he habitually knew of their being imprisoned , whipped , transported , neglected , cast out , qualified in all ways for the hangman , and growing up to be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 56]: Put the case that pretty nigh all the children he saw in his daily business life he had reason to look upon as so much spawn , to develop into the fish that were to come to his net , -- to be prosecuted , defended , forsworn , made orphans , bedevilled somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 8]: `` I follow you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 64]: `` Put the case , Pip , that here was one pretty little child out of the heap who could be saved ; whom the father believed dead , and dared make no stir about ; as to whom , over the mother , the legal adviser had this power : `` I know what you did , and how you did it .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 16]: You came so and so , you did such and such things to divert suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 15]: I have tracked you through it all , and I tell it you all .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 24]: Part with the child , unless it should be necessary to produce it to clear you , and then it shall be produced .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 18]: Give the child into my hands , and I will do my best to bring you off .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 23]: If you are saved , your child is saved too ; if you are lost , your child is still saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 16]: Put the case that this was done , and that the woman was cleared . ''
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 7]: `` I understand you perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 9]: `` But that I make no admissions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 8]: `` That you make no admissions . ''
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 9]: And Wemmick repeated , `` No admissions . ''
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 51]: `` Put the case , Pip , that passion and the terror of death had a little shaken the woman 's intellects , and that when she was set at liberty , she was scared out of the ways of the world , and went to him to be sheltered .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 42]: Put the case that he took her in , and that he kept down the old , wild , violent nature whenever he saw an inkling of its breaking out , by asserting his power over her in the old way .
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 8]: Do you comprehend the imaginary case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 4]: `` Quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 16]: `` Put the case that the child grew up , and was married for money .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 7]: That the mother was still living .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 7]: That the father was still living .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 29]: That the mother and father , unknown to one another , were dwelling within so many miles , furlongs , yards if you like , of one another .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 17]: That the secret was still a secret , except that you had got wind of it .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 10]: Put that last case to yourself very carefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 13]: `` I ask Wemmick to put it to himself very carefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 9]: And Wemmick said , `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 10]: `` For whose sake would you reveal the secret ?
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 5]: For the father 's ?
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 13]: I think he would not be much the better for the mother .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 5]: For the mother 's ?
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 17]: I think if she had done such a deed she would be safer where she was .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 5]: For the daughter 's ?
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 40]: I think it would hardly serve her to establish her parentage for the information of her husband , and to drag her back to disgrace , after an escape of twenty years , pretty secure to last for life .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 97]: But add the case that you had loved her , Pip , and had made her the subject of those ` poor dreams ' which have , at one time or another , been in the heads of more men than you think likely , then I tell you that you had better -- and would much sooner when you had thought well of it -- chop off that bandaged left hand of yours with your bandaged right hand , and then pass the chopper on to Wemmick there , to cut that off too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 11]: I looked at Wemmick , whose face was very grave .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 9]: He gravely touched his lips with his forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 5]: I did the same .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 6]: Mr. Jaggers did the same .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 31]: `` Now , Wemmick , '' said the latter then , resuming his usual manner , `` what item was it you were at when Mr. Pip came in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 60]: Standing by for a little , while they were at work , I observed that the odd looks they had cast at one another were repeated several times : with this difference now , that each of them seemed suspicious , not to say conscious , of having shown himself in a weak and unprofessional light to the other .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 38]: For this reason , I suppose , they were now inflexible with one another ; Mr. Jaggers being highly dictatorial , and Wemmick obstinately justifying himself whenever there was the smallest point in abeyance for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 20]: I had never seen them on such ill terms ; for generally they got on very well indeed together .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 46]: But they were both happily relieved by the opportune appearance of Mike , the client with the fur cap and the habit of wiping his nose on his sleeve , whom I had seen on the very first day of my appearance within those walls .
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 50]: This individual , who , either in his own person or in that of some member of his family , seemed to be always in trouble -LRB- which in that place meant Newgate -RRB- , called to announce that his eldest daughter was taken up on suspicion of shoplifting .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 34]: As he imparted this melancholy circumstance to Wemmick , Mr. Jaggers standing magisterially before the fire and taking no share in the proceedings , Mike 's eye happened to twinkle with a tear .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 7]: `` What are you about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 8]: demanded Wemmick , with the utmost indignation .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 10]: `` What do you come snivelling here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 13]: `` I did n't go to do it , Mr. Wemmick . ''
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 8]: `` You did , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 5]: `` How dare you ?
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 24]: You 're not in a fit state to come here , if you ca n't come here without spluttering like a bad pen .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 8]: What do you mean by it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 16]: `` A man ca n't help his feelings , Mr. Wemmick , '' pleaded Mike .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 5]: `` His what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 6]: demanded Wemmick , quite savagely .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 6]: `` Say that again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 22]: `` Now look here my man , '' said Mr. Jaggers , advancing a step , and pointing to the door .
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 7]: `` Get out of this office .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 7]: I 'll have no feelings here .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 4]: Get out . ''
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 15]: `` It serves you right , '' said Wemmick , `` Get out . ''
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 42]: So , the unfortunate Mike very humbly withdrew , and Mr. Jaggers and Wemmick appeared to have re-established their good understanding , and went to work again with an air of refreshment upon them as if they had just had lunch .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 54]: Chapter LII From Little Britain I went , with my check in my pocket , to Miss Skiffins 's brother , the accountant ; and Miss Skiffins 's brother , the accountant , going straight to Clarriker 's and bringing Clarriker to me , I had the great satisfaction of concluding that arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 29]: It was the only good thing I had done , and the only completed thing I had done , since I was first apprised of my great expectations .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 82]: Clarriker informing me on that occasion that the affairs of the House were steadily progressing , that he would now be able to establish a small branch-house in the East which was much wanted for the extension of the business , and that Herbert in his new partnership capacity would go out and take charge of it , I found that I must have prepared for a separation from my friend , even though my own affairs had been more settled .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 29]: And now , indeed , I felt as if my last anchor were loosening its hold , and I should soon be driving with the winds and waves .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 81]: But there was recompense in the joy with which Herbert would come home of a night and tell me of these changes , little imagining that he told me no news , and would sketch airy pictures of himself conducting Clara Barley to the land of the Arabian Nights , and of me going out to join them -LRB- with a caravan of camels , I believe -RRB- , and of our all going up the Nile and seeing wonders .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 48]: Without being sanguine as to my own part in those bright plans , I felt that Herbert 's way was clearing fast , and that old Bill Barley had but to stick to his pepper and rum , and his daughter would soon be happily provided for .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 10]: We had now got into the month of March .
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 33]: My left arm , though it presented no bad symptoms , took , in the natural course , so long to heal that I was still unable to get a coat on .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 13]: My right arm was tolerably restored ; disfigured , but fairly serviceable .
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 24]: On a Monday morning , when Herbert and I were at breakfast , I received the following letter from Wemmick by the post .
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 3]: `` Walworth .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 7]: Burn this as soon as read .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 25]: Early in the week , or say Wednesday , you might do what you know of , if you felt disposed to try it .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 4]: Now burn . ''
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 32]: When I had shown this to Herbert and had put it in the fire -- but not before we had both got it by heart -- we considered what to do .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 17]: For , of course my being disabled could now be no longer kept out of view .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 29]: `` I have thought it over again and again , '' said Herbert , `` and I think I know a better course than taking a Thames waterman .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 3]: Take Startop .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 18]: A good fellow , a skilled hand , fond of us , and enthusiastic and honorable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 9]: I had thought of him more than once .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 12]: `` But how much would you tell him , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 10]: `` It is necessary to tell him very little .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 35]: Let him suppose it a mere freak , but a secret one , until the morning comes : then let him know that there is urgent reason for your getting Provis aboard and away .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 6]: You go with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 5]: `` No doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 46]: It had seemed to me , in the many anxious considerations I had given the point , almost indifferent what port we made for , -- Hamburg , Rotterdam , Antwerp , -- the place signified little , so that he was out of England .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 16]: Any foreign steamer that fell in our way and would take us up would do .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 36]: I had always proposed to myself to get him well down the river in the boat ; certainly well beyond Gravesend , which was a critical place for search or inquiry if suspicion were afoot .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 42]: As foreign steamers would leave London at about the time of high-water , our plan would be to get down the river by a previous ebb-tide , and lie by in some quiet spot until we could pull off to one .
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 28]: The time when one would be due where we lay , wherever that might be , could be calculated pretty nearly , if we made inquiries beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 18]: Herbert assented to all this , and we went out immediately after breakfast to pursue our investigations .
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 25]: We found that a steamer for Hamburg was likely to suit our purpose best , and we directed our thoughts chiefly to that vessel .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 30]: But we noted down what other foreign steamers would leave London with the same tide , and we satisfied ourselves that we knew the build and color of each .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 29]: We then separated for a few hours : I , to get at once such passports as were necessary ; Herbert , to see Startop at his lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 24]: We both did what we had to do without any hindrance , and when we met again at one o'clock reported it done .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 25]: I , for my part , was prepared with passports ; Herbert had seen Startop , and he was more than ready to join .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 40]: Those two should pull a pair of oars , we settled , and I would steer ; our charge would be sitter , and keep quiet ; as speed was not our object , we should make way enough .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 94]: We arranged that Herbert should not come home to dinner before going to Mill Pond Bank that evening ; that he should not go there at all to-morrow evening , Tuesday ; that he should prepare Provis to come down to some stairs hard by the house , on Wednesday , when he saw us approach , and not sooner ; that all the arrangements with him should be concluded that Monday night ; and that he should be communicated with no more in any way , until we took him on board .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 13]: These precautions well understood by both of us , I went home .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 33]: On opening the outer door of our chambers with my key , I found a letter in the box , directed to me ; a very dirty letter , though not ill-written .
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 58]: It had been delivered by hand -LRB- of course , since I left home -RRB- , and its contents were these : -- `` If you are not afraid to come to the old marshes to-night or tomorrow night at nine , and to come to the little sluice-house by the limekiln , you had better come .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 24]: If you want information regarding your uncle Provis , you had much better come and tell no one , and lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 5]: You must come alone .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 6]: Bring this with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 16]: I had had load enough upon my mind before the receipt of this strange letter .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 10]: What to do now , I could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 29]: And the worst was , that I must decide quickly , or I should miss the afternoon coach , which would take me down in time for to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 22]: To-morrow night I could not think of going , for it would be too close upon the time of the flight .
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 21]: And again , for anything I knew , the proffered information might have some important bearing on the flight itself .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 17]: If I had had ample time for consideration , I believe I should still have gone .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 27]: Having hardly any time for consideration , -- my watch showing me that the coach started within half an hour , -- I resolved to go .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 16]: I should certainly not have gone , but for the reference to my Uncle Provis .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 18]: That , coming on Wemmick 's letter and the morning 's busy preparation , turned the scale .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 46]: It is so difficult to become clearly possessed of the contents of almost any letter , in a violent hurry , that I had to read this mysterious epistle again twice , before its injunction to me to be secret got mechanically into my mind .
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 58]: Yielding to it in the same mechanical kind of way , I left a note in pencil for Herbert , telling him that as I should be so soon going away , I knew not for how long , I had decided to hurry down and back , to ascertain for myself how Miss Havisham was faring .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 25]: I had then barely time to get my great-coat , lock up the chambers , and make for the coach-office by the short by-ways .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 37]: If I had taken a hackney-chariot and gone by the streets , I should have missed my aim ; going as I did , I caught the coach just as it came out of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 19]: I was the only inside passenger , jolting away knee-deep in straw , when I came to myself .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 28]: For I really had not been myself since the receipt of the letter ; it had so bewildered me , ensuing on the hurry of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 31]: The morning hurry and flutter had been great ; for , long and anxiously as I had waited for Wemmick , his hint had come like a surprise at last .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 75]: And now I began to wonder at myself for being in the coach , and to doubt whether I had sufficient reason for being there , and to consider whether I should get out presently and go back , and to argue against ever heeding an anonymous communication , and , in short , to pass through all those phases of contradiction and indecision to which I suppose very few hurried people are strangers .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 11]: Still , the reference to Provis by name mastered everything .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 37]: I reasoned as I had reasoned already without knowing it , -- if that be reasoning , -- in case any harm should befall him through my not going , how could I ever forgive myself !
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 37]: It was dark before we got down , and the journey seemed long and dreary to me , who could see little of it inside , and who could not go outside in my disabled state .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 23]: Avoiding the Blue Boar , I put up at an inn of minor reputation down the town , and ordered some dinner .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 27]: While it was preparing , I went to Satis House and inquired for Miss Havisham ; she was still very ill , though considered something better .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 26]: My inn had once been a part of an ancient ecclesiastical house , and I dined in a little octagonal common-room , like a font .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 23]: As I was not able to cut my dinner , the old landlord with a shining bald head did it for me .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 39]: This bringing us into conversation , he was so good as to entertain me with my own story , -- of course with the popular feature that Pumblechook was my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 9]: `` Do you know the young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 7]: said I. `` Know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 4]: repeated the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 12]: `` Ever since he was -- no height at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 11]: `` Does he ever come back to this neighborhood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 35]: `` Ay , he comes back , '' said the landlord , `` to his great friends , now and again , and gives the cold shoulder to the man that made him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 7]: `` What man is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 12]: `` Him that I speak of , '' said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 5]: `` Mr. Pumblechook . ''
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 10]: `` Is he ungrateful to no one else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 22]: `` No doubt he would be , if he could , '' returned the landlord , `` but he ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 8]: Because Pumblechook done everything for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 7]: `` Does Pumblechook say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 5]: `` Say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 4]: replied the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 11]: `` He ha n't no call to say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 8]: `` But does he say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 26]: `` It would turn a man 's blood to white wine winegar to hear him tell of it , sir , '' said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 16]: I thought , `` Yet Joe , dear Joe , you never tell of it .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 9]: Long-suffering and loving Joe , you never complain .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 7]: Nor you , sweet-tempered Biddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 25]: `` Your appetite 's been touched like by your accident , '' said the landlord , glancing at the bandaged arm under my coat .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 7]: `` Try a tenderer bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 20]: `` No , thank you , '' I replied , turning from the table to brood over the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 7]: `` I can eat no more .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 6]: Please take it away . ''
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 22]: I had never been struck at so keenly , for my thanklessness to Joe , as through the brazen impostor Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 16]: The falser he , the truer Joe ; the meaner he , the nobler Joe .
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 20]: My heart was deeply and most deservedly humbled as I mused over the fire for an hour or more .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 33]: The striking of the clock aroused me , but not from my dejection or remorse , and I got up and had my coat fastened round my neck , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 44]: I had previously sought in my pockets for the letter , that I might refer to it again ; but I could not find it , and was uneasy to think that it must have been dropped in the straw of the coach .
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 27]: I knew very well , however , that the appointed place was the little sluice-house by the limekiln on the marshes , and the hour nine .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 14]: Towards the marshes I now went straight , having no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 27]: Chapter LIII It was a dark night , though the full moon rose as I left the enclosed lands , and passed out upon the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 22]: Beyond their dark line there was a ribbon of clear sky , hardly broad enough to hold the red large moon .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 21]: In a few minutes she had ascended out of that clear field , in among the piled mountains of cloud .
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 13]: There was a melancholy wind , and the marshes were very dismal .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 26]: A stranger would have found them insupportable , and even to me they were so oppressive that I hesitated , half inclined to go back .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 28]: But I knew them well , and could have found my way on a far darker night , and had no excuse for returning , being there .
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 15]: So , having come there against my inclination , I went on against it .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 25]: The direction that I took was not that in which my old home lay , nor that in which we had pursued the convicts .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 36]: My back was turned towards the distant Hulks as I walked on , and , though I could see the old lights away on the spits of sand , I saw them over my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 51]: I knew the limekiln as well as I knew the old Battery , but they were miles apart ; so that , if a light had been burning at each point that night , there would have been a long strip of the blank horizon between the two bright specks .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 39]: At first , I had to shut some gates after me , and now and then to stand still while the cattle that were lying in the banked-up pathway arose and blundered down among the grass and reeds .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 15]: But after a little while I seemed to have the whole flats to myself .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 12]: It was another half-hour before I drew near to the kiln .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 25]: The lime was burning with a sluggish stifling smell , but the fires were made up and left , and no workmen were visible .
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 7]: Hard by was a small stone-quarry .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 27]: It lay directly in my way , and had been worked that day , as I saw by the tools and barrows that were lying about .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 31]: Coming up again to the marsh level out of this excavation , -- for the rude path lay through it , -- I saw a light in the old sluice-house .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 14]: I quickened my pace , and knocked at the door with my hand .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 75]: Waiting for some reply , I looked about me , noticing how the sluice was abandoned and broken , and how the house -- of wood with a tiled roof -- would not be proof against the weather much longer , if it were so even now , and how the mud and ooze were coated with lime , and how the choking vapor of the kiln crept in a ghostly way towards me .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 11]: Still there was no answer , and I knocked again .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 10]: No answer still , and I tried the latch .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 11]: It rose under my hand , and the door yielded .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 23]: Looking in , I saw a lighted candle on a table , a bench , and a mattress on a truckle bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 18]: As there was a loft above , I called , `` Is there any one here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 5]: but no voice answered .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 27]: Then I looked at my watch , and , finding that it was past nine , called again , `` Is there any one here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 18]: There being still no answer , I went out at the door , irresolute what to do .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 7]: It was beginning to rain fast .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 32]: Seeing nothing save what I had seen already , I turned back into the house , and stood just within the shelter of the doorway , looking out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 40]: While I was considering that some one must have been there lately and must soon be coming back , or the candle would not be burning , it came into my head to look if the wick were long .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 52]: I turned round to do so , and had taken up the candle in my hand , when it was extinguished by some violent shock ; and the next thing I comprehended was , that I had been caught in a strong running noose , thrown over my head from behind .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 19]: `` Now , '' said a suppressed voice with an oath , `` I 've got you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 6]: `` What is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 5]: I cried , struggling .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 5]: `` Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 7]: Help , help , help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 23]: Not only were my arms pulled close to my sides , but the pressure on my bad arm caused me exquisite pain .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 51]: Sometimes , a strong man 's hand , sometimes a strong man 's breast , was set against my mouth to deaden my cries , and with a hot breath always close to me , I struggled ineffectually in the dark , while I was fastened tight to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 28]: `` And now , '' said the suppressed voice with another oath , `` call out again , and I 'll make short work of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 44]: Faint and sick with the pain of my injured arm , bewildered by the surprise , and yet conscious how easily this threat could be put in execution , I desisted , and tried to ease my arm were it ever so little .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 10]: But , it was bound too tight for that .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 16]: I felt as if , having been burnt before , it were now being boiled .
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 27]: The sudden exclusion of the night , and the substitution of black darkness in its place , warned me that the man had closed a shutter .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 23]: After groping about for a little , he found the flint and steel he wanted , and began to strike a light .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 46]: I strained my sight upon the sparks that fell among the tinder , and upon which he breathed and breathed , match in hand , but I could only see his lips , and the blue point of the match ; even those but fitfully .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 20]: The tinder was damp , -- no wonder there , -- and one after another the sparks died out .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 16]: The man was in no hurry , and struck again with the flint and steel .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 40]: As the sparks fell thick and bright about him , I could see his hands , and touches of his face , and could make out that he was seated and bending over the table ; but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 27]: Presently I saw his blue lips again , breathing on the tinder , and then a flare of light flashed up , and showed me Orlick .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 11]: Whom I had looked for , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 7]: I had not looked for him .
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 22]: Seeing him , I felt that I was in a dangerous strait indeed , and I kept my eyes upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 22]: He lighted the candle from the flaring match with great deliberation , and dropped the match , and trod it out .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 33]: Then he put the candle away from him on the table , so that he could see me , and sat with his arms folded on the table and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 34]: I made out that I was fastened to a stout perpendicular ladder a few inches from the wall , -- a fixture there , -- the means of ascent to the loft above .
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 24]: `` Now , '' said he , when we had surveyed one another for some time , `` I 've got you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 4]: `` Unbind me .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 5]: Let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 10]: he returned , `` I 'll let you go .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 18]: I 'll let you go to the moon , I 'll let you go to the stars .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 6]: All in good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 9]: `` Why have you lured me here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 8]: said he , with a deadly look .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 12]: `` Why have you set upon me in the dark ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 10]: `` Because I mean to do it all myself .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 8]: One keeps a secret better than two .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 8]: O you enemy , you enemy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 38]: His enjoyment of the spectacle I furnished , as he sat with his arms folded on the table , shaking his head at me and hugging himself , had a malignity in it that made me tremble .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 28]: As I watched him in silence , he put his hand into the corner at his side , and took up a gun with a brass-bound stock .
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 7]: `` Do you know this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 13]: said he , making as if he would take aim at me .
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 10]: `` Do you know where you saw it afore ?
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 5]: Speak , wolf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 7]: `` You cost me that place .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 3]: You did .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 3]: Speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 8]: `` What else could I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 14]: `` You did that , and that would be enough , without more .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 15]: How dared you to come betwixt me and a young woman I liked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 6]: `` When did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 6]: `` When did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 15]: It was you as always give Old Orlick a bad name to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 13]: `` You gave it to yourself ; you gained it for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 16]: I could have done you no harm , if you had done yourself none . ''
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 6]: `` You 're a liar .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 24]: And you 'll take any pains , and spend any money , to drive me out of this country , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 17]: said he , repeating my words to Biddy in the last interview I had with her .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 12]: `` Now , I 'll tell you a piece of information .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 20]: It was never so well worth your while to get me out of this country as it is to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 17]: If it was all your money twenty times told , to the last brass farden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 25]: As he shook his heavy hand at me , with his mouth snarling like a tiger 's , I felt that it was true .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 11]: `` What are you going to do to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 46]: `` I 'm a going , '' said he , bringing his fist down upon the table with a heavy blow , and rising as the blow fell to give it greater force , -- `` I 'm a going to have your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 30]: He leaned forward staring at me , slowly unclenched his hand and drew it across his mouth as if his mouth watered for me , and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 16]: `` You was always in Old Orlick 's way since ever you was a child .
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 10]: You goes out of his way this present night .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 8]: He 'll have no more on you .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 5]: You 're dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 13]: I felt that I had come to the brink of my grave .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 20]: For a moment I looked wildly round my trap for any chance of escape ; but there was none .
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 40]: `` More than that , '' said he , folding his arms on the table again , `` I wo n't have a rag of you , I wo n't have a bone of you , left on earth .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 41]: I 'll put your body in the kiln , -- I 'd carry two such to it , on my Shoulders , -- and , let people suppose what they may of you , they shall never know nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 16]: My mind , with inconceivable rapidity followed out all the consequences of such a death .
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 91]: Estella 's father would believe I had deserted him , would be taken , would die accusing me ; even Herbert would doubt me , when he compared the letter I had left for him with the fact that I had called at Miss Havisham 's gate for only a moment ; Joe and Biddy would never know how sorry I had been that night , none would ever know what I had suffered , how true I had meant to be , what an agony I had passed through .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 23]: The death close before me was terrible , but far more terrible than death was the dread of being misremembered after death .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 37]: And so quick were my thoughts , that I saw myself despised by unborn generations , -- Estella 's children , and their children , -- while the wretch 's words were yet on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 52]: `` Now , wolf , '' said he , `` afore I kill you like any other beast , -- which is wot I mean to do and wot I have tied you up for , -- I 'll have a good look at you and a good goad at you .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 5]: O you enemy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 34]: It had passed through my thoughts to cry out for help again ; though few could know better than I , the solitary nature of the spot , and the hopelessness of aid .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 22]: But as he sat gloating over me , I was supported by a scornful detestation of him that sealed my lips .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 26]: Above all things , I resolved that I would not entreat him , and that I would die making some last poor resistance to him .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 96]: Softened as my thoughts of all the rest of men were in that dire extremity ; humbly beseeching pardon , as I did , of Heaven ; melted at heart , as I was , by the thought that I had taken no farewell , and never now could take farewell of those who were dear to me , or could explain myself to them , or ask for their compassion on my miserable errors , -- still , if I could have killed him , even in dying , I would have done it .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 13]: He had been drinking , and his eyes were red and bloodshot .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 25]: Around his neck was slung a tin bottle , as I had often seen his meat and drink slung about him in other days .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 30]: He brought the bottle to his lips , and took a fiery drink from it ; and I smelt the strong spirits that I saw flash into his face .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 4]: `` Wolf ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 19]: said he , folding his arms again , `` Old Orlick 's a going to tell you somethink .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 11]: It was you as did for your shrew sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 40]: Again my mind , with its former inconceivable rapidity , had exhausted the whole subject of the attack upon my sister , her illness , and her death , before his slow and hesitating speech had formed these words .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 52]: `` It was you , villain , '' said I. `` I tell you it was your doing , -- I tell you it was done through you , '' he retorted , catching up the gun , and making a blow with the stock at the vacant air between us .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 15]: `` I come upon her from behind , as I come upon you to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 6]: I giv ' it her !
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 32]: I left her for dead , and if there had been a limekiln as nigh her as there is now nigh you , she should n't have come to life again .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 14]: But it war n't Old Orlick as did it ; it was you .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 11]: You was favored , and he was bullied and beat .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 8]: Old Orlick bullied and beat , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 6]: Now you pays for it .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 11]: You done it ; now you pays for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 9]: He drank again , and became more ferocious .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 18]: I saw by his tilting of the bottle that there was no great quantity left in it .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 19]: I distinctly understood that he was working himself up with its contents to make an end of me .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 14]: I knew that every drop it held was a drop of my life .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 62]: I knew that when I was changed into a part of the vapor that had crept towards me but a little while before , like my own warning ghost , he would do as he had done in my sister 's case , -- make all haste to the town , and be seen slouching about there drinking at the alehouses .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 45]: My rapid mind pursued him to the town , made a picture of the street with him in it , and contrasted its lights and life with the lonely marsh and the white vapor creeping over it , into which I should have dissolved .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 38]: It was not only that I could have summed up years and years and years while he said a dozen words , but that what he did say presented pictures to me , and not mere words .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 28]: In the excited and exalted state of my brain , I could not think of a place without seeing it , or of persons without seeing them .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 39]: It is impossible to overstate the vividness of these images , and yet I was so intent , all the time , upon him himself , -- who would not be intent on the tiger crouching to spring !
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 12]: -- that I knew of the slightest action of his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 24]: When he had drunk this second time , he rose from the bench on which he sat , and pushed the table aside .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 37]: Then , he took up the candle , and , shading it with his murderous hand so as to throw its light on me , stood before me , looking at me and enjoying the sight .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 10]: `` Wolf , I 'll tell you something more .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 15]: It was Old Orlick as you tumbled over on your stairs that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 9]: I saw the staircase with its extinguished lamps .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 19]: I saw the shadows of the heavy stair-rails , thrown by the watchman 's lantern on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 32]: I saw the rooms that I was never to see again ; here , a door half open ; there , a door closed ; all the articles of furniture around .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 8]: `` And why was Old Orlick there ?
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 9]: I 'll tell you something more , wolf .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 37]: You and her have pretty well hunted me out of this country , so far as getting a easy living in it goes , and I 've took up with new companions , and new masters .
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 17]: Some of 'em writes my letters when I wants 'em wrote , -- do you mind ?
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 7]: -- writes my letters , wolf !
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 17]: They writes fifty hands ; they 're not like sneaking you , as writes but one .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 26]: I 've had a firm mind and a firm will to have your life , since you was down here at your sister 's burying .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 24]: I ha n't seen a way to get you safe , and I 've looked arter you to know your ins and outs .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 18]: For , says Old Orlick to himself , ` Somehow or another I 'll have him ! '
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 15]: When I looks for you , I finds your uncle Provis , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 22]: Mill Pond Bank , and Chinks 's Basin , and the Old Green Copper Ropewalk , all so clear and plain !
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 45]: Provis in his rooms , the signal whose use was over , pretty Clara , the good motherly woman , old Bill Barley on his back , all drifting by , as on the swift stream of my life fast running out to sea !
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 7]: `` You with a uncle too !
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 67]: Why , I know 'd you at Gargery 's when you was so small a wolf that I could have took your weazen betwixt this finger and thumb and chucked you away dead -LRB- as I 'd thoughts o ' doing , odd times , when I see you loitering amongst the pollards on a Sunday -RRB- , and you had n't found no uncles then .
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 5]: No , not you !
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 64]: But when Old Orlick come for to hear that your uncle Provis had most like wore the leg-iron wot Old Orlick had picked up , filed asunder , on these meshes ever so many year ago , and wot he kep by him till he dropped your sister with it , like a bullock , as he means to drop you -- hey ?
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 12]: -- when he come for to hear that -- hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 26]: In his savage taunting , he flared the candle so close at me that I turned my face aside to save it from the flame .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 18]: he cried , laughing , after doing it again , `` the burnt child dreads the fire !
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 33]: Old Orlick knowed you was burnt , Old Orlick knowed you was smuggling your uncle Provis away , Old Orlick 's a match for you and know 'd you 'd come to-night !
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 15]: Now I 'll tell you something more , wolf , and this ends it .
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 21]: There 's them that 's as good a match for your uncle Provis as Old Orlick has been for you .
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 13]: Let him ` ware them , when he 's lost his nevvy !
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 29]: Let him ` ware them , when no man ca n't find a rag of his dear relation 's clothes , nor yet a bone of his body .
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 21]: There 's them that ca n't and that wo n't have Magwitch , -- yes , I know the name !
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 43]: -- alive in the same land with them , and that 's had such sure information of him when he was alive in another land , as that he could n't and should n't leave it unbeknown and put them in danger .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 21]: P'raps it 's them that writes fifty hands , and that 's not like sneaking you as writes but one .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 11]: ` Ware Compeyson , Magwitch , and the gallows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 35]: He flared the candle at me again , smoking my face and hair , and for an instant blinding me , and turned his powerful back as he replaced the light on the table .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 23]: I had thought a prayer , and had been with Joe and Biddy and Herbert , before he turned towards me again .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 17]: There was a clear space of a few feet between the table and the opposite wall .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 11]: Within this space , he now slouched backwards and forwards .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 36]: His great strength seemed to sit stronger upon him than ever before , as he did this with his hands hanging loose and heavy at his sides , and with his eyes scowling at me .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 8]: I had no grain of hope left .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 60]: Wild as my inward hurry was , and wonderful the force of the pictures that rushed by me instead of thoughts , I could yet clearly understand that , unless he had resolved that I was within a few moments of surely perishing out of all human knowledge , he would never have told me what he had told .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 20]: Of a sudden , he stopped , took the cork out of his bottle , and tossed it away .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 13]: Light as it was , I heard it fall like a plummet .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 22]: He swallowed slowly , tilting up the bottle by little and little , and now he looked at me no more .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 19]: The last few drops of liquor he poured into the palm of his hand , and licked up .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 36]: Then , with a sudden hurry of violence and swearing horribly , he threw the bottle from him , and stooped ; and I saw in his hand a stone-hammer with a long heavy handle .
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 37]: The resolution I had made did not desert me , for , without uttering one vain word of appeal to him , I shouted out with all my might , and struggled with all my might .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 33]: It was only my head and my legs that I could move , but to that extent I struggled with all the force , until then unknown , that was within me .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 58]: In the same instant I heard responsive shouts , saw figures and a gleam of light dash in at the door , heard voices and tumult , and saw Orlick emerge from a struggle of men , as if it were tumbling water , clear the table at a leap , and fly out into the night .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 30]: After a blank , I found that I was lying unbound , on the floor , in the same place , with my head on some one 's knee .
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 50]: My eyes were fixed on the ladder against the wall , when I came to myself , -- had opened on it before my mind saw it , -- and thus as I recovered consciousness , I knew that I was in the place where I had lost it .
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 33]: Too indifferent at first , even to look round and ascertain who supported me , I was lying looking at the ladder , when there came between me and it a face .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 7]: The face of Trabb 's boy !
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 9]: `` I think he 's all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 20]: said Trabb 's boy , in a sober voice ; `` but ai n't he just pale though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 27]: At these words , the face of him who supported me looked over into mine , and I saw my supporter to be -- `` Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 4]: Great Heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 7]: `` Softly , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 5]: `` Gently , Handel .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 7]: Do n't be too eager . ''
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 9]: `` And our old comrade , Startop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 10]: I cried , as he too bent over me .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 21]: `` Remember what he is going to assist us in , '' said Herbert , `` and be calm . ''
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 18]: The allusion made me spring up ; though I dropped again from the pain in my arm .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 13]: `` The time has not gone by , Herbert , has it ?
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 5]: What night is to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 8]: How long have I been here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 34]: For , I had a strange and strong misgiving that I had been lying there a long time -- a day and a night , -- two days and nights , -- more .
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 8]: `` The time has not gone by .
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 7]: It is still Monday night . ''
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 5]: `` Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 17]: `` And you have all to-morrow , Tuesday , to rest in , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 12]: `` But you ca n't help groaning , my dear Handel .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 6]: What hurt have you got ?
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 5]: Can you stand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 14]: `` Yes , yes , '' said I , `` I can walk .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 11]: I have no hurt but in this throbbing arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 11]: They laid it bare , and did what they could .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 17]: It was violently swollen and inflamed , and I could scarcely endure to have it touched .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 37]: But , they tore up their handkerchiefs to make fresh bandages , and carefully replaced it in the sling , until we could get to the town and obtain some cooling lotion to put upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 27]: In a little while we had shut the door of the dark and empty sluice-house , and were passing through the quarry on our way back .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 31]: Trabb 's boy -- Trabb 's overgrown young man now -- went before us with a lantern , which was the light I had seen come in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 30]: But , the moon was a good two hours higher than when I had last seen the sky , and the night , though rainy , was much lighter .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 30]: The white vapor of the kiln was passing from us as we went by , and as I had thought a prayer before , I thought a thanksgiving now .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 84]: Entreating Herbert to tell me how he had come to my rescue , -- which at first he had flatly refused to do , but had insisted on my remaining quiet , -- I learnt that I had in my hurry dropped the letter , open , in our chambers , where he , coming home to bring with him Startop whom he had met in the street on his way to me , found it , very soon after I was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 26]: Its tone made him uneasy , and the more so because of the inconsistency between it and the hasty letter I had left for him .
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 40]: His uneasiness increasing instead of subsiding , after a quarter of an hour 's consideration , he set off for the coach-office with Startop , who volunteered his company , to make inquiry when the next coach went down .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 33]: Finding that the afternoon coach was gone , and finding that his uneasiness grew into positive alarm , as obstacles came in his way , he resolved to follow in a post-chaise .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 39]: So he and Startop arrived at the Blue Boar , fully expecting there to find me , or tidings of me ; but , finding neither , went on to Miss Havisham 's , where they lost me .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 42]: Hereupon they went back to the hotel -LRB- doubtless at about the time when I was hearing the popular local version of my own story -RRB- to refresh themselves and to get some one to guide them out upon the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 52]: Among the loungers under the Boar 's archway happened to be Trabb 's Boy , -- true to his ancient habit of happening to be everywhere where he had no business , -- and Trabb 's boy had seen me passing from Miss Havisham 's in the direction of my dining-place .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 32]: Thus Trabb 's boy became their guide , and with him they went out to the sluice-house , though by the town way to the marshes , which I had avoided .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 83]: Now , as they went along , Herbert reflected , that I might , after all , have been brought there on some genuine and serviceable errand tending to Provis 's safety , and , bethinking himself that in that case interruption must be mischievous , left his guide and Startop on the edge of the quarry , and went on by himself , and stole round the house two or three times , endeavouring to ascertain whether all was right within .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 60]: As he could hear nothing but indistinct sounds of one deep rough voice -LRB- this was while my mind was so busy -RRB- , he even at last began to doubt whether I was there , when suddenly I cried out loudly , and he answered the cries , and rushed in , closely followed by the other two .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 37]: When I told Herbert what had passed within the house , he was for our immediately going before a magistrate in the town , late at night as it was , and getting out a warrant .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 29]: But , I had already considered that such a course , by detaining us there , or binding us to come back , might be fatal to Provis .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 19]: There was no gainsaying this difficulty , and we relinquished all thoughts of pursuing Orlick at that time .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 51]: For the present , under the circumstances , we deemed it prudent to make rather light of the matter to Trabb 's boy ; who , I am convinced , would have been much affected by disappointment , if he had known that his intervention saved me from the limekiln .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 37]: Not that Trabb 's boy was of a malignant nature , but that he had too much spare vivacity , and that it was in his constitution to want variety and excitement at anybody 's expense .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 46]: When we parted , I presented him with two guineas -LRB- which seemed to meet his views -RRB- , and told him that I was sorry ever to have had an ill opinion of him -LRB- which made no impression on him at all -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 43]: Wednesday being so close upon us , we determined to go back to London that night , three in the post-chaise ; the rather , as we should then be clear away before the night 's adventure began to be talked of .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 38]: Herbert got a large bottle of stuff for my arm ; and by dint of having this stuff dropped over it all the night through , I was just able to bear its pain on the journey .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 24]: It was daylight when we reached the Temple , and I went at once to bed , and lay in bed all day .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 33]: My terror , as I lay there , of falling ill , and being unfitted for tomorrow , was so besetting , that I wonder it did not disable me of itself .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 32]: It would have done so , pretty surely , in conjunction with the mental wear and tear I had suffered , but for the unnatural strain upon me that to-morrow was .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 21]: So anxiously looked forward to , charged with such consequences , its results so impenetrably hidden , though so near .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 24]: No precaution could have been more obvious than our refraining from communication with him that day ; yet this again increased my restlessness .
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 27]: I started at every footstep and every sound , believing that he was discovered and taken , and this was the messenger to tell me so .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 40]: I persuaded myself that I knew he was taken ; that there was something more upon my mind than a fear or a presentiment ; that the fact had occurred , and I had a mysterious knowledge of it .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 36]: As the days wore on , and no ill news came , as the day closed in and darkness fell , my overshadowing dread of being disabled by illness before to-morrow morning altogether mastered me .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 20]: My burning arm throbbed , and my burning head throbbed , and I fancied I was beginning to wander .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 24]: I counted up to high numbers , to make sure of myself , and repeated passages that I knew in prose and verse .
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 44]: It happened sometimes that in the mere escape of a fatigued mind , I dozed for some moments or forgot ; then I would say to myself with a start , `` Now it has come , and I am turning delirious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 21]: They kept me very quiet all day , and kept my arm constantly dressed , and gave me cooling drinks .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 32]: Whenever I fell asleep , I awoke with the notion I had had in the sluice-house , that a long time had elapsed and the opportunity to save him was gone .
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 30]: About midnight I got out of bed and went to Herbert , with the conviction that I had been asleep for four-and-twenty hours , and that Wednesday was past .
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 17]: It was the last self-exhausting effort of my fretfulness , for after that I slept soundly .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 11]: Wednesday morning was dawning when I looked out of window .
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 23]: The winking lights upon the bridges were already pale , the coming sun was like a marsh of fire on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 34]: The river , still dark and mysterious , was spanned by bridges that were turning coldly gray , with here and there at top a warm touch from the burning in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 45]: As I looked along the clustered roofs , with church-towers and spires shooting into the unusually clear air , the sun rose up , and a veil seemed to be drawn from the river , and millions of sparkles burst out upon its waters .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 18]: From me too , a veil seemed to be drawn , and I felt strong and well .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 17]: Herbert lay asleep in his bed , and our old fellow-student lay asleep on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 28]: I could not dress myself without help ; but I made up the fire , which was still burning , and got some coffee ready for them .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 34]: In good time they too started up strong and well , and we admitted the sharp morning air at the windows , and looked at the tide that was still flowing towards us .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 33]: `` When it turns at nine o'clock , '' said Herbert , cheerfully , `` look out for us , and stand ready , you over there at Mill Pond Bank ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 34]: Chapter LIV It was one of those March days when the sun shines hot and the wind blows cold : when it is summer in the light , and winter in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 13]: We had out pea-coats with us , and I took a bag .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 18]: Of all my worldly possessions I took no more than the few necessaries that filled the bag .
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 42]: Where I might go , what I might do , or when I might return , were questions utterly unknown to me ; nor did I vex my mind with them , for it was wholly set on Provis 's safety .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 32]: I only wondered for the passing moment , as I stopped at the door and looked back , under what altered circumstances I should next see those rooms , if ever .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 28]: We loitered down to the Temple stairs , and stood loitering there , as if we were not quite decided to go upon the water at all .
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 18]: Of course , I had taken care that the boat should be ready and everything in order .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 42]: After a little show of indecision , which there were none to see but the two or three amphibious creatures belonging to our Temple stairs , we went on board and cast off ; Herbert in the bow , I steering .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 10]: It was then about high-water , -- half-past eight .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 5]: Our plan was this .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 35]: The tide , beginning to run down at nine , and being with us until three , we intended still to creep on after it had turned , and row against it until dark .
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 53]: We should then be well in those long reaches below Gravesend , between Kent and Essex , where the river is broad and solitary , where the water-side inhabitants are very few , and where lone public-houses are scattered here and there , of which we could choose one for a resting-place .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 10]: There , we meant to lie by all night .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 20]: The steamer for Hamburg and the steamer for Rotterdam would start from London at about nine on Thursday morning .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 41]: We should know at what time to expect them , according to where we were , and would hail the first ; so that , if by any accident we were not taken abroad , we should have another chance .
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 9]: We knew the distinguishing marks of each vessel .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 37]: The relief of being at last engaged in the execution of the purpose was so great to me that I felt it difficult to realize the condition in which I had been a few hours before .
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 48]: The crisp air , the sunlight , the movement on the river , and the moving river itself , -- the road that ran with us , seeming to sympathize with us , animate us , and encourage us on , -- freshened me with new hope .
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 39]: I felt mortified to be of so little use in the boat ; but , there were few better oarsmen than my two friends , and they rowed with a steady stroke that was to last all day .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 25]: At that time , the steam-traffic on the Thames was far below its present extent , and watermen 's boats were far more numerous .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 36]: Of barges , sailing colliers , and coasting-traders , there were perhaps , as many as now ; but of steam-ships , great and small , not a tithe or a twentieth part so many .
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 67]: Early as it was , there were plenty of scullers going here and there that morning , and plenty of barges dropping down with the tide ; the navigation of the river between bridges , in an open boat , was a much easier and commoner matter in those days than it is in these ; and we went ahead among many skiffs and wherries briskly .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 36]: Old London Bridge was soon passed , and old Billingsgate Market with its oyster-boats and Dutchmen , and the White Tower and Traitor 's Gate , and we were in among the tiers of shipping .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 99]: Here were the Leith , Aberdeen , and Glasgow steamers , loading and unloading goods , and looking immensely high out of the water as we passed alongside ; here , were colliers by the score and score , with the coal-whippers plunging off stages on deck , as counterweights to measures of coal swinging up , which were then rattled over the side into barges ; here , at her moorings was to-morrow 's steamer for Rotterdam , of which we took good notice ; and here to-morrow 's for Hamburg , under whose bowsprit we crossed .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 26]: And now I , sitting in the stern , could see , with a faster beating heart , Mill Pond Bank and Mill Pond stairs .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 6]: `` Is he there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 5]: `` Not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 11]: He was not to come down till he saw us .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 7]: Can you see his signal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 13]: `` Not well from here ; but I think I see it .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 6]: -- Now I see him !
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 3]: Pull both .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 4]: Easy , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 3]: Oars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 22]: We touched the stairs lightly for a single moment , and he was on board , and we were off again .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 27]: He had a boat-cloak with him , and a black canvas bag ; and he looked as like a river-pilot as my heart could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 5]: `` Dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 16]: he said , putting his arm on my shoulder , as he took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 8]: `` Faithful dear boy , well done .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 5]: Thankye , thankye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 191]: Again among the tiers of shipping , in and out , avoiding rusty chain-cables frayed hempen hawsers and bobbing buoys , sinking for the moment floating broken baskets , scattering floating chips of wood and shaving , cleaving floating scum of coal , in and out , under the figure-head of the John of Sunderland making a speech to the winds -LRB- as is done by many Johns -RRB- , and the Betsy of Yarmouth with a firm formality of bosom and her knobby eyes starting two inches out of her head ; in and out , hammers going in ship-builders ' yards , saws going at timber , clashing engines going at things unknown , pumps going in leaky ships , capstans going , ships going out to sea , and unintelligible sea-creatures roaring curses over the bulwarks at respondent lightermen , in and out , -- out at last upon the clearer river , where the ships ' boys might take their fenders in , no longer fishing in troubled waters with them over the side , and where the festooned sails might fly out to the wind .
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 26]: At the Stairs where we had taken him abroad , and ever since , I had looked warily for any token of our being suspected .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 5]: I had seen none .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 23]: We certainly had not been , and at that time as certainly we were not either attended or followed by any boat .
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 33]: If we had been waited on by any boat , I should have run in to shore , and have obliged her to go on , or to make her purpose evident .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 11]: But we held our own without any appearance of molestation .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 22]: He had his boat-cloak on him , and looked , as I have said , a natural part of the scene .
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 27]: It was remarkable -LRB- but perhaps the wretched life he had led accounted for it -RRB- that he was the least anxious of any of us .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 55]: He was not indifferent , for he told me that he hoped to live to see his gentleman one of the best of gentlemen in a foreign country ; he was not disposed to be passive or resigned , as I understood it ; but he had no notion of meeting danger half way .
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 19]: When it came upon him , he confronted it , but it must come before he troubled himself .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 45]: `` If you knowed , dear boy , '' he said to me , `` what it is to sit here alonger my dear boy and have my smoke , arter having been day by day betwixt four walls , you 'd envy me .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 10]: But you do n't know what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 14]: `` I think I know the delights of freedom , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 12]: `` Ah , '' said he , shaking his head gravely .
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 11]: `` But you do n't know it equal to me .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 31]: You must have been under lock and key , dear boy , to know it equal to me , -- but I ai n't a going to be low . ''
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 26]: It occurred to me as inconsistent , that , for any mastering idea , he should have endangered his freedom , and even his life .
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 31]: But I reflected that perhaps freedom without danger was too much apart from all the habit of his existence to be to him what it would be to another man .
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 61]: I was not far out , since he said , after smoking a little : -- `` You see , dear boy , when I was over yonder , t ` other side the world , I was always a looking to this side ; and it come flat to be there , for all I was a growing rich .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 24]: Everybody knowed Magwitch , and Magwitch could come , and Magwitch could go , and nobody 's head would be troubled about him .
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 27]: They ai n't so easy concerning me here , dear boy , -- would n't be , leastwise , if they knowed where I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 25]: `` If all goes well , '' said I , `` you will be perfectly free and safe again within a few hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 18]: `` Well , '' he returned , drawing a long breath , `` I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 6]: `` And think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 45]: He dipped his hand in the water over the boat 's gunwale , and said , smiling with that softened air upon him which was not new to me : -- `` Ay , I s ` pose I think so , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 16]: We 'd be puzzled to be more quiet and easy-going than we are at present .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 64]: But -- it 's a flowing so soft and pleasant through the water , p ` raps , as makes me think it -- I was a thinking through my smoke just then , that we can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river what I catches hold of .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 16]: Nor yet we ca n't no more hold their tide than I can hold this .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 14]: And it 's run through my fingers and gone , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 6]: holding up his dripping hand .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 27]: `` But for your face I should think you were a little despondent , '' said I. `` Not a bit on it , dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 26]: It comes of flowing on so quiet , and of that there rippling at the boat 's head making a sort of a Sunday tune .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 11]: Maybe I 'm a growing a trifle old besides . ''
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 30]: He put his pipe back in his mouth with an undisturbed expression of face , and sat as composed and contented as if we were already out of England .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 58]: Yet he was as submissive to a word of advice as if he had been in constant terror ; for , when we ran ashore to get some bottles of beer into the boat , and he was stepping out , I hinted that I thought he would be safest where he was , and he said .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 8]: `` Do you , dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 6]: and quietly sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 22]: The air felt cold upon the river , but it was a bright day , and the sunshine was very cheering .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 24]: The tide ran strong , I took care to lose none of it , and our steady stroke carried us on thoroughly well .
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 45]: By imperceptible degrees , as the tide ran out , we lost more and more of the nearer woods and hills , and dropped lower and lower between the muddy banks , but the tide was yet with us when we were off Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 57]: As our charge was wrapped in his cloak , I purposely passed within a boat or two 's length of the floating Custom House , and so out to catch the stream , alongside of two emigrant ships , and under the bows of a large transport with troops on the forecastle looking down at us .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 81]: And soon the tide began to slacken , and the craft lying at anchor to swing , and presently they had all swung round , and the ships that were taking advantage of the new tide to get up to the Pool began to crowd upon us in a fleet , and we kept under the shore , as much out of the strength of the tide now as we could , standing carefully off from low shallows and mudbanks .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 39]: Our oarsmen were so fresh , by dint of having occasionally let her drive with the tide for a minute or two , that a quarter of an hour 's rest proved full as much as they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 22]: We got ashore among some slippery stones while we ate and drank what we had with us , and looked about .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 45]: It was like my own marsh country , flat and monotonous , and with a dim horizon ; while the winding river turned and turned , and the great floating buoys upon it turned and turned , and everything else seemed stranded and still .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 127]: For now the last of the fleet of ships was round the last low point we had headed ; and the last green barge , straw-laden , with a brown sail , had followed ; and some ballast-lighters , shaped like a child 's first rude imitation of a boat , lay low in the mud ; and a little squat shoal-lighthouse on open piles stood crippled in the mud on stilts and crutches ; and slimy stakes stuck out of the mud , and slimy stones stuck out of the mud , and red landmarks and tidemarks stuck out of the mud , and an old landing-stage and an old roofless building slipped into the mud , and all about us was stagnation and mud .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 12]: We pushed off again , and made what way we could .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 25]: It was much harder work now , but Herbert and Startop persevered , and rowed and rowed and rowed until the sun went down .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 20]: By that time the river had lifted us a little , so that we could see above the bank .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 63]: There was the red sun , on the low level of the shore , in a purple haze , fast deepening into black ; and there was the solitary flat marsh ; and far away there were the rising grounds , between which and us there seemed to be no life , save here and there in the foreground a melancholy gull .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 49]: As the night was fast falling , and as the moon , being past the full , would not rise early , we held a little council ; a short one , for clearly our course was to lie by at the first lonely tavern we could find .
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 19]: So , they plied their oars once more , and I looked out for anything like a house .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 15]: Thus we held on , speaking little , for four or five dull miles .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 26]: It was very cold , and , a collier coming by us , with her galley-fire smoking and flaring , looked like a comfortable home .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 45]: The night was as dark by this time as it would be until morning ; and what light we had , seemed to come more from the river than the sky , as the oars in their dipping struck at a few reflected stars .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 17]: At this dismal time we were evidently all possessed by the idea that we were followed .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 38]: As the tide made , it flapped heavily at irregular intervals against the shore ; and whenever such a sound came , one or other of us was sure to start , and look in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 33]: Here and there , the set of the current had worn down the bank into a little creek , and we were all suspicious of such places , and eyed them nervously .
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 9]: Sometimes , `` What was that ripple ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 10]: one of us would say in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 11]: Or another , `` Is that a boat yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 30]: And afterwards we would fall into a dead silence , and I would sit impatiently thinking with what an unusual amount of noise the oars worked in the thowels .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 29]: At length we descried a light and a roof , and presently afterwards ran alongside a little causeway made of stones that had been picked up hard by .
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 24]: Leaving the rest in the boat , I stepped ashore , and found the light to be in a window of a public-house .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 42]: It was a dirty place enough , and I dare say not unknown to smuggling adventurers ; but there was a good fire in the kitchen , and there were eggs and bacon to eat , and various liquors to drink .
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 20]: Also , there were two double-bedded rooms , -- `` such as they were , '' the landlord said .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 44]: No other company was in the house than the landlord , his wife , and a grizzled male creature , the `` Jack '' of the little causeway , who was as slimy and smeary as if he had been low-water mark too .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 41]: With this assistant , I went down to the boat again , and we all came ashore , and brought out the oars , and rudder and boat-hook , and all else , and hauled her up for the night .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 32]: We made a very good meal by the kitchen fire , and then apportioned the bedrooms : Herbert and Startop were to occupy one ; I and our charge the other .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 38]: We found the air as carefully excluded from both , as if air were fatal to life ; and there were more dirty clothes and bandboxes under the beds than I should have thought the family possessed .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 20]: But we considered ourselves well off , notwithstanding , for a more solitary place we could not have found .
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 81]: While we were comforting ourselves by the fire after our meal , the Jack -- who was sitting in a corner , and who had a bloated pair of shoes on , which he had exhibited while we were eating our eggs and bacon , as interesting relics that he had taken a few days ago from the feet of a drowned seaman washed ashore -- asked me if we had seen a four-oared galley going up with the tide ?
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 29]: When I told him No , he said she must have gone down then , and yet she `` took up too , '' when she left there .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 26]: `` They must ha ' thought better o n't for some reason or another , '' said the Jack , `` and gone down . ''
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 10]: `` A four-oared galley , did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 17]: said I. `` A four , '' said the Jack , `` and two sitters . ''
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 8]: `` Did they come ashore here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 13]: `` They put in with a stone two-gallon jar for some beer .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 27]: I 'd ha ' been glad to pison the beer myself , '' said the Jack , `` or put some rattling physic in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 10]: `` I know why , '' said the Jack .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 17]: He spoke in a slushy voice , as if much mud had washed into his throat .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 40]: `` He thinks , '' said the landlord , a weakly meditative man with a pale eye , who seemed to rely greatly on his Jack , -- `` he thinks they was , what they was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 12]: `` I knows what I thinks , '' observed the Jack .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 10]: `` You thinks Custum ` Us , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 4]: said the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 9]: `` I do , '' said the Jack .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 9]: `` Then you 're wrong , Jack . ''
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 5]: `` AM I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 47]: In the infinite meaning of his reply and his boundless confidence in his views , the Jack took one of his bloated shoes off , looked into it , knocked a few stones out of it on the kitchen floor , and put it on again .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 21]: He did this with the air of a Jack who was so right that he could afford to do anything .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 19]: `` Why , what do you make out that they done with their buttons then , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 7]: asked the landlord , vacillating weakly .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 7]: `` Done with their buttons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 4]: returned the Jack .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 5]: `` Chucked 'em overboard .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 3]: Swallered 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 9]: Sowed 'em , to come up small salad .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 6]: Done with their buttons ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 20]: `` Do n't be cheeky , Jack , '' remonstrated the landlord , in a melancholy and pathetic way .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 39]: `` A Custum ` Us officer knows what to do with his Buttons , '' said the Jack , repeating the obnoxious word with the greatest contempt , `` when they comes betwixt him and his own light .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 41]: A four and two sitters do n't go hanging and hovering , up with one tide and down with another , and both with and against another , without there being Custum ` Us at the bottom of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 27]: Saying which he went out in disdain ; and the landlord , having no one to reply upon , found it impracticable to pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 12]: This dialogue made us all uneasy , and me very uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 29]: The dismal wind was muttering round the house , the tide was flapping at the shore , and I had a feeling that we were caged and threatened .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 27]: A four-oared galley hovering about in so unusual a way as to attract this notice was an ugly circumstance that I could not get rid of .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 36]: When I had induced Provis to go up to bed , I went outside with my two companions -LRB- Startop by this time knew the state of the case -RRB- , and held another council .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 40]: Whether we should remain at the house until near the steamer 's time , which would be about one in the afternoon , or whether we should put off early in the morning , was the question we discussed .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 43]: On the whole we deemed it the better course to lie where we were , until within an hour or so of the steamer 's time , and then to get out in her track , and drift easily with the tide .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 16]: Having settled to do this , we returned into the house and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 20]: I lay down with the greater part of my clothes on , and slept well for a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 31]: When I awoke , the wind had risen , and the sign of the house -LRB- the Ship -RRB- was creaking and banging about , with noises that startled me .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 17]: Rising softly , for my charge lay fast asleep , I looked out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 35]: It commanded the causeway where we had hauled up our boat , and , as my eyes adapted themselves to the light of the clouded moon , I saw two men looking into her .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 41]: They passed by under the window , looking at nothing else , and they did not go down to the landing-place which I could discern to be empty , but struck across the marsh in the direction of the Nore .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 18]: My first impulse was to call up Herbert , and show him the two men going away .
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 41]: But reflecting , before I got into his room , which was at the back of the house and adjoined mine , that he and Startop had had a harder day than I , and were fatigued , I forbore .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 17]: Going back to my window , I could see the two men moving over the marsh .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 30]: In that light , however , I soon lost them , and , feeling very cold , lay down to think of the matter , and fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 5]: We were up early .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 25]: As we walked to and fro , all four together , before breakfast , I deemed it right to recount what I had seen .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 11]: Again our charge was the least anxious of the party .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 26]: It was very likely that the men belonged to the Custom House , he said quietly , and that they had no thought of us .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 20]: I tried to persuade myself that it was so , -- as , indeed , it might easily be .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 43]: However , I proposed that he and I should walk away together to a distant point we could see , and that the boat should take us aboard there , or as near there as might prove feasible , at about noon .
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 23]: This being considered a good precaution , soon after breakfast he and I set forth , without saying anything at the tavern .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 19]: He smoked his pipe as we went along , and sometimes stopped to clap me on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 23]: One would have supposed that it was I who was in danger , not he , and that he was reassuring me .
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 5]: We spoke very little .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 37]: As we approached the point , I begged him to remain in a sheltered place , while I went on to reconnoitre ; for it was towards it that the men had passed in the night .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 9]: He complied , and I went on alone .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 29]: There was no boat off the point , nor any boat drawn up anywhere near it , nor were there any signs of the men having embarked there .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 21]: But , to be sure , the tide was high , and there might have been some footpints under water .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 60]: When he looked out from his shelter in the distance , and saw that I waved my hat to him to come up , he rejoined me , and there we waited ; sometimes lying on the bank , wrapped in our coats , and sometimes moving about to warm ourselves , until we saw our boat coming round .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 15]: We got aboard easily , and rowed out into the track of the steamer .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 22]: By that time it wanted but ten minutes of one o'clock , and we began to look out for her smoke .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 25]: But , it was half-past one before we saw her smoke , and soon afterwards we saw behind it the smoke of another steamer .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 29]: As they were coming on at full speed , we got the two bags ready , and took that opportunity of saying good by to Herbert and Startop .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 46]: We had all shaken hands cordially , and neither Herbert 's eyes nor mine were quite dry , when I saw a four-oared galley shoot out from under the bank but a little way ahead of us , and row out into the same track .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 37]: A stretch of shore had been as yet between us and the steamer 's smoke , by reason of the bend and wind of the river ; but now she was visible , coming head on .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 36]: I called to Herbert and Startop to keep before the tide , that she might see us lying by for her , and I adjured Provis to sit quite still , wrapped in his cloak .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 19]: He answered cheerily , `` Trust to me , dear boy , '' and sat like a statue .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 25]: Meantime the galley , which was very skilfully handled , had crossed us , let us come up with her , and fallen alongside .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 30]: Leaving just room enough for the play of the oars , she kept alongside , drifting when we drifted , and pulling a stroke or two when we pulled .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 52]: Of the two sitters one held the rudder-lines , and looked at us attentively , -- as did all the rowers ; the other sitter was wrapped up , much as Provis was , and seemed to shrink , and whisper some instruction to the steerer as he looked at us .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 9]: Not a word was spoken in either boat .
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 36]: Startop could make out , after a few minutes , which steamer was first , and gave me the word `` Hamburg , '' in a low voice , as we sat face to face .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 18]: She was nearing us very fast , and the beating of her peddles grew louder and louder .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 17]: I felt as if her shadow were absolutely upon us , when the galley hailed us .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 3]: I answered .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 17]: `` You have a returned Transport there , '' said the man who held the lines .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 11]: `` That 's the man , wrapped in the cloak .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 9]: His name is Abel Magwitch , otherwise Provis .
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 18]: I apprehend that man , and call upon him to surrender , and you to assist . ''
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 22]: At the same moment , without giving any audible direction to his crew , he ran the galley abroad of us .
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 35]: They had pulled one sudden stroke ahead , had got their oars in , had run athwart us , and were holding on to our gunwale , before we knew what they were doing .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 41]: This caused great confusion on board the steamer , and I heard them calling to us , and heard the order given to stop the paddles , and heard them stop , but felt her driving down upon us irresistibly .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 51]: In the same moment , I saw the steersman of the galley lay his hand on his prisoner 's shoulder , and saw that both boats were swinging round with the force of the tide , and saw that all hands on board the steamer were running forward quite frantically .
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 34]: Still , in the same moment , I saw the prisoner start up , lean across his captor , and pull the cloak from the neck of the shrinking sitter in the galley .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 24]: Still in the same moment , I saw that the face disclosed , was the face of the other convict of long ago .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 52]: Still , in the same moment , I saw the face tilt backward with a white terror on it that I shall never forget , and heard a great cry on board the steamer , and a loud splash in the water , and felt the boat sink from under me .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 34]: It was but for an instant that I seemed to struggle with a thousand mill-weirs and a thousand flashes of light ; that instant past , I was taken on board the galley .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 22]: Herbert was there , and Startop was there ; but our boat was gone , and the two convicts were gone .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 78]: What with the cries aboard the steamer , and the furious blowing off of her steam , and her driving on , and our driving on , I could not at first distinguish sky from water or shore from shore ; but the crew of the galley righted her with great speed , and , pulling certain swift strong strokes ahead , lay upon their oars , every man looking silently and eagerly at the water astern .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 16]: Presently a dark object was seen in it , bearing towards us on the tide .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 28]: No man spoke , but the steersman held up his hand , and all softly backed water , and kept the boat straight and true before it .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 19]: As it came nearer , I saw it to be Magwitch , swimming , but not swimming freely .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 15]: He was taken on board , and instantly manacled at the wrists and ankles .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 18]: The galley was kept steady , and the silent , eager look-out at the water was resumed .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 22]: But , the Rotterdam steamer now came up , and apparently not understanding what had happened , came on at speed .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 31]: By the time she had been hailed and stopped , both steamers were drifting away from us , and we were rising and falling in a troubled wake of water .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 27]: The look-out was kept , long after all was still again and the two steamers were gone ; but everybody knew that it was hopeless now .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 29]: At length we gave it up , and pulled under the shore towards the tavern we had lately left , where we were received with no little surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 36]: Here I was able to get some comforts for Magwitch , -- Provis no longer , -- who had received some very severe injury in the Chest , and a deep cut in the head .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 28]: He told me that he believed himself to have gone under the keel of the steamer , and to have been struck on the head in rising .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 25]: The injury to his chest -LRB- which rendered his breathing extremely painful -RRB- he thought he had received against the side of the galley .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 85]: He added that he did not pretend to say what he might or might not have done to Compeyson , but that , in the moment of his laying his hand on his cloak to identify him , that villain had staggered up and staggered back , and they had both gone overboard together , when the sudden wrenching of him -LRB- Magwitch -RRB- out of our boat , and the endeavor of his captor to keep him in it , had capsized us .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 43]: He told me in a whisper that they had gone down fiercely locked in each other 's arms , and that there had been a struggle under water , and that he had disengaged himself , struck out , and swum away .
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 17]: I never had any reason to doubt the exact truth of what he thus told me .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 15]: The officer who steered the galley gave the same account of their going overboard .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 46]: When I asked this officer 's permission to change the prisoner 's wet clothes by purchasing any spare garments I could get at the public-house , he gave it readily : merely observing that he must take charge of everything his prisoner had about him .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 16]: So the pocket-book which had once been in my hands passed into the officer 's .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 23]: He further gave me leave to accompany the prisoner to London ; but declined to accord that grace to my two friends .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 33]: The Jack at the Ship was instructed where the drowned man had gone down , and undertook to search for the body in the places where it was likeliest to come ashore .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 21]: His interest in its recovery seemed to me to be much heightened when he heard that it had stockings on .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 36]: Probably , it took about a dozen drowned men to fit him out completely ; and that may have been the reason why the different articles of his dress were in various stages of decay .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 24]: We remained at the public-house until the tide turned , and then Magwitch was carried down to the galley and put on board .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 17]: Herbert and Startop were to get to London by land , as soon as they could .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 29]: We had a doleful parting , and when I took my place by Magwitch 's side , I felt that that was my place henceforth while he lived .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 63]: For now , my repugnance to him had all melted away ; and in the Hunted , wounded , shackled creature who held my hand in his , I only saw a man who had meant to be my benefactor , and who had felt affectionately , gratefully , and generously , towards me with great constancy through a series of years .
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 16]: I only saw in him a much better man than I had been to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 22]: His breathing became more difficult and painful as the night drew on , and often he could not repress a groan .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 47]: I tried to rest him on the arm I could use , in any easy position ; but it was dreadful to think that I could not be sorry at heart for his being badly hurt , since it was unquestionably best that he should die .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 23]: That there were , still living , people enough who were able and willing to identify him , I could not doubt .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 12]: That he would be leniently treated , I could not hope .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 51]: He who had been presented in the worst light at his trial , who had since broken prison and had been tried again , who had returned from transportation under a life sentence , and who had occasioned the death of the man who was the cause of his arrest .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 44]: As we returned towards the setting sun we had yesterday left behind us , and as the stream of our hopes seemed all running back , I told him how grieved I was to think that he had come home for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 18]: `` Dear boy , '' he answered , `` I 'm quite content to take my chance .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 16]: I 've seen my boy , and he can be a gentleman without me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 15]: I had thought about that , while we had been there side by side .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 15]: Apart from any inclinations of my own , I understood Wemmick 's hint now .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 16]: I foresaw that , being convicted , his possessions would be forfeited to the Crown .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 27]: `` Lookee here , dear boy , '' said he `` It 's best as a gentleman should not be knowed to belong to me now .
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 14]: Only come to see me as if you come by chance alonger Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 29]: Sit where I can see you when I am swore to , for the last o ' many times , and I do n't ask no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 23]: `` I will never stir from your side , '' said I , `` when I am suffered to be near you .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 18]: Please God , I will be as true to you as you have been to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 47]: I felt his hand tremble as it held mine , and he turned his face away as he lay in the bottom of the boat , and I heard that old sound in his throat , -- softened now , like all the rest of him .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 45]: It was a good thing that he had touched this point , for it put into my mind what I might not otherwise have thought of until too late , -- that he need never know how his hopes of enriching me had perished .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 49]: Chapter LV He was taken to the Police Court next day , and would have been immediately committed for trial , but that it was necessary to send down for an old officer of the prison-ship from which he had once escaped , to speak to his identity .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 45]: Nobody doubted it ; but Compeyson , who had meant to depose to it , was tumbling on the tides , dead , and it happened that there was not at that time any prison officer in London who could give the required evidence .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 35]: I had gone direct to Mr. Jaggers at his private house , on my arrival over night , to retain his assistance , and Mr. Jaggers on the prisoner 's behalf would admit nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 38]: It was the sole resource ; for he told me that the case must be over in five minutes when the witness was there , and that no power on earth could prevent its going against us .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 19]: I imparted to Mr. Jaggers my design of keeping him in ignorance of the fate of his wealth .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 38]: Mr. Jaggers was querulous and angry with me for having `` let it slip through my fingers , '' and said we must memorialize by and by , and try at all events for some of it .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 38]: But he did not conceal from me that , although there might be many cases in which the forfeiture would not be exacted , there were no circumstances in this case to make it one of them .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 6]: I understood that very well .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 43]: I was not related to the outlaw , or connected with him by any recognizable tie ; he had put his hand to no writing or settlement in my favor before his apprehension , and to do so now would be idle .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 35]: I had no claim , and I finally resolved , and ever afterwards abided by the resolution , that my heart should never be sickened with the hopeless task of attempting to establish one .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 32]: There appeared to be reason for supposing that the drowned informer had hoped for a reward out of this forfeiture , and had obtained some accurate knowledge of Magwitch 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 43]: When his body was found , many miles from the scene of his death , and so horribly disfigured that he was only recognizable by the contents of his pockets , notes were still legible , folded in a case he carried .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 30]: Among these were the name of a banking-house in New South Wales , where a sum of money was , and the designation of certain lands of considerable value .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 30]: Both these heads of information were in a list that Magwitch , while in prison , gave to Mr. Jaggers , of the possessions he supposed I should inherit .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 28]: His ignorance , poor fellow , at last served him ; he never mistrusted but that my inheritance was quite safe , with Mr. Jaggers 's aid .
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 33]: After three days ' delay , during which the crown prosecution stood over for the production of the witness from the prison-ship , the witness came , and completed the easy case .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 20]: He was committed to take his trial at the next Sessions , which would come on in a month .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 42]: It was at this dark time of my life that Herbert returned home one evening , a good deal cast down , and said , -- `` My dear Handel , I fear I shall soon have to leave you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 16]: His partner having prepared me for that , I was less surprised than he thought .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 34]: `` We shall lose a fine opportunity if I put off going to Cairo , and I am very much afraid I must go , Handel , when you most need me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 29]: `` Herbert , I shall always need you , because I shall always love you ; but my need is no greater now than at another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 8]: `` You will be so lonely . ''
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 46]: `` I have not leisure to think of that , '' said I. `` You know that I am always with him to the full extent of the time allowed , and that I should be with him all day long , if I could .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 18]: And when I come away from him , you know that my thoughts are with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 28]: The dreadful condition to which he was brought , was so appalling to both of us , that we could not refer to it in plainer words .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 34]: `` My dear fellow , '' said Herbert , `` let the near prospect of our separation -- for , it is very near -- be my justification for troubling you about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 8]: Have you thought of your future ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 15]: `` No , for I have been afraid to think of any future . ''
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 21]: `` But yours can not be dismissed ; indeed , my dear dear Handel , it must not be dismissed .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 22]: I wish you would enter on it now , as far as a few friendly words go , with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 43]: `` I will , '' said I. `` In this branch house of ours , Handel , we must have a -- '' I saw that his delicacy was avoiding the right word , so I said , `` A clerk . ''
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 4]: `` A clerk .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 27]: And I hope it is not at all unlikely that he may expand -LRB- as a clerk of your acquaintance has expanded -RRB- into a partner .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 19]: Now , Handel , -- in short , my dear boy , will you come to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 53]: There was something charmingly cordial and engaging in the manner in which after saying `` Now , Handel , '' as if it were the grave beginning of a portentous business exordium , he had suddenly given up that tone , stretched out his honest hand , and spoken like a schoolboy .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 75]: `` Clara and I have talked about it again and again , '' Herbert pursued , `` and the dear little thing begged me only this evening , with tears in her eyes , to say to you that , if you will live with us when we come together , she will do her best to make you happy , and to convince her husband 's friend that he is her friend too .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 10]: We should get on so well , Handel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 28]: I thanked her heartily , and I thanked him heartily , but said I could not yet make sure of joining him as he so kindly offered .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 17]: Firstly , my mind was too preoccupied to be able to take in the subject clearly .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 5]: Secondly , -- Yes !
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 24]: Secondly , there was a vague something lingering in my thoughts that will come out very near the end of this slight narrative .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 39]: `` But if you thought , Herbert , that you could , without doing any injury to your business , leave the question open for a little while -- '' `` For any while , '' cried Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 8]: `` Six months , a year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 19]: `` Not so long as that , '' said I. `` Two or three months at most . ''
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 36]: Herbert was highly delighted when we shook hands on this arrangement , and said he could now take courage to tell me that he believed he must go away at the end of the week .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 5]: `` And Clara ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 31]: said I. `` The dear little thing , '' returned Herbert , `` holds dutifully to her father as long as he lasts ; but he wo n't last long .
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 12]: Mrs. Whimple confides to me that he is certainly going . ''
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 22]: `` Not to say an unfeeling thing , '' said I , `` he can not do better than go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 41]: `` I am afraid that must be admitted , '' said Herbert ; `` and then I shall come back for the dear little thing , and the dear little thing and I will walk quietly into the nearest church .
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 2]: Remember !
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 29]: The blessed darling comes of no family , my dear Handel , and never looked into the red book , and has n't a notion about her grandpapa .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 11]: What a fortune for the son of my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 41]: On the Saturday in that same week , I took my leave of Herbert , -- full of bright hope , but sad and sorry to leave me , -- as he sat on one of the seaport mail coaches .
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 61]: I went into a coffee-house to write a little note to Clara , telling her he had gone off , sending his love to her over and over again , and then went to my lonely home , -- if it deserved the name ; for it was now no home to me , and I had no home anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 23]: On the stairs I encountered Wemmick , who was coming down , after an unsuccessful application of his knuckles to my door .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 40]: I had not seen him alone since the disastrous issue of the attempted flight ; and he had come , in his private and personal capacity , to say a few words of explanation in reference to that failure .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 58]: `` The late Compeyson , '' said Wemmick , `` had by little and little got at the bottom of half of the regular business now transacted ; and it was from the talk of some of his people in trouble -LRB- some of his people being always in trouble -RRB- that I heard what I did .
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 34]: I kept my ears open , seeming to have them shut , until I heard that he was absent , and I thought that would be the best time for making the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 28]: I can only suppose now , that it was a part of his policy , as a very clever man , habitually to deceive his own instruments .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 12]: You do n't blame me , I hope , Mr. Pip ?
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 15]: I am sure I tried to serve you , with all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 29]: `` I am as sure of that , Wemmick , as you can be , and I thank you most earnestly for all your interest and friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 9]: `` Thank you , thank you very much .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 31]: It 's a bad job , '' said Wemmick , scratching his head , `` and I assure you I have n't been so cut up for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 13]: What I look at is the sacrifice of so much portable property .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 4]: Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 17]: `` What I think of , Wemmick , is the poor owner of the property . ''
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 11]: `` Yes , to be sure , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 32]: `` Of course , there can be no objection to your being sorry for him , and I 'd put down a five-pound note myself to get him out of it .
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 8]: But what I look at is this .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 34]: The late Compeyson having been beforehand with him in intelligence of his return , and being so determined to bring him to book , I do not think he could have been saved .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 11]: Whereas , the portable property certainly could have been saved .
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 17]: That 's the difference between the property and the owner , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 21]: I invited Wemmick to come up stairs , and refresh himself with a glass of grog before walking to Walworth .
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 5]: He accepted the invitation .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 46]: While he was drinking his moderate allowance , he said , with nothing to lead up to it , and after having appeared rather fidgety , -- `` What do you think of my meaning to take a holiday on Monday , Mr. Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 17]: `` Why , I suppose you have not done such a thing these twelve months . ''
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 12]: `` These twelve years , more likely , '' said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 8]: I 'm going to take a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 12]: More than that ; I 'm going to take a walk .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 18]: More than that ; I 'm going to ask you to take a walk with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 21]: I was about to excuse myself , as being but a bad companion just then , when Wemmick anticipated me .
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 23]: `` I know your engagements , '' said he , `` and I know you are out of sorts , Mr. Pip .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 15]: But if you could oblige me , I should take it as a kindness .
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 14]: It ai n't a long walk , and it 's an early one .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 17]: Say it might occupy you -LRB- including breakfast on the walk -RRB- from eight to twelve .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 11]: Could n't you stretch a point and manage it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 21]: He had done so much for me at various times , that this was very little to do for him .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 30]: I said I could manage it , -- would manage it , -- and he was so very much pleased by my acquiescence , that I was pleased too .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 30]: At his particular request , I appointed to call for him at the Castle at half past eight on Monday morning , and so we parted for the time .
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 39]: Punctual to my appointment , I rang at the Castle gate on the Monday morning , and was received by Wemmick himself , who struck me as looking tighter than usual , and having a sleeker hat on .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 16]: Within , there were two glasses of rum and milk prepared , and two biscuits .
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 28]: The Aged must have been stirring with the lark , for , glancing into the perspective of his bedroom , I observed that his bed was empty .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 46]: When we had fortified ourselves with the rum and milk and biscuits , and were going out for the walk with that training preparation on us , I was considerably surprised to see Wemmick take up a fishing-rod , and put it over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 10]: `` Why , we are not going fishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 19]: said I. `` No , '' returned Wemmick , `` but I like to walk with one . ''
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 16]: I thought this odd ; however , I said nothing , and we set off .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 20]: We went towards Camberwell Green , and when we were thereabouts , Wemmick said suddenly , -- `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 6]: Here 's a church ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 38]: There was nothing very surprising in that ; but again , I was rather surprised , when he said , as if he were animated by a brilliant idea , -- `` Let 's go in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 17]: We went in , Wemmick leaving his fishing-rod in the porch , and looked all round .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 20]: In the mean time , Wemmick was diving into his coat-pockets , and getting something out of paper there .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 10]: `` Here 's a couple of pair of gloves !
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 7]: Let 's put 'em on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 28]: As the gloves were white kid gloves , and as the post-office was widened to its utmost extent , I now began to have my strong suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 20]: They were strengthened into certainty when I beheld the Aged enter at a side door , escorting a lady .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 4]: `` Halloa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 3]: said Wemmick .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 6]: `` Here 's Miss Skiffins !
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 7]: Let 's have a wedding . ''
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 26]: That discreet damsel was attired as usual , except that she was now engaged in substituting for her green kid gloves a pair of white .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 16]: The Aged was likewise occupied in preparing a similar sacrifice for the altar of Hymen .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 68]: The old gentleman , however , experienced so much difficulty in getting his gloves on , that Wemmick found it necessary to put him with his back against a pillar , and then to get behind the pillar himself and pull away at them , while I for my part held the old gentleman round the waist , that he might present and equal and safe resistance .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 15]: By dint of this ingenious scheme , his gloves were got on to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 17]: The clerk and clergyman then appearing , we were ranged in order at those fatal rails .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 36]: True to his notion of seeming to do it all without preparation , I heard Wemmick say to himself , as he took something out of his waistcoat-pocket before the service began , `` Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 6]: Here 's a ring ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 41]: I acted in the capacity of backer , or best-man , to the bridegroom ; while a little limp pew-opener in a soft bonnet like a baby 's , made a feint of being the bosom friend of Miss Skiffins .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 27]: The responsibility of giving the lady away devolved upon the Aged , which led to the clergyman 's being unintentionally scandalized , and it happened thus .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 17]: When he said , `` Who giveth this woman to be married to this man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 28]: the old gentlemen , not in the least knowing what point of the ceremony we had arrived at , stood most amiably beaming at the ten commandments .
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 21]: Upon which , the clergyman said again , `` WHO giveth this woman to be married to this man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 33]: The old gentleman being still in a state of most estimable unconsciousness , the bridegroom cried out in his accustomed voice , `` Now Aged P. you know ; who giveth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 28]: To which the Aged replied with great briskness , before saying that he gave , `` All right , John , all right , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 28]: And the clergyman came to so gloomy a pause upon it , that I had doubts for the moment whether we should get completely married that day .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 38]: It was completely done , however , and when we were going out of church Wemmick took the cover off the font , and put his white gloves in it , and put the cover on again .
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 21]: Mrs. Wemmick , more heedful of the future , put her white gloves in her pocket and assumed her green .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 35]: `` Now , Mr. Pip , '' said Wemmick , triumphantly shouldering the fishing-rod as we came out , `` let me ask you whether anybody would suppose this to be a wedding-party ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 46]: Breakfast had been ordered at a pleasant little tavern , a mile or so away upon the rising ground beyond the green ; and there was a bagatelle board in the room , in case we should desire to unbend our minds after the solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 52]: It was pleasant to observe that Mrs. Wemmick no longer unwound Wemmick 's arm when it adapted itself to her figure , but sat in a high-backed chair against the wall , like a violoncello in its case , and submitted to be embraced as that melodious instrument might have done .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 34]: We had an excellent breakfast , and when any one declined anything on table , Wemmick said , `` Provided by contract , you know ; do n't be afraid of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 32]: I drank to the new couple , drank to the Aged , drank to the Castle , saluted the bride at parting , and made myself as agreeable as I could .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 22]: Wemmick came down to the door with me , and I again shook hands with him , and wished him joy .
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 4]: `` Thankee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 7]: said Wemmick , rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 14]: `` She 's such a manager of fowls , you have no idea .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 11]: You shall have some eggs , and judge for yourself .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 7]: I say , Mr. Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 8]: calling me back , and speaking low .
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 11]: `` This is altogether a Walworth sentiment , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 4]: `` I understand .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 14]: Not to be mentioned in Little Britain , '' said I. Wemmick nodded .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 20]: `` After what you let out the other day , Mr. Jaggers may as well not know of it .
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 15]: He might think my brain was softening , or something of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 26]: Chapter LVI He lay in prison very ill , during the whole interval between his committal for trial and the coming round of the Sessions .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 27]: He had broken two ribs , they had wounded one of his lungs , and he breathed with great pain and difficulty , which increased daily .
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 24]: It was a consequence of his hurt that he spoke so low as to be scarcely audible ; therefore he spoke very little .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 37]: But he was ever ready to listen to me ; and it became the first duty of my life to say to him , and read to him , what I knew he ought to hear .
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 26]: Being far too ill to remain in the common prison , he was removed , after the first day or so , into the infirmary .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 16]: This gave me opportunities of being with him that I could not otherwise have had .
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 29]: And but for his illness he would have been put in irons , for he was regarded as a determined prison-breaker , and I know not what else .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 42]: Although I saw him every day , it was for only a short time ; hence , the regularly recurring spaces of our separation were long enough to record on his face any slight changes that occurred in his physical state .
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 41]: I do not recollect that I once saw any change in it for the better ; he wasted , and became slowly weaker and worse , day by day , from the day when the prison door closed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 19]: The kind of submission or resignation that he showed was that of a man who was tired out .
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 38]: I sometimes derived an impression , from his manner or from a whispered word or two which escaped him , that he pondered over the question whether he might have been a better man under better circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 24]: But he never justified himself by a hint tending that way , or tried to bend the past out of its eternal shape .
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 30]: It happened on two or three occasions in my presence , that his desperate reputation was alluded to by one or other of the people in attendance on him .
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 47]: A smile crossed his face then , and he turned his eyes on me with a trustful look , as if he were confident that I had seen some small redeeming touch in him , even so long ago as when I was a little child .
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 19]: As to all the rest , he was humble and contrite , and I never knew him complain .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 25]: When the Sessions came round , Mr. Jaggers caused an application to be made for the postponement of his trial until the following Sessions .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 19]: It was obviously made with the assurance that he could not live so long , and was refused .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 24]: The trial came on at once , and , when he was put to the bar , he was seated in a chair .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 29]: No objection was made to my getting close to the dock , on the outside of it , and holding the hand that he stretched forth to me .
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 9]: The trial was very short and very clear .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 27]: Such things as could be said for him were said , -- how he had taken to industrious habits , and had thriven lawfully and reputably .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 22]: But nothing could unsay the fact that he had returned , and was there in presence of the Judge and Jury .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 17]: It was impossible to try him for that , and do otherwise than find him guilty .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 43]: At that time , it was the custom -LRB- as I learnt from my terrible experience of that Sessions -RRB- to devote a concluding day to the passing of Sentences , and to make a finishing effect with the Sentence of Death .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 42]: But for the indelible picture that my remembrance now holds before me , I could scarcely believe , even as I write these words , that I saw two-and-thirty men and women put before the Judge to receive that sentence together .
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 21]: Foremost among the two-and-thirty was he ; seated , that he might get breath enough to keep life in him .
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 36]: The whole scene starts out again in the vivid colors of the moment , down to the drops of April rain on the windows of the court , glittering in the rays of April sun .
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 50]: Penned in the dock , as I again stood outside it at the corner with his hand in mine , were the two-and-thirty men and women ; some defiant , some stricken with terror , some sobbing and weeping , some covering their faces , some staring gloomily about .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 22]: There had been shrieks from among the women convicts ; but they had been stilled , and a hush had succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 46]: The sheriffs with their great chains and nosegays , other civic gewgaws and monsters , criers , ushers , a great gallery full of people , -- a large theatrical audience , -- looked on , as the two-and-thirty and the Judge were solemnly confronted .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 6]: Then the Judge addressed them .
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 73]: Among the wretched creatures before him whom he must single out for special address was one who almost from his infancy had been an offender against the laws ; who , after repeated imprisonments and punishments , had been at length sentenced to exile for a term of years ; and who , under circumstances of great violence and daring , had made his escape and been re-sentenced to exile for life .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 37]: That miserable man would seem for a time to have become convinced of his errors , when far removed from the scenes of his old offences , and to have lived a peaceable and honest life .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 49]: But in a fatal moment , yielding to those propensities and passions , the indulgence of which had so long rendered him a scourge to society , he had quitted his haven of rest and repentance , and had come back to the country where he was proscribed .
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 69]: Being here presently denounced , he had for a time succeeded in evading the officers of Justice , but being at length seized while in the act of flight , he had resisted them , and had -- he best knew whether by express design , or in the blindness of his hardihood -- caused the death of his denouncer , to whom his whole career was known .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 33]: The appointed punishment for his return to the land that had cast him out , being Death , and his case being this aggravated case , he must prepare himself to Die .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 73]: The sun was striking in at the great windows of the court , through the glittering drops of rain upon the glass , and it made a broad shaft of light between the two-and-thirty and the Judge , linking both together , and perhaps reminding some among the audience how both were passing on , with absolute equality , to the greater Judgment that knoweth all things , and can not err .
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 47]: Rising for a moment , a distinct speck of face in this way of light , the prisoner said , `` My Lord , I have received my sentence of Death from the Almighty , but I bow to yours , '' and sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 20]: There was some hushing , and the Judge went on with what he had to say to the rest .
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 62]: Then they were all formally doomed , and some of them were supported out , and some of them sauntered out with a haggard look of bravery , and a few nodded to the gallery , and two or three shook hands , and others went out chewing the fragments of herb they had taken from the sweet herbs lying about .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 74]: He went last of all , because of having to be helped from his chair , and to go very slowly ; and he held my hand while all the others were removed , and while the audience got up -LRB- putting their dresses right , as they might at church or elsewhere -RRB- , and pointed down at this criminal or at that , and most of all at him and me .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 63]: I earnestly hoped and prayed that he might die before the Recorder 's Report was made ; but , in the dread of his lingering on , I began that night to write out a petition to the Home Secretary of State , setting forth my knowledge of him , and how it was that he had come back for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 49]: I wrote it as fervently and pathetically as I could ; and when I had finished it and sent it in , I wrote out other petitions to such men in authority as I hoped were the most merciful , and drew up one to the Crown itself .
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 30]: For several days and nights after he was sentenced I took no rest except when I fell asleep in my chair , but was wholly absorbed in these appeals .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 37]: And after I had sent them in , I could not keep away from the places where they were , but felt as if they were more hopeful and less desperate when I was near them .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 30]: In this unreasonable restlessness and pain of mind I would roam the streets of an evening , wandering by those offices and houses where I had left the petitions .
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 43]: To the present hour , the weary western streets of London on a cold , dusty spring night , with their ranges of stern , shut-up mansions , and their long rows of lamps , are melancholy to me from this association .
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 18]: The daily visits I could make him were shortened now , and he was more strictly kept .
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 58]: Seeing , or fancying , that I was suspected of an intention of carrying poison to him , I asked to be searched before I sat down at his bedside , and told the officer who was always there , that I was willing to do anything that would assure him of the singleness of my designs .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 9]: Nobody was hard with him or with me .
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 16]: There was duty to be done , and it was done , but not harshly .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 47]: The officer always gave me the assurance that he was worse , and some other sick prisoners in the room , and some other prisoners who attended on them as sick nurses , -LRB- malefactors , but not incapable of kindness , God be thanked ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 7]: always joined in the same report .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 48]: As the days went on , I noticed more and more that he would lie placidly looking at the white ceiling , with an absence of light in his face until some word of mine brightened it for an instant , and then it would subside again .
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 32]: Sometimes he was almost or quite unable to speak , then he would answer me with slight pressures on my hand , and I grew to understand his meaning very well .
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 24]: The number of the days had risen to ten , when I saw a greater change in him than I had seen yet .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 15]: His eyes were turned towards the door , and lighted up as I entered .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 23]: `` Dear boy , '' he said , as I sat down by his bed : `` I thought you was late .
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 10]: But I knowed you could n't be that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 20]: `` It is just the time , '' said I. `` I waited for it at the gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 16]: `` You always waits at the gate ; do n't you , dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 10]: Not to lose a moment of the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 11]: `` Thank ` ee dear boy , thank ` ee .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 4]: God bless you !
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 10]: You 've never deserted me , dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 21]: I pressed his hand in silence , for I could not forget that I had once meant to desert him .
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 36]: `` And what 's the best of all , '' he said , `` you 've been more comfortable alonger me , since I was under a dark cloud , than when the sun shone .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 7]: That 's best of all . ''
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 11]: He lay on his back , breathing with great difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 34]: Do what he would , and love me though he did , the light left his face ever and again , and a film came over the placid look at the white ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 9]: `` Are you in much pain to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 12]: `` I do n't complain of none , dear boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 7]: `` You never do complain . ''
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 7]: He had spoken his last words .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 25]: He smiled , and I understood his touch to mean that he wished to lift my hand , and lay it on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 18]: I laid it there , and he smiled again , and put both his hands upon it .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 39]: The allotted time ran out , while we were thus ; but , looking round , I found the governor of the prison standing near me , and he whispered , `` You need n't go yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 22]: I thanked him gratefully , and asked , `` Might I speak to him , if he can hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 11]: The governor stepped aside , and beckoned the officer away .
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 31]: The change , though it was made without noise , drew back the film from the placid look at the white ceiling , and he looked most affectionately at me .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 13]: `` Dear Magwitch , I must tell you now , at last .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 7]: You understand what I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 7]: A gentle pressure on my hand .
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 14]: `` You had a child once , whom you loved and lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 7]: A stronger pressure on my hand .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 9]: `` She lived , and found powerful friends .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 5]: She is living now .
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 8]: She is a lady and very beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 6]: And I love her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 29]: With a last faint effort , which would have been powerless but for my yielding to it and assisting it , he raised my hand to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 20]: Then , he gently let it sink upon his breast again , with his own hands lying on it .
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 23]: The placid look at the white ceiling came back , and passed away , and his head dropped quietly on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 55]: Mindful , then , of what we had read together , I thought of the two men who went up into the Temple to pray , and I knew there were no better words that I could say beside his bed , than `` O Lord , be merciful to him a sinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 41]: Chapter LVII Now that I was left wholly to myself , I gave notice of my intention to quit the chambers in the Temple as soon as my tenancy could legally determine , and in the meanwhile to underlet them .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 36]: At once I put bills up in the windows ; for , I was in debt , and had scarcely any money , and began to be seriously alarmed by the state of my affairs .
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 39]: I ought rather to write that I should have been alarmed if I had had energy and concentration enough to help me to the clear perception of any truth beyond the fact that I was falling very ill .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 45]: The late stress upon me had enabled me to put off illness , but not to put it away ; I knew that it was coming on me now , and I knew very little else , and was even careless as to that .
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 45]: For a day or two , I lay on the sofa , or on the floor , -- anywhere , according as I happened to sink down , -- with a heavy head and aching limbs , and no purpose , and no power .
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 46]: Then there came , one night which appeared of great duration , and which teemed with anxiety and horror ; and when in the morning I tried to sit up in my bed and think of it , I found I could not do so .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 178]: Whether I really had been down in Garden Court in the dead of the night , groping about for the boat that I supposed to be there ; whether I had two or three times come to myself on the staircase with great terror , not knowing how I had got out of bed ; whether I had found myself lighting the lamp , possessed by the idea that he was coming up the stairs , and that the lights were blown out ; whether I had been inexpressibly harassed by the distracted talking , laughing , and groaning of some one , and had half suspected those sounds to be of my own making ; whether there had been a closed iron furnace in a dark corner of the room , and a voice had called out , over and over again , that Miss Havisham was consuming within it , -- these were things that I tried to settle with myself and get into some order , as I lay that morning on my bed .
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 34]: But the vapor of a limekiln would come between me and them , disordering them all , and it was through the vapor at last that I saw two men looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 13]: I asked , starting ; `` I do n't know you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 41]: `` Well , sir , '' returned one of them , bending down and touching me on the shoulder , `` this is a matter that you 'll soon arrange , I dare say , but you 're arrested . ''
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 7]: `` What is the debt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 10]: `` Hundred and twenty-three pound , fifteen , six .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 8]: Jeweller 's account , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 8]: `` What is to be done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 14]: `` You had better come to my house , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 9]: `` I keep a very nice house . ''
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 11]: I made some attempt to get up and dress myself .
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 21]: When I next attended to them , they were standing a little off from the bed , looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 5]: I still lay there .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 26]: `` You see my state , '' said I. `` I would come with you if I could ; but indeed I am quite unable .
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 17]: If you take me from here , I think I shall die by the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 24]: Perhaps they replied , or argued the point , or tried to encourage me to believe that I was better than I thought .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 30]: Forasmuch as they hang in my memory by only this one slender thread , I do n't know what they did , except that they forbore to remove me .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 130]: That I had a fever and was avoided , that I suffered greatly , that I often lost my reason , that the time seemed interminable , that I confounded impossible existences with my own identity ; that I was a brick in the house-wall , and yet entreating to be released from the giddy place where the builders had set me ; that I was a steel beam of a vast engine , clashing and whirling over a gulf , and yet that I implored in my own person to have the engine stopped , and my part in it hammered off ; that I passed through these phases of disease , I know of my own remembrance , and did in some sort know at the time .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 56]: That I sometimes struggled with real people , in the belief that they were murderers , and that I would all at once comprehend that they meant to do me good , and would then sink exhausted in their arms , and suffer them to lay me down , I also knew at the time .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 80]: But , above all , I knew that there was a constant tendency in all these people , -- who , when I was very ill , would present all kinds of extraordinary transformations of the human face , and would be much dilated in size , -- above all , I say , I knew that there was an extraordinary tendency in all these people , sooner or later , to settle down into the likeness of Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 31]: After I had turned the worst point of my illness , I began to notice that while all its other features changed , this one consistent feature did not change .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 11]: Whoever came about me , still settled down into Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 22]: I opened my eyes in the night , and I saw , in the great chair at the bedside , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 29]: I opened my eyes in the day , and , sitting on the window-seat , smoking his pipe in the shaded open window , still I saw Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 18]: I asked for cooling drink , and the dear hand that gave it me was Joe 's .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 26]: I sank back on my pillow after drinking , and the face that looked so hopefully and tenderly upon me was the face of Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 19]: At last , one day , I took courage , and said , `` Is it Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 16]: And the dear old home-voice answered , `` Which it air , old chap . ''
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 9]: `` O Joe , you break my heart !
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 7]: Look angry at me , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 5]: Strike me , Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 6]: Tell me of my ingratitude .
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 9]: Do n't be so good to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 31]: For Joe had actually laid his head down on the pillow at my side , and put his arm round my neck , in his joy that I knew him .
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 21]: `` Which dear old Pip , old chap , '' said Joe , `` you and me was ever friends .
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 17]: And when you 're well enough to go out for a ride -- what larks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 21]: After which , Joe withdrew to the window , and stood with his back towards me , wiping his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 28]: And as my extreme weakness prevented me from getting up and going to him , I lay there , penitently whispering , `` O God bless him !
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 9]: O God bless this gentle Christian man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 26]: Joe 's eyes were red when I next found him beside me ; but I was holding his hand , and we both felt happy .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 8]: `` How long , dear Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 19]: `` Which you meantersay , Pip , how long have your illness lasted , dear old chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 6]: `` Yes , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 10]: `` It 's the end of May , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 8]: To-morrow is the first of June . ''
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 14]: `` And have you been here all that time , dear Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 7]: `` Pretty nigh , old chap .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 77]: For , as I says to Biddy when the news of your being ill were brought by letter , which it were brought by the post , and being formerly single he is now married though underpaid for a deal of walking and shoe-leather , but wealth were not a object on his part , and marriage were the great wish of his hart -- '' `` It is so delightful to hear you , Joe !
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 12]: But I interrupt you in what you said to Biddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 40]: `` Which it were , '' said Joe , `` that how you might be amongst strangers , and that how you and me having been ever friends , a wisit at such a moment might not prove unacceptabobble .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 18]: And Biddy , her word were , ` Go to him , without loss of time . '
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 20]: That , '' said Joe , summing up with his judicial air , `` were the word of Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 16]: ` Go to him , ' Biddy say , ` without loss of time . '
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 46]: In short , I should n't greatly deceive you , '' Joe added , after a little grave reflection , `` if I represented to you that the word of that young woman were , ` without a minute 's loss of time . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 55]: There Joe cut himself short , and informed me that I was to be talked to in great moderation , and that I was to take a little nourishment at stated frequent times , whether I felt inclined for it or not , and that I was to submit myself to all his orders .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 26]: So I kissed his hand , and lay quiet , while he proceeded to indite a note to Biddy , with my love in it .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 8]: Evidently Biddy had taught Joe to write .
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 34]: As I lay in bed looking at him , it made me , in my weak state , cry again with pleasure to see the pride with which he set about his letter .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 47]: My bedstead , divested of its curtains , had been removed , with me upon it , into the sitting-room , as the airiest and largest , and the carpet had been taken away , and the room kept always fresh and wholesome night and day .
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 58]: At my own writing-table , pushed into a corner and cumbered with little bottles , Joe now sat down to his great work , first choosing a pen from the pen-tray as if it were a chest of large tools , and tucking up his sleeves as if he were going to wield a crow-bar or sledgehammer .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 65]: It was necessary for Joe to hold on heavily to the table with his left elbow , and to get his right leg well out behind him , before he could begin ; and when he did begin he made every down-stroke so slowly that it might have been six feet long , while at every up-stroke I could hear his pen spluttering extensively .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 35]: He had a curious idea that the inkstand was on the side of him where it was not , and constantly dipped his pen into space , and seemed quite satisfied with the result .
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 80]: Occasionally , he was tripped up by some orthographical stumbling-block ; but on the whole he got on very well indeed ; and when he had signed his name , and had removed a finishing blot from the paper to the crown of his head with his two forefingers , he got up and hovered about the table , trying the effect of his performance from various points of view , as it lay there , with unbounded satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 31]: Not to make Joe uneasy by talking too much , even if I had been able to talk much , I deferred asking him about Miss Havisham until next day .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 14]: He shook his head when I then asked him if she had recovered .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 8]: `` Is she dead , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 60]: `` Why you see , old chap , '' said Joe , in a tone of remonstrance , and by way of getting at it by degrees , `` I would n't go so far as to say that , for that 's a deal to say ; but she ai n't -- '' `` Living , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 19]: `` That 's nigher where it is , '' said Joe ; `` she ai n't living . ''
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 9]: `` Did she linger long , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 43]: `` Arter you was took ill , pretty much about what you might call -LRB- if you was put to it -RRB- a week , '' said Joe ; still determined , on my account , to come at everything by degrees .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 14]: `` Dear Joe , have you heard what becomes of her property ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 34]: `` Well , old chap , '' said Joe , `` it do appear that she had settled the most of it , which I meantersay tied it up , on Miss Estella .
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 30]: But she had wrote out a little coddleshell in her own hand a day or two afore the accident , leaving a cool four thousand to Mr. Matthew Pocket .
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 22]: And why , do you suppose , above all things , Pip , she left that cool four thousand unto him ?
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 14]: ` Because of Pip 's account of him , the said Matthew . '
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 36]: I am told by Biddy , that air the writing , '' said Joe , repeating the legal turn as if it did him infinite good , ` account of him the said Matthew . '
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 9]: And a cool four thousand , Pip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 42]: I never discovered from whom Joe derived the conventional temperature of the four thousand pounds ; but it appeared to make the sum of money more to him , and he had a manifest relish in insisting on its being cool .
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 18]: This account gave me great joy , as it perfected the only good thing I had done .
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 17]: I asked Joe whether he had heard if any of the other relations had any legacies ?
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 25]: `` Miss Sarah , '' said Joe , `` she have twenty-five pound perannium fur to buy pills , on account of being bilious .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 9]: Miss Georgiana , she have twenty pound down .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 17]: Mrs. -- what 's the name of them wild beasts with humps , old chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 4]: `` Camels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 12]: said I , wondering why he could possibly want to know .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 3]: Joe nodded .
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 37]: `` Mrs. Camels , '' by which I presently understood he meant Camilla , `` she have five pound fur to buy rushlights to put her in spirits when she wake up in the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 21]: The accuracy of these recitals was sufficiently obvious to me , to give me great confidence in Joe 's information .
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 31]: `` And now , '' said Joe , `` you ai n't that strong yet , old chap , that you can take in more nor one additional shovelful to-day .
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 13]: Old Orlick he 's been a bustin ' open a dwelling-ouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 4]: `` Whose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 49]: said I. `` Not , I grant you , but what his manners is given to blusterous , '' said Joe , apologetically ; `` still , a Englishman 's ouse is his Castle , and castles must not be busted ` cept when done in war time .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 19]: And wotsume'er the failings on his part , he were a corn and seedsman in his hart . ''
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 15]: `` Is it Pumblechook 's house that has been broken into , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 81]: `` That 's it , Pip , '' said Joe ; `` and they took his till , and they took his cash-box , and they drinked his wine , and they partook of his wittles , and they slapped his face , and they pulled his nose , and they tied him up to his bedpust , and they giv ' him a dozen , and they stuffed his mouth full of flowering annuals to prewent his crying out .
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 14]: But he knowed Orlick , and Orlick 's in the county jail . ''
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 9]: By these approaches we arrived at unrestricted conversation .
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 32]: I was slow to gain strength , but I did slowly and surely become less weak , and Joe stayed with me , and I fancied I was little Pip again .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 23]: For the tenderness of Joe was so beautifully proportioned to my need , that I was like a child in his hands .
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 56]: He would sit and talk to me in the old confidence , and with the old simplicity , and in the old unassertive protecting way , so that I would half believe that all my life since the days of the old kitchen was one of the mental troubles of the fever that was gone .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 30]: He did everything for me except the household work , for which he had engaged a very decent woman , after paying off the laundress on his first arrival .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 49]: `` Which I do assure you , Pip , '' he would often say , in explanation of that liberty ; `` I found her a tapping the spare bed , like a cask of beer , and drawing off the feathers in a bucket , for sale .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 46]: Which she would have tapped yourn next , and draw 'd it off with you a laying on it , and was then a carrying away the coals gradiwally in the soup-tureen and wegetable-dishes , and the wine and spirits in your Wellington boots . ''
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 28]: We looked forward to the day when I should go out for a ride , as we had once looked forward to the day of my apprenticeship .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 62]: And when the day came , and an open carriage was got into the Lane , Joe wrapped me up , took me in his arms , carried me down to it , and put me in , as if I were still the small helpless creature to whom he had so abundantly given of the wealth of his great nature .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 40]: And Joe got in beside me , and we drove away together into the country , where the rich summer growth was already on the trees and on the grass , and sweet summer scents filled all the air .
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 87]: The day happened to be Sunday , and when I looked on the loveliness around me , and thought how it had grown and changed , and how the little wild-flowers had been forming , and the voices of the birds had been strengthening , by day and by night , under the sun and under the stars , while poor I lay burning and tossing on my bed , the mere remembrance of having burned and tossed there came like a check upon my peace .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 81]: But when I heard the Sunday bells , and looked around a little more upon the outspread beauty , I felt that I was not nearly thankful enough , -- that I was too weak yet to be even that , -- and I laid my head on Joe 's shoulder , as I had laid it long ago when he had taken me to the Fair or where not , and it was too much for my young senses .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 27]: More composure came to me after a while , and we talked as we used to talk , lying on the grass at the old Battery .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 8]: There was no change whatever in Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 27]: Exactly what he had been in my eyes then , he was in my eyes still ; just as simply faithful , and as simply right .
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 19]: When we got back again , and he lifted me out , and carried me -- so easily !
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 25]: -- across the court and up the stairs , I thought of that eventful Christmas Day when he had carried me over the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 28]: We had not yet made any allusion to my change of fortune , nor did I know how much of my late history he was acquainted with .
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 34]: I was so doubtful of myself now , and put so much trust in him , that I could not satisfy myself whether I ought to refer to it when he did not .
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 34]: `` Have you heard , Joe , '' I asked him that evening , upon further consideration , as he smoked his pipe at the window , `` who my patron was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 20]: `` I heerd , '' returned Joe , `` as it were not Miss Havisham , old chap . ''
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 11]: `` Did you hear who it was , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 25]: I heerd as it were a person what sent the person what giv ' you the bank-notes at the Jolly Bargemen , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 6]: `` So it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 4]: `` Astonishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 8]: said Joe , in the placidest way .
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 12]: `` Did you hear that he was dead , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 8]: I presently asked , with increasing diffidence .
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 3]: `` Which ?
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 9]: Him as sent the bank-notes , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 44]: `` I think , '' said Joe , after meditating a long time , and looking rather evasively at the window-seat , `` as I did hear tell that how he were something or another in a general way in that direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 12]: `` Did you hear anything of his circumstances , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 7]: `` Not partickler , Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 25]: `` If you would like to hear , Joe -- '' I was beginning , when Joe got up and came to my sofa .
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 15]: `` Lookee here , old chap , '' said Joe , bending over me .
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 14]: `` Ever the best of friends ; ai n't us , Pip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 7]: I was ashamed to answer him .
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 27]: `` Wery good , then , '' said Joe , as if I had answered ; `` that 's all right ; that 's agreed upon .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 20]: Then why go into subjects , old chap , which as betwixt two sech must be for ever onnecessary ?
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 13]: There 's subjects enough as betwixt two sech , without onnecessary ones .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 10]: To think of your poor sister and her Rampages !
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 8]: And do n't you remember Tickler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 8]: `` I do indeed , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 11]: `` Lookee here , old chap , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 26]: `` I done what I could to keep you and Tickler in sunders , but my power were not always fully equal to my inclinations .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 57]: For when your poor sister had a mind to drop into you , it were not so much , '' said Joe , in his favorite argumentative way , `` that she dropped into me too , if I put myself in opposition to her , but that she dropped into you always heavier for it .
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 4]: I noticed that .
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 46]: It ai n't a grab at a man 's whisker , not yet a shake or two of a man -LRB- to which your sister was quite welcome -RRB- , that ` ud put a man off from getting a little child out of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 38]: But when that little child is dropped into heavier for that grab of whisker or shaking , then that man naterally up and says to himself , ` Where is the good as you are a doing ?
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 23]: I grant you I see the ` arm , ' says the man , ` but I do n't see the good .
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 17]: I call upon you , sir , therefore , to pint out the good . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 6]: `` The man says ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 11]: I observed , as Joe waited for me to speak .
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 9]: `` The man says , '' Joe assented .
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 9]: `` Is he right , that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 10]: `` Dear Joe , he is always right . ''
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 17]: `` Well , old chap , '' said Joe , `` then abide by your words .
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 69]: If he 's always right -LRB- which in general he 's more likely wrong -RRB- , he 's right when he says this : Supposing ever you kep any little matter to yourself , when you was a little child , you kep it mostly because you know 'd as J. Gargery 's power to part you and Tickler in sunders were not fully equal to his inclinations .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 23]: Theerfore , think no more of it as betwixt two sech , and do not let us pass remarks upon onnecessary subjects .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 47]: Biddy giv ' herself a deal o ' trouble with me afore I left -LRB- for I am almost awful dull -RRB- , as I should view it in this light , and , viewing it in this light , as I should so put it .
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 29]: Both of which , '' said Joe , quite charmed with his logical arrangement , `` being done , now this to you a true friend , say .
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 2]: Namely .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 31]: You must n't go a overdoing on it , but you must have your supper and your wine and water , and you must be put betwixt the sheets . ''
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 46]: The delicacy with which Joe dismissed this theme , and the sweet tact and kindness with which Biddy -- who with her woman 's wit had found me out so soon -- had prepared him for it , made a deep impression on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 32]: But whether Joe knew how poor I was , and how my great expectations had all dissolved , like our own marsh mists before the sun , I could not understand .
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 47]: Another thing in Joe that I could not understand when it first began to develop itself , but which I soon arrived at a sorrowful comprehension of , was this : As I became stronger and better , Joe became a little less easy with me .
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 45]: In my weakness and entire dependence on him , the dear fellow had fallen into the old tone , and called me by the old names , the dear `` old Pip , old chap , '' that now were music in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 18]: I too had fallen into the old ways , only happy and thankful that he let me .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 54]: But , imperceptibly , though I held by them fast , Joe 's hold upon them began to slacken ; and whereas I wondered at this , at first , I soon began to understand that the cause of it was in me , and that the fault of it was all mine .
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 28]: Had I given Joe no reason to doubt my constancy , and to think that in prosperity I should grow cold to him and cast him off ?
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 46]: Had I given Joe 's innocent heart no cause to feel instinctively that as I got stronger , his hold upon me would be weaker , and that he had better loosen it in time and let me go , before I plucked myself away ?
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 33]: It was on the third or fourth occasion of my going out walking in the Temple Gardens leaning on Joe 's arm , that I saw this change in him very plainly .
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 31]: We had been sitting in the bright warm sunlight , looking at the river , and I chanced to say as we got up , -- `` See , Joe !
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 6]: I can walk quite strongly .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 12]: Now , you shall see me walk back by myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 28]: `` Which do not overdo it , Pip , '' said Joe ; `` but I shall be happy fur to see you able , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 13]: The last word grated on me ; but how could I remonstrate !
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 28]: I walked no further than the gate of the gardens , and then pretended to be weaker than I was , and asked Joe for his arm .
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 9]: Joe gave it me , but was thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 30]: I , for my part , was thoughtful too ; for , how best to check this growing change in Joe was a great perplexity to my remorseful thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 40]: That I was ashamed to tell him exactly how I was placed , and what I had come down to , I do not seek to conceal ; but I hope my reluctance was not quite an unworthy one .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 37]: He would want to help me out of his little savings , I knew , and I knew that he ought not to help me , and that I must not suffer him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 10]: It was a thoughtful evening with both of us .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 35]: But , before we went to bed , I had resolved that I would wait over to-morrow , -- to-morrow being Sunday , -- and would begin my new course with the new week .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 64]: On Monday morning I would speak to Joe about this change , I would lay aside this last vestige of reserve , I would tell him what I had in my thoughts -LRB- that Secondly , not yet arrived at -RRB- , and why I had not decided to go out to Herbert , and then the change would be conquered for ever .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 21]: As I cleared , Joe cleared , and it seemed as though he had sympathetically arrived at a resolution too .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 24]: We had a quiet day on the Sunday , and we rode out into the country , and then walked in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 16]: `` I feel thankful that I have been ill , Joe , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 19]: `` Dear old Pip , old chap , you 're a ` most come round , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 13]: `` It has been a memorable time for me , Joe . ''
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 11]: `` Likeways for myself , sir , '' Joe returned .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 16]: `` We have had a time together , Joe , that I can never forget .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 24]: There were days once , I know , that I did for a while forget ; but I never shall forget these . ''
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 20]: `` Pip , '' said Joe , appearing a little hurried and troubled , `` there has been larks .
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 15]: And , dear sir , what have been betwixt us -- have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 25]: At night , when I had gone to bed , Joe came into my room , as he had done all through my recovery .
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 17]: He asked me if I felt sure that I was as well as in the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 9]: `` Yes , dear Joe , quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 12]: `` And are always a getting stronger , old chap ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 9]: `` Yes , dear Joe , steadily . ''
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 29]: Joe patted the coverlet on my shoulder with his great good hand , and said , in what I thought a husky voice , `` Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 27]: When I got up in the morning , refreshed and stronger yet , I was full of my resolution to tell Joe all , without delay .
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 7]: I would tell him before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 27]: I would dress at once and go to his room and surprise him ; for , it was the first day I had been up early .
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 12]: I went to his room , and he was not there .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 13]: Not only was he not there , but his box was gone .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 14]: I hurried then to the breakfast-table , and on it found a letter .
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 29]: These were its brief contents : -- `` Not wishful to intrude I have departured fur you are well again dear Pip and will do better without JO .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 9]: `` P.S. Ever the best of friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 19]: Enclosed in the letter was a receipt for the debt and costs on which I had been arrested .
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 25]: Down to that moment , I had vainly supposed that my creditor had withdrawn , or suspended proceedings until I should be quite recovered .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 26]: I had never dreamed of Joe 's having paid the money ; but Joe had paid it , and the receipt was in his name .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 66]: What remained for me now , but to follow him to the dear old forge , and there to have out my disclosure to him , and my penitent remonstrance with him , and there to relieve my mind and heart of that reserved Secondly , which had begun as a vague something lingering in my thoughts , and had formed into a settled purpose ?
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 54]: The purpose was , that I would go to Biddy , that I would show her how humbled and repentant I came back , that I would tell her how I had lost all I once hoped for , that I would remind her of our old confidences in my first unhappy time .
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 45]: Then I would say to her , `` Biddy , I think you once liked me very well , when my errant heart , even while it strayed away from you , was quieter and better with you than it ever has been since .
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 82]: If you can like me only half as well once more , if you can take me with all my faults and disappointments on my head , if you can receive me like a forgiven child -LRB- and indeed I am as sorry , Biddy , and have as much need of a hushing voice and a soothing hand -RRB- , I hope I am a little worthier of you that I was , -- not much , but a little .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 66]: And , Biddy , it shall rest with you to say whether I shall work at the forge with Joe , or whether I shall try for any different occupation down in this country , or whether we shall go away to a distant place where an opportunity awaits me which I set aside , when it was offered , until I knew your answer .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 55]: And now , dear Biddy , if you can tell me that you will go through the world with me , you will surely make it a better world for me , and me a better man for it , and I will try hard to make it a better world for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 5]: Such was my purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 20]: After three days more of recovery , I went down to the old place to put it in execution .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 14]: And how I sped in it is all I have left to tell .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 28]: Chapter LVIII The tidings of my high fortunes having had a heavy fall had got down to my native place and its neighborhood before I got there .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 26]: I found the Blue Boar in possession of the intelligence , and I found that it made a great change in the Boar 's demeanour .
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 35]: Whereas the Boar had cultivated my good opinion with warm assiduity when I was coming into property , the Boar was exceedingly cool on the subject now that I was going out of property .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 20]: It was evening when I arrived , much fatigued by the journey I had so often made so easily .
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 42]: The Boar could not put me into my usual bedroom , which was engaged -LRB- probably by some one who had expectations -RRB- , and could only assign me a very indifferent chamber among the pigeons and post-chaises up the yard .
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 39]: But I had as sound a sleep in that lodging as in the most superior accommodation the Boar could have given me , and the quality of my dreams was about the same as in the best bedroom .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 19]: Early in the morning , while my breakfast was getting ready , I strolled round by Satis House .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 33]: There were printed bills on the gate and on bits of carpet hanging out of the windows , announcing a sale by auction of the Household Furniture and Effects , next week .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 16]: The House itself was to be sold as old building materials , and pulled down .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 30]: LOT 1 was marked in whitewashed knock-knee letters on the brew house ; LOT 2 on that part of the main building which had been so long shut up .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 40]: Other lots were marked off on other parts of the structure , and the ivy had been torn down to make room for the inscriptions , and much of it trailed low in the dust and was withered already .
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 76]: Stepping in for a moment at the open gate , and looking around me with the uncomfortable air of a stranger who had no business there , I saw the auctioneer 's clerk walking on the casks and telling them off for the information of a catalogue -- compiler , pen in hand , who made a temporary desk of the wheeled chair I had so often pushed along to the tune of Old Clem .
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 22]: When I got back to my breakfast in the Boar 's coffee-room , I found Mr. Pumblechook conversing with the landlord .
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 40]: Mr. Pumblechook -LRB- not improved in appearance by his late nocturnal adventure -RRB- was waiting for me , and addressed me in the following terms : -- `` Young man , I am sorry to see you brought low .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 7]: But what else could be expected !
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 7]: what else could be expected ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 27]: As he extended his hand with a magnificently forgiving air , and as I was broken by illness and unfit to quarrel , I took it .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 18]: `` William , '' said Mr. Pumblechook to the waiter , `` put a muffin on table .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 7]: And has it come to this !
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 7]: Has it come to this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 8]: I frowningly sat down to my breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 34]: Mr. Pumblechook stood over me and poured out my tea -- before I could touch the teapot -- with the air of a benefactor who was resolved to be true to the last .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 16]: `` William , '' said Mr. Pumblechook , mournfully , `` put the salt on .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 15]: In happier times , '' addressing me , `` I think you took sugar ?
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 6]: And did you take milk ?
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 3]: You did .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 4]: Sugar and milk .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 7]: William , bring a watercress . ''
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 19]: `` Thank you , '' said I , shortly , `` but I do n't eat watercresses . ''
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 40]: `` You do n't eat 'em , '' returned Mr. Pumblechook , sighing and nodding his head several times , as if he might have expected that , and as if abstinence from watercresses were consistent with my downfall .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 3]: `` True .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 7]: The simple fruits of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 9]: You need n't bring any , William . ''
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 27]: I went on with my breakfast , and Mr. Pumblechook continued to stand over me , staring fishily and breathing noisily , as he always did .
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 9]: `` Little more than skin and bone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 6]: mused Mr. Pumblechook , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 39]: `` And yet when he went from here -LRB- I may say with my blessing -RRB- , and I spread afore him my humble store , like the Bee , he was as plump as a Peach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 30]: This reminded me of the wonderful difference between the servile manner in which he had offered his hand in my new prosperity , saying , `` May I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 17]: and the ostentatious clemency with which he had just now exhibited the same fat five fingers .
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 4]: `` Hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 11]: he went on , handing me the bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 10]: `` And air you a going to Joseph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 28]: `` In heaven 's name , '' said I , firing in spite of myself , `` what does it matter to you where I am going ?
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 6]: Leave that teapot alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 19]: It was the worst course I could have taken , because it gave Pumblechook the opportunity he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 50]: `` Yes , young man , '' said he , releasing the handle of the article in question , retiring a step or two from my table , and speaking for the behoof of the landlord and waiter at the door , `` I will leave that teapot alone .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 7]: You are right , young man .
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 6]: For once you are right .
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 39]: I forgit myself when I take such an interest in your breakfast , as to wish your frame , exhausted by the debilitating effects of prodigygality , to be stimilated by the ` olesome nourishment of your forefathers .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 39]: And yet , '' said Pumblechook , turning to the landlord and waiter , and pointing me out at arm 's length , `` this is him as I ever sported with in his days of happy infancy !
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 16]: Tell me not it can not be ; I tell you this is him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 8]: A low murmur from the two replied .
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 8]: The waiter appeared to be particularly affected .
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 18]: `` This is him , '' said Pumblechook , `` as I have rode in my shay-cart .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 12]: This is him as I have seen brought up by hand .
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 34]: This is him untoe the sister of which I was uncle by marriage , as her name was Georgiana M'ria from her own mother , let him deny it if he can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 21]: The waiter seemed convinced that I could not deny it , and that it gave the case a black look .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 26]: `` Young man , '' said Pumblechook , screwing his head at me in the old fashion , `` you air a going to Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 17]: What does it matter to me , you ask me , where you air a going ?
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 15]: I say to you , Sir , you air a going to Joseph . ''
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 15]: The waiter coughed , as if he modestly invited me to get over that .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 40]: `` Now , '' said Pumblechook , and all this with a most exasperating air of saying in the cause of virtue what was perfectly convincing and conclusive , `` I will tell you what to say to Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 35]: Here is Squires of the Boar present , known and respected in this town , and here is William , which his father 's name was Potkins if I do not deceive myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 11]: `` You do not , sir , '' said William .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 24]: `` In their presence , '' pursued Pumblechook , `` I will tell you , young man , what to say to Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 22]: Says you , `` Joseph , I have this day seen my earliest benefactor and the founder of my fortun 's .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 27]: I will name no names , Joseph , but so they are pleased to call him up town , and I have seen that man . ''
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 22]: `` I swear I do n't see him here , '' said I. `` Say that likewise , '' retorted Pumblechook .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 15]: `` Say you said that , and even Joseph will probably betray surprise . ''
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 16]: `` There you quite mistake him , '' said I. `` I know better . ''
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 32]: `` Says you , '' Pumblechook went on , '' ` Joseph , I have seen that man , and that man bears you no malice and bears me no malice .
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 33]: He knows your character , Joseph , and is well acquainted with your pig-headedness and ignorance ; and he knows my character , Joseph , and he knows my want of gratitoode .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 31]: Yes , Joseph , ' says you , '' here Pumblechook shook his head and hand at me , '' ` he knows my total deficiency of common human gratitoode .
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 10]: He knows it , Joseph , as none can .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 22]: You do not know it , Joseph , having no call to know it , but that man do . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 22]: Windy donkey as he was , it really amazed me that he could have the face to talk thus to mine .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 20]: `` Says you , ` Joseph , he gave me a little message , which I will now repeat .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 17]: It was that , in my being brought low , he saw the finger of Providence .
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 15]: He knowed that finger when he saw Joseph , and he saw it plain .
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 8]: It pinted out this writing , Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 14]: Reward of ingratitoode to his earliest benefactor , and founder of fortun 's .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 16]: But that man said he did not repent of what he had done , Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 30]: It was right to do it , it was kind to do it , it was benevolent to do it , and he would do it again . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 35]: `` It 's pity , '' said I , scornfully , as I finished my interrupted breakfast , `` that the man did not say what he had done and would do again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 7]: `` Squires of the Boar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 11]: Pumblechook was now addressing the landlord , `` and William !
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 49]: I have no objections to your mentioning , either up town or down town , if such should be your wishes , that it was right to do it , kind to do it , benevolent to do it , and that I would do it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 39]: With those words the Impostor shook them both by the hand , with an air , and left the house ; leaving me much more astonished than delighted by the virtues of that same indefinite `` it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 61]: `` I was not long after him in leaving the house too , and when I went down the High Street I saw him holding forth -LRB- no doubt to the same effect -RRB- at his shop door to a select group , who honored me with very unfavorable glances as I passed on the opposite side of the way .
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 35]: But , it was only the pleasanter to turn to Biddy and to Joe , whose great forbearance shone more brightly than before , if that could be , contrasted with this brazen pretender .
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 39]: I went towards them slowly , for my limbs were weak , but with a sense of increasing relief as I drew nearer to them , and a sense of leaving arrogance and untruthfulness further and further behind .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 6]: The June weather was delicious .
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 36]: The sky was blue , the larks were soaring high over the green corn , I thought all that countryside more beautiful and peaceful by far than I had ever known it to be yet .
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 49]: Many pleasant pictures of the life that I would lead there , and of the change for the better that would come over my character when I had a guiding spirit at my side whose simple faith and clear home wisdom I had proved , beguiled my way .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 48]: They awakened a tender emotion in me ; for my heart was softened by my return , and such a change had come to pass , that I felt like one who was toiling home barefoot from distant travel , and whose wanderings had lasted many years .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 34]: The schoolhouse where Biddy was mistress I had never seen ; but , the little roundabout lane by which I entered the village , for quietness ' sake , took me past it .
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 24]: I was disappointed to find that the day was a holiday ; no children were there , and Biddy 's house was closed .
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 28]: Some hopeful notion of seeing her , busily engaged in her daily duties , before she saw me , had been in my mind and was defeated .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 30]: But the forge was a very short distance off , and I went towards it under the sweet green limes , listening for the clink of Joe 's hammer .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 29]: Long after I ought to have heard it , and long after I had fancied I heard it and found it but a fancy , all was still .
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 44]: The limes were there , and the white thorns were there , and the chestnut-trees were there , and their leaves rustled harmoniously when I stopped to listen ; but , the clink of Joe 's hammer was not in the midsummer wind .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 28]: Almost fearing , without knowing why , to come in view of the forge , I saw it at last , and saw that it was closed .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 23]: No gleam of fire , no glittering shower of sparks , no roar of bellows ; all shut up , and still .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 37]: But the house was not deserted , and the best parlor seemed to be in use , for there were white curtains fluttering in its window , and the window was open and gay with flowers .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 25]: I went softly towards it , meaning to peep over the flowers , when Joe and Biddy stood before me , arm in arm .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 26]: At first Biddy gave a cry , as if she thought it was my apparition , but in another moment she was in my embrace .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 33]: I wept to see her , and she wept to see me ; I , because she looked so fresh and pleasant ; she , because I looked so worn and white .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 11]: `` But dear Biddy , how smart you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 7]: `` Yes , dear Pip . ''
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 10]: `` And Joe , how smart you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 11]: `` Yes , dear old Pip , old chap . ''
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 23]: I looked at both of them , from one to the other , and then -- `` It 's my wedding-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 18]: cried Biddy , in a burst of happiness , `` and I am married to Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 21]: They had taken me into the kitchen , and I had laid my head down on the old deal table .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 20]: Biddy held one of my hands to her lips , and Joe 's restoring touch was on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 20]: `` Which he war n't strong enough , my dear , fur to be surprised , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 23]: And Biddy said , `` I ought to have thought of it , dear Joe , but I was too happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 38]: They were both so overjoyed to see me , so proud to see me , so touched by my coming to them , so delighted that I should have come by accident to make their day complete !
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 20]: My first thought was one of great thankfulness that I had never breathed this last baffled hope to Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 19]: How often , while he was with me in my illness , had it risen to my lips !
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 20]: How irrevocable would have been his knowledge of it , if he had remained with me but another hour !
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 47]: `` Dear Biddy , '' said I , `` you have the best husband in the whole world , and if you could have seen him by my bed you would have -- But no , you could n't love him better than you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 12]: `` No , I could n't indeed , '' said Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 39]: `` And , dear Joe , you have the best wife in the whole world , and she will make you as happy as even you deserve to be , you dear , good , noble Joe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 18]: Joe looked at me with a quivering lip , and fairly put his sleeve before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 45]: `` And Joe and Biddy both , as you have been to church to-day , and are in charity and love with all mankind , receive my humble thanks for all you have done for me , and all I have so ill repaid !
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 95]: And when I say that I am going away within the hour , for I am soon going abroad , and that I shall never rest until I have worked for the money with which you have kept me out of prison , and have sent it to you , do n't think , dear Joe and Biddy , that if I could repay it a thousand times over , I suppose I could cancel a farthing of the debt I owe you , or that I would do so if I could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 17]: They were both melted by these words , and both entreated me to say no more .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 7]: `` But I must say more .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 42]: Dear Joe , I hope you will have children to love , and that some little fellow will sit in this chimney-corner of a winter night , who may remind you of another little fellow gone out of it for ever .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 71]: Do n't tell him , Joe , that I was thankless ; do n't tell him , Biddy , that I was ungenerous and unjust ; only tell him that I honored you both , because you were both so good and true , and that , as your child , I said it would be natural to him to grow up a much better man than I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 28]: `` I ai n't a going , '' said Joe , from behind his sleeve , `` to tell him nothink o ' that natur , Pip .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 5]: Nor Biddy ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 8]: Nor yet no one ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 29]: `` And now , though I know you have already done it in your own kind hearts , pray tell me , both , that you forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 48]: Pray let me hear you say the words , that I may carry the sound of them away with me , and then I shall be able to believe that you can trust me , and think better of me , in the time to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 13]: `` O dear old Pip , old chap , '' said Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 16]: `` God knows as I forgive you , if I have anythink to forgive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 3]: `` Amen !
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 7]: And God knows I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 3]: echoed Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 22]: Now let me go up and look at my old little room , and rest there a few minutes by myself .
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 33]: And then , when I have eaten and drunk with you , go with me as far as the finger-post , dear Joe and Biddy , before we say good by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 43]: I sold all I had , and put aside as much as I could , for a composition with my creditors , -- who gave me ample time to pay them in full , -- and I went out and joined Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 32]: Within a month , I had quitted England , and within two months I was clerk to Clarriker and Co. , and within four months I assumed my first undivided responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 53]: For the beam across the parlor ceiling at Mill Pond Bank had then ceased to tremble under old Bill Barley 's growls and was at peace , and Herbert had gone away to marry Clara , and I was left in sole charge of the Eastern Branch until he brought her back .
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 43]: Many a year went round before I was a partner in the House ; but I lived happily with Herbert and his wife , and lived frugally , and paid my debts , and maintained a constant correspondence with Biddy and Joe .
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 43]: It was not until I became third in the Firm , that Clarriker betrayed me to Herbert ; but he then declared that the secret of Herbert 's partnership had been long enough upon his conscience , and he must tell it .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 30]: So he told it , and Herbert was as much moved as amazed , and the dear fellow and I were not the worse friends for the long concealment .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 24]: I must not leave it to be supposed that we were ever a great House , or that we made mints of money .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 28]: We were not in a grand way of business , but we had a good name , and worked for our profits , and did very well .
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 56]: We owed so much to Herbert 's ever cheerful industry and readiness , that I often wondered how I had conceived that old idea of his inaptitude , until I was one day enlightened by the reflection , that perhaps the inaptitude had never been in him at all , but had been in me .
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 62]: Chapter LIX For eleven years , I had not seen Joe nor Biddy with my bodily Eyes , -- though they had both been often before my fancy in the East , -- when , upon an evening in December , an hour or two after dark , I laid my hand softly on the latch of the old kitchen door .
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 16]: I touched it so softly that I was not heard , and looked in unseen .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 59]: There , smoking his pipe in the old place by the kitchen firelight , as hale and as strong as ever , though a little gray , sat Joe ; and there , fenced into the corner with Joe 's leg , and sitting on my own little stool looking at the fire , was -- I again !
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 63]: `` We giv ' him the name of Pip for your sake , dear old chap , '' said Joe , delighted , when I took another stool by the child 's side -LRB- but I did not rumple his hair -RRB- , `` and we hoped he might grow a little bit like you , and we think he do . ''
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 27]: I thought so too , and I took him out for a walk next morning , and we talked immensely , understanding one another to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 50]: And I took him down to the churchyard , and set him on a certain tombstone there , and he showed me from that elevation which stone was sacred to the memory of Philip Pirrip , late of this Parish , and Also Georgiana , Wife of the Above .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 46]: `` Biddy , '' said I , when I talked with her after dinner , as her little girl lay sleeping in her lap , `` you must give Pip to me one of these days ; or lend him , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 11]: `` No , no , '' said Biddy , gently .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 6]: `` You must marry . ''
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 17]: `` So Herbert and Clara say , but I do n't think I shall , Biddy .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 17]: I have so settled down in their home , that it 's not at all likely .
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 9]: I am already quite an old bachelor . ''
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 32]: Biddy looked down at her child , and put its little hand to her lips , and then put the good matronly hand with which she had touched it into mine .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 26]: There was something in the action , and in the light pressure of Biddy 's wedding-ring , that had a very pretty eloquence in it .
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 20]: `` Dear Pip , '' said Biddy , `` you are sure you do n't fret for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 12]: `` O no , -- I think not , Biddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 10]: `` Tell me as an old , old friend .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 6]: Have you quite forgotten her ?
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 29]: `` My dear Biddy , I have forgotten nothing in my life that ever had a foremost place there , and little that ever had any place there .
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 26]: But that poor dream , as I once used to call it , has all gone by , Biddy , -- all gone by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 32]: Nevertheless , I knew , while I said those words , that I secretly intended to revisit the site of the old house that evening , alone , for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 5]: Yes , even so .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 5]: For Estella 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 47]: I had heard of her as leading a most unhappy life , and as being separated from her husband , who had used her with great cruelty , and who had become quite renowned as a compound of pride , avarice , brutality , and meanness .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 22]: And I had heard of the death of her husband , from an accident consequent on his ill-treatment of a horse .
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 20]: This release had befallen her some two years before ; for anything I knew , she was married again .
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 31]: The early dinner hour at Joe 's , left me abundance of time , without hurrying my talk with Biddy , to walk over to the old spot before dark .
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 32]: But , what with loitering on the way to look at old objects and to think of old times , the day had quite declined when I came to the place .
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 22]: There was no house now , no brewery , no building whatever left , but the wall of the old garden .
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 40]: The cleared space had been enclosed with a rough fence , and looking over it , I saw that some of the old ivy had struck root anew , and was growing green on low quiet mounds of ruin .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 17]: A gate in the fence standing ajar , I pushed it open , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 20]: A cold silvery mist had veiled the afternoon , and the moon was not yet up to scatter it .
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 23]: But , the stars were shining beyond the mist , and the moon was coming , and the evening was not dark .
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 31]: I could trace out where every part of the old house had been , and where the brewery had been , and where the gates , and where the casks .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 23]: I had done so , and was looking along the desolate garden walk , when I beheld a solitary figure in it .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 12]: The figure showed itself aware of me , as I advanced .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 12]: It had been moving towards me , but it stood still .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 16]: As I drew nearer , I saw it to be the figure of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 25]: As I drew nearer yet , it was about to turn away , when it stopped , and let me come up with it .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 25]: Then , it faltered , as if much surprised , and uttered my name , and I cried out , -- `` Estella ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 6]: `` I am greatly changed .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 7]: I wonder you know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 19]: The freshness of her beauty was indeed gone , but its indescribable majesty and its indescribable charm remained .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 45]: Those attractions in it , I had seen before ; what I had never seen before , was the saddened , softened light of the once proud eyes ; what I had never felt before was the friendly touch of the once insensible hand .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 39]: We sat down on a bench that was near , and I said , `` After so many years , it is strange that we should thus meet again , Estella , here where our first meeting was !
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 7]: Do you often come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 9]: `` I have never been here since . ''
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 27]: `` Nor I. '' The moon began to rise , and I thought of the placid look at the white ceiling , which had passed away .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 28]: The moon began to rise , and I thought of the pressure on my hand when I had spoken the last words he had heard on earth .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 13]: Estella was the next to break the silence that ensued between us .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 20]: `` I have very often hoped and intended to come back , but have been prevented by many circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 7]: Poor , poor old place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 26]: The silvery mist was touched with the first rays of the moonlight , and the same rays touched the tears that dropped from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 43]: Not knowing that I saw them , and setting herself to get the better of them , she said quietly , -- `` Were you wondering , as you walked along , how it came to be left in this condition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 6]: `` Yes , Estella . ''
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 7]: `` The ground belongs to me .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 10]: It is the only possession I have not relinquished .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 17]: Everything else has gone from me , little by little , but I have kept this .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 18]: It was the subject of the only determined resistance I made in all the wretched years . ''
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 9]: `` Is it to be built on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 7]: `` At last , it is .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 12]: I came here to take leave of it before its change .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 25]: And you , '' she said , in a voice of touching interest to a wanderer , -- `` you live abroad still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 4]: `` Still . ''
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 10]: `` And do well , I am sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 20]: `` I work pretty hard for a sufficient living , and therefore -- yes , I do well . ''
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 12]: `` I have often thought of you , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 5]: `` Have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 7]: `` Of late , very often .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 29]: There was a long hard time when I kept far from me the remembrance of what I had thrown away when I was quite ignorant of its worth .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 26]: But since my duty has not been incompatible with the admission of that remembrance , I have given it a place in my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 15]: `` You have always held your place in my heart , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 9]: And we were silent again until she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 24]: `` I little thought , '' said Estella , `` that I should take leave of you in taking leave of this spot .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 9]: I am very glad to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 8]: `` Glad to part again , Estella ?
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 9]: To me , parting is a painful thing .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 17]: To me , the remembrance of our last parting has been ever mournful and painful . ''
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 24]: `` But you said to me , '' returned Estella , very earnestly , ` God bless you , God forgive you ! '
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 47]: And if you could say that to me then , you will not hesitate to say that to me now , -- now , when suffering has been stronger than all other teaching , and has taught me to understand what your heart used to be .
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 17]: I have been bent and broken , but -- I hope -- into a better shape .
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 19]: Be as considerate and good to me as you were , and tell me we are friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 22]: `` We are friends , '' said I , rising and bending over her , as she rose from the bench .
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 11]: `` And will continue friends apart , '' said Estella .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 65]: I took her hand in mine , and we went out of the ruined place ; and , as the morning mists had risen long ago when I first left the forge , so the evening mists were rising now , and in all the broad expanse of tranquil light they showed to me , I saw no shadow of another parting from her .
