Parsing [sent. 1 len. 35]: THE MAGNIFICENT AMBERSONS By Booth Tarkington Chapter I Major Amberson had `` made a fortune '' in 1873 , when other people were losing fortunes , and the magnificence of the Ambersons began then .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 43]: Magnificence , like the size of a fortune , is always comparative , as even Magnificent Lorenzo may now perceive , if he has happened to haunt New York in 1916 ; and the Ambersons were magnificent in their day and place .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 37]: Their splendour lasted throughout all the years that saw their Midland town spread and darken into a city , but reached its topmost during the period when every prosperous family with children kept a Newfoundland dog .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 49]: In that town , in those days , all the women who wore silk or velvet knew all the other women who wore silk or velvet , and when there was a new purchase of sealskin , sick people were got to windows to see it go by .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 50]: Trotters were out , in the winter afternoons , racing light sleighs on National Avenue and Tennessee Street ; everybody recognized both the trotters and the drivers ; and again knew them as well on summer evenings , when slim buggies whizzed by in renewals of the snow-time rivalry .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 53]: For that matter , everybody knew everybody else 's family horse-and-carriage , could identify such a silhouette half a mile down the street , and thereby was sure who was going to market , or to a reception , or coming home from office or store to noon dinner or evening supper .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 27]: During the earlier years of this period , elegance of personal appearance was believed to rest more upon the texture of garments than upon their shaping .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 23]: A silk dress needed no remodelling when it was a year or so old ; it remained distinguished by merely remaining silk .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 48]: Old men and governors wore broadcloth ; `` full dress '' was broadcloth with `` doeskin '' trousers ; and there were seen men of all ages to whom a hat meant only that rigid , tall silk thing known to impudence as a `` stove-pipe . ''
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 24]: In town and country these men would wear no other hat , and , without self-consciousness , they went rowing in such hats .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 33]: Shifting fashions of shape replaced aristocracy of texture : dressmakers , shoemakers , hatmakers , and tailors , increasing in cunning and in power , found means to make new clothes old .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 31]: The long contagion of the `` Derby '' hat arrived : one season the crown of this hat would be a bucket ; the next it would be a spoon .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 45]: Every house still kept its bootjack , but high-topped boots gave way to shoes and `` congress gaiters '' ; and these were played through fashions that shaped them now with toes like box-ends and now with toes like the prows of racing shells .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 42]: Trousers with a crease were considered plebeian ; the crease proved that the garment had lain upon a shelf , and hence was `` ready-made '' ; these betraying trousers were called `` hand-me-downs , '' in allusion to the shelf .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 97]: In the early ` eighties , while bangs and bustles were having their way with women , that variation of dandy known as the `` dude '' was invented : he wore trousers as tight as stockings , dagger-pointed shoes , a spoon `` Derby , '' a single-breasted coat called a `` Chesterfield , '' with short flaring skirts , a torturing cylindrical collar , laundered to a polish and three inches high , while his other neckgear might be a heavy , puffed cravat or a tiny bow fit for a doll 's braids .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 53]: With evening dress he wore a tan overcoat so short that his black coat-tails hung visible , five inches below the over-coat ; but after a season or two he lengthened his overcoat till it touched his heels , and he passed out of his tight trousers into trousers like great bags .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 27]: Then , presently , he was seen no more , though the word that had been coined for him remained in the vocabularies of the impertinent .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 8]: It was a hairier day than this .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 20]: Beards were to the wearers ' fancy , and things as strange as the Kaiserliche boar-tusk moustache were commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 67]: `` Side-burns '' found nourishment upon childlike profiles ; great Dundreary whiskers blew like tippets over young shoulders ; moustaches were trained as lambrequins over forgotten mouths ; and it was possible for a Senator of the United States to wear a mist of white whisker upon his throat only , not a newspaper in the land finding the ornament distinguished enough to warrant a lampoon .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 20]: Surely no more is needed to prove that so short a time ago we were living in another age !
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 23]: At the beginning of the Ambersons ' great period most of the houses of the Midland town were of a pleasant architecture .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 20]: They lacked style , but also lacked pretentiousness , and whatever does not pretend at all has style enough .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 41]: They stood in commodious yards , well shaded by leftover forest trees , elm and walnut and beech , with here and there a line of tall sycamores where the land had been made by filling bayous from the creek .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 38]: The house of a `` prominent resident , '' facing Military Square , or National Avenue , or Tennessee Street , was built of brick upon a stone foundation , or of wood upon a brick foundation .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 24]: Usually it had a `` front porch '' and a `` back porch '' ; often a `` side porch , '' too .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 24]: There was a `` front hall '' ; there was a `` side hall '' ; and sometimes a `` back hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 45]: From the `` front hall '' opened three rooms , the `` parlour , '' the `` sitting room , '' and the `` library '' ; and the library could show warrant to its title -- for some reason these people bought books .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 41]: Commonly , the family sat more in the library than in the `` sitting room , '' while callers , when they came formally , were kept to the `` parlour , '' a place of formidable polish and discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 26]: The upholstery of the library furniture was a little shabby ; but the hostile chairs and sofa of the `` parlour '' always looked new .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 16]: For all the wear and tear they got they should have lasted a thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 87]: Upstairs were the bedrooms ; `` mother-and-father 's room '' the largest ; a smaller room for one or two sons another for one or two daughters ; each of these rooms containing a double bed , a `` washstand , '' a `` bureau , '' a wardrobe , a little table , a rocking-chair , and often a chair or two that had been slightly damaged downstairs , but not enough to justify either the expense of repair or decisive abandonment in the attic .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 36]: And there was always a `` spare-room , '' for visitors -LRB- where the sewing-machine usually was kept -RRB- , and during the ` seventies there developed an appreciation of the necessity for a bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 42]: Therefore the architects placed bathrooms in the new houses , and the older houses tore out a cupboard or two , set up a boiler beside the kitchen stove , and sought a new godliness , each with its own bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 16]: The great American plumber joke , that many-branched evergreen , was planted at this time .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 45]: At the rear of the house , upstairs was a bleak little chamber , called `` the girl 's room , '' and in the stable there was another bedroom , adjoining the hayloft , and called `` the hired man 's room . ''
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 29]: House and stable cost seven or eight thousand dollars to build , and people with that much money to invest in such comforts were classified as the Rich .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 39]: They paid the inhabitant of `` the girl 's room '' two dollars a week , and , in the latter part of this period , two dollars and a half , and finally three dollars a week .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 30]: She was Irish , ordinarily , or German or it might be Scandinavian , but never native to the land unless she happened to be a person of colour .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 32]: The man or youth who lived in the stable had like wages , and sometimes he , too , was lately a steerage voyager , but much oftener he was coloured .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 52]: After sunrise , on pleasant mornings , the alleys behind the stables were gay ; laughter and shouting went up and down their dusty lengths , with a lively accompaniment of curry-combs knocking against back fences and stable walls , for the darkies loved to curry their horses in the alley .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 26]: Darkies always prefer to gossip in shouts instead of whispers ; and they feel that profanity , unless it be vociferous , is almost worthless .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 55]: Horrible phrases were caught by early rising children and carried to older people for definition , sometimes at inopportune moments ; while less investigative children would often merely repeat the phrases in some subsequent flurry of agitation , and yet bring about consequences so emphatic as to be recalled with ease in middle life .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 38]: They have passed , those darky hired-men of the Midland town ; and the introspective horses they curried and brushed and whacked and amiably cursed -- those good old horses switch their tails at flies no more .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 42]: For all their seeming permanence they might as well have been buffaloes -- or the buffalo laprobes that grew bald in patches and used to slide from the careless drivers ' knees and hang unconcerned , half way to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 42]: The stables have been transformed into other likenesses , or swept away , like the woodsheds where were kept the stove-wood and kindling that the `` girl '' and the `` hired-man '' always quarrelled over : who should fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 20]: Horse and stable and woodshed , and the whole tribe of the `` hired-man , '' all are gone .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: They went quickly , yet so silently that we whom they served have not yet really noticed that they are vanished .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 5]: So with other vanishings .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 21]: There were the little bunty street-cars on the long , single track that went its troubled way among the cobblestones .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 31]: At the rear door of the car there was no platform , but a step where passengers clung in wet clumps when the weather was bad and the car crowded .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 57]: The patrons -- if not too absent-minded -- put their fares into a slot ; and no conductor paced the heaving floor , but the driver would rap remindingly with his elbow upon the glass of the door to his little open platform if the nickels and the passengers did not appear to coincide in number .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 27]: A lone mule drew the car , and sometimes drew it off the track , when the passengers would get out and push it on again .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 75]: They really owed it courtesies like this , for the car was genially accommodating : a lady could whistle to it from an upstairs window , and the car would halt at once and wait for her while she shut the window , put on her hat and cloak , went downstairs , found an umbrella , told the `` girl '' what to have for dinner , and came forth from the house .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 29]: The previous passengers made little objection to such gallantry on the part of the car : they were wont to expect as much for themselves on like occasion .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 46]: In good weather the mule pulled the car a mile in a little less than twenty minutes , unless the stops were too long ; but when the trolley-car came , doing its mile in five minutes and better , it would wait for nobody .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 24]: Nor could its passengers have endured such a thing , because the faster they were carried the less time they had to spare !
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 51]: In the days before deathly contrivances hustled them through their lives , and when they had no telephones -- another ancient vacancy profoundly responsible for leisure -- they had time for everything : time to think , to talk , time to read , time to wait for a lady !
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 41]: They even had time to dance `` square dances , '' quadrilles , and `` lancers '' ; they also danced the `` racquette , '' and schottisches and polkas , and such whims as the `` Portland Fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 54]: They pushed back the sliding doors between the `` parlour '' and the `` sitting room , '' tacked down crash over the carpets , hired a few palms in green tubs , stationed three or four Italian musicians under the stairway in the `` front hall '' -- and had great nights !
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 23]: But these people were gayest on New Year 's Day ; they made it a true festival -- something no longer known .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 79]: The women gathered to `` assist '' the hostesses who kept `` Open House '' ; and the carefree men , dandified and perfumed , went about in sleighs , or in carriages and ponderous `` hacks , '' going from Open House to Open House , leaving fantastic cards in fancy baskets as they entered each doorway , and emerging a little later , more carefree than ever , if the punch had been to their liking .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 41]: It always was , and , as the afternoon wore on , pedestrians saw great gesturing and waving of skin-tight lemon gloves , while ruinous fragments of song were dropped behind as the carriages rolled up and down the streets .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 34]: `` Keeping Open House '' was a merry custom ; it has gone , like the all-day picnic in the woods , and like that prettiest of all vanished customs , the serenade .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 26]: When a lively girl visited the town she did not long go unserenaded , though a visitor was not indeed needed to excuse a serenade .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 102]: Of a summer night , young men would bring an orchestra under a pretty girl 's window -- or , it might be , her father 's , or that of an ailing maiden aunt -- and flute , harp , fiddle , ` cello , cornet , and bass viol would presently release to the dulcet stars such melodies as sing through `` You 'll Remember Me , '' `` I Dreamt That I Dwelt in Marble Halls , '' `` Silver Threads Among the Gold , '' `` Kathleen Mavourneen , '' or `` The Soldier 's Farewell . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 41]: They had other music to offer , too , for these were the happy days of `` Olivette '' and `` The Macotte '' and `` The Chimes of Normandy '' and `` Girofle-Girofla '' and `` Fra Diavola . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 25]: Better than that , these were the days of `` Pinafore '' and `` The Pirates of Penzance '' and of `` Patience . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 36]: This last was needed in the Midland town , as elsewhere , for the `` aesthetic movement '' had reached thus far from London , and terrible things were being done to honest old furniture .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 11]: Maidens sawed what-nots in two , and gilded the remains .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 26]: They took the rockers from rocking-chairs and gilded the inadequate legs ; they gilded the easels that supported the crayon portraits of their deceased uncles .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 32]: In the new spirit of art they sold old clocks for new , and threw wax flowers and wax fruit , and the protecting glass domes , out upon the trash-heap .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 26]: They filled vases with peacock feathers , or cattails , or sumac , or sunflowers , and set the vases upon mantelpieces and marble-topped tables .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 45]: They embroidered daisies -LRB- which they called `` marguerites '' -RRB- and sunflowers and sumac and cat-tails and owls and peacock feathers upon plush screens and upon heavy cushions , then strewed these cushions upon floors where fathers fell over them in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 59]: In the teeth of sinful oratory , the daughters went on embroidering : they embroidered daisies and sunflowers and sumac and cat-tails and owls and peacock feathers upon `` throws '' which they had the courage to drape upon horsehair sofas ; they painted owls and daisies and sunflowers and sumac and cat-tails and peacock feathers upon tambourines .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 18]: They hung Chinese umbrellas of paper to the chandeliers ; they nailed paper fans to the walls .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 54]: They `` studied '' painting on china , these girls ; they sang Tosti 's new songs ; they sometimes still practiced the old , genteel habit of lady-fainting , and were most charming of all when they drove forth , three or four in a basket phaeton , on a spring morning .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 26]: Croquet and the mildest archery ever known were the sports of people still young and active enough for so much exertion ; middle-age played euchre .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 43]: There was a theatre , next door to the Amberson Hotel , and when Edwin Booth came for a night , everybody who could afford to buy a ticket was there , and all the `` hacks '' in town were hired .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 40]: `` The Black Crook '' also filled the theatre , but the audience then was almost entirely of men who looked uneasy as they left for home when the final curtain fell upon the shocking girls dressed as fairies .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 20]: But the theatre did not often do so well ; the people of the town were still too thrifty .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 46]: They were thrifty because they were the sons or grandsons of the `` early settlers , '' who had opened the wilderness and had reached it from the East and the South with wagons and axes and guns , but with no money at all .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 49]: The pioneers were thrifty or they would have perished : they had to store away food for the winter , or goods to trade for food , and they often feared they had not stored enough -- they left traces of that fear in their sons and grandsons .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 35]: In the minds of most of these , indeed , their thrift was next to their religion : to save , even for the sake of saving , was their earliest lesson and discipline .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 31]: No matter how prosperous they were , they could not spend money either upon `` art , '' or upon mere luxury and entertainment , without a sense of sin .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 21]: Against so homespun a background the magnificence of the Ambersons was as conspicuous as a brass band at a funeral .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 38]: Major Amberson bought two hundred acres of land at the end of National Avenue ; and through this tract he built broad streets and cross-streets ; paved them with cedar block , and curbed them with stone .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 66]: He set up fountains , here and there , where the streets intersected , and at symmetrical intervals placed cast-iron statues , painted white , with their titles clear upon the pedestals : Minerva , Mercury , Hercules , Venus , Gladiator , Emperor Augustus , Fisher Boy , Stag-hound , Mastiff , Greyhound , Fawn , Antelope , Wounded Doe , and Wounded Lion .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 47]: Most of the forest trees had been left to flourish still , and , at some distance , or by moonlight , the place was in truth beautiful ; but the ardent citizen , loving to see his city grow , wanted neither distance nor moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 37]: He had not seen Versailles , but , standing before the Fountain of Neptune in Amberson Addition , at bright noon , and quoting the favourite comparison of the local newspapers , he declared Versailles outdone .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 29]: All this Art showed a profit from the start , for the lots sold well and there was something like a rush to build in the new Addition .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 51]: Its main thoroughfare , an oblique continuation of National Avenue , was called Amberson Boulevard , and here , at the juncture of the new Boulevard and the Avenue , Major Amberson reserved four acres for himself , and built his new house -- the Amberson Mansion , of course .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 9]: This house was the pride of the town .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 34]: Faced with stone as far back as the dining-room windows , it was a house of arches and turrets and girdling stone porches : it had the first porte-cochere seen in that town .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 35]: There was a central `` front hall '' with a great black walnut stairway , and open to a green glass skylight called the `` dome , '' three stories above the ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 24]: A ballroom occupied most of the third story ; and at one end of it was a carved walnut gallery for the musicians .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 18]: Citizens told strangers that the cost of all this black walnut and wood-carving was sixty thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 9]: `` Sixty thousand dollars for the wood-work alone !
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 12]: Yes , sir , and hardwood floors all over the house !
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 27]: Turkish rugs and no carpets at all , except a Brussels carpet in the front parlour -- I hear they call it the ` reception-room . '
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 19]: Hot and cold water upstairs and down , and stationary washstands in every last bedroom in the place !
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 21]: Their sideboard 's built right into the house and goes all the way across one end of the dining room .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 10]: It is n't walnut , it 's solid mahogany !
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: Not veneering -- solid mahogany !
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 52]: Well , sir , I presume the President of the United States would be tickled to swap the White House for the new Amberson Mansion , if the Major 'd give him the chance -- but by the Almighty Dollar , you bet your sweet life the Major would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 58]: The visitor to the town was certain to receive further enlightenment , for there was one form of entertainment never omitted : he was always patriotically taken for `` a little drive around our city , '' even if his host had to hire a hack , and the climax of the display was the Amberson Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 21]: `` Look at that greenhouse they 've put up there in the side yard , '' the escort would continue .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 8]: `` And look at that brick stable !
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 39]: Most folks would think that stable plenty big enough and good enough to live in ; it 's got running water and four rooms upstairs for two hired men and one of 'em 's family to live in .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 30]: They keep one hired man loafin ' in the house , and they got a married hired man out in the stable , and his wife does the washing .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 27]: They got box-stalls for four horses , and they keep a coupay , and some new kinds of fancy rigs you never saw the beat of !
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 23]: ` Carts ' they call two of 'em -- ` way up in the air they are -- too high for me !
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 17]: I guess they got every new kind of fancy rig in there that 's been invented .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 22]: And harness -- well , everybody in town can tell when Ambersons are out driving after dark , by the jingle .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 41]: This town never did see so much style as Ambersons are putting on , these days ; and I guess it 's going to be expensive , because a lot of other folks 'll try to keep up with 'em .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 35]: The Major 's wife and the daughter 's been to Europe , and my wife tells me since they got back they make tea there every afternoon about five o'clock , and drink it .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 35]: Seems to me it would go against a person 's stomach , just before supper like that , and anyway tea is n't fit for much -- not unless you 're sick or something .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 28]: My wife says Ambersons do n't make lettuce salad the way other people do ; they do n't chop it up with sugar and vinegar at all .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 25]: They pour olive oil on it with their vinegar , and they have it separate -- not along with the rest of the meal .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 36]: And they eat these olives , too : green things they are , something like a hard plum , but a friend of mine told me they tasted a good deal like a bad hickory-nut .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 26]: My wife says she 's going to buy some ; you got to eat nine and then you get to like 'em , she says .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 25]: Well , I would n't eat nine bad hickory-nuts to get to like them , and I 'm going to let these olives alone .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 35]: Kind of a woman 's dish , anyway , I suspect , but most everybody 'll be makin ' a stagger to worm through nine of 'em , now Ambersons brought 'em to town .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 17]: Yes , sir , the rest 'll eat 'em , whether they get sick or not !
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 29]: Looks to me like some people in this city 'd be willing to go crazy if they thought that would help 'em to be as high-toned as Ambersons .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 38]: Old Aleck Minafer -- he 's about the closest old codger we got -- he come in my office the other day , and he pretty near had a stroke tellin ' me about his daughter Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 29]: Seems Miss Isabel Amberson 's got some kind of a dog -- they call it a Saint Bernard -- and Fanny was bound to have one , too .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 40]: Well , old Aleck told her he did n't like dogs except rat-terriers , because a rat-terrier cleans up the mice , but she kept on at him , and finally he said all right she could have one .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 5]: Then , by George !
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 28]: she says Ambersons bought their dog , and you ca n't get one without paying for it : they cost from fifty to a hundred dollars up !
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 38]: Old Aleck wanted to know if I ever heard of anybody buyin ' a dog before , because , of course , even a Newfoundland or a setter you can usually get somebody to give you one .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 54]: He says he saw some sense in payin ' a nigger a dime , or even a quarter , to drown a dog for you , but to pay out fifty dollars and maybe more -- well , sir , he like to choked himself to death , right there in my office !
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 49]: Of course everybody realizes that Major Amberson is a fine business man , but what with throwin ' money around for dogs , and every which and what , some think all this style 's bound to break him up , if his family do n't quit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 48]: One citizen , having thus discoursed to a visitor , came to a thoughtful pause , and then added , `` Does seem pretty much like squandering , yet when you see that dog out walking with this Miss Isabel , he seems worth the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 8]: `` What 's she look like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 52]: `` Well , sir , '' said the citizen , `` she 's not more than just about eighteen or maybe nineteen years old , and I do n't know as I know just how to put it -- but she 's kind of a delightful lookin ' young lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 15]: Chapter II Another citizen said an eloquent thing about Miss Isabel Amberson 's looks .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 56]: This was Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster , the foremost literary authority and intellectual leader of the community -- for both the daily newspapers thus described Mrs. Foster when she founded the Women 's Tennyson Club ; and her word upon art , letters , and the drama was accepted more as law than as opinion .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 45]: Naturally , when `` Hazel Kirke '' finally reached the town , after its long triumph in larger places , many people waited to hear what Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster thought of it before they felt warranted in expressing any estimate of the play .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 27]: In fact , some of them waited in the lobby of the theatre , as they came out , and formed an inquiring group about her .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 13]: `` I did n't see the play , '' she informed them .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 16]: Why , we saw you , right in the middle of the fourth row ! ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' she said , smiling , `` but I was sitting just behind Isabelle Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 20]: I could n't look at anything except her wavy brown hair and the wonderful back of her neck . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 45]: The ineligible young men of the town -LRB- they were all ineligible -RRB- were unable to content themselves with the view that had so charmed Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster : they spent their time struggling to keep Miss Amberson 's face turned toward them .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 36]: She turned it most often , observers said , toward two : one excelling in the general struggle by his sparkle , and the other by that winning if not winsome old trait , persistence .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 26]: The sparkling gentleman `` led germans '' with her , and sent sonnets to her with his bouquets -- sonnets lacking neither music nor wit .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 22]: He was generous , poor , well-dressed , and his amazing persuasiveness was one reason why he was always in debt .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 62]: No one doubted that he would be able to persuade Isabel , but he unfortunately joined too merry a party one night , and , during a moonlight serenade upon the lawn before the Amberson Mansion , was easily identified from the windows as the person who stepped through the bass viol and had to be assisted to a waiting carriage .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 58]: One of Miss Amberson 's brothers was among the serenaders , and , when the party had dispersed , remained propped against the front door in a state of helpless liveliness ; the Major going down in a dressing-gown and slippers to bring him in , and scolding mildly , while imperfectly concealing strong impulses to laughter .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 33]: Miss Amberson also laughed at this brother , the next day , but for the suitor it was a different matter : she refused to see him when he called to apologize .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 13]: `` You seem to care a great deal about bass viols ! ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 4]: he wrote her .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 9]: `` I promise never to break another . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 24]: She made no response to the note , unless it was an answer , two weeks later , when her engagement was announced .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 23]: She took the persistent one , Wilbur Minafer , no breaker of bass viols or of hearts , no serenader at all .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 62]: A few people , who always foresaw everything , claimed that they were not surprised , because though Wilbur Minafer `` might not be an Apollo , as it were , '' he was `` a steady young business man , and a good church-goer , '' and Isabel Amberson was `` pretty sensible -- for such a showy girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 38]: But the engagement astounded the young people , and most of their fathers and mothers , too ; and as a topic it supplanted literature at the next meeting of the `` Women 's Tennyson Club . ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 5]: `` Wilbur Minafer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 19]: a member cried , her inflection seeming to imply that Wilbur 's crime was explained by his surname .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 4]: `` Wilbur Minafer !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 9]: It 's the queerest thing I ever heard !
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 31]: To think of her taking Wilbur Minafer , just because a man any woman would like a thousand times better was a little wild one night at a serenade ! ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 10]: `` No , '' said Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 6]: `` It is n't that .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 21]: It is n't even because she 's afraid he 'd be a dissipated husband and she wants to be safe .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 23]: It is n't because she 's religious or hates wildness ; it is n't even because she hates wildness in him . ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 15]: `` Well , but look how she 's thrown him over for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 18]: `` No , that was n't her reason , '' said the wise Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 50]: `` If men only knew it -- and it 's a good thing they do n't -- a woman does n't really care much about whether a man 's wild or not , if it does n't affect herself , and Isabel Amberson does n't care a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 5]: `` Mrs. Foster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 7]: `` No , she does n't .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 15]: What she minds is his making a clown of himself in her front yard !
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 12]: It made her think he did n't care much about her .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 43]: She 's probably mistaken , but that 's what she thinks , and it 's too late for her to think anything else now , because she 's going to be married right away -- the invitations will be out next week .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 34]: It 'll be a big Amberson-style thing , raw oysters floating in scooped-out blocks of ice and a band from out-of-town -- champagne , showy presents ; a colossal present from the Major .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 42]: Then Wilbur will take Isabel on the carefulest little wedding trip he can manage , and she 'll be a good wife to him , but they 'll have the worst spoiled lot of children this town will ever see . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 14]: `` How on earth do you make that out , Mrs. Foster ? ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 11]: `` She could n't love Wilbur , could she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 8]: Mrs. Foster demanded , with no challengers .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 18]: `` Well , it will all go to her children , and she 'll ruin 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 21]: The prophetess proved to be mistaken in a single detail merely : except for that , her foresight was accurate .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 50]: The wedding was of Ambersonian magnificence , even to the floating oysters ; and the Major 's colossal present was a set of architect 's designs for a house almost as elaborate and impressive as the Mansion , the house to be built in Amberson Addition by the Major .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 58]: The orchestra was certainly not that local one which had suffered the loss of a bass viol ; the musicians came , according to the prophecy and next morning 's paper , from afar ; and at midnight the bride was still being toasted in champagne , though she had departed upon her wedding journey at ten .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 31]: Four days later the pair had returned to town , which promptness seemed fairly to demonstrate that Wilbur had indeed taken Isabel upon the carefulest little trip he could manage .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 29]: According to every report , she was from the start `` a good wife to him , '' but here in a final detail the prophecy proved inaccurate .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 13]: Wilbur and Isabel did not have children ; they had only one .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 11]: `` Only one , '' Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster admitted .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 19]: `` But I 'd like to know if he is n't spoiled enough for a whole carload ! ''
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 8]: Again she found none to challenge her .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 41]: At the age of nine , George Amberson Minafer , the Major 's one grandchild , was a princely terror , dreaded not only in Amberson Addition but in many other quarters through which he galloped on his white pony .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 14]: `` By golly , I guess you think you own this town ! ''
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 24]: an embittered labourer complained , one day , as Georgie rode the pony straight through a pile of sand the man was sieving .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 14]: `` I will when I grow up , '' the undisturbed child replied .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 13]: `` I guess my grandpa owns it now , you bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 30]: And the baffled workman , having no means to controvert what seemed a mere exaggeration of the facts could only mutter `` Oh , pull down your vest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 6]: `` Do n't haf to !
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 8]: Doctor says it ai n't healthy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 5]: the boy returned promptly .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 26]: `` But I 'll tell you what I 'll do : I 'll pull down my vest if you 'll wipe off your chin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 25]: This was stock and stencil : the accustomed argot of street badinage of the period ; and in such matters Georgie was an expert .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 67]: He had no vest to pull down ; the incongruous fact was that a fringed sash girdled the juncture of his velvet blouse and breeches , for the Fauntleroy period had set in , and Georgie 's mother had so poor an eye for appropriate things , where Georgie was concerned , that she dressed him according to the doctrine of that school in boy decoration .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 41]: Not only did he wear a silk sash , and silk stockings , and a broad lace collar , with his little black velvet suit : he had long brown curls , and often came home with burrs in them .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 28]: Except upon the surface -LRB- which was not his own work , but his mother 's -RRB- Georgie bore no vivid resemblance to the fabulous little Cedric .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 25]: The storied boy 's famous `` Lean on me , grandfather , '' would have been difficult to imagine upon the lips of Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 59]: A month after his ninth birthday anniversary , when the Major gave him his pony , he had already become acquainted with the toughest boys in various distant parts of the town , and had convinced them that the toughness of a rich little boy with long curls might be considered in many respects superior to their own .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 38]: He fought them , learning how to go berserk at a certain point in a fight , bursting into tears of anger , reaching for rocks , uttering wailed threats of murder and attempting to fulfil them .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 24]: Fights often led to intimacies , and he acquired the art of saying things more exciting than `` Do n't haf to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 10]: and `` Doctor says it ai n't healthy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 47]: Thus , on a summer afternoon , a strange boy , sitting bored upon the gate-post of the Reverend Malloch Smith , beheld George Amberson Minafer rapidly approaching on his white pony , and was impelled by bitterness to shout : `` Shoot the ole jackass !
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 6]: Look at the girly curls !
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 15]: Say , bub , where 'd you steal your mother 's ole sash ! ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 9]: `` Your sister stole it for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 8]: Georgie instantly replied , checking the pony .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 17]: `` She stole it off our clo'es - line an ' gave it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 9]: `` You go get your hair cut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 5]: said the stranger hotly .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 3]: `` Yah !
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 8]: I have n't got any sister ! ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 13]: `` I know you have n't at home , '' Georgie responded .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 11]: `` I mean the one that 's in jail . ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 12]: `` I dare you to get down off that pony ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 26]: Georgie jumped to the ground , and the other boy descended from the Reverend Mr. Smith 's gatepost -- but he descended inside the gate .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 12]: `` I dare you outside that gate , '' said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 3]: `` Yah !
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 7]: I dare you half way here .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 47]: I dare you -- '' But these were luckless challenges , for Georgie immediately vaulted the fence -- and four minutes later Mrs. Malloch Smith , hearing strange noises , looked forth from a window ; then screamed , and dashed for the pastor 's study .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 36]: Mr. Malloch Smith , that grim-bearded Methodist , came to the front yard and found his visiting nephew being rapidly prepared by Master Minafer to serve as a principal figure in a pageant of massacre .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 58]: It was with great physical difficulty that Mr. Smith managed to give his nephew a chance to escape into the house , for Georgie was hard and quick , and , in such matters , remarkably intense ; but the minister , after a grotesque tussle , got him separated from his opponent , and shook him .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 8]: `` You stop that , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 9]: Georgie cried fiercely ; and wrenched himself away .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 12]: `` I guess you do n't know who I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 8]: `` Yes , I do know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 6]: the angered Mr. Smith retorted .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 16]: `` I know who you are , and you 're a disgrace to your mother !
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 25]: Your mother ought to be ashamed of herself to allow -- '' `` Shut up about my mother bein ' ashamed of herself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 14]: Mr. Smith , exasperated , was unable to close the dialogue with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 11]: `` She ought to be ashamed , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 21]: `` A woman that lets a bad boy like you -- '' But Georgie had reached his pony and mounted .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 18]: Before setting off at his accustomed gallop , he paused to interrupt the Reverend Malloch Smith again .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 14]: `` You pull down your vest , you ole Billygoat , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 5]: he shouted , distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 18]: `` Pull down your vest , wipe off your chin -- an ' go to hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 19]: Such precocity is less unusual , even in children of the Rich , than most grown people imagine .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 22]: However , it was a new experience for the Reverend Malloch Smith , and left him in a state of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 31]: He at once wrote a note to Georgie 's mother , describing the crime according to his nephew 's testimony ; and the note reached Mrs. Minafer before Georgie did .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 11]: When he got home she read it to him sorrowfully .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 14]: Dear Madam : Your son has caused a painful distress in my household .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 38]: He made an unprovoked attack upon a little nephew of mine who is visiting in my household , insulted him by calling him vicious names and falsehoods , stating that ladies of his family were in jail .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 54]: He then tried to make his pony kick him , and when the child , who is only eleven years old , while your son is much older and stronger , endeavoured to avoid his indignities and withdraw quietly , he pursued him into the enclosure of my property and brutally assaulted him .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 45]: When I appeared upon this scene he deliberately called insulting words to me , concluding with profanity , such as `` go to hell , '' which was heard not only by myself but by my wife and the lady who lives next door .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 34]: I trust such a state of undisciplined behaviour may be remedied for the sake of the reputation for propriety , if nothing higher , of the family to which this unruly child belongs .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 23]: Georgie had muttered various interruptions , and as she concluded the reading he said : `` He 's an ole liar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 11]: `` Georgie , you must n't say ` liar . '
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 8]: Is n't this letter the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 14]: `` Well , '' said Georgie , `` how old am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 4]: `` Ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 18]: `` Well , look how he says I 'm older than a boy eleven years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 9]: `` That 's true , '' said Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 4]: `` He does .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 11]: But is n't some of it true , Georgie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 15]: Georgie felt himself to be in a difficulty here , and he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 13]: `` Georgie , did you say what he says you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 19]: `` Did you tell him to -- to -- Did you say , ` Go to hell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 12]: Georgie looked worried for a moment longer ; then he brightened .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 21]: `` Listen here , mamma ; grandpa would n't wipe his shoe on that ole story-teller , would he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 28]: `` Georgie , you must n't -- '' `` I mean : none of the Ambersons would n't have anything to do with him , would they ?
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 13]: He does n't even know you , does he , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 11]: `` That has n't anything to do with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 6]: `` Yes , it has !
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 42]: I mean : none of the Amberson family go to see him , and they never have him come in their house ; they would n't ask him to , and they prob ` ly would n't even let him . ''
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 11]: `` That is n't what we 're talking about . ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 33]: `` I bet , '' said Georgie emphatically , `` I bet if he wanted to see any of 'em , he 'd haf to go around to the side door ! ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 16]: `` No , dear , they -- '' `` Yes , they would , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 19]: So what does it matter if I did say somep 'm ' to him he did n't like ?
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 24]: That kind o ' people , I do n't see why you ca n't say anything you want to , to 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 5]: `` No , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 18]: And you have n't answered me whether you said that dreadful thing he says you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 7]: `` Well -- '' said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 16]: `` Anyway , he said somep 'm ' to me that made me mad . ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 69]: And upon this point he offered no further details ; he would not explain to his mother that what had made him `` mad '' was Mr. Smith 's hasty condemnation of herself : `` Your mother ought to be ashamed , '' and , `` A woman that lets a bad boy like you -- '' Georgie did not even consider excusing himself by quoting these insolences .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 5]: Isabel stroked his head .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 12]: `` They were terrible words for you to use , dear .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 25]: From his letter he does n't seem a very tactful person , but -- '' `` He 's just riffraff , '' said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 24]: `` You must n't say so , '' his mother gently agreed `` Where did you learn those bad words he speaks of ?
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 10]: Where did you hear any one use them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 10]: `` Well , I 've heard 'em several places .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 14]: I guess Uncle George Amberson was the first I ever heard say 'em .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 9]: Uncle George Amberson said 'em to papa once .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 29]: Papa did n't like it , but Uncle George was just laughin ' at papa , an ' then he said 'em while he was laughin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 24]: `` That was wrong of him , '' she said , but almost instinctively he detected the lack of conviction in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 31]: It was Isabel 's great failing that whatever an Amberson did seemed right to her , especially if the Amberson was either her brother George , or her son George .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 37]: She knew that she should be more severe with the latter now , but severity with him was beyond her power ; and the Reverend Malloch Smith had succeeded only in rousing her resentment against himself .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 18]: Georgie 's symmetrical face -- altogether an Amberson face -- had looked never more beautiful to her .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 14]: It always looked unusually beautiful when she tried to be severe with him .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 21]: `` You must promise me , '' she said feebly , `` never to use those bad words again . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 30]: `` I promise not to , '' he said promptly -- and he whispered an immediate codicil under his breath : `` Unless I get mad at somebody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 19]: This satisfied a code according to which , in his own sincere belief , he never told lies .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: `` That 's a good boy , '' she said , and he ran out to the yard , his punishment over .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 34]: Some admiring friends were gathered there ; they had heard of his adventure , knew of the note , and were waiting to see what was going to `` happen '' to him .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 32]: They hoped for an account of things , and also that he would allow them to `` take turns '' riding his pony to the end of the alley and back .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 13]: They were really his henchmen : Georgie was a lord among boys .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 35]: In fact , he was a personage among certain sorts of grown people , and was often fawned upon ; the alley negroes delighted in him , chuckled over him , flattered him slavishly .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 32]: For that matter , he often heard well-dressed people speaking of him admiringly : a group of ladies once gathered about him on the pavement where he was spinning a top .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 8]: `` I know this is Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 15]: one exclaimed , and turned to the others with the impressiveness of a showman .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 8]: `` Major Amberson 's only grandchild ! ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 9]: The others said , `` It is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 19]: and made clicking sounds with their mouths ; two of them loudly whispering , `` So handsome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 35]: Georgie , annoyed because they kept standing upon the circle he had chalked for his top , looked at them coldly and offered a suggestion : `` Oh , go hire a hall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 30]: As an Amberson , he was already a public character , and the story of his adventure in the Reverend Malloch Smith 's front yard became a town topic .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 61]: Many people glanced at him with great distaste , thereafter , when they chanced to encounter him , which meant nothing to Georgie , because he innocently believed most grown people to be necessarily cross-looking as a normal phenomenon resulting from the adult state ; and he failed to comprehend that the distasteful glances had any personal bearing upon himself .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 27]: If he had perceived such a bearing , he would have been affected only so far , probably , as to mutter , `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 33]: Possibly he would have shouted it ; and , certainly , most people believed a story that went round the town just after Mrs. Amberson 's funeral , when Georgie was eleven .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 40]: Georgie was reported to have differed with the undertaker about the seating of the family ; his indignant voice had become audible : `` Well , who is the most important person at my own grandmother 's funeral ? ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 24]: And later he had projected his head from the window of the foremost mourners ' carriage , as the undertaker happened to pass .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 4]: `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 35]: There were people -- grown people they were -- who expressed themselves longingly : they did hope to live to see the day , they said , when that boy would get his come-upance !
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 36]: -LRB- They used that honest word , so much better than `` deserts , '' and not until many years later to be more clumsily rendered as `` what is coming to him . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 19]: Something was bound to take him down , some day , and they only wanted to be there !
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 35]: But Georgie heard nothing of this , and the yearners for his taking down went unsatisfied , while their yearning grew the greater as the happy day of fulfilment was longer and longer postponed .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 56]: His grandeur was not diminished by the Malloch Smith story ; the rather it was increased , and among other children -LRB- especially among little girls -RRB- there was added to the prestige of his gilded position that diabolical glamour which must inevitably attend a boy who has told a minister to go to hell .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 55]: Chapter III Until he reached the age of twelve , Georgie 's education was a domestic process ; tutors came to the house ; and those citizens who yearned for his taking down often said : `` Just wait till he has to go to public school ; then he 'll get it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 56]: But at twelve Georgie was sent to a private school in the town , and there came from this small and dependent institution no report , or even rumour , of Georgie 's getting anything that he was thought to deserve ; therefore the yearning still persisted , though growing gaunt with feeding upon itself .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 24]: For , although Georgie 's pomposities and impudence in the little school were often almost unbearable , the teachers were fascinated by him .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 40]: They did not like him -- he was too arrogant for that -- but he kept them in such a state of emotion that they thought more about him than they did about all of the other ten pupils .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 21]: The emotion he kept them in was usually one resulting from injured self-respect , but sometimes it was dazzled admiration .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 47]: So far as their conscientious observation went , he `` studied '' his lessons sparingly ; but sometimes , in class , he flashed an admirable answer , with a comprehension not often shown by the pupils they taught ; and he passed his examinations easily .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 25]: In all , without discernible effort , he acquired at this school some rudiments of a liberal education and learned nothing whatever about himself .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 22]: The yearners were still yearning when Georgie , at sixteen , was sent away to a great `` Prep School . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 14]: `` Now , '' they said brightly , `` he 'll get it !
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 35]: He 'll find himself among boys just as important in their home towns as he is , and they 'll knock the stuffing out of him when he puts on his airs with them !
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 12]: Oh , but that would be worth something to see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 26]: They were mistaken , it appeared , for when Georgie returned , a few months later , he still seemed to have the same stuffing .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 44]: He had been deported by the authorities , the offense being stated as `` insolence and profanity '' ; in fact , he had given the principal of the school instructions almost identical with those formerly objected to by the Reverend Malloch Smith .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 49]: But he had not got his come-upance , and those who counted upon it were embittered by his appearance upon the down-town streets driving a dog-cart at criminal speed , making pedestrians retreat from the crossings , and behaving generally as if he `` owned the earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 55]: A disgusted hardware dealer of middle age , one of those who hungered for Georgie 's downfall , was thus driven back upon the sidewalk to avoid being run over , and so far forgot himself as to make use of the pet street insult of the year : `` Got ` ny sense !
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 14]: See here , bub , does your mother know you 're out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 39]: Georgie , without even seeming to look at him , flicked the long lash of his whip dexterously , and a little spurt of dust came from the hardware man 's trousers , not far below the waist .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 40]: He was not made of hardware : he raved , looking for a missile ; then , finding none , commanded himself sufficiently to shout after the rapid dog-cart : `` Turn down your pants , you would-be dude !
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 6]: Raining in dear ole Lunnon !
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 6]: Git off the earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 12]: Georgie gave him no encouragement to think that he was heard .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 56]: The dog-cart turned the next corner , causing indignation there , likewise , and , having proceeded some distance farther , halted in front of the `` Amberson Block '' -- an old-fashioned four-story brick warren of lawyers offices , insurance and realestate offices , with a `` drygoods store '' occupying the ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 76]: Georgie tied his lathered trotter to a telegraph pole , and stood for a moment looking at the building critically : it seemed shabby , and he thought his grandfather ought to replace it with a fourteen-story skyscraper , or even a higher one , such as he had lately seen in New York -- when he stopped there for a few days of recreation and rest on his way home from the bereaved school .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 38]: About the entryway to the stairs were various tin signs , announcing the occupation and location of upper-floor tenants , and Georgie decided to take some of these with him if he should ever go to college .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 43]: However , he did not stop to collect them at this time , but climbed the worn stairs -- there was no elevator -- to the fourth floor , went down a dark corridor , and rapped three times upon a door .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 84]: It was a mysterious door , its upper half , of opaque glass , bearing no sign to state the business or profession of the occupants within ; but overhead , upon the lintel , four letters had been smearingly inscribed , partly with purple ink and partly with a soft lead pencil , `` F. O. T. A. '' and upon the plaster wall , above the lintel , there was a drawing dear to male adolescence : a skull and crossbones .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 14]: Three raps , similar to Georgie 's , sounded from within the room .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 19]: Georgie then rapped four times the rapper within the room rapped twice , and Georgie rapped seven times .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 28]: This ended precautionary measures ; and a well-dressed boy of sixteen opened the door ; whereupon Georgie entered quickly , and the door was closed behind him .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 33]: Seven boys of congenial age were seated in a semicircular row of damaged office chairs , facing a platform whereon stood a solemn , red-haired young personage with a table before him .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 72]: At one end of the room there was a battered sideboard , and upon it were some empty beer bottles , a tobacco can about two-thirds full , with a web of mold over the surface of the tobacco , a dusty cabinet photograph -LRB- not inscribed -RRB- of Miss Lillian Russell , several withered old pickles , a caseknife , and a half-petrified section of icing-cake on a sooty plate .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 108]: At the other end of the room were two rickety card-tables and a stand of bookshelves where were displayed under dust four or five small volumes of M. Guy de Maupassant 's stories , `` Robinson Crusoe , '' `` Sappho , '' `` Mr. Barnes of New York , '' a work by Giovanni Boccaccio , a Bible , `` The Arabian Nights ' Entertainment , '' `` Studies of the Human Form Divine , '' `` The Little Minister , '' and a clutter of monthly magazines and illustrated weeklies of about that crispness one finds in such articles upon a doctor 's ante-room table .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 55]: Upon the wall , above the sideboard , was an old framed lithograph of Miss Della Fox in `` Wang '' ; over the bookshelves there was another lithograph purporting to represent Mr. John L. Sullivan in a boxing costume , and beside it a halftone reproduction of `` A Reading From Horner . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 33]: The final decoration consisted of damaged papiermache -- a round shield with two battle-axes and two cross-hilted swords , upon the wall over the little platform where stood the red-haired presiding officer .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 17]: He addressed Georgie in a serious voice : `` Welcome , Friend of the Ace . ''
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 31]: `` Welcome , Friend of the Ace , '' Georgie responded , and all of the other boys repeated the words , `` Welcome , Friend of the Ace . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 15]: `` Take your seat in the secret semicircle , '' said the presiding officer .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 16]: `` We will now proceed to -- '' But Georgie was disposed to be informal .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 30]: He interrupted , turning to the boy who had admitted him : `` Look here , Charlie Johnson , what 's Fred Kinney doing in the president 's chair ?
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 9]: That 's my place , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 10]: What you men been up to here , anyhow ?
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 23]: Did n't you all agree I was to be president just the same , even if I was away at school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 9]: `` Well -- '' said Charlie Johnson uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 10]: I did n't have much to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 59]: Some of the other members thought that long as you were n't in town or anything , and Fred gave the sideboard , why -- '' Mr. Kinney , presiding , held in his hand , in lieu of a gavel , and considered much more impressive , a Civil War relic known as a `` horse-pistol . ''
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 6]: He rapped loudly for order .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 12]: `` All Friends of the Ace will take their seats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 4]: he said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 22]: `` I 'm president of the F. O. T. A. now , George Minafer , and do n't you forget it !
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 26]: You and Charlie Johnson sit down , because I was elected perfectly fair , and we 're goin ' to hold a meeting here . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 10]: `` Oh , you are , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: said George skeptically .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 7]: Charlie Johnson thought to mollify him .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 17]: `` Well , did n't we call this meeting just especially because you told us to ?
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 34]: You said yourself we ought to have a kind of celebration because you 've got back to town , George , and that 's what we 're here for now , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 8]: What do you care about being president ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 20]: All it amounts to is just calling the roll and -- '' The president de facto hammered the table .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 30]: `` This meeting will now proceed to -- '' `` No , it wo n't , '' said George , and he advanced to the desk , laughing contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 7]: `` Get off that platform . ''
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 9]: `` This meeting will come to order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: Mr. Kinney commanded fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 11]: `` You put down that gavel , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 11]: `` Whose is it , I 'd like to know ?
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 30]: It belongs to my grandfather , and you quit hammering it that way or you 'll break it , and I 'll have to knock your head off . ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 8]: `` This meeting will come to order !
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 16]: I was legally elected here , and I 'm not going to be bulldozed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 5]: `` You 're president .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 8]: Now we 'll hold another election . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 6]: `` We will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 4]: Fred Kinney shouted .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 27]: `` We 'll have our reg ` lar meeting , and then we 'll play euchre & nickel a corner , what we 're here for .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 14]: This meeting will now come to ord -- '' Georgie addressed the members .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 20]: `` I 'd like to know who got up this thing in the first place , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 13]: `` Who 's the founder of the F.O.T.A. , if you please ?
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 7]: Who got this room rent free ?
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 13]: Who got the janitor to let us have most of this furniture ?
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 26]: You suppose you could keep this clubroom a minute if I told my grandfather I did n't want it for a literary club any more ?
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 16]: I 'd like to say a word on how you members been acting , too !
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 40]: When I went away I said I did n't care if you had a vice-president or something while I was gone , but here I hardly turned my back and you had to go and elect Fred Kinney president !
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 14]: Well , if that 's what you want , you can have it .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 87]: I was going to have a little celebration down here some night pretty soon , and bring some port wine , like we drink at school in our crowd there , and I was going to get my grandfather to give the club an extra room across the hall , and prob ` ly I could get my Uncle George to give us his old billiard table , because he 's got a new one , and the club could put it in the other room .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 10]: Well , you got a new president now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 21]: Here Georgie moved toward the door and his tone became plaintive , though undeniably there was disdain beneath his sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 12]: `` I guess all I better do is -- resign ! ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 11]: And he opened the door , apparently intending to withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 24]: `` All in favour of having a new election , '' Charlie Johnson shouted hastily , `` say , ` Aye ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 24]: `` Aye '' was said by everyone present except Mr. Kinney , who began a hot protest , but it was immediately smothered .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 23]: `` All in favour of me being president instead of Fred Kinney , '' shouted Georgie , `` say ` Aye . '
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 8]: The ` Ayes ' have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 18]: `` I resign , '' said the red-headed boy , gulping as he descended from the platform .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 8]: `` I resign from the club ! ''
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 20]: Hot-eyed , he found his hat and departed , jeers echoing after him as he plunged down the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 14]: Georgie stepped upon the platform , and took up the emblem of office .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 16]: `` Ole red-head Fred 'll be around next week , '' said the new chairman .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 33]: `` He 'll be around boot-lickin ' to get us to take him back in again , but I guess we do n't want him : that fellow always was a trouble-maker .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 8]: We will now proceed with our meeting .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 14]: Well , fellows , I suppose you want to hear from your president .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 27]: I do n't know that I have much to say , as I have already seen most of you a few times since I got back .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 26]: I had a good time at the old school , back East , but had a little trouble with the faculty and came on home .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 31]: My family stood by me as well as I could ask , and I expect to stay right here in the old town until whenever I decide to enter college .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 15]: Now , I do n't suppose there 's any more business before the meeting .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 9]: I guess we might as well play cards .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 30]: Anybody that 's game for a little quarter-limit poker or any limit they say , why I 'd like to have 'em sit at the president 's card-table . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 64]: When the diversions of the Friends of the Ace were concluded for that afternoon , Georgie invited his chief supporter , Mr. Charlie Johnson , to drive home with him to dinner , and as they jingled up National Avenue in the dog-cart , Charlie asked : `` What sort of men did you run up against at that school , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 14]: `` Best crowd there : finest set of men I ever met . ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 10]: `` How 'd you get in with 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 3]: Georgie laughed .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 21]: `` I let them get in with me , Charlie , '' he said in a tone of gentle explanation .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 10]: `` It 's vulgar to do any other way .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 14]: Did I tell you the nickname they gave me -- ` King ' ?
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 15]: That was what they called me at that school , ` King Minafer . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 10]: `` How 'd they happen to do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: his friend asked innocently .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 11]: `` Oh , different things , '' George answered lightly .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 56]: `` Of course , any of 'em that came from anywhere out in this part the country knew about the family and all that , and so I suppose it was a good deal on account of -- oh , on account of the family and the way I do things , most likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 37]: Chapter IV When Mr. George Amberson Minafer came home for the holidays at Christmastide , in his sophomore year , probably no great change had taken place inside him , but his exterior was visibly altered .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 54]: Nothing about him encouraged any hope that he had received his come-upance ; on the contrary , the yearners for that stroke of justice must yearn even more itchingly : the gilded youth 's manner had become polite , but his politeness was of a kind which democratic people found hard to bear .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 44]: In a word , M. le Due had returned from the gay life of the capital to show himself for a week among the loyal peasants belonging to the old chateau , and their quaint habits and costumes afforded him a mild amusement .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 31]: Cards were out for a ball in his honour , and this pageant of the tenantry was held in the ballroom of the Amberson Mansion the night after his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 60]: It was , as Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster said of Isabel 's wedding , `` a big Amberson-style thing , '' though that wise Mrs. Henry Franklin Foster had long ago gone the way of all wisdom , having stepped out of the Midland town , unquestionably into heaven -- a long step , but not beyond her powers .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 61]: She had successors , but no successor ; the town having grown too large to confess that it was intellectually led and literarily authoritated by one person ; and some of these successors were not invited to the ball , for dimensions were now so metropolitan that intellectual leaders and literary authorities loomed in outlying regions unfamiliar to the Ambersons .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 22]: However , all `` old citizens '' recognizable as gentry received cards , and of course so did their dancing descendants .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 49]: The orchestra and the caterer were brought from away , in the Amberson manner , though this was really a gesture -- perhaps one more of habit than of ostentation -- for servitors of gaiety as proficient as these importations were nowadays to be found in the town .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 40]: Even flowers and plants and roped vines were brought from afar -- not , however , until the stock of the local florists proved insufficient to obliterate the interior structure of the big house , in the Amberson way .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 55]: It was the last of the great , long remembered dances that `` everybody talked about '' -- there were getting to be so many people in town that no later than the next year there were too many for `` everybody '' to hear of even such a ball as the Ambersons ' .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 57]: George , white-gloved , with a gardenia in his buttonhole , stood with his mother and the Major , embowered in the big red and gold drawing room downstairs , to `` receive '' the guests ; and , standing thus together , the trio offered a picturesque example of good looks persistent through three generations .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 53]: The Major , his daughter , and his grandson were of a type all Amberson : tall , straight , and regular , with dark eyes , short noses , good chins ; and the grandfather 's expression , no less than the grandson 's , was one of faintly amused condescension .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 7]: There was a difference , however .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 23]: The grandson 's unlined young face had nothing to offer except this condescension ; the grandfather 's had other things to say .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 28]: It was a handsome , worldly old face , conscious of its importance , but persuasive rather than arrogant , and not without tokens of sufferings withstood .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 33]: The Major 's short white hair was parted in the middle , like his grandson 's , and in all he stood as briskly equipped to the fashion as exquisite young George .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 20]: Isabel , standing between her father and her son caused a vague amazement in the mind of the latter .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 49]: Her age , just under forty , was for George a thought of something as remote as the moons of Jupiter : he could not possibly have conceived such an age ever coming to be his own : five years was the limit of his thinking in time .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 20]: Five years ago he had been a child not yet fourteen ; and those five years were an abyss .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 23]: Five years hence he would be almost twenty-four ; what the girls he knew called `` one of the older men . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 19]: He could imagine himself at twenty-four , but beyond that , his powers staggered and refused the task .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 24]: He saw little essential difference between thirty-eight and eighty-eight , and his mother was to him not a woman but wholly a mother .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 51]: He had no perception of her other than as an adjunct to himself , his mother ; nor could he imagine her thinking or doing anything -- falling in love , walking with a friend , or reading a book -- as a woman , and not as his mother .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 31]: The woman , Isabel , was a stranger to her son ; as completely a stranger as if he had never in his life seen her or heard her voice .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 34]: And it was to-night , while he stood with her , `` receiving , '' that he caught a disquieting glimpse of this stranger whom he thus fleetingly encountered for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 9]: Youth can not imagine romance apart from youth .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 29]: That is why the roles of the heroes and heroines of plays are given by the managers to the most youthful actors they can find among the competent .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 53]: Both middle-aged people and young people enjoy a play about young lovers ; but only middle-aged people will tolerate a play about middle-aged lovers ; young people will not come to see such a play , because , for them , middle-aged lovers are a joke -- not a very funny one .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 27]: Therefore , to bring both the middle-aged people and the young people into his house , the manager makes his romance as young as he can .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 24]: Youth will indeed be served , and its profound instinct is to be not only scornfully amused but vaguely angered by middle-age romance .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 52]: So , standing beside his mother , George was disturbed by a sudden impression , coming upon him out of nowhere , so far as he could detect , that her eyes were brilliant , that she was graceful and youthful -- in a word , that she was romantically lovely .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 21]: He had one of those curious moments that seem to have neither a cause nor any connection with actual things .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 41]: While it lasted , he was disquieted not by thoughts -- for he had no definite thoughts -- but by a slight emotion like that caused in a dream by the presence of something invisible soundless , and yet fantastic .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 55]: There was nothing different or new about his mother , except her new black and silver dress : she was standing there beside him , bending her head a little in her greetings , smiling the same smile she had worn for the half-hour that people had been passing the `` receiving '' group .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 29]: Her face was flushed , but the room was warm ; and shaking hands with so many people easily accounted for the pretty glow that was upon her .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 50]: At any time she could have `` passed '' for twenty-five or twenty-six -- a man of fifty would have honestly guessed her to be about thirty but possibly two or three years younger -- and though extraordinary in this , she had been extraordinary in it for years .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 38]: There was nothing in either her looks or her manner to explain George 's uncomfortable feeling ; and yet it increased , becoming suddenly a vague resentment , as if she had done something unmotherly to him .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 58]: The fantastic moment passed ; and even while it lasted , he was doing his duty , greeting two pretty girls with whom he had grown up , as people say , and warmly assuring them that he remembered them very well -- an assurance which might have surprised them `` in anybody but Georgie Minafer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 67]: It seemed unnecessary , since he had spent many hours with them no longer ago than the preceding August , They had with them their parents and an uncle from out of town ; and George negligently gave the parents the same assurance he had given the daughters , but murmured another form of greeting to the out-of-town uncle , whom he had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 14]: This person George absently took note of as a `` queer-looking duck . ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 9]: Undergraduates had not yet adopted `` bird . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 36]: It was a period previous to that in which a sophomore would have thought of the Sharon girls ' uncle as a `` queer-looking bird , '' or , perhaps a `` funny-face bird . ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 63]: In George 's time , every human male was to be defined , at pleasure , as a `` duck '' ; but `` duck '' was not spoken with admiring affection , as in its former feminine use to signify a `` dear '' -- on the contrary , `` duck '' implied the speaker 's personal detachment and humorous superiority .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 34]: An indifferent amusement was what George felt when his mother , with a gentle emphasis , interrupted his interchange of courtesies with the nieces to present him to the queer-looking duck their uncle .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 36]: This emphasis of Isabel 's , though slight , enabled George to perceive that she considered the queer-looking duck a person of some importance ; but it was far from enabling him to understand why .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 46]: The duck parted his thick and longish black hair on the side ; his tie was a forgetful looking thing , and his coat , though it fitted a good enough middle-aged figure , no product of this year , or of last year either .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 98]: One of his eyebrows was noticeably higher than the other ; and there were whimsical lines between them , which gave him an apprehensive expression ; but his apprehensions were evidently more humorous than profound , for his prevailing look was that of a genial man of affairs , not much afraid of anything whatever Nevertheless , observing only his unfashionable hair , his eyebrows , his preoccupied tie and his old coat , the olympic George set him down as a queer-looking duck , and having thus completed his portrait , took no interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 35]: The Sharon girls passed on , taking the queer-looking duck with them , and George became pink with mortification as his mother called his attention to a white-bearded guest waiting to shake his hand .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 40]: This was George 's great-uncle , old John Minafer : it was old John 's boast that in spite of his connection by marriage with the Ambersons , he never had worn and never would wear a swaller-tail coat .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 37]: Members of his family had exerted their influence uselessly -- at eighty-nine conservative people seldom form radical new habits , and old John wore his `` Sunday suit '' of black broadcloth to the Amberson ball .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 40]: The coat was square , with skirts to the knees ; old John called it a `` Prince Albert '' and was well enough pleased with it , but his great-nephew considered it the next thing to an insult .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 58]: George 's purpose had been to ignore the man , but he had to take his hand for a moment ; whereupon old John began to tell George that he was looking well , though there had been a time , during his fourth month , when he was so puny that nobody thought he would live .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 29]: The great-nephew , in a fury of blushes , dropped old John 's hand with some vigour , and seized that of the next person in the line .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 11]: `` Member you v ` ry well ` ndeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 4]: he said fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 30]: The large room had filled , and so had the broad hall and the rooms on the other side of the hall , where there were tables for whist .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 45]: The imported orchestra waited in the ballroom on the third floor , but a local harp , ` cello , violin , and flute were playing airs from `` The Fencing Master '' in the hall , and people were shouting over the music .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 38]: Old John Minafer 's voice was louder and more penetrating than any other , because he had been troubled with deafness for twenty-five years , heard his own voice but faintly , and liked to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 46]: `` Smell o ' flowers like this always puts me in mind o ' funerals , '' he kept telling his niece , Fanny Minafer , who was with him ; and he seemed to get a great deal of satisfaction out of this reminder .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 37]: His tremulous yet strident voice cut through the voluminous sound that filled the room , and he was heard everywhere : `` Always got to think o ' funerals when I smell so many flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 43]: And , as the pressure of people forced Fanny and himself against the white marble mantelpiece , he pursued this train of cheery thought , shouting , `` Right here 's where the Major 's wife was laid out at her funeral .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 14]: They had her in a good light from that big bow window . ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: He paused to chuckle mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 19]: `` I s ` pose that 's where they 'll put the Major when his time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 32]: Presently George 's mortification was increased to hear this sawmill droning harshly from the midst of the thickening crowd : `` Ai n't the dancin ' broke out yet , Fanny ?
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 2]: Hoopla !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 14]: Le 's push through and go see the young women-folks crack their heels !
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 4]: Start the circus !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 3]: Hoopse-daisy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 53]: Miss Fanny Minafer , in charge of the lively veteran , was almost as distressed as her nephew George , but she did her duty and managed to get old John through the press and out to the broad stairway , which numbers of young people were now ascending to the ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 24]: And here the sawmill voice still rose over all others : `` Solid black walnut every inch of it , balustrades and all .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 13]: Sixty thousand dollars ' worth o ' carved woodwork in the house !
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 3]: Like water !
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 5]: Spent money like water !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 3]: Always did !
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 3]: Still do !
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 3]: Like water !
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 9]: God knows where it all comes from ! ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 64]: He continued the ascent , barking and coughing among the gleaming young heads , white shoulders , jewels , and chiffon , like an old dog slowly swimming up the rapids of a sparkling river ; while down below , in the drawing room , George began to recover from the degradation into which this relic of early settler days had dragged him .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 41]: What restored him completely was a dark-eyed little beauty of nineteen , very knowing in lustrous blue and jet ; at sight of this dashing advent in the line of guests before him , George was fully an Amberson again .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 8]: `` Remember you very well indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 14]: he said , his graciousness more earnest than any he had heretofore displayed .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 6]: Isabel heard him and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 9]: `` But you do n't , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 14]: `` You do n't remember her yet , though of course you will !
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 23]: Miss Morgan is from out of town , and I 'm afraid this is the first time you 've ever seen her .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 21]: You might take her up to the dancing ; I think you 've pretty well done your duty here . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 67]: `` Be d'lighted , '' George responded formally , and offered his arm , not with a flourish , certainly , but with an impressiveness inspired partly by the appearance of the person to whom he offered it , partly by his being the hero of this fete , and partly by his youthfulness -- for when manners are new they are apt to be elaborate .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 17]: The little beauty entrusted her gloved fingers to his coat-sleeve , and they moved away together .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 17]: Their progress was necessarily slow , and to George 's mind it did not lack stateliness .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 4]: How could it ?
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 108]: Musicians , hired especially for him , were sitting in a grove of palms in the hall and now tenderly playing `` Oh , Promise Me '' for his pleasuring ; dozens and scores of flowers had been brought to life and tended to this hour that they might sweeten the air for him while they died ; and the evanescent power that music and floral scents hold over youth stirred his appreciation of strange , beautiful qualities within his own bosom : he seemed to himself to be mysteriously angelic , and about to do something which would overwhelm the beautiful young stranger upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 18]: Elderly people and middle-aged people moved away to let him pass with his honoured fair beside him .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 32]: Worthy middle-class creatures , they seemed , leading dull lives but appreciative of better things when they saw them -- and George 's bosom was fleetingly touched with a pitying kindness .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 49]: And since the primordial day when caste or heritage first set one person , in his own esteem , above his fellow-beings , it is to be doubted if anybody ever felt more illustrious , or more negligently grand , than George Amberson Minafer felt at this party .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 72]: As he conducted Miss Morgan through the hall , toward the stairway , they passed the open double doors of a card room , where some squadrons of older people were preparing for action , and , leaning gracefully upon the mantelpiece of this room , a tall man , handsome , high-mannered , and sparklingly point-device , held laughing converse with that queer-looking duck , the Sharon girls ' uncle .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 18]: The tall gentleman waved a gracious salutation to George , and Miss Morgan 's curiosity was stirred .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 6]: `` Who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 19]: `` I did n't catch his name when my mother presented him to me , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 8]: `` You mean the queer-looking duck . ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 8]: `` I mean the aristocratic duck . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 10]: `` That 's my Uncle George Honourable George Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: I thought everybody knew him . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 15]: `` He looks as though everybody ought to know him , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 10]: `` It seems to run in your family . ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 13]: If she had any sly intention , it skipped over George harmlessly .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 26]: `` Well , of course , I suppose most everybody does , '' he admitted -- `` out in this part of the country especially .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 17]: Besides , Uncle George is in Congress ; the family like to have someone there . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 14]: `` Well , it 's sort of a good thing in one way .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 36]: For instance , my Uncle Sydney Amberson and his wife , Aunt Amelia , they have n't got much of anything to do with themselves -- get bored to death around here , of course .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 48]: Well , probably Uncle George 'll have Uncle Sydney appointed minister or ambassador , or something like that , to Russia or Italy or somewhere , and that 'll make it pleasant when any of the rest of the family go travelling , or things like that .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 18]: I expect to do a good deal of travelling myself when I get out of college . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: On the stairway he pointed out this prospective ambassadorial couple , Sydney and Amelia .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 24]: They were coming down , fronting the ascending tide , and as conspicuous over it as a king and queen in a play .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 17]: Moreover , as the clear-eyed Miss Morgan remarked , the very least they looked was ambassadorial .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 32]: Sydney was an Amberson exaggerated , more pompous than gracious ; too portly , flushed , starched to a shine , his stately jowl furnished with an Edward the Seventh beard .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 48]: Amelia , likewise full-bodied , showed glittering blond hair exuberantly dressed ; a pink , fat face cold under a white-hot tiara ; a solid , cold bosom under a white-hot necklace ; great , cold , gloved arms , and the rest of her beautifully upholstered .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 45]: Amelia was an Amberson born , herself , Sydney 's second-cousin : they had no children , and Sydney was without a business or a profession ; thus both found a great deal of time to think about the appropriateness of their becoming Excellencies .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 40]: And as George ascended the broad stairway , they were precisely the aunt and uncle he was most pleased to point out , to a girl from out of town , as his appurtenances in the way of relatives .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 53]: At sight of them the grandeur of the Amberson family was instantly conspicuous as a permanent thing : it was impossible to doubt that the Ambersons were entrenched , in their nobility and riches , behind polished and glittering barriers which were as solid as they were brilliant , and would last .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 71]: Chapter V The hero of the fete , with the dark-eyed little beauty upon his arm , reached the top of the second flight of stairs ; and here , beyond a spacious landing , where two proud-like darkies tended a crystalline punch bowl , four wide archways in a rose-vine lattice framed gliding silhouettes of waltzers , already smoothly at it to the castanets of `` La Paloma . ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 16]: Old John Minafer , evidently surfeited , was in the act of leaving these delights .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 10]: `` D'want ` ny more o ' that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 3]: he barked .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 6]: `` Just slidin ' around !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 5]: Call that dancin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 10]: Rather see a jig any day in the world !
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 10]: They ai n't very modest , some of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 8]: I do n't mind that , though .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 4]: Not me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 25]: Miss Fanny Minafer was no longer in charge of him : he emerged from the ballroom escorted by a middle-aged man of commonplace appearance .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 51]: The escort had a dry , lined face upon which , not ornamentally but as a matter of course , there grew a business man 's short moustache ; and his thin neck showed an Adam 's apple , but not conspicuously , for there was nothing conspicuous about him .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 57]: Baldish , dim , quiet , he was an unnoticeable part of this festival , and although there were a dozen or more middle-aged men present , not casually to be distinguished from him in general aspect , he was probably the last person in the big house at whom a stranger would have glanced twice .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 26]: It did not enter George 's mind to mention to Miss Morgan that this was his father , or to say anything whatever about him .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 11]: Mr. Minafer shook his son 's hand unobtrusively in passing .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 17]: `` I 'll take Uncle John home , '' he said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 23]: `` Then I guess I 'll go on home myself -- I 'm not a great hand at parties , you know .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 5]: Good-night , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 9]: George murmured a friendly enough good-night without pausing .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 58]: Ordinarily he was not ashamed of the Minafers ; he seldom thought about them at all , for he belonged , as most American children do , to the mother 's family -- but he was anxious not to linger with Miss Morgan in the vicinity of old John , whom he felt to be a disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 43]: He pushed brusquely through the fringe of calculating youths who were gathered in the arches , watching for chances to dance only with girls who would soon be taken off their hands , and led his stranger lady out upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 13]: They caught the time instantly , and were away in the waltz .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 26]: George danced well , and Miss Morgan seemed to float as part of the music , the very dove itself of `` La Paloma . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 64]: They said nothing as they danced ; her eyes were cast down all the while -- the prettiest gesture for a dancer -- and there was left in the universe , for each , of them , only their companionship in this waltz ; while the faces of the other dancers , swimming by , denoted not people but merely blurs of colour .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 30]: George became conscious of strange feelings within him : an exaltation of soul , tender , but indefinite , and seemingly located in the upper part of his diaphragm .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 37]: The stopping of the music came upon him like the waking to an alarm clock ; for instantly six or seven of the calculating persons about the entry-ways bore down upon Miss Morgan to secure dances .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 15]: George had to do with one already established as a belle , it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 30]: `` Give me the next and the one after that , '' he said hurriedly , recovering some presence of mind , just as the nearest applicant reached them .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 14]: `` And give me every third one the rest of the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 6]: `` Are you asking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 11]: `` What do you mean , ` asking ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 18]: `` It sounded as though you were just telling me to give you all those dances . ''
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 8]: `` Well , I want 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 3]: George insisted .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 16]: `` What about all the other girls it 's your duty to dance with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 23]: `` They 'll have to go without , '' he said heartlessly ; and then , with surprising vehemence : `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 19]: I want to know : Are you going to give me those -- '' `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 85]: The applicants flocked round her , urging contracts for what remained , but they did not dislodge George from her side , though he made it evident that they succeeded in annoying him ; and presently he extricated her from an accumulating siege -- she must have connived in the extrication -- and bore her off to sit beside him upon the stairway that led to the musicians ' gallery , where they were sufficiently retired , yet had a view of the room .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 14]: `` How 'd all those ducks get to know you so quick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 7]: George inquired , with little enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 11]: `` Oh , I 've been here a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 11]: `` Looks as if you 'd been pretty busy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 21]: `` Most of those ducks , I do n't know what my mother wanted to invite 'em here for . ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: `` Oh , I used to see something of a few of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 32]: I was president of a club we had here , and some of 'em belonged to it , but I do n't care much for that sort of thing any more .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 12]: I really do n't see why my mother invited 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 16]: `` Perhaps it was on account of their parents , '' Miss Morgan suggested mildly .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 14]: `` Maybe she did n't want to offend their fathers and mothers . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 5]: `` Oh , hardly !
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 18]: I do n't think my mother need worry much about offending anybody in this old town . ''
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 11]: `` It must be wonderful , '' said Miss Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 16]: `` It must be wonderful , Mr. Amberson -- Mr. Minafer , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 7]: `` What must be wonderful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 9]: `` To be so important as that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 12]: `` That is n't ` important , '' George assured her .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 26]: `` Anybody that really is anybody ought to be able to do about as they like in their own town , I should think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 20]: She looked at him critically from under her shading lashes -- but her eyes grew gentler almost at once .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: In truth , they became more appreciative than critical .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 41]: George 's imperious good looks were altogether manly , yet approached actual beauty as closely as a boy 's good looks should dare ; and dance-music and flowers have some effect upon nineteen-year-old girls as well as upon eighteen-year-old boys .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 46]: Miss Morgan turned her eyes slowly from George , and pressed her face among the lilies-of-the-valley and violets of the pretty bouquet she carried , while , from the gallery above , the music of the next dance carolled out merrily in a new two-step .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 42]: The musicians made the melody gay for the Christmastime with chimes of sleighbells , and the entrance to the shadowed stairway framed the passing flushed and lively dancers , but neither George nor Miss Morgan suggested moving to join the dance .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 23]: The stairway was draughty : the steps were narrow and uncomfortable ; no older person would have remained in such a place .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 60]: Moreover , these two young people were strangers to each other ; neither had said anything in which the other had discovered the slightest intrinsic interest ; there had not arisen between them the beginnings of congeniality , or even of friendliness -- but stairways near ballrooms have more to answer for than have moonlit lakes and mountain sunsets .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 44]: Some day the laws of glamour must be discovered , because they are so important that the world would be wiser now if Sir Isaac Newton had been hit on the head , not by an apple , but by a young lady .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 24]: Age , confused by its own long accumulation of follies , is everlastingly inquiring , `` What does she see in him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 13]: as if young love came about through thinking -- or through conduct .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 15]: Age wants to know : `` What on earth can they talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 11]: as if talking had anything to do with April rains !
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 40]: At seventy , one gets up in the morning , finds the air sweet under a bright sun , feels lively ; thinks , `` I am hearty , today , '' and plans to go for a drive .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 31]: At eighteen , one goes to a dance , sits with a stranger on a stairway , feels peculiar , thinks nothing , and becomes incapable of any plan whatever .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 9]: Miss Morgan and George stayed where they were .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 27]: They had agreed to this in silence and without knowing it ; certainly without exchanging glances of intelligence -- they had exchanged no glances at all .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 20]: Both sat staring vaguely out into the ballroom , and , for a time , they did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 26]: Over their heads the music reached a climax of vivacity : drums , cymbals , triangle , and sleighbells , beating , clashing , tinkling .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 45]: Here and there were to be seen couples so carried away that , ceasing to move at the decorous , even glide , considered most knowing , they pranced and whirled through the throng , from wall to wall , galloping bounteously in abandon .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 27]: George suffered a shock of vague surprise when he perceived that his aunt , Fanny Minafer , was the lady-half of one of these wild couples .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 21]: Fanny Minafer , who rouged a little , was like fruit which in some climates dries with the bloom on .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 57]: Her features had remained prettily childlike ; so had her figure , and there were times when strangers , seeing her across the street , took her to be about twenty ; they were other times when at the same distance they took her to be about sixty , instead of forty , as she was .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 28]: She had old days and young days ; old hours and young hours ; old minutes and young minutes ; for the change might be that quick .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 32]: An alteration in her expression , or a difference in the attitude of her head , would cause astonishing indentations to appear -- and behold , Fanny was an old lady !
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 33]: But she had been never more childlike than she was tonight as she flew over the floor in the capable arms of the queer-looking duck ; for this person was her partner .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 24]: The queer-looking duck had been a real dancer in his day , it appeared ; and evidently his day was not yet over .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 52]: In spite of the headlong , gay rapidity with which he bore Miss Fanny about the big room , he danced authoritatively , avoiding without effort the lightest collision with other couples , maintaining sufficient grace throughout his wildest moments , and all the while laughing and talking with his partner .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 41]: What was most remarkable to George , and a little irritating , this stranger in the Amberson Mansion had no vestige of the air of deference proper to a stranger in such a place : he seemed thoroughly at home .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 51]: He seemed offensively so , indeed , when , passing the entrance to the gallery stairway , he disengaged his hand from Miss Fanny 's for an instant , and not pausing in the dance , waved a laughing salutation more than cordial , then capered lightly out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 14]: George gazed stonily at this manifestation , responding neither by word nor sign .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 11]: `` How 's that for a bit of freshness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 3]: he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: `` What was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 4]: Miss Morgan asked .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 12]: `` That queer-looking duck waving his hand at me like that .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 17]: Except he 's the Sharon girls ' uncle I do n't know him from Adam . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 11]: `` You do n't need to , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 15]: `` He was n't waving his hand to you : he meant me . ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 7]: `` Oh , he did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 8]: George was not mollified by the explanation .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 7]: `` Everybody seems to mean you !
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 17]: You certainly do seem to 've been pretty busy this week you 've been here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 17]: She pressed her bouquet to her face again , and laughed into it , not displeased .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: She made no other comment , and for another period neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 31]: Meanwhile the music stopped ; loud applause insisted upon its renewal ; an encore was danced ; there was an interlude of voices ; and the changing of partners began .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 23]: `` Well , '' said George finally , `` I must say you do n't seem to be much of a prattler .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 19]: They say it 's a great way to get a reputation for being wise , never saying much .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 8]: Do n't you ever talk any ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 10]: `` When people can understand , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 41]: He had been looking moodily out at the ballroom but he turned to her quickly , at this , saw that her eyes were sunny and content , over the top of her bouquet ; and he consented to smile .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 8]: `` Girls are usually pretty fresh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 24]: `` They ought to go to a man 's college about a year : they 'd get taught a few things about freshness !
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 12]: What you got to do after two o'clock to-morrow afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 7]: `` A whole lot of things .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 6]: Every minute filled up . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 23]: `` The snow 's fine for sleighing : I 'll come for you in a cutter at ten minutes after two . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 8]: `` I ca n't possibly go . ''
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 55]: `` If you do n't , '' he said , `` I 'm going to sit in the cutter in front of the gate , wherever you 're visiting , all afternoon , and if you try to go out with anybody else he 's got to whip me before he gets you . ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 39]: And as she laughed -- though she blushed a little , too -- he continued , seriously : `` If you think I 'm not in earnest you 're at liberty to make quite a big experiment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 4]: She laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 40]: `` I do n't think I 've often had so large a compliment as that , '' she said , `` especially on such short notice -- and yet , I do n't think I 'll go with you .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 11]: `` You be ready at ten minutes after two . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 8]: `` No , I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 7]: `` Yes , you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' she said , `` I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 13]: And her partner for the next dance arrived , breathless with searching .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 18]: `` Do n't forget I 've got the third from now , '' George called after her .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 6]: `` I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 9]: `` And every third one after that . ''
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 5]: `` I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 18]: she called , over her partner 's shoulder , and her voice was amused -- but meek .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 28]: When `` the third from now '' came , George presented himself before her without any greeting , like a brother , or a mannerless old friend .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 38]: Neither did she greet him , but moved away with him , concluding , as she went , an exchange of badinage with the preceding partner : she had been talkative enough with him , it appeared .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 33]: In fact , both George and Miss Morgan talked much more to every one else that evening , than to each other ; and they said nothing at all at this time .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 24]: Both looked preoccupied , as they began to dance , and preserved a gravity , of expression to the end of the number .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 45]: And when `` the third one after that '' came , they did not dance , but went back to the gallery stairway , seeming to have reached an understanding without any verbal consultation , that this suburb was again the place for them .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 24]: `` Well , '' said George , coolly , when they were seated , `` what did you say your name was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 4]: `` Morgan . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 5]: `` Funny name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 9]: `` Everybody else 's name always is . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 14]: `` I did n't mean it was really funny , '' George explained .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 15]: `` That 's just one of my crowd 's bits of horsing at college .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 13]: We always say ` funny name ' no matter what it is .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 22]: I guess we 're pretty fresh sometimes ; but I knew your name was Morgan because my mother said so downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 11]: I meant : what 's the rest of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 4]: `` Lucy . ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 4]: He was silent .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 12]: `` Is ` Lucy ' a funny name , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: Lucy 's very much all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 12]: he said , and he went so far as to smile .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 19]: Even his Aunt Fanny admitted that when George smiled `` in a certain way '' he was charming .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 13]: `` Thanks about letting my name be Lucy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 3]: George asked .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 10]: `` I do n't really know , myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 14]: `` What do you mean : you do n't really know yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 11]: `` I mean I only know what they tell me .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 14]: I believe them , of course , but believing is n't really knowing .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 32]: You believe some certain day is your birthday -- at least , I suppose you do -- but you do n't really know it is because you ca n't remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 9]: `` Do you always talk like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 30]: Miss Lucy Morgan laughed forgivingly , put her young head on one side , like a bird , and responded cheerfully : `` I 'm willing to learn wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 8]: What are you studying in school ? ''
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 4]: `` College ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 5]: `` At the university !
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: What are you studying there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 3]: George laughed .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 8]: `` Lot o ' useless guff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 12]: `` Then why do n't you study some useful guff ? ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 11]: `` What do you mean : ` useful ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 14]: `` Something you 'd use later , in your business or profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 6]: George waved his hand impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 15]: `` I do n't expect to go into any ` business or profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 5]: `` Certainly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 25]: George was emphatic , being sincerely annoyed by a suggestion which showed how utterly she failed to comprehend the kind of person he was .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 4]: she asked mildly .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 7]: `` Just look at 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 28]: he said , almost with bitterness , and he made a gesture presumably intended to indicate the business and professional men now dancing within range of vision .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 14]: `` That 's a fine career for a man , is n't it !
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 6]: Lawyers , bankers , politicians !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 14]: What do they get out of life , I 'd like to know !
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 9]: What do they ever know about real things ?
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 7]: Where do they ever get ? ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 11]: He was so earnest that she was surprised and impressed .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 29]: Evidently he had deep-seated ambitions , for he seemed to speak with actual emotion of these despised things which were so far beneath his planning for the future .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 40]: She had a vague , momentary vision of Pitt , at twenty-one , prime minister of England ; and she spoke , involuntarily in a lowered voice , with deference : `` What do you want to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 4]: George answered promptly .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 8]: `` A yachtsman , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 76]: Chapter VI Having thus , in a word , revealed his ambition for a career above courts , marts , and polling booths , George breathed more deeply than usual , and , turning his face from the lovely companion whom he had just made his confidant , gazed out at the dancers with an expression in which there was both sternness and a contempt for the squalid lives of the unyachted Midlanders before him .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 26]: However , among them , he marked his mother ; and his sombre grandeur relaxed momentarily ; a more genial light came into his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 39]: Isabel was dancing with the queer-looking duck ; and it was to be noted that the lively gentleman 's gait was more sedate than it had been with Miss Fanny Minafer , but not less dexterous and authoritative .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 40]: He was talking to Isabel as gaily as he had talked to Miss Fanny , though with less laughter , and Isabel listened and answered eagerly : her colour was high and her eyes had a look of delight .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 16]: She saw George and the beautiful Lucy on the stairway , and nodded to them .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 23]: George waved his hand vaguely : he had a momentary return of that inexplicable uneasiness and resentment which had troubled him downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 8]: `` How lovely your mother is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 13]: Lucy said `` I think she is , '' he agreed gently .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 10]: `` She 's the gracefulest woman in that ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 9]: She dances like a girl of sixteen . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 15]: `` Most girls of sixteen , '' said George , `` are bum dancers .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 14]: Anyhow , I would n't dance with one unless I had to . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 11]: `` Well , you 'd better dance with your mother !
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 6]: I never saw anybody lovelier .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 7]: How wonderfully they dance together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 14]: `` Your mother and -- and the queer-looking duck , '' said Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 12]: `` I 'm going to dance with him pretty soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 24]: `` I do n't care -- so long as you do n't give him one of the numbers that belong to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 32]: `` I 'll try to remember , '' she said , and thoughtfully lifted to her face the bouquet of violets and lilies , a gesture which George noted without approval .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 15]: Who sent you those flowers you keep makin ' such a fuss over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 5]: `` He did . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 8]: `` Who 's ` he ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 6]: `` The queer-looking duck . ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 10]: George feared no such rival ; he laughed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 12]: `` I s ` pose he 's some old widower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 20]: he said , the object thus described seeming ignominious enough to a person of eighteen , without additional characterization .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 6]: `` Some old widower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 6]: Lucy became serious at once .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 12]: `` Yes , he is a widower , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 15]: `` I ought to have told you before ; he 's my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 5]: George stopped laughing abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 10]: `` Well , that 's a horse on me .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 20]: If I 'd known he was your father , of course I would n't have made fun of him .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 5]: I 'm sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 13]: `` Nobody could make fun of him , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 7]: `` Why could n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 16]: `` It would n't make him funny : it would only make themselves silly . ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 10]: Upon this , George had a gleam of intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 28]: `` Well , I 'm not going to make myself silly any more , then ; I do n't want to take chances like that with you .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 11]: But I thought he was the Sharon girls ' uncle .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 30]: He came with them -- '' `` Yes , '' she said , `` I 'm always late to everything : I would n't let them wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 7]: We 're visiting the Sharons . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 7]: `` About time I knew that !
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 13]: You forget my being so fresh about your father , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: Of course he 's a distinguished looking man , in a way . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 5]: Lucy was still serious .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 7]: `` In a way ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 3]: she repeated .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 14]: `` You mean , not in your way , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 4]: George was perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 12]: `` How do you mean : not in my way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 39]: `` People pretty often say ` in a way ' and ` rather distinguished looking , ' or ` rather ' so-and-so , or ` rather ' anything , to show that they 're superior do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 37]: In New York last month I overheard a climber sort of woman speaking of me as ` little Miss Morgan , ' but she did n't mean my height ; she meant that she was important .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 23]: Her husband spoke of a friend of mine as ` little Mr. Pembroke ' and ` little Mr. Pembroke ' is six-feet-three .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 31]: This husband and wife were really so terribly unimportant that the only way they knew to pretend to be important was calling people ` little ' Miss or Mister so-and-so .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 11]: It 's a kind of snob slang , I think .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 21]: Of course people do n't always say ` rather ' or ` in a way ' to be superior . ''
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 6]: `` I should say not !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 14]: I use both of 'em a great deal myself , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 19]: `` One thing I do n't see though : What 's the use of a man being six-feet-three ?
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 19]: Men that size ca n't handle themselves as well as a man about five-feet-eleven and a half can .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 47]: Those long , gangling men , they 're nearly always too kind of wormy to be any good in athletics , and they 're so awkward they keep falling over chairs or -- '' `` Mr. Pembroke is in the army , '' said Lucy primly .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 7]: `` He 's extraordinarily graceful . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 5]: `` In the army ?
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 15]: Oh , I suppose he 's some old friend of your father 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 18]: `` They got on very well , '' she said , `` after I introduced them . ''
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 9]: George was a straightforward soul , at least .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 8]: `` Are you engaged to anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 9]: Not wholly mollified , he shrugged his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 10]: `` You seem to know a good many people !
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 8]: Do you live in New York ? ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: We do n't live anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 12]: `` What you mean : you do n't live anywhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 11]: `` We 've lived all over , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 19]: `` Papa used to live here in this town , but that was before I was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 10]: `` What do you keep moving around so for ?
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 6]: Is he a promoter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 6]: He 's an inventor . ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 7]: `` What 's he invented ? ''
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 22]: `` Just lately , '' said Lucy , `` he 's been working on a new kind of horseless carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 18]: `` Well , I 'm sorry for him , '' George said , in no unkindly spirit .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 11]: `` Those things are never going to amount to anything .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 23]: People are n't going to spend their lives lying on their backs in the road and letting grease drip in their faces .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 20]: Horseless carriages are pretty much a failure , and your father better not waste his time on 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 20]: `` Papa 'd be so grateful , '' she returned , `` if he could have your advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 7]: Instantly George 's face became flushed .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 16]: `` I do n't know that I 've done anything to be insulted for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 14]: `` I do n't see that what I said was particularly fresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 6]: `` No , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 11]: `` Then what do you -- '' She laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 5]: `` I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 14]: And I do n't mind your being such a lofty person at all .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 16]: I think it 's ever so interesting -- but papa 's a great man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 5]: `` Is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 13]: George decided to be good-natured `` Well , let us hope so .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 9]: I hope so , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 20]: Looking at him keenly , she saw that the magnificent youth was incredibly sincere in this bit of graciousness .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 32]: He spoke as a tolerant , elderly statesman might speak of a promising young politician ; and with her eyes still upon him , Lucy shook her head in gentle wonder .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 12]: `` I 'm just beginning to understand , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 5]: `` Understand what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 13]: `` What it means to be a real Amberson in this town .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 21]: Papa told me something about it before we came , but I see he did n't say half enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 8]: George superbly took this all for tribute .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 15]: `` Did your father say he knew the family before he left here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 33]: I believe he was particularly a friend of your Uncle George ; and he did n't say so , but I imagine he must have known your mother very well , too .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 13]: He was n't an inventor then ; he was a young lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 18]: The town was smaller in those days , and I believe he was quite well known . ''
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 5]: `` I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 35]: I 've no doubt the family are all very glad to see him back , especially if they used to have him at the house a good deal , as he told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 25]: `` I do n't think he meant to boast of it , '' she said : `` He spoke of it quite calmly . ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 55]: George stared at her for a moment in perplexity , then perceiving that her intention was satirical , `` Girls really ought to go to a man 's college , '' he said -- `` just a month or two , anyhow ; It 'd take some of the freshness out of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 20]: `` I ca n't believe it , '' she retorted , as her partner for the next dance arrived .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 34]: `` It would only make them a little politer on the surface -- they 'd be really just as awful as ever , after you got to know them a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 24]: `` What do you mean : ` after you got to know them a -- ' '' She was departing to the dance .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 26]: `` Janie and Mary Sharon told me all about what sort of a little boy you were , '' she said , over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 8]: `` You must think it out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 63]: She took wing away on the breeze of the waltz , and George , having stared gloomily after her for a few moments , postponed filling an engagement , and strolled round the fluctuating outskirts of the dance to where his uncle , George Amberson , stood smilingly watching , under one of the rose-vine arches at the entrance to the room .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 11]: `` Hello , young namesake , '' said the uncle .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 10]: `` Why lingers the laggard heel of the dancer ?
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 8]: Have n't you got a partner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 14]: `` She 's sitting around waiting for me somewhere , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 20]: `` See here : Who is this fellow Morgan that Aunt Fanny Minafer was dancing with a while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 3]: Amberson laughed .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 12]: `` He 's a man with a pretty daughter , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 19]: Meseemed you 've been spending the evening noticing something of that sort -- or do I err ? ''
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 4]: `` Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 6]: What sort is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 14]: `` I think we 'll have to give him a character , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 31]: He 's an old friend ; used to practice law here -- perhaps he had more debts than cases , but he paid 'em all up before he left town .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 24]: Your question is purely mercenary , I take it : you want to know his true worth before proceeding further with the daughter .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 20]: I can not inform you , though I notice signs of considerable prosperity in that becoming dress of hers .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 54]: However , you never can tell , it is an age when every sacrifice is made for the young , and how your own poor mother managed to provide those genuine pearl studs for you out of her allowance from father , I ca n't -- '' `` Oh , dry up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 4]: said the nephew .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 17]: `` I understand this Morgan -- '' `` Mr. Eugene Morgan , '' his uncle suggested .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 30]: `` Politeness requires that the young should -- '' `` I guess the ` young ' did n't know much about politeness in your day , '' George interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 18]: `` I understand that Mr. Eugene Morgan used to be a great friend of the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: `` Oh , the Minafers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: the uncle inquired , with apparent innocence .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 27]: `` No , I seem to recall that he and your father were not -- '' `` I mean the Ambersons , '' George said impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 14]: `` I understand he was a good deal around the house here . ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 11]: `` What is your objection to that , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 10]: `` What do you mean : my objection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 11]: `` You seemed to speak with a certain crossness . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 19]: `` Well , '' said George , `` I meant he seems to feel awfully at home here .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: The way he was dancing with Aunt Fanny -- '' Amberson laughed .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid your Aunt Fanny 's heart was stirred by ancient recollections , Georgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 12]: `` You mean she used to be silly about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 19]: `` She was n't considered singular , '' said the uncle `` He was -- he was popular .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 7]: Could you bear a question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 35]: `` What do you mean : could I bear -- '' `` I only wanted to ask : Do you take this same passionate interest in the parents of every girl you dance with ?
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 14]: Perhaps it 's a new fashion we old bachelors ought to take up .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 16]: Is it the thing this year to -- '' `` Oh , go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 6]: said George , moving away .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 40]: `` I only wanted to know -- '' He left the sentence unfinished , and crossed the room to where a girl sat waiting for his nobility to find time to fulfil his contract with her for this dance .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 53]: `` Pardon f ' keep ' wait , '' he muttered , as she rose brightly to meet him ; and she seemed pleased that he came at all -- but George was used to girls ' looking radiant when he danced with them , and she had little effect upon him .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 17]: He danced with her perfunctorily , thinking the while of Mr. Eugene Morgan and his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 33]: Strangely enough , his thoughts dwelt more upon the father than the daughter , though George could not possibly have given a reason -- even to himself -- for this disturbing preponderance .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 36]: By a coincidence , though not an odd one , the thoughts and conversation of Mr. Eugene Morgan at this very time were concerned with George Amberson Minafer , rather casually , it is true .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 29]: Mr. Morgan had retired to a room set apart for smoking , on the second floor , and had found a grizzled gentleman lounging in solitary possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: ` Gene Morgan ! ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 9]: this person exclaimed , rising with great heartiness .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 18]: `` I 'd heard you were in town -- I do n't believe you know me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 10]: `` Yes , I do , Fred Kinney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 7]: Mr. Morgan returned with equal friendliness .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 24]: `` Your real face -- the one I used to know -- it 's just underneath the one you 're masquerading in to-night .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 14]: You ought to have changed it more if you wanted a disguise . ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 5]: `` Twenty years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 4]: said Mr. Kinney .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 14]: `` It makes some difference in faces , but more in behaviour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 6]: `` It does so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 7]: his friend agreed with explosive emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 17]: `` My own behaviour began to be different about that long ago -- quite suddenly . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 10]: `` I remember , '' said Mr. Kinney sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 13]: `` Well , life 's odd enough as we look back . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 17]: `` Probably it 's going to be odder still -- if we could look forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 4]: `` Probably . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 5]: They sat and smoked .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 17]: `` However , '' Mr. Morgan remarked presently , `` I still dance like an Indian .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 8]: I leave that to my boy Fred .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 9]: He does the dancing for the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 11]: `` I suppose he 's upstairs hard at it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 9]: `` No , he 's not here . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: Mr. Kinney glanced toward the open door and lowered his voice .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 6]: `` He would n't come .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 19]: It seems that a couple of years or so ago he had a row with young Georgie Minafer .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 28]: Fred was president of a literary club they had , and he said this young Georgie got himself elected instead , in an overbearing sort of way .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 14]: Fred 's red-headed , you know -- I suppose you remember his mother ?
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 18]: You were at the wedding -- '' `` I remember the wedding , '' said Mr. Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 16]: `` And I remember your bachelor dinner -- most of it , that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 36]: `` Well , my boy Fred 's as red-headed now , '' Mr. Kinney went on , `` as his mother was then , and he 's very bitter about his row with Georgie Minafer .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 25]: He says he 'd rather burn his foot off than set it inside any Amberson house or any place else where young Georgie is .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 94]: Fact is , the boy seemed to have so much feeling over it I had my doubts about coming myself , but my wife said it was all nonsense ; we must n't humour Fred in a grudge over such a little thing , and while she despised that Georgie Minafer , herself , as much as any one else did , she was n't going to miss a big Amberson show just on account of a boys ' rumpus , and so on and so on ; and so we came . ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 9]: `` Do people dislike young Minafer generally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 10]: `` I do n't know about ` generally . '
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 27]: I guess he gets plenty of toadying ; but there 's certainly a lot of people that are glad to express their opinions about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 12]: `` Too much Amberson , I suppose , for one thing .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 24]: And for another , his mother just fell down and worshipped him from the day he was born That 's what beats me !
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 15]: I do n't have to tell you what Isabel Amberson is , Eugene Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 38]: She 's got a touch of the Amberson high stuff about her , but you ca n't get anybody that ever knew her to deny that she 's just about the finest woman in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Eugene Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 11]: `` You ca n't get anybody to deny that . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 17]: `` Then I ca n't see how she does n't see the truth about that boy .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 27]: He thinks he 's a little tin god on wheels -- and honestly , it makes some people weak and sick just to think about him !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 16]: Yet that high-spirited , intelligent woman , Isabel Amberson , actually sits and worships him !
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 17]: You can hear it in her voice when she speaks to him or speaks of him .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 13]: You can see it in her eyes when she looks at him .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: What does she see when she looks at him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 39]: Morgan 's odd expression of genial apprehension deepened whimsically , though it denoted no actual apprehension whatever , and cleared away from his face altogether when he smiled ; he became surprisingly winning and persuasive when he smiled .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 16]: He smiled now , after a moment , at this question of his old friend .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 14]: `` She sees something that we do n't see , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: `` What does she see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 5]: `` An angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 4]: Kinney laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 27]: `` Well , if she sees an angel when she looks at Georgie Minafer , she 's a funnier woman than I thought she was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 9]: `` Perhaps she is , '' said Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 9]: `` But that 's what she sees . ''
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 4]: `` My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 15]: It 's easy to see you 've only known him an hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 14]: In that time have you looked at Georgie and seen an angel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 39]: All I saw was a remarkably good-looking fool-boy with the pride of Satan and a set of nice new drawing-room manners that he probably could n't use more than half an hour at a time without busting . ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 14]: `` Then what -- '' `` Mothers are right , '' said Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 30]: `` Do you think this young George is the same sort of creature when he 's with his mother that he is when he 's bulldozing your boy Fred ?
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 12]: Mothers see the angel in us because the angel is there .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 21]: If it 's shown to the mother , the son has got an angel to show , has n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 33]: When a son cuts somebody 's throat the mother only sees it 's possible for a misguided angel to act like a devil -- and she 's entirely right about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 13]: Kinney laughed , and put his hand on his friend 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: `` I remember what a fellow you always were to argue , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 26]: `` You mean Georgie Minafer is as much of an angel as any murderer is , and that Georgie 's mother is always right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 14]: `` I 'm afraid she always has been , '' Morgan said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 8]: The friendly hand remained upon his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 9]: `` She was wrong once , old fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 10]: At least , so it seemed to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 11]: `` No , '' said Morgan , a little awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 21]: `` No -- '' Kinney relieved the slight embarrassment that had come upon both of them : he laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 15]: `` Wait till you know young Georgie a little better , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 27]: `` Something tells me you 're going to change your mind about his having an angel to show , if you see anything of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 24]: `` You mean beauty 's in the eye of the beholder , and the angel is all in the eye of the mother .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 22]: If you were a painter , Fred , you 'd paint mothers with angels ' eyes holding imps in their laps .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 2]: Me .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 12]: I 'll stick to the Old Masters and the cherubs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 7]: Mr. Kinney looked at him musingly .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 29]: `` Somebody 's eyes must have been pretty angelic , '' he said , `` if they 've been persuading you that Georgie Minnafer is a cherub ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 9]: `` They are , '' said Morgan heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 9]: `` They 're more angelic than ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 20]: And as a new flourish of music sounded overhead he threw away his cigarette , and jumped up briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 12]: `` Good-bye , I 've got this dance with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 5]: `` With whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 5]: `` With Isabel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 10]: The grizzled Mr. Kinney affected to rub his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 18]: `` It startles me , your jumping up like that to go and dance with Isabel Amberson !
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 11]: Twenty years seem to have passed -- but have they ?
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 17]: Tell me , have you danced with poor old Fanny , too , this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 4]: `` Twice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 5]: `` My Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 7]: Kinney groaned , half in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: `` Old times starting all over again !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 4]: My Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 5]: `` Old times ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 7]: Morgan laughed gaily from the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 5]: `` Not a bit !
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 7]: There are n't any old times .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 13]: When times are gone they 're not old , they 're dead !
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 10]: There are n't any times but new times ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 16]: And he vanished in such a manner that he seemed already to have begun dancing .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 42]: Chapter VII The appearance of Miss Lucy Morgan the next day , as she sat in George 's fast cutter , proved so charming that her escort was stricken to soft words instantly , and failed to control a poetic impulse .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 47]: Her rich little hat was trimmed with black fur ; her hair was almost as dark as the fur ; a great boa of black fur was about her shoulders ; her hands were vanished into a black muff ; and George 's laprobe was black .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 9]: `` You look like -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 17]: `` Your face looks like -- it looks like a snowflake on a lump of coal .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 15]: I mean a -- a snowflake that would be a rose-leaf , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 14]: `` Perhaps you 'd better look at the reins , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 8]: `` We almost upset just then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 7]: George declined to heed this advice .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 18]: `` Because there 's too much pink in your cheeks for a snowflake , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 23]: `` What 's that fairy story about snow-white and rose-red -- '' `` We 're going pretty fast , Mr. Minafer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 15]: `` Well , you see , I 'm only here for two weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 7]: `` I mean the sleigh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 3]: she explained .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 15]: `` We 're not the only people on the street , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 12]: `` Oh , they 'll keep out of the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 19]: `` That 's very patrician charioteering , but it seems to me a horse like this needs guidance .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 13]: I 'm sure he 's going almost twenty miles an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 17]: `` That 's nothing , '' said George ; but he consented to look forward again .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 12]: `` He can trot under three minutes , all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 18]: `` I suppose your father thinks he can build a horseless carriage to go that fast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 10]: `` They go that fast already , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' said George ; `` they do -- for about a hundred feet !
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 10]: Then they give a yell and burn up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 22]: Evidently she decided not to defend her father 's faith in horseless carriages , for she laughed , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 19]: The cold air was polka-dotted with snowflakes , and trembled to the loud , continuous jingling of sleighbells .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 78]: Boys and girls , all aglow and panting jets of vapour , darted at the passing sleighs to ride on the runners , or sought to rope their sleds to any vehicle whatever , but the fleetest no more than just touched the flying cutter , though a hundred soggy mittens grasped for it , then reeled and whirled till sometimes the wearers of those daring mittens plunged flat in the snow and lay a-sprawl , reflecting .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 25]: For this was the holiday time , and all the boys and girls in town were out , most of them on National Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 31]: But there came panting and chugging up that flat thoroughfare a thing which some day was to spoil all their sleigh-time merriment -- save for the rashest and most disobedient .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 34]: It was vaguely like a topless surry , but cumbrous with unwholesome excrescences fore and aft , while underneath were spinning leather belts and something that whirred and howled and seemed to stagger .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 19]: The ride-stealers made no attempt to fasten their sleds to a contrivance so nonsensical and yet so fearsome .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 34]: Instead , they gave over their sport and concentrated all their energies in their lungs , so that up and down the street the one cry shrilled increasingly : `` Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 4]: Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 4]: Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 11]: Mister , why do n't you git a hoss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 33]: But the mahout in charge , sitting solitary on the front seat , was unconcerned -- he laughed , and now and then ducked a snowball without losing any of his good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 28]: It was Mr. Eugene Morgan who exhibited so cheerful a countenance between the forward visor of a deer-stalker cap and the collar of a fuzzy gray ulster .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 6]: `` Git a hoss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 10]: the children shrieked , and gruffer voices joined them .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 5]: `` Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 4]: Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 5]: Git a hoss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 23]: George Minafer was correct thus far : the twelve miles an hour of such a machine would never over-take George 's trotter .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 16]: The cutter was already scurrying between the stone pillars at the entrance to Amberson Addition .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 17]: `` That 's my grandfather 's , '' said George , nodding toward the Amberson Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 8]: `` I ought to know that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 3]: Lucy exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 19]: `` We stayed there late enough last night : papa and I were almost the last to go .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 32]: He and your mother and Miss Fanny Minafer got the musicians to play another waltz when everybody else had gone downstairs and the fiddles were being put away in their cases .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 15]: Papa danced part of it with Miss Minafer and the rest with your mother .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 11]: Miss Minafer 's your aunt , is n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 8]: `` Yes ; she lives with us .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 8]: I tease her a good deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: `` What about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 17]: `` Oh , anything handy -- whatever 's easy to tease an old maid about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 7]: `` Does n't she mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 15]: `` She usually has sort of a grouch on me , '' laughed George .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 4]: `` Nothing much .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 10]: That 's our house just beyond grandfather 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 20]: He waved a sealskin gauntlet to indicate the house Major Amberson had built for Isabel as a wedding gift .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 22]: `` It 's almost the same as grandfather 's , only not as large and has n't got a regular ballroom .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 28]: We gave the dance , last night , at grandfather 's on account of the ballroom , and because I 'm the only grandchild , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 33]: Of course , some day that 'll be my house , though I expect my mother will most likely go on living where she does now , with father and Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 19]: I suppose I 'll probably build a country house , too -- somewhere East , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 15]: He stopped speaking , and frowned as they passed a closed carriage and pair .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 87]: The body of this comfortable vehicle sagged slightly to one side ; the paint was old and seamed with hundreds of minute cracks like little rivers on a black map ; the coachman , a fat and elderly darky , seemed to drowse upon the box ; but the open window afforded the occupants of the cutter a glimpse of a tired , fine old face , a silk hat , a pearl tie , and an astrachan collar , evidently out to take the air .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 11]: `` There 's your grandfather now , '' said Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 6]: `` Is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 7]: George 's frown was not relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 20]: `` Yes , it is ; and he ought to give that rat-trap away and sell those old horses .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 12]: They 're a disgrace , all shaggy -- not even clipped .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 28]: I suppose he does n't notice it -- people get awful funny when they get old ; they seem to lose their self-respect , sort of . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 13]: `` He seemed a real Brummell to me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 23]: `` Oh , he keeps up about what he wears , well enough , but -- well , look at that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 25]: He pointed to a statue of Minerva , one of the cast-iron sculptures Major Amberson had set up in opening the Addition years before .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 39]: Minerva was intact , but a blackish streak descended unpleasantly from her forehead to the point of her straight nose , and a few other streaks were sketched in a repellent dinge upon the folds of her drapery .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 11]: `` That must be from soot , '' said Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 10]: `` There are so many houses around here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 14]: `` Anyhow , somebody ought to see that these statues are kept clean .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 16]: My grandfather owns a good many of these houses , I guess , for renting .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 31]: Of course , he sold most of the lots -- there are n't any vacant ones , and there used to be heaps of 'em when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 85]: Another thing I do n't think he ought to allow a good many of these people bought big lots and they built houses on 'em ; then the price of the land kept getting higher , and they 'd sell part of their yards and let the people that bought it build houses on it to live in , till they have n't hardly any of 'em got big , open yards any more , and it 's getting all too much built up .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 28]: The way it used to be , it was like a gentleman 's country estate , and that 's the way my grandfather ought to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 17]: He lets these people take too many liberties : they do anything they want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 9]: `` But how could he stop them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 7]: Lucy asked , surely with reason .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 17]: `` If he sold them the land , it 's theirs , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 12]: George remained serene in the face of this apparently difficult question .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 20]: `` He ought to have all the trades-people boycott the families that sell part of their yards that way .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 30]: All he 'd have to do would be to tell the trades-people they would n't get any more orders from the family if they did n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 7]: `` From ` the family ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 4]: What family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: `` Our family , '' said George , unperturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 5]: `` The Ambersons . ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 5]: `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 37]: she murmured , and evidently she did see something that he did not , for , as she lifted her muff to her face , he asked : `` What are you laughing at now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 18]: `` You always seem to have some little secret of your own to get happy over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 4]: `` Always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 13]: `` What a big word when we only met last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 16]: `` That 's another case of it , '' he said , with obvious sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 13]: `` One of the reasons I do n't like you -- much !
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 16]: -- is you 've got that way of seeming quietly superior to everybody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 5]: `` I have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 20]: `` Oh , you think you keep it sort of confidential to yourself , but it 's plain enough !
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 11]: I do n't believe in that kind of thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 6]: `` You do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 8]: `` No , '' said George emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 5]: `` Not with me !
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 41]: I think the world 's like this : there 's a few people that their birth and position , and so on , puts them at the top , and they ought to treat each other entirely as equals . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 21]: His voice betrayed a little emotion as he added , `` I would n't speak like this to everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 21]: `` You mean you 're confiding your deepest creed -- or code , whatever it is -- to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 12]: `` Go on , make fun of it , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 4]: George said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 9]: `` You do think you 're terribly clever !
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 6]: It makes me tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 28]: `` Well , as you do n't like my seeming ` quietly superior , ' after this I 'll be noisily superior , '' she returned cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 7]: `` We aim to please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 22]: `` I had a notion before I came for you today that we were going to quarrel , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 12]: `` No , we wo n't ; it takes two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 23]: She laughed and waved her muff toward a new house , not quite completed , standing in a field upon their right .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 21]: They had passed beyond Amberson Addition , and were leaving the northern fringes of the town for the open country .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 9]: `` Is n't that a beautiful house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 11]: `` Papa and I call it our Beautiful House . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 5]: George was not pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 8]: `` Does it belong to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 5]: `` Of course not !
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: Papa brought me out here the other day , driving in his machine , and we both loved it .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 10]: It 's so spacious and dignified and plain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 9]: `` Yes , it 's plain enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 3]: George grunted .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 26]: `` Yet it 's lovely ; the gray-green roof and shutters give just enough colour , with the trees , for the long white walls .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 18]: It seems to me the finest house I 've seen in this part of the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 20]: George was outraged by an enthusiasm so ignorant -- not ten minutes ago they had passed the Amberson Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 12]: `` Is that a sample of your taste in architecture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 17]: `` Because it strikes me you better go somewhere and study the subject a little ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 4]: Lucy looked puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 11]: `` What makes you have so much feeling about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 6]: Have I offended you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 6]: `` Offended ' nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 4]: George returned brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 23]: `` Girls usually think they know it all as soon as they 've learned to dance and dress and flirt a little .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 12]: They never know anything about things like architecture , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 16]: That house is about as bum a house as any house I ever saw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 3]: George repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 8]: `` Did you ask me why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 23]: `` Well , for one thing -- '' he paused -- `` for one thing -- well , just look at it !
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 26]: I should n't think you 'd have to do any more than look at it if you 'd ever given any attention to architecture . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 13]: `` What is the matter with its architecture , Mr. Minafer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 12]: `` Well , it 's this way , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 6]: `` It 's like this .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 19]: Well , for instance , that house -- well , it was built like a town house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 26]: He spoke of it in the past tense , because they had now left it far behind them -- a human habit of curious significance .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 14]: `` It was like a house meant for a street in the city .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 21]: What kind of a house was that for people of any taste to build out here in the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 12]: `` But papa says it 's built that way on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 39]: There are a lot of other houses being built in this direction , and papa says the city 's coming out this way ; and in a year or two that house will be right in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 14]: `` It was a bum house , anyhow , '' said George crossly .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 13]: `` I do n't even know the people that are building it .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 39]: They say a lot of riffraff come to town every year nowadays and there 's other riffraff that have always lived here , and have made a little money , and act as if they owned the place .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 41]: Uncle Sydney was talking about it yesterday : he says he and some of his friends are organizing a country club , and already some of these riffraff are worming into it -- people he never heard of at all !
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 19]: Anyhow , I guess it 's pretty clear you do n't know a great deal about architecture . ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 10]: She demonstrated the completeness of her amiability by laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 28]: `` I 'll know something about the North Pole before long , '' she said , `` if we keep going much farther in this direction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: At this he was remorseful .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 19]: `` All right , we 'll turn , and drive south awhile till you get warmed up again .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 13]: I expect we have been going against the wind about long enough .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: Indeed , I 'm sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 29]: He said , `` Indeed , I 'm sorry , '' in a nice way , and looked very strikingly handsome when he said it , she thought .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 47]: No doubt it is true that there is more rejoicing in heaven over one sinner repented than over all the saints who consistently remain holy , and the rare , sudden gentlenesses of arrogant people have infinitely more effect than the continual gentleness of gentle people .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 21]: Arrogance turned gentle melts the heart ; and Lucy gave her companion a little sidelong , sunny nod of acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 22]: George was dazzled by the quick glow of her eyes , and found himself at a loss for something to say .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 22]: Having turned about , he kept his horse to a walk , and at this gait the sleighbells tinkled but intermittently .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 34]: Gleaming wanly through the whitish vapour that kept rising from the trotter 's body and flanks , they were like tiny fog-bells , and made the only sounds in a great winter silence .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 57]: The white road ran between lonesome rail fences ; and frozen barnyards beyond the fences showed sometimes a harrow left to rust , with its iron seat half filled with stiffened snow , and sometimes an old dead buggy , it 's wheels forever set , it seemed , in the solid ice of deep ruts .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 40]: Chickens scratched the metallic earth with an air of protest , and a masterless ragged colt looked up in sudden horror at the mild tinkle of the passing bells , then blew fierce clouds of steam at the sleigh .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 24]: The snow no longer fell , and far ahead , in a grayish cloud that lay upon the land , was the town .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 8]: Lucy looked at this distant thickening reflection .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 26]: `` When we get this far out we can see there must be quite a little smoke hanging over the town , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 10]: `` I suppose that 's because it 's growing .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 22]: As it grows bigger it seems to get ashamed of itself , so it makes this cloud and hides in it .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 38]: Papa says it used to be a bit nicer when he lived here : he always speaks of it differently -- he always has a gentle look , a particular tone of voice , I 've noticed .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 9]: He must have been very fond of it .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 15]: It must have been a lovely place : everybody must have been so jolly .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 19]: From the way he talks , you 'd think life here then was just one long midsummer serenade .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 35]: He declares it was always sunshine , that the air was n't like the air anywhere else -- that , as he remembers it , there always seemed to be gold-dust in the air .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 4]: I doubt it !
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 35]: I think it does n't seem to be duller air to him now just on account of having a little soot in it sometimes , but probably because he was twenty years younger then .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 19]: It seems to me the gold-dust he thinks was here is just his being young that he remembers .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 7]: I think it was just youth .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 13]: It is pretty pleasant to be young , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 10]: She laughed absently , then appeared to become wistful .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 21]: `` I wonder if we really do enjoy it as much as we 'll look back and think we did !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 6]: I do n't suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 57]: Anyhow , for my part I feel as if I must be missing something about it , somehow , because I do n't ever seem to be thinking about what 's happening at the present moment ; I 'm always looking forward to something -- thinking about things that will happen when I 'm older . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 12]: `` You 're a funny girl , '' George said gently .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 18]: `` But your voice sounds pretty nice when you think and talk along together like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 16]: The horse shook himself all over , and the impatient sleighbells made his wish audible .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 24]: Accordingly , George tightened the reins , and the cutter was off again at a three-minute trot , no despicable rate of speed .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 27]: It was not long before they were again passing Lucy 's Beautiful House , and here George thought fit to put an appendix to his remark .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 25]: `` You 're a funny girl , and you know a lot -- but I do n't believe you know much about architecture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 15]: Coming toward them , black against the snowy road , was a strange silhouette .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 68]: It approached moderately and without visible means of progression , so the matter seemed from a distance ; but as the cutter shortened the distance , the silhouette was revealed to be Mr. Morgan 's horseless carriage , conveying four people atop : Mr. Morgan with George 's mother beside him , and , in the rear seat , Miss Fanny Minafer and the Honorable George Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 31]: All four seemed to be in the liveliest humour , like high-spirited people upon a new adventure ; and Isabel waved her handkerchief dashingly as the cutter flashed by them .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 8]: `` For the Lord 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 3]: George gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 11]: `` Your mother 's a dear , '' said Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 10]: `` And she does wear the most bewitching things !
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 17]: She looked like a Russian princess , though I doubt if they 're that handsome . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 25]: George said nothing ; he drove on till they had crossed Amberson Addition and reached the stone pillars at the head of National Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 4]: There he turned .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 18]: `` Let 's go back and take another look at that old sewing-machine , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 28]: `` It certainly is the weirdest , craziest -- '' He left the sentence unfinished , and presently they were again in sight of the old sewing-machine .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 4]: George shouted mockingly .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 44]: three figures stood in the road , and a pair of legs , with the toes turned up , indicated that a fourth figure lay upon its back in the snow , beneath a horseless carriage that had decided to need a horse .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 42]: George became vociferous with laughter , and coming up at his trotter 's best gait , snow spraying from runners and every hoof , swerved to the side of the road and shot by , shouting , `` Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 4]: Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 5]: Git a hoss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 34]: Three hundred yards away he turned and came back , racing ; leaning out as he passed , to wave jeeringly at the group about the disabled machine : `` Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 4]: Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 23]: Git a -- '' The trotter had broken into a gallop , and Lucy cried a warning : `` Be careful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 7]: `` Look where you 're driving !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 8]: There 's a ditch on that side .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 46]: Look -- '' George turned too late ; the cutter 's right runner went into the ditch and snapped off ; the little sleigh upset , and , after dragging its occupants some fifteen yards , left them lying together in a bank of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 21]: Then the vigorous young horse kicked himself free of all annoyances , and disappeared down the road , galloping cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 63]: Chapter VIII When George regained some measure of his presence of mind , Miss Lucy Morgan 's cheek , snowy and cold , was pressing his nose slightly to one side ; his right arm was firmly about her neck ; and a monstrous amount of her fur boa seemed to mingle with an equally unplausible quantity of snow in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 15]: He was confused , but conscious of no objection to any of these juxtapositions .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 25]: She was apparently uninjured , for she sat up , hatless , her hair down , and said mildly : `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 20]: Though her father had been under his machine when they passed , he was the first to reach them .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 20]: He threw himself on his knees beside his daughter , but found her already laughing , and was reassured .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 26]: `` They 're all right , '' he called to Isabel , who was running toward them , ahead of her brother and Fanny Minafer .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 16]: `` This snowbank 's a feather bed -- nothing the matter with them at all .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 7]: Do n't look so pale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 4]: `` Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 4]: `` Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 11]: Georgie was on his feet , snow all over him .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 9]: `` Do n't make a fuss , mother !
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 5]: Nothing 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 14]: That darned silly horse -- '' Sudden tears stood in Isabel 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 25]: `` To see you down underneath -- dragging -- oh -- '' Then with shaking hands she began to brush the snow from him .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 9]: `` Let me alone , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 7]: `` You 'll ruin your gloves .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 17]: You 're getting snow all over you , and -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 13]: `` You 'll catch cold ; you must n't catch cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 7]: And she continued to brush him .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 35]: Amberson had brought Lucy 's hat ; Miss Fanny acted as lady 's - maid ; and both victims of the accident were presently restored to about their usual appearance and condition of apparel .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 36]: In fact , encouraged by the two older gentlemen , the entire party , with one exception , decided that the episode was after all a merry one , and began to laugh about it .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 13]: But George was glummer than the December twilight now swiftly closing in .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 6]: `` That darned horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 15]: `` I would n't bother about Pendennis , Georgie , '' said his uncle .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 58]: `` You can send a man out for what 's left of the cutter tomorrow , and Pendennis will gallop straight home to his stable : he 'll be there a long while before we will , because all we 've got to depend on to get us home is Gene Morgan 's broken-down chafing-dish yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 20]: They were approaching the machine as he spoke , and his friend , again underneath it , heard him .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 5]: He emerged , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: `` She 'll go , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 5]: `` All aboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 7]: He offered his hand to Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 25]: She was smiling but still pale , and her eyes , in spite of the smile , kept upon George in a shocked anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 27]: Miss Fanny had already mounted to the rear seat , and George , after helping Lucy Morgan to climb up beside his aunt , was following .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 20]: Isabel saw that his shoes were light things of patent leather , and that snow was clinging to them .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 43]: She made a little rush toward him , and , as one of his feet rested on the iron step of the machine , in mounting , she began to clean the snow from his shoe with her almost aerial lace handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: `` You must n't catch cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 5]: `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 9]: George shouted , and furiously withdrew his foot .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 11]: `` Then stamp the snow off , '' she begged .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 10]: `` You must n't ride with wet feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 6]: `` They 're not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 6]: George roared , thoroughly outraged .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 8]: `` For heaven 's sake get in !
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 8]: You 're standing in the snow yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 4]: Get in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 16]: Isabel consented , turning to Morgan , whose habitual expression of apprehensiveness was somewhat accentuated .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 15]: He climbed up after her , George Amberson having gone to the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 12]: `` You 're the same Isabel I used to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 7]: he said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 9]: `` You 're a divinely ridiculous woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 7]: `` Am I , Eugene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: she said , not displeased . ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 16]: ` Divinely ' and ` ridiculous ' just counterbalance each other , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 18]: Plus one and minus one equal nothing ; so you mean I 'm nothing in particular ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 12]: `` No , '' he answered , tugging at a lever .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 12]: `` That does n't seem to be precisely what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 27]: This exclamation referred to the subterranean machinery , for dismaying sounds came from beneath the floor , and the vehicle plunged , then rolled noisily forward .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 4]: `` Behold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 4]: George Amberson exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: `` She does move !
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 7]: It must be another accident . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 4]: `` Accident ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 6]: Morgan shouted over the din .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 19]: She breathes , she stirs ; she seems to feel a thrill of life along her keel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 12]: And he began to sing `` The Star Spangled Banner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 12]: Amberson joined him lustily , and sang on when Morgan stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 33]: The twilight sky cleared , discovering a round moon already risen ; and the musical congressman hailed this bright presence with the complete text and melody of `` The Danube River . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: His nephew , behind , was gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 72]: He had overheard his mother 's conversation with the inventor : it seemed curious to him that this Morgan , of whom he had never heard until last night , should be using the name `` Isabel '' so easily ; and George felt that it was not just the thing for his mother to call Morgan `` Eugene ; '' the resentment of the previous night came upon George again .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 33]: Meanwhile , his mother and Morgan continued their talk ; but he could no longer hear what they said ; the noise of the car and his uncle 's songful mood prevented .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 37]: He marked how animated Isabel seemed ; it was not strange to see his mother so gay , but it was strange that a man not of the family should be the cause of her gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 5]: And George sat frowning .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 9]: Fanny Minafer had begun to talk to Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 22]: `` Your father wanted to prove that his horseless carriage would run , even in the snow , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 8]: `` It really does , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: `` Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 6]: `` It 's so interesting !
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 13]: He 's been telling us how he 's going to change it .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 18]: He says he 's going to have wheels all made of rubber and blown up with air .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 25]: I do n't understand what he means at all ; I should think they 'd explode -- but Eugene seems to be very confident .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 7]: He always was confident , though .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 12]: It seems so like old times to hear him talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 10]: She became thoughtful , and Lucy turned to George .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 22]: `` You tried to swing underneath me and break the fall for me when we went over , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 17]: `` I knew you were doing that , and -- it was nice of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 14]: `` Was n't any fall to speak of , '' he returned brusquely .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 10]: `` Could n't have hurt either of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 14]: `` Still it was friendly of you -- and awfully quick , too .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 11]: I 'll not -- I 'll not forget it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 22]: Her voice had a sound of genuineness , very pleasant ; and George began to forget his annoyance with her father .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 62]: This annoyance of his had not been alleviated by the circumstance that neither of the seats of the old sewing-machine was designed for three people , but when his neighbour spoke thus gratefully , he no longer minded the crowding -- in fact , it pleased him so much that he began to wish the old sewing-machine would go even slower .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 21]: And she had spoken no word of blame for his letting that darned horse get the cutter into the ditch .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 28]: George presently addressed her hurriedly , almost tremulously , speaking close to her ear : `` I forgot to tell you something : you 're pretty nice !
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 12]: I thought so the first second I saw you last night .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 17]: I 'll come for you tonight and take you to the Assembly at the Amberson Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 9]: You 're going , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 19]: `` Yes , but I 'm going with papa and the Sharons I 'll see you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 35]: `` Looks to me as if you were awfully conventional , '' George grumbled ; and his disappointment was deeper than he was willing to let her see -- though she probably did see .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 13]: `` Well , we 'll dance the cotillion together , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: `` I 'm afraid not .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 6]: I promised Mr. Kinney . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 11]: George 's tone was shocked , as at incredible news .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 17]: `` Well , you could break that engagement , I guess , if you wanted to !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 12]: Girls always can get out of things when they want to .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 5]: Wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 8]: `` I do n't think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 6]: `` Because I promised him .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 5]: Several days ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 18]: George gulped , and lowered his pride , `` I do n't -- oh , look here !
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 32]: I only want to go to that thing tonight to get to see something of you ; and if you do n't dance the cotillion with me , how can I ?
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 23]: I 'll only be here two weeks , and the others have got all the rest of your visit to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 9]: Wo n't you do it , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 6]: `` I could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 5]: said the stricken George .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 38]: `` If you 're going to decline to dance that cotillion with me simply because you 've promised a -- a -- a miserable red-headed outsider like Fred Kinney , why we might as well quit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 5]: `` Quit what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 14]: `` You know perfectly well what I mean , '' he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 6]: `` I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 8]: `` Well , you ought to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 9]: `` But I do n't at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 31]: George , thoroughly hurt , and not a little embittered , expressed himself in a short outburst of laughter : `` Well , I ought to have seen it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 5]: `` Seen what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 21]: `` That you might turn out to be a girl who 'd like a fellow of the red-headed Kinney sort .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 11]: I ought to have seen it from the first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 6]: Lucy bore her disgrace lightly .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 31]: `` Oh , dancing a cotillion with a person does n't mean that you like him -- but I do n't see anything in particular the matter with Mr. Kinney .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 4]: What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 32]: `` If you do n't see anything the matter with him for yourself , '' George responded , icily , `` I do n't think pointing it out would help you .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 7]: You probably would n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 9]: `` You might try , '' she suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 37]: `` Of course I 'm a stranger here , and if people have done anything wrong or have something unpleasant about them , I would n't have any way of knowing it , just at first .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 19]: If poor Mr. Kinney -- '' `` I prefer not to discuss it , '' said George curtly .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 9]: `` He 's an enemy of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 9]: `` I prefer not to discuss it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 15]: `` Well , but -- '' `` I prefer not to discuss it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 5]: `` Very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 40]: She began to hum the air of the song which Mr. George Amberson was now discoursing , `` O moon of my delight that knows no wane '' -- and there was no further conversation on the back seat .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 34]: They had entered Amberson Addition , and the moon of Mr. Amberson 's delight was overlaid by a slender Gothic filagree ; the branches that sprang from the shade trees lining the street .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 55]: Through the windows of many of the houses rosy lights were flickering ; and silver tinsel and evergreen wreaths and brilliant little glass globes of silver and wine colour could be seen , and glimpses were caught of Christmas trees , with people decking them by firelight -- reminders that this was Christmas Eve .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 50]: The ride-stealers had disappeared from the highway , though now and then , over the gasping and howling of the horseless carriage , there came a shrill jeer from some young passer-by upon the sidewalk : `` Mister , fer heaven 's sake go an ' git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 4]: Git a hoss !
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 5]: Git a hoss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 12]: The contrivance stopped with a heart-shaking jerk before Isabel 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 25]: The gentlemen jumped down , helping Isabel and Fanny to descend ; there were friendly leavetakings -- and one that was not precisely friendly .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 16]: `` It 's ` au revoir , ' till to-night , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: Lucy asked , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 5]: `` Good afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 44]: said George , and he did not wait , as his relatives did , to see the old sewing machine start briskly down the street , toward the Sharons ' ; its lighter load consisting now of only Mr. Morgan and his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 8]: George went into the house at once .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 12]: He found his father reading the evening paper in the library .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 11]: `` Where are your mother and your Aunt Fanny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 8]: Mr. Minafer inquired , not looking up .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 24]: `` They 're coming , '' said his son ; and , casting himself heavily into a chair , stared at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 21]: His prediction was verified a few moments later ; the two ladies came in cheerfully , unfastening their fur cloaks .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 12]: `` It 's all right , Georgie , '' said Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 13]: `` Your Uncle George called to us that Pendennis got home safely .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 18]: Put your shoes close to the fire , dear , or else go and change them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 22]: She went to her husband and patted him lightly on the shoulder , an action which George watched with sombre moodiness .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 11]: `` You might dress before long , '' she suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 16]: `` We 're all going to the Assembly , after dinner , are n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 10]: Brother George said he 'd go with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 9]: `` Look here , '' said George abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 11]: `` How about this man Morgan and his old sewing-machine ?
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 13]: Does n't he want to get grandfather to put money into it ?
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 11]: Is n't he trying to work Uncle George for that ?
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 10]: Is n't that what he 's up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: It was Miss Fanny who responded .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 6]: `` You little silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 7]: she cried , with surprising sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 9]: `` What on earth are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 14]: Eugene Morgan 's perfectly able to finance his own inventions these days . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 16]: `` I 'll bet he borrows money of Uncle George , '' the nephew insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 8]: Isabel looked at him in grave perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 12]: `` Why do you say such a thing , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 15]: `` He strikes me as that sort of man , '' he answered doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 8]: `` Is n't he , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 9]: Minafer set down his paper for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 22]: `` He was a fairly wild young fellow twenty years ago , '' he said , glancing at his wife absently .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 41]: `` He was like you in one thing , Georgie ; he spent too much money -- only he did n't have any mother to get money out of a grandfather for him , so he was usually in debt .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 15]: But I believe I 've heard he 's done fairly well of late years .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 30]: No , I ca n't say I think he 's a swindler , and I doubt if he needs anybody else 's money to back his horseless carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 15]: `` Well , what 's he brought the old thing here for , then ?
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 17]: People that own elephants do n't take them elephants around with 'em when they go visiting .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 9]: What 's he got it here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 18]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know , '' said Mr. Minafer , resuming his paper .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 7]: `` You might ask him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 11]: Isabel laughed , and patted her husband 's shoulder again .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 8]: `` Are n't you going to dress ?
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 10]: Are n't we all going to the dance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 4]: He groaned faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 15]: `` Are n't your brother and Georgie escorts enough for you and Fanny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 10]: `` Would n't you enjoy it at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 8]: `` You know I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 46]: Isabel let her hand remain upon his shoulder a moment longer ; she stood behind him , looking into the fire , and George , watching her broodingly , thought there was more colour in her face than the reflection of the flames accounted for .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 18]: `` Well , then , '' she said indulgently , `` stay at home and be happy .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 13]: We wo n't urge you if you 'd really rather not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: `` I really would n't , '' he said contentedly .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 33]: Half an hour later , George was passing through the upper hall , in a bath-robe stage of preparation for the evening 's ' gaieties , when he encountered his Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 4]: He stopped her .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 12]: `` What in the world is the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 9]: she demanded , regarding him with little amiability .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 15]: `` You look as if you were rehearsing for a villain in a play .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 6]: Do change your expression ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 19]: His expression gave no sign of yielding to the request ; on the contrary , its somberness deepened .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 21]: `` I suppose you do n't know why father does n't want to go tonight , '' he said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 15]: `` You 're his only sister , and yet you do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: `` He never wants to go anywhere that I ever heard of , '' said Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 9]: `` What is the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 17]: `` He does n't want to go because he does n't like this man Morgan . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 4]: Fanny cried impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 19]: `` Eugene Morgan is n't in your father 's thoughts at all , one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 6]: Why should he be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 3]: George hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 24]: `` Well -- it strikes me -- Look here , what makes you and -- and everybody -- so excited over him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 4]: `` Excited ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 3]: she jeered .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 24]: `` Ca n't people be glad to see an old friend without silly children like you having to make a to-do about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 26]: I 've just been in your mother 's room suggesting that she might give a little dinner for them -- '' `` For who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 6]: `` For whom , Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 8]: For Mr. Morgan and his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 4]: George said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 6]: `` Do n't do that !
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 6]: Mother must n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 7]: It would n't look well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 7]: `` Would n't look well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 13]: Fanny mocked him ; and her suppressed vehemence betrayed a surprising acerbity .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 23]: `` See here , Georgie Minafer , I suggest that you just march straight on into your room and finish your dressing !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 15]: Sometimes you say things that show you have a pretty mean little mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 16]: George was so astounded by this outburst that his indignation was delayed by his curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 10]: `` Why , what upsets you this way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 22]: `` I know what you mean , '' she said , her voice still lowered , but not decreasing in sharpness .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 27]: `` You 're trying to insinuate that I 'd get your mother to invite Eugene Morgan here on my account because he 's a widower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 5]: `` I am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 5]: George gasped , nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 21]: `` I 'm trying to insinuate that you 're setting your cap at him and getting mother to help you ?
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 7]: Is that what you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 10]: Beyond a doubt that was what Miss Fanny meant .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 7]: She gave him a white-hot look .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 9]: `` You attend to your own affairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 8]: she whispered fiercely , and swept away .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: George , dumfounded , returned to his room for meditation .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 34]: He had lived for years in the same house with his Aunt Fanny , and it now appeared that during all those years he had been thus intimately associating with a total stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 20]: Never before had he met the passionate lady with whom he had just held a conversation in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 7]: So she wanted to get married !
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 13]: And wanted George 's mother to help her with this horseless-carriage widower !
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 9]: `` Well , I will be shot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: he muttered aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: `` I will -- I certainly will be shot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 7]: And he began ' to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 6]: `` Lord ` lmighty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 29]: But presently , at the thought of the horseless-carriage widower 's daughter , his grimness returned , and he resolved upon a line of conduct for the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 47]: He would nod to her carelessly when he first saw her ; and , after that , he would notice her no more : he would not dance with her ; he would not favour her in the cotillion -- he would not go near her !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 23]: He descended to dinner upon the third urgent summons of a coloured butler , having spent two hours dressing -- and rehearsing .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 22]: Chapter IX The Honourable George Amberson was a congressman who led cotillions -- the sort of congressman an Amberson would be .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 27]: He did it negligently , tonight , yet with infallible dexterity , now and then glancing humorously at the spectators , people of his own age .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 37]: They were seated in a tropical grove at one end of the room whither they had retired at the beginning of the cotillion , which they surrendered entirely to the twenties and the late ` teens .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 34]: And here , grouped with that stately pair , Sydney and Amelia Amberson , sat Isabel with Fanny , while Eugene Morgan appeared to bestow an amiable devotion impartially upon the three sisters-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 61]: Fanny watched his face eagerly , laughing at everything he said ; Amelia smiled blandly , but rather because of graciousness than because of interest ; while Isabel , looking out at the dancers , rhythmically moved a great fan of blue ostrich feathers , listened to Eugene thoughtfully , yet all the while kept her shining eyes on Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 27]: Georgie had carried out his rehearsed projects with precision , he had given Miss Morgan a nod studied into perfection during his lengthy toilet before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 16]: `` Oh , yes , I do seem to remember that curious little outsider ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 6]: this nod seemed to say .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 21]: Thereafter , all cognizance of her evaporated : the curious little outsider was permitted no further existence worth the struggle .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 13]: Nevertheless , she flashed in the corner of his eye too often .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 76]: He was aware of her dancing demurely , and of her viciously flirtatious habit of never looking up at her partner , but keeping her eyes concealed beneath downcast lashes ; and he had over-sufficient consciousness of her between the dances , though it was not possible to see her at these times , even if he had cared to look frankly in her direction -- she was invisible in a thicket of young dresscoats .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 27]: The black thicket moved as she moved and her location was hatefully apparent , even if he had not heard her voice laughing from the thicket .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 14]: It was annoying how her voice , though never loud , pursued him .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 22]: No matter how vociferous were other voices , all about , he seemed unable to prevent himself from constantly recognizing hers .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 36]: It had a quaver in it , not pathetic -- rather humorous than pathetic -- a quality which annoyed him to the point of rage , because it was so difficult to get away from .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 11]: She seemed to be having a `` wonderful time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 31]: An unbearable soreness accumulated in his chest : his dislike of the girl and her conduct increased until he thought of leaving this sickening Assembly and going home to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 5]: That would show her !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 17]: But just then he heard her laughing , and decided that it would n't show her .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 4]: So he remained .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 49]: When the young couples seated themselves in chairs against the walls , round three sides of the room , for the cotillion , George joined a brazen-faced group clustering about the doorway -- youths with no partners , yet eligible to be `` called out '' and favoured .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 62]: He marked that his uncle placed the infernal Kinney and Miss Morgan , as the leading couple , in the first chairs at the head of the line upon the leader 's right ; and this disloyalty on the part of Uncle George was inexcusable , for in the family circle the nephew had often expressed his opinion of Fred Kinney .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 10]: In his bitterness , George uttered a significant monosyllable .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 21]: The music flourished ; whereupon Mr. Kinney , Miss Morgan , and six of their neighbours rose and waltzed knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 36]: Mr. Amberson 's whistle blew ; ' then the eight young people went to the favour-table and were given toys and trinkets wherewith to delight the new partners it was now their privilege to select .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 36]: Around the walls , the seated non-participants in this ceremony looked rather conscious ; some chattered , endeavouring not to appear expectant ; some tried not to look wistful ; and others were frankly solemn .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 27]: It was a trying moment ; and whoever secured a favour , this very first shot , might consider the portents happy for a successful evening .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 24]: Holding their twinkling gewgaws in their hands , those about to bestow honour came toward the seated lines , where expressions became feverish .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 30]: Two of the approaching girls seemed to wander , not finding a predetermined object in sight ; and these two were Janie Sharon , and her cousin , Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 36]: At this , George Amberson Minafer , conceiving that he had little to anticipate from either , turned a proud back upon the room and affected to converse with his friend , Mr. Charlie Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 12]: The next moment a quick little figure intervened between the two .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 14]: It was Lucy , gaily offering a silver sleighbell decked with white ribbon .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: `` I almost could n't find you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 17]: George stared , took her hand , led her forth in silence , danced with her .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 36]: She seemed content not to talk ; but as the whistle blew , signalling that this episode was concluded , and he conducted her to her seat , she lifted the little bell toward him .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 8]: `` You have n't taken your favour .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 14]: You 're supposed to pin it on your coat , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 8]: `` Do n't you want it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 6]: `` If you insist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 4]: said George stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 24]: And he bowed her into her chair ; then turned and walked away , dropping the sleighbell haughtily into his trousers ' pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 57]: The figure proceeded to its conclusion , and George was given other sleighbells , which he easily consented to wear upon his lapel ; but , as the next figure ` began , he strolled with a bored air to the tropical grove , where sat his elders , and seated himself beside his Uncle Sydney .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 18]: His mother leaned across Miss Fanny , raising her voice over the music to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 12]: `` Georgie , nobody will be able to see you here .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 6]: You 'll not be favoured .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 10]: You ought to be where you can dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 10]: `` Do n't care to , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 4]: `` Bore ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 21]: `` But you ought -- '' She stopped and laughed , waving her fan to direct his attention behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 3]: `` Look !
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: Over your shoulder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 19]: He turned , and discovered Miss Lucy Morgan in the act of offering him a purple toy balloon .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 6]: `` I found you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 4]: George was startled .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 7]: `` Well -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 11]: `` Would you rather ` sit it out ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 10]: Lucy asked quickly , as he did not move .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 20]: `` I do n't care to dance if you -- '' `` No , '' he said , rising .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 9]: `` It would be better to dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 15]: His tone was solemn , and solemnly he departed with her from the grove .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 6]: Solemnly he danced with her .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 21]: Four times , with not the slightest encouragement , she brought him a favour : ` four times in succession .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 10]: When the fourth came , `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 4]: said George huskily .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 10]: `` You going to keep this up all night ?
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 8]: What do you mean by it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 7]: For an instant she seemed confused .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 13]: `` That 's what cotillions are for , are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 12]: `` What do you mean : what they 're for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 15]: `` So that a girl can dance with a person she wants to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 5]: George 's huskiness increased .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 22]: `` Well , do you mean you -- you want to dance with me all the time -- all evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 11]: `` Well , this much of it -- evidently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: `` Is it because you thought I tried to keep you from getting hurt this afternoon when we upset ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 28]: `` Was it because you want to even things up for making me angry -- I mean , for hurting my feelings on the way home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 38]: With her eyes averted -- for girls of nineteen can be as shy as boys , sometimes -- she said , `` Well -- you only got angry because I could n't dance the cotillion with you .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 17]: I -- I did n't feel terribly hurt with you for getting angry about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 7]: `` Was there any other reason ?
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 15]: Did my telling you I liked you have anything to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 29]: She looked up gently , and , as George met her eyes , something exquisitely touching , yet queerly delightful , gave him a catch in the throat .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 24]: She looked instantly away , and , turning , ran out from the palm grove , where they stood , to the dancing-floor .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 5]: `` Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 6]: `` Let 's dance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 4]: He followed her .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 12]: `` See here -- I -- I -- '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 14]: `` You mean -- Do you -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 6]: `` Let 's dance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 15]: He put his arm about her almost tremulously , and they began to waltz .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 10]: It was a happy dance for both of them .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 15]: Christmas day is the children 's , but the holidays are youth 's dancing-time .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 18]: The holidays belong to the early twenties and the ` teens , home from school and college .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 33]: These years possess the holidays for a little while , then possess them only in smiling , wistful memories of holly and twinkling lights and dance-music , and charming faces all aglow .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 17]: It is the liveliest time in life , the happiest of the irresponsible times in life .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 28]: Mothers echo its happiness -- nothing is like a mother who has a son home from college , except another mother with a son home from college .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 28]: Bloom does actually come upon these mothers ; it is a visible thing ; and they run like girls , walk like athletes , laugh like sycophants .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 27]: Yet they give up their sons to the daughters of other mothers , and find it proud rapture enough to be allowed to sit and watch .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 22]: Thus Isabel watched George and Lucy dancing , as together they danced away the holidays of that year into the past .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 36]: `` They seem to get along better than they did at first , those two children , '' Fanny Minafer said sitting beside her at the Sharons ' dance , a week after the Assembly .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 16]: `` They seemed to be always having little quarrels of some sort , at first .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 29]: At least George did : he seemed to be continually pecking at that lovely , dainty , little Lucy , and being cross with her over nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 4]: `` Pecking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 3]: Isabel laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: `` What a word to use about Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 15]: I think I never knew a more angelically amiable disposition in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 19]: Miss Fanny echoed her sister-in-law 's laugh , but it was a rueful echo , and not sweet .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 8]: `` He 's amiable to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 14]: `` That 's all the side of him you ever happen to see .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 22]: And why would n't he be amiable to anybody that simply fell down and worshipped him every minute of her life ?
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 6]: Most of us would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 7]: `` Is n't he worth worshipping ?
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 5]: Just look at him !
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 7]: Is n't he charming with Lucy !
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 17]: See how hard he ran to get it when she dropped her handkerchief back there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 15]: `` Oh , I 'm not going to argue with you about George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 4]: said Miss Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 12]: `` I 'm fond enough of him , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 32]: He can be charming , and he 's certainly stunning looking , if only -- '' `` Let the ` if only ' go , dear , '' Isabel suggested good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 17]: `` Let 's talk about that dinner you thought I should -- '' `` I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 5]: Miss Fanny interrupted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 11]: `` Did n't you want to give it yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 10]: `` Indeed , I did , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 4]: said Isabel heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 33]: `` I only meant that unless you had proposed it , perhaps I would n't -- '' But here Eugene came for her to dance , and she left the sentence uncompleted .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 40]: Holiday dances can be happy for youth renewed as well as for youth in bud -- and yet it was not with the air of a rival that Miss Fanny watched her brother 's wife dancing with the widower .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 20]: Miss Fanny 's eyes narrowed a little , but only as if her mind engaged in a hopeful calculation .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 4]: She looked pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 34]: Chapter X A few days after George 's return to the university it became evident that not quite everybody had gazed with complete benevolence upon the various young collegians at their holiday sports .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 75]: The Sunday edition of the principal morning paper even expressed some bitterness under the heading , `` Gilded Youths of the Fin-de-Siecle '' -- this was considered the knowing phrase of the time , especially for Sunday supplements -- and there is no doubt that from certain references in this bit of writing some people drew the conclusion that Mr. George Amberson Minafer had not yet got his comeuppance , a postponement still irritating .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 48]: Undeniably , Fanny Minafer was one of the people who drew this conclusion , for she cut the article out and enclosed it in a letter to her nephew , having written on the border of the clipping , `` I wonder whom it can mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 6]: George read part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 41]: We debate sometimes what is to be the future of this nation when we think that in a few years public affairs may be in the hands of the fin-de-siecle gilded youths we see about us during the Christmas holidays .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 31]: Such foppery , such luxury , such insolence , was surely never practised by the scented , overbearing patricians of the Palatine , even in Rome 's most decadent epoch .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 28]: In all the wild orgy of wastefulness and luxury with which the nineteenth century reaches its close , the gilded youth has been surely the worst symptom .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 45]: With his airs of young milord , his fast horses , his gold and silver cigarette-cases , his clothes from a New York tailor , his recklessness of money showered upon him by indulgent mothers or doting grandfathers , he respects nothing and nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 7]: He is blase if you please .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 56]: Watch him at a social function how condescendingly he deigns to select a partner for the popular waltz or two step how carelessly he shoulders older people out of his way , with what a blank stare he returns the salutation of some old acquaintance whom he may choose in his royal whim to forget !
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 63]: The unpleasant part of all this is that the young women he so condescendingly selects as partners for the dance greet him with seeming rapture , though in their hearts they must feel humiliated by his languid hauteur , and many older people beam upon him almost fawningly if he unbends so far as to throw them a careless , disdainful word !
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 10]: One wonders what has come over the new generation .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 10]: Of such as these the Republic was not made .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 40]: Let us pray that the future of our country is not in the hands of these fin-de-siecle gilded youths , but rather in the calloused palms of young men yet unknown , labouring upon the farms of the land .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 53]: When we compare the young manhood of Abraham Lincoln with the specimens we are now producing , we see too well that it bodes ill for the twentieth century -- George yawned , and tossed the clipping into his waste-basket , wondering why his aunt thought such dull nonsense worth the sending .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 32]: As for her insinuation , pencilled upon the border , he supposed she meant to joke -- a supposition which neither surprised him nor altered his lifelong opinion of her wit .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 21]: He read her letter with more interest : The dinner your mother gave for the Morgans was a lovely affair .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 13]: It was last Monday evening , just ten days after you left .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 62]: It was peculiarly appropriate that your mother should give this dinner , because her brother George , your uncle , was Mr. Morgan 's most intimate friend before he left here a number of years ago , and it was a pleasant occasion for the formal announcement of some news which you heard from Lucy Morgan before you returned to college .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 25]: At least she told me she had told you the night before you left that her father had decided to return here to live .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 30]: It was appropriate that your mother , herself an old friend , should assemble a representative selection of Mr. Morgan 's old friends around him at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 9]: He was in great spirits and most entertaining .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 41]: As your time was so charmingly taken up during your visit home with a younger member of his family , you probably overlooked opportunities of hearing him talk , and do not know what an interesting man he can be .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 29]: He will soon begin to build his factory here for the manufacture of automobiles , which he says is a term he prefers to `` horseless carriages . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 54]: Your Uncle George told me he would like to invest in this factory , as George thinks there is a future for automobiles ; perhaps not for general use , but as an interesting novelty , which people with sufficient means would like to own for their amusement and the sake of variety .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 31]: However , he said Mr. Morgan laughingly declined his offer , as Mr. M. was fully able to finance this venture , though not starting in a very large way .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 17]: Your uncle said other people are manufacturing automobiles in different parts of the country with success .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 76]: Your father is not very well , though he is not actually ill , and the doctor tells him he ought not to be so much at his office , as the long years of application indoors with no exercise are beginning to affect him unfavourably , but I believe your father would die if he had to give up his work , which is all that has ever interested him outside of his family .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 6]: I never could understand it .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 40]: Mr. Morgan took your mother and me with Lucy to see Modjeska in `` Twelfth Night '' yesterday evening , and Lucy said she thought the Duke looked rather like you , only much more democratic in his manner .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 36]: I suppose you will think I have written a great deal about the Morgans in this letter , but thought you would be interested because of your interest in a younger member of his family .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 17]: Hoping that you are finding college still as attractive as ever , Affectionately , Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 10]: George read one sentence in this letter several times .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 31]: Then he dropped the missive in his wastebasket to join the clipping , and strolled down the corridor of his dormitory to borrow a copy of `` Twelfth Night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 31]: Having secured one , he returned to his study and refreshed his memory of the play -- but received no enlightenment that enabled him to comprehend Lucy 's strange remark .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 26]: However , he found himself impelled in the direction of correspondence , and presently wrote a letter -- not a reply to his Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 38]: Dear Lucy : No doubt you will be surprised at hearing from me so soon again , especially as this makes two in answer to the one received from you since getting back to the old place .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 32]: I hear you have been making comments about me at the theatre , that some actor was more democratic in his manners than I am , which I do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 45]: You know my theory of life because I explained it to you on our first drive together , when I told you I would not talk to everybody about things I feel like the way I spoke to you of my theory of life .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 26]: I believe those who are able should have a true theory of life , and I developed my theory of life long , long ago .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 47]: Well , here I sit smoking my faithful briar pipe , indulging in the fragrance of my tobacco as I look out on the campus from my many-paned window , and things are different with me from the way they were way back in Freshman year .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 13]: I can see now how boyish in many ways I was then .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 21]: I believe what has changed me as much as anything was my visit home at the time I met you .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 65]: So I sit here with my faithful briar and dream the old dreams over as it were , dreaming of the waltzes we waltzed together and of that last night before we parted , and you told me the good news you were going to live there , and I would find my friend waiting for me , when I get home next summer .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 12]: I will be glad my friend will be waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 41]: I am not capable of friendship except for the very few , and , looking back over my life , I remember there were times when I doubted if I could feel a great friendship for anybody -- especially girls .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 23]: I do not take a great interest in many people , as you know , for I find most of them shallow .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 76]: Here in the old place I do not believe in being hail-fellow-well-met with every Tom , Dick , and Harry just because he happens to be a classmate , any more than I do at home , where I have always been careful who I was seen with , largely on account of the family , but also because my disposition ever since my boyhood has been to encourage real intimacy from but the few .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 6]: What are you reading now ?
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 14]: I have finished both `` Henry Esmond '' and `` The Virginians . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 18]: I like Thackeray because he is not trashy , and because he writes principally of nice people .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 25]: My theory of literature is an author who does not indulge in trashiness -- writes about people you could introduce into your own home .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 40]: I agree with my Uncle Sydney , as I once heard him say he did not care to read a book or go to a play about people he would not care to meet at his own dinner table .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 23]: I believe we should live by certain standards and ideals , as you know from my telling you my theory of life .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 20]: Well , a letter is no place for deep discussions , so I will not go into the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 28]: From several letters from my mother , and one from Aunt Fanny , I hear you are seeing a good deal of the family since I left .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 12]: I hope sometimes you think of the member who is absent .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 20]: I got a silver frame for your photograph in New York , and I keep it on my desk .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 73]: It is the only girl 's photograph I ever took the trouble to have framed , though , as I told you frankly , I have had any number of other girls ' photographs , yet all were only passing fancies , and oftentimes I have questioned in years past if I was capable of much friendship toward the feminine sex , which I usually found shallow until our own friendship began .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 28]: When I look at your photograph , I say to myself , `` At last , at last here is one that will not prove shallow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 7]: My faithful briar has gone out .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 51]: I will have to rise and fill it , then once more in the fragrance of My Lady Nicotine , I will sit and dream the old dreams over , and think , too , of the true friend at home awaiting my return in June for the summer vacation .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 16]: Friend , this is from your friend , G.A.M. George 's anticipations were not disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 48]: When he came home in June his friend was awaiting him ; at least , she was so pleased to see him again that for a few minutes after their first encounter she was a little breathless , and a great deal glowing , and quiet withal .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 33]: Their sentimental friendship continued , though sometimes he was irritated by her making it less sentimental than he did , and sometimes by what he called her `` air of superiority . ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 34]: Her air was usually , in truth , that of a fond but amused older sister ; and George did not believe such an attitude was warranted by her eight months of seniority .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 55]: Lucy and her father were living at the Amberson Hotel , while Morgan got his small machine-shops built in a western outskirt of the town ; and George grumbled about the shabbiness and the old-fashioned look of the hotel , though it was `` still the best in the place , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 31]: He remonstrated with his grandfather , declaring that the whole Amberson Estate would be getting `` run-down and out-at-heel , if things were n't taken in hand pretty soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 15]: He urged the general need of rebuilding , renovating , varnishing , and lawsuits .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 43]: But the Major , declining to hear him out , interrupted querulously , saying that he had enough to bother him without any advice from George ; and retired to his library , going so far as to lock the door audibly .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 5]: `` Second childhood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 20]: George muttered , shaking his head ; and he thought sadly that the Major had not long to live .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 13]: However , this surmise depressed him for only a moment or so .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 46]: Of course , people could n't be expected to live forever , and it would be a good thing to have someone in charge of the Estate who would n't let it get to looking so rusty that riffraff dared to make fun of it .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 48]: For George had lately undergone the annoyance of calling upon the Morgans , in the rather stuffy red velours and gilt parlour of their apartment at the hotel , one evening when Mr. Frederick Kinney also was a caller , and Mr. Kinney had not been tactful .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 63]: In fact , though he adopted a humorous tone of voice , in expressing his , sympathy for people who , through the city 's poverty in hotels , were obliged to stay at the Amberson , Mr. Kinney 's intention was interpreted by the other visitor as not at all humorous , but , on the contrary , personal and offensive .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 11]: George rose abruptly , his face the colour of wrath .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Miss Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 9]: Good-night , Mr. Morgan , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 23]: `` I shall take pleasure in calling at some other time when a more courteous sort of people may be present . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 6]: the hot-headed Fred burst out .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 15]: `` Do n't you try to make me out a boor , George Minafer !
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 20]: I was n't hinting anything at you ; I simply forgot all about your grandfather owning this old building .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 14]: Do n't you try to put me in the light of a boor !
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 25]: I wo n't -- '' But George walked out in the very course of this vehement protest , and it was necessarily left unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 28]: Mr. Kinney remained only a few moments after George 's departure ; and as the door closed upon him , the distressed Lucy turned to her father .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 14]: She was plaintively surprised to find him in a condition of immoderate laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 15]: `` I did n't -- I did n't think I could hold out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 32]: he gasped , and , after choking until tears came to his eyes , felt blindly for the chair from which he had risen to wish Mr. Kinney an indistinct good-night .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 19]: His hand found the arm of the chair ; he collapsed feebly , and sat uttering incoherent sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 8]: `` It brings things back so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 55]: he managed to explain , `` This very Fred Kinney 's father and young George 's father , Wilbur Minafer , used to do just such things when they were at that age -- and , for that matter , so did George Amberson and I , and all the rest of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 29]: And , in spite of his exhaustion , he began to imitate : `` Do n't you try to put me in the light of a boor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 26]: `` I shall take pleasure in calling at some time when a more courteous sort of people -- '' He was unable to go on .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 24]: There is a mirth for every age , and Lucy failed to comprehend her father 's , but tolerated it a little ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 9]: `` Papa , I think they were shocking .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 6]: Were n't they awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 7]: `` Just -- just boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 7]: he moaned , wiping his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 15]: But Lucy could not smile at all ; she was beginning to look indignant .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 13]: `` I can forgive that poor Fred Kinney , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 16]: `` He 's just blundering -- but George -- oh , George behaved outrageously ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 17]: `` It 's a difficult age , '' her father observed , his calmness somewhat restored .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 27]: `` Girls do n't seem to have to pass through it quite as boys do , or their savoir faire is instinctive -- or something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 11]: And he gave away to a return of his convulsion .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 11]: She came and sat upon the arm of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 11]: `` Papa , why should George behave like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 6]: `` He 's sensitive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 5]: But why is he ?
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 15]: He does anything he likes to , without any regard for what people think .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 26]: Then why should he mind so furiously when the least little thing reflects upon him , or on anything or anybody connected with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 5]: Eugene patted her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 24]: `` That 's one of the greatest puzzles of human vanity , dear ; and I do n't pretend to know the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 19]: In all my life , the most arrogant people that I 've known have been the most sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 35]: The people who have done the most in contempt of other people 's opinion , and who consider themselves the highest above it , have been the most furious if it went against them .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 17]: Arrogant and domineering people ca n't stand the least , lightest , faintest breath of criticism .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 6]: It just kills them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 13]: `` Papa , do you think George is arrogant and domineering ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 15]: `` Oh , he 's still only a boy , '' said Eugene consolingly .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 25]: `` There 's plenty of fine stuff in him -- ca n't help but be , because he 's Isabel Amberson 's son . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 15]: Lucy stroked his hair , which was still almost as dark as her own .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 14]: `` You liked her pretty well once , I guess , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 10]: `` I do still , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 7]: `` She 's lovely -- lovely !
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 19]: Papa -- '' she paused , then continued -- `` I wonder sometimes -- '' `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 13]: `` I wonder just how she happened to marry Mr. Minafer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 12]: `` Oh , Minafer 's all right , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 20]: `` He 's a quiet sort of man , but he 's a good man and a kind man .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 10]: He always was , and those things count . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 27]: `` But in a way -- well , I 've heard people say there was n't anything to him at all except business and saving money .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 38]: Miss Fanny Minafer herself told me that everything George and his mother have of their own -- that is , just to spend as they like -- she says it has always come from Major Amberson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 6]: `` Thrift , Horatio ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 4]: said Eugene lightly .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 13]: `` Thrift 's an inheritance , and a common enough one here .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 43]: The people who settled the country had to save , so making and saving were taught as virtues , and the people , to the third generation , have n't found out that making and saving are only means to an end .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 9]: Minafer does n't believe in money being spent .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 12]: He believes God made it to be invested and saved . ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 7]: `` But George is n't saving .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 21]: He 's reckless , and even if he is arrogant and conceited and bad-tempered , he 's awfully generous . ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 13]: `` Oh , he 's an Amberson , '' said her father .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 7]: `` The Ambersons are n't saving .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 13]: They 're too much the other way , most of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 17]: `` I do n't think I should have called George bad-tempered , '' Lucy said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: I do n't think he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 10]: `` Only when he 's cross about something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 10]: Morgan suggested , with a semblance of sympathetic gravity .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' she said brightly , not perceiving that his intention was humorous .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 13]: `` All the rest of the time he 's really very amiable .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 19]: Of course , he 's much more a perfect child , the whole time , than he realizes !
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 7]: He certainly behaved awfully to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 8]: She jumped up , her indignation returning .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 17]: `` He did , indeed , and it wo n't do to encourage him in it .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 16]: I think he 'll find me pretty cool -- for a week or so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 13]: Whereupon her father suffered a renewal of his attack of uproarious laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 41]: Chapter XI In the matter of coolness , George met Lucy upon her own predetermined ground ; in fact , he was there first , and , at their next encounter , proved loftier and more formal than she did .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 25]: Their estrangement lasted three weeks , and then disappeared without any preliminary treaty : it had worn itself out , and they forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 13]: At times , however , George found other disturbances to the friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 54]: Lucy was `` too much the village belle , '' he complained ; and took a satiric attitude toward his competitors , referring to them as her `` local swains and bumpkins , '' sulking for an afternoon when she reminded him that he , too , was at least `` local . ''
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 69]: She was a belle with older people as well ; Isabel and Fanny were continually taking her driving , bringing her home with them to lunch or dinner , and making a hundred little engagements with her , and the Major had taken a great fancy to her , insisting upon her presence and her father 's at the Amberson family dinner at the Mansion every Sunday evening .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 46]: She knew how to flirt with old people , he said , as she sat next him at the table on one of these Sunday occasions ; and he had always liked her father , even when Eugene was a `` terror '' long ago .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , he was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 8]: the Major laughed , when she remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 34]: `` He came up here with my son George and some others for a serenade one night , and Eugene stepped into a bass fiddle , and the poor musicians just gave up !
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 11]: I had a pretty half-hour getting my son George upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 3]: I remember !
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 29]: It was the last time Eugene ever touched a drop -- but he 'd touched plenty before that , young lady , and he dare n't deny it !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 17]: Well , well ; there 's another thing that 's changed : hardly anybody drinks nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 14]: Perhaps it 's just as well , but things used to be livelier .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 26]: That serenade was just before Isabel was married -- and do n't you fret , Miss Lucy : your father remembers it well enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: The old gentleman burst into laughter , and shook his finger at Eugene across the table .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 35]: `` The fact is , '' the Major went on hilariously , `` I believe if Eugene had n't broken that bass fiddle and given himself away , Isabel would never have taken Wilbur !
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 17]: I should n't be surprised if that was about all the reason that Wilbur got her !
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 5]: What do you think .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 3]: Wilbur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: `` I should n't be surprised , '' said Wilbur placidly .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 16]: `` If your notion is right , I 'm glad ` Gene broke the fiddle .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 9]: He was giving me a hard run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 20]: The Major always drank three glasses of champagne at his Sunday dinner , and he was finishing the third .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 10]: `` What do you say about it , Isabel ?
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 4]: By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 7]: he cried , pounding the table .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 6]: `` She 's blushing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 8]: Isabel did blush , but she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 7]: `` Who would n't blush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 11]: she cried , and her sister-in-law came to her assistance .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 29]: `` The important thing , '' said Fanny jovially , `` is that Wilbur did get her , and not only got her , but kept her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 21]: Eugene was as pink as Isabel , but he laughed without any sign of embarrassment other than his heightened colour .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 17]: `` There 's another important thing -- that is , for me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 20]: `` It 's the only thing that makes me forgive that bass viol for getting in my way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 4]: the Major asked .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 8]: `` Lucy , '' said Morgan gently .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 22]: Isabel gave him a quick glance , all warm approval , and there was a murmur of friendliness round the table .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 12]: George was not one of those who joined in this applause .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 26]: He considered his grandfather 's nonsense indelicate , even for second childhood , and he thought that the sooner the subject was dropped the better .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 57]: However , he had only a slight recurrence of the resentment which had assailed him during the winter at every sign of his mother 's interest in Morgan ; though he was still ashamed of his aunt sometimes , when it seemed to him that Fanny was almost publicly throwing herself at the widower 's head .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 18]: Fanny and he had one or two arguments in which her fierceness again astonished and amused him .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 30]: `` You drop your criticisms of your relatives , '' she bade him , hotly , one day , `` and begin thinking a little about your own behaviour !
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 20]: You say people will ` talk ' about my -- about my merely being pleasant to an old friend !
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 8]: What do I care how they talk ?
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 41]: I guess if people are talking about anybody in this family they 're talking about the impertinent little snippet that has n't any respect for anything , and does n't even know enough to attend to his own affairs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 8]: `` Snippet , ' Aunt Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 3]: George laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 4]: `` How elegant !
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 13]: And ` little snippet ' -- when I 'm over five-feet-eleven ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 6]: `` I said it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 5]: she snapped , departing .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 12]: `` I do n't see how Lucy can stand you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 9]: `` You 'd make an amiable stepmother-in-law ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 5]: he called after her .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 11]: `` I 'll be careful about proposing to Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 31]: These were but roughish spots in a summer that glided by evenly and quickly enough , for the most part , and , at the end , seemed to fly .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 27]: On the last night before George went back to be a Junior , his mother asked him confidently if it had not been a happy summer .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 10]: He had n't thought about it , he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 8]: `` Oh , ' I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 21]: `` I just thought it would be : nice to hear you say so , '' she said , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 26]: `` I mean , it 's pleasant for people of my age to know that people of your age realize that they 're happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 7]: `` People of your age ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 3]: he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 15]: `` You know you do n't look precisely like an old woman , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 4]: Not precisely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 30]: `` And I suppose I feel about as young as you do , inside , but it wo n't be many years before I must begin to look old .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 5]: It does come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 6]: She sighed , still smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 34]: `` It 's seemed to me that , it must have been a happy summer for you -- a real ` summer of roses and wine ' -- without the wine , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 14]: ` Gather ye roses while ye may ' -- or was it primroses ?
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 22]: Time does really fly , or perhaps it 's more like the sky -- and smoke -- '' George was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 15]: `` What do you mean : time being like the sky and smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 33]: `` I mean the things that we have and that we think are so solid -- they 're like smoke , and time is like the sky that the smoke disappears into .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 82]: You know how wreath of smoke goes up from a chimney , and seems all thick and black and busy against the sky , as if it were going to do such important things and last forever , and you see it getting thinner and thinner -- and then , in such a little while , it is n't there at all ; nothing is left but the sky , and the sky keeps on being just the same forever . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 15]: `` It strikes me you 're getting mixed up , '' said George cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 33]: `` I do n't see much resemblance between time and the sky , or between things and smoke-wreaths ; but I do see one reason you like ` Lucy Morgan so much .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 46]: She talks that same kind of wistful , moony way sometimes -- I do n't mean to say I mind it in either of you , because I rather like to listen to it , and you 've got a very good voice , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 22]: It 's nice to listen to , no matter how much smoke and sky , and so on , you talk .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 16]: So 's Lucy 's for that matter ; and I see why you 're congenial .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 22]: She talks that way to her father , too ; and he 's right there with the same kind of guff .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 10]: Well , it 's all right with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 19]: He laughed , teasingly , and allowed her to retain his hand , which she had fondly seized .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: `` I 've got plenty to think about when people drool along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 22]: She pressed his hand to her cheek , and a tear made a tiny warm streak across one of his knuckles .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: `` For heaven 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 6]: `` What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 7]: Is n't everything all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 7]: `` You 're going away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 13]: `` Well , I 'm coming back , do n't you suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 8]: Is that all that worries you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 13]: She cheered up , and smiled again , but shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 17]: `` I never can bear to see you go -- that 's the most of it .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 12]: I 'm a little bothered about your father , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 10]: `` It seems to me he looks so badly .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 5]: Everybody thinks so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 5]: `` What nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 3]: George laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 10]: `` He 's been looking that way all summer .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 20]: He is n't much different from the way he 's looked all his life , that I can see .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 8]: What 's the matter with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 25]: `` He never talks much about his business to me but I think he 's been worrying about some investments he made last year .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 10]: I think his worry has affected his health . ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 5]: `` What investments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 3]: George demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 16]: `` He has n't gone into Mr. Morgan 's automobile concern , has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 7]: `` No , '' Isabel smiled .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 24]: `` The ` automobile concern ' is all Eugene 's , and it 's so small I understand it 's taken hardly anything .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 69]: No ; your father has always prided himself on making only the most absolutely safe investments , but two or three years ago he and your Uncle George both put a great deal -- pretty much everything they could get together , I think -- into the stock of rolling-mills some friends of theirs owned , and I 'm afraid the mills have n't been doing well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 5]: `` What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 5]: Father need n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 26]: You and I could take care of him the rest of his life on what grandfather -- '' `` Of course , '' she agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 27]: `` But your father 's always lived so for his business and taken such pride in his sound investments ; it 's a passion with him .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 6]: I -- '' `` Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 5]: He need n't worry !
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 39]: You tell him we 'll look after him : we 'll build him a little stone bank in the backyard , if he busts up , and he can go and put his pennies in it every morning .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 13]: That 'll keep him just as happy as he ever was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 4]: He kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 11]: `` Good-night , I 'm going to tell Lucy good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 8]: Do n't sit up for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 28]: She walked to the front gate with him , still holding his hand , and he told her again not to `` sit up '' for him .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 10]: `` Yes , I will , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 9]: `` You wo n't be very late . ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 10]: `` Well -- it 's my last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 21]: `` But I know Lucy , and she knows I want to see you , too , your last night .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 14]: You 'll see : she 'll send you home promptly at eleven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 13]: But she was mistaken : Lucy sent him home promptly at ten .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 71]: Chapter XII Isabel 's uneasiness about her husbands health -- sometimes reflected in her letters to George during the winter that followed -- had not been alleviated when the accredited Senior returned for his next summer vacation , and she confided to him in his room , soon after his arrival , that `` something '' the doctor had said to her lately had made her more uneasy than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 9]: `` Still worrying over his rolling-mills investments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 7]: George asked , not seriously impressed .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 15]: `` I 'm afraid it 's past that stage from what Dr Rainey says .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 8]: His worries only aggravate his condition now .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 11]: Dr. Rainey says we ought to get him away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 11]: `` Well , let 's do it , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 7]: `` He wo n't go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 19]: `` He 's a man awfully set in his ways ; that 's true , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 25]: `` I do n't think there 's anything much the matter with him , though , and he looks just the same to me .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 6]: Have you seen Lucy lately ?
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 5]: How is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 8]: `` Has n't she written you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 13]: `` Oh , about once a month , '' he answered carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: `` Never says much about herself .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 6]: How 's she look ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 7]: `` She looks -- pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 3]: said Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 11]: `` I suppose she wrote you they 've moved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 9]: `` Yes ; I 've got her address .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 7]: She said they were building . ''
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 4]: `` They did .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 14]: It 's all finished , and they 've been in it a month .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 10]: Lucy is so capable ; she keeps house exquisitely .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 14]: It 's small , but oh , such a pretty little house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 11]: `` Well , that 's fortunate , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 19]: `` One thing I 've always felt they did n't know a great deal about is architecture . ''
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 6]: `` Do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 5]: asked Isabel , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 8]: `` Anyhow , their house is charming .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 33]: It 's way out beyond the end of Amberson Boulevard ; it 's quite near that big white house with a gray-green roof somebody built out there a year or so ago .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 42]: There are any number of houses going up , out that way ; and the trolley-line runs within a block of them now , on the next street , and the traction people are laying tracks more than three miles beyond .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 13]: I suppose you 'll be driving out to see Lucy to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 8]: `` I thought -- '' George hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 13]: `` I thought perhaps I 'd go after dinner this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 9]: At this his mother laughed , not astonished .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 14]: `` It was only my feeble joke about ` to-morrow , ' Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 11]: I was pretty sure you could n't wait that long .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 9]: Did Lucy write you about the factory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 4]: What factory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 5]: `` The automobile shops .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 51]: They had rather a dubious time at first , I 'm afraid , and some of Eugene 's experiments turned out badly , but this spring they 've finished eight automobiles and sold them all , and they 've got twelve more almost finished , and they 're sold already !
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 8]: Eugene 's so gay over it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 9]: `` What do his old sewing-machines look like ?
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 12]: Like that first one he had when they came here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 5]: `` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 11]: These have rubber tires blown up with air -- pneumatic !
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 30]: And they are n't so high ; they 're very easy to get into , and the engine 's in front -- Eugene thinks that 's a great improvement .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 50]: They 're very interesting to look at ; behind the driver 's seat there 's a sort of box where four people can sit , with a step and a little door in the rear , and -- '' `` I know all about it , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 11]: `` I 've seen any number like that , East .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 22]: You can see all you want of 'em , if you stand on Fifth Avenue half an hour , any afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 32]: I 've seen half-a-dozen go by almost at the same time -- within a few minutes , anyhow ; and of course electric hansoms are a common sight there any day .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 13]: I hired one , myself , the last time I was there .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 10]: How fast do Mr. Morgan 's machines go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 5]: `` Much too fast !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 17]: It 's very exhilarating -- but rather frightening ; and they do make a fearful uproar .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 20]: He says , though , he thinks he sees a way to get around the noisiness in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 12]: `` I do n't mind the noise , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 14]: `` Give me a horse , for mine , though , any day .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 24]: I must get up a race with one of these things : Pendennis 'll leave it one mile behind in a two-mile run .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 5]: How 's grandfather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 30]: `` He looks well , but he complains sometimes of his heart : I suppose that 's natural at his age -- and it 's an Amberson trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 9]: Having mentioned this , she looked anxious instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 12]: `` Did you ever feel any weakness there , Georgie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 8]: `` Are you sure , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 5]: And he laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 5]: `` Did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 23]: `` Oh , I think not -- at least , the doctor told me he thought my heart was about all right .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 9]: He said I need n't be alarmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 6]: `` I should think not !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 23]: Women do seem to be always talking about health : I suppose they have n't got enough else to think of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 11]: `` That must be it , '' she said gayly .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 8]: `` We 're an idle lot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 7]: George had taken off his coat .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 26]: `` I do n't like to hint to a lady , '' he said , `` but I do want to dress before dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 21]: `` Do n't be long ; I 've got to do a lot of looking at you , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 8]: She kissed him and ran away singing .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 41]: But his Aunt Fanny was not so fond ; and at the dinner-table there came a spark of liveliness into her eye when George patronizingly asked her what was the news in her own `` particular line of sport . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , Georgie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 4]: she asked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: `` Oh I mean : What 's the news in the fast set generally ?
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 8]: You been causing any divorces lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 15]: `` No , '' said Fanny , the spark in her eye getting brighter .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 9]: `` I have n't been causing anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 8]: `` Well , what 's the gossip ?
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 21]: You usually hear pretty much everything that goes on around the nooks and crannies in this town , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 13]: What 's the last from the gossips ' corner , auntie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 28]: Fanny dropped her eyes , and the spark was concealed , but a movement of her lower lip betokened a tendency to laugh , as she replied .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 32]: `` There has n't been much gossip lately , except the report that Lucy Morgan and Fred Kinney are engaged -- and that 's quite old , by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 20]: Undeniably , this bit of mischief was entirely successful , for there was a clatter upon George 's plate .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 13]: `` What -- what do you think you 're talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 6]: Miss Fanny looked up innocently .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 14]: `` About the report of Lucy Morgan 's engagement to Fred Kinney . ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 14]: George turned dumbly to his mother , and Isabel shook her head reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 11]: `` People are always starting rumours , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 12]: `` I have n't paid any attention to this one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 10]: `` But you -- you 've heard it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 3]: he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 12]: `` Oh , one hears all sorts of nonsense , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 12]: I have n't the slightest idea that it 's true . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 8]: `` Then you have heard it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 16]: `` I would n't let it take my appetite , '' his father suggested drily .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 11]: `` There are plenty of girls in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 4]: George turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 13]: `` Eat your dinner , Georgie , '' his aunt said sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 7]: `` Food will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 11]: I did n't say I knew this rumour was true .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 9]: I only said I 'd heard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 3]: `` When ?
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: When did you hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 7]: `` Oh , months ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 10]: And Fanny found any further postponement of laughter impossible .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 14]: `` Fanny , you 're a hard-hearted creature , '' Isabel said gently .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 5]: `` You really are .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 10]: Do n't pay any attention to her , George .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 28]: Fred Kinney 's only a clerk in his uncle 's hardware place : he could n't marry for ages -- even if anybody would accept him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 4]: George breathed tumultuously .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 11]: `` I do n't care anything about ` ages ' !
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 10]: What 's that got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 11]: he said , his thoughts appearing to be somewhat disconnected .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 9]: `` Ages , ' do n't mean anything !
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 18]: I only want to know -- I want to know -- I want -- '' He stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 5]: his father asked crossly .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 8]: `` Why do n't you say it ?
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 8]: Do n't make such a fuss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 21]: `` I 'm not -- not at all , '' George declared , pushing his chair back from the table .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 14]: `` You must finish your dinner , dear , '' his mother urged .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 10]: `` Do n't -- '' `` I have finished .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 7]: I 've eaten all I want .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 10]: I do n't want any more than I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 14]: I do n't want -- I -- '' He rose , still incoherent .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 12]: `` I prefer -- I want -- Please excuse me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 24]: He left the room , and a moment later the screens outside the open front door were heard to slam : `` Fanny !
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 44]: You should n't -- '' `` Isabel , do n't reproach me , he did have plenty of dinner , and I only told the truth : everybody has been saying -- '' `` But there is n't any truth in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 17]: `` We do n't actually know there is n't , '' Miss Fanny insisted , giggling .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 8]: `` We 've never asked Lucy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 11]: `` I would n't ask her anything so absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 10]: `` George would , '' George 's father remarked .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 11]: `` That 's what he 's gone to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 16]: Mr. Minafer was not mistaken : that was what his son had gone to do .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 25]: Lucy and her father were just rising from their dinner table when the stirred youth arrived at the front door of the new house .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 57]: It was a cottage , however , rather than a house ; and Lucy had taken a free hand with the architect , achieving results in white and green , outside , and white and blue , inside , to such effect of youth and daintiness that her father complained of `` too much spring-time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 33]: The whole place , including his own bedroom , was a young damsel 's boudoir , he said , so that nowhere could he smoke a cigar without feeling like a ruffian .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 38]: However , he was smoking when George arrived , and he encouraged George to join him in the pastime , but the caller , whose air was both tense and preoccupied , declined with something like agitation .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 22]: `` I never smoke -- that is , I 'm seldom -- I mean , no thanks , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 7]: `` I mean not at all .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 6]: I 'd rather not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 9]: `` Are n't you well , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 9]: Eugene asked , looking at him in perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 8]: `` Have you been overworking at college ?
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 17]: You do look rather pa -- '' `` I do n't work , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 8]: `` I mean I do n't work .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 9]: I think , but I do n't work .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 10]: I only work at the end of the term .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 8]: There is n't much to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 18]: Eugene 's perplexity was little decreased , and a tinkle of the door-bell afforded him obvious relief .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 15]: `` It 's my foreman , '' he said , looking at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 12]: `` I 'll take him out in the yard to talk .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 9]: This is no place for a foreman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: And he departed , leaving the `` living room '' to Lucy and George .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 23]: It was a pretty room , white panelled and blue curtained -- and no place for a foreman , as Eugene said .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 33]: There was a grand piano , and Lucy stood leaning back against it , looking intently at George , while her fingers , behind her , absently struck a chord or two .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 78]: And her dress was the dress for that room , being of blue and white , too ; and the high colour in her cheeks was far from interfering with the general harmony of things -- George saw with dismay that she was prettier than ever , and naturally he missed the reassurance he might have felt had he been able to guess that Lucy , on her part , was finding him better looking than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 26]: For , however unusual the scope of George 's pride , vanity of beauty was not included ; he did not think about his looks .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 8]: `` What 's wrong , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 4]: she asked softly .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 12]: `` What do you mean : ` What 's wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 8]: `` You 're awfully upset about something .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 11]: Did n't you get though your examination all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 5]: `` Certainly I did .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 13]: What makes you think anything 's ` wrong ' with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 29]: `` You do look pale , as papa said , and it seemed to me that the way you talked sounded -- well , a little confused . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 4]: `` Confused ' !
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 9]: I said I did n't care to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 10]: What in the world is confused about that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 8]: But -- '' `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: George stepped close to her .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 9]: `` Are you glad to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 11]: `` You need n't be so fierce about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 9]: Lucy protested , laughing at his dramatic intensity .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 6]: `` Of course I am !
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 11]: How long have I been looking forward to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 17]: `` I do n't know , '' he said sharply , abating nothing of his fierceness .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: `` How long have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 10]: `` Why -- ever since you went away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 5]: `` Is that true ?
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 7]: Lucy , is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 6]: `` You are funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: `` Of course it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 13]: Do tell me what 's the matter with you , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 5]: `` I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 11]: `` I was a boy when I saw you last .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 11]: I see that now , though I did n't then .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 10]: Well , I 'm not a boy any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 19]: I 'm a man , and a man has a right to demand a totally different treatment . ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 6]: `` Why has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 16]: `` I do n't seem to be able to understand you at all , George .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 15]: Why should n't a boy be treated just as well as a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 9]: George seemed to find himself at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 22]: `` Why should n't -- Well , he should n't , because a man has a right to certain explanations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 5]: `` What explanations ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 11]: `` Whether he 's been made a toy of ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 4]: George almost shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 10]: `` That 's what I want to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 6]: Lucy shook her head despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 7]: `` You are the queerest person !
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 18]: You say you 're a man now , but you talk more like a boy than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 9]: What does make you so excited ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 5]: ` Excited ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 3]: he stormed .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 14]: `` Do you dare to stand there and call me ` excited ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 16]: I tell you , I never have been more calm or calmer in my life !
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 25]: I do n't know that a person needs to be called ` excited ' because he demands explanations that are his simple due ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 13]: `` What in the world do you want me to explain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 8]: `` Your conduct with Fred Kinney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 3]: George shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 12]: Lucy uttered a sudden cry of laughter ; she was delighted .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 7]: `` It 's been awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 13]: `` I do n't know that I ever heard of worse misbehaviour !
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 29]: Papa and I have been twice to dinner with his family , and I 've been three times to church with Fred -- and once to the circus !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 14]: I do n't know when they 'll be here to arrest me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 5]: `` Stop that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 4]: George commanded fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 19]: `` I want to know just one thing , and I mean to know it , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 8]: `` Whether I enjoyed the circus ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 13]: `` I want to know if you 're engaged to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 30]: she cried and lifting her face close to his for the shortest instant possible , she gave him a look half merry , half defiant , but all fond .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 6]: It was an adorable look .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 4]: `` Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 4]: he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 17]: But she turned quickly from him , and ran to the other end of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 18]: He followed awkwardly , stammering : `` Lucy , I want -- I want to ask you .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 14]: Will you -- will you -- will you be engaged to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 20]: She stood at a window , seeming to look out into the summer darkness , her back to him .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 7]: `` Will you , Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 10]: `` No , '' she murmured , just audibly .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 8]: `` I 'm older than you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 5]: `` Eight months ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 7]: `` You 're too young . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 21]: `` Is that -- '' he said , gulping -- `` is that the only reason you wo n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 5]: She did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 48]: As she stood , persistently staring out of the window , with her back to him , she did not see how humble his attitude had become ; but his voice was low , and it shook so that she could have no doubt of his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 19]: `` Lucy , please forgive me for making such a row , '' he said , thus gently .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: `` I 've been -- I 've been terribly upset -- terribly !
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 15]: You know how I feel about you , and always have felt about you .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 26]: I 've shown it in every single thing I 've done since the first time I met you , and I know you know it .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 8]: Still she did not move or speak .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 22]: `` Is the only reason you wo n't be engaged to me you think I 'm too young , Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 14]: `` It 's -- it 's reason enough , '' she said faintly .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 31]: At that he caught one of her hands , and she turned to him : there were tears in her eyes , tears which he did not understand at all .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 8]: `` Lucy , you little dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 12]: `` I knew you -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 13]: she said , and she pushed him away , withdrawing her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 12]: `` George , let 's not talk of solemn things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 5]: `` Solemn things ! '
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 4]: Like what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 7]: `` Like -- being engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: But George had become altogether jubilant , and he laughed triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 10]: `` Good gracious , that is n't solemn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 7]: `` It is , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 7]: she said , wiping her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 9]: `` It 's too solemn for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 7]: `` No , it is n't !
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 18]: I -- '' `` Let 's sit down and be sensible , dear , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 22]: `` You sit over there -- '' `` I will if you 'll call me , ` dear ' again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 20]: `` I 'll only call you that once again this summer -- the night before you go away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 24]: `` That will have to do , then , '' he laughed , `` so long as I know we 're engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 7]: `` But we 're not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 27]: `` And we never will be , if you do n't promise not to speak of it again until -- until I tell you to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 13]: `` I wo n't promise that , '' said the happy George .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 40]: `` I 'll only promise not to speak of it till the next time you call me ` dear ' ; and you 've promised to call me that the night before I leave for my senior year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 9]: `` Oh , but I did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 7]: she said earnestly , then hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 6]: `` Did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 21]: `` I do n't think I meant it , '' she murmured , her wet lashes flickering above troubled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 17]: `` I know one thing about you , '' he said gayly , his triumph increasing .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 25]: `` You never went back on anything you said , yet , and I 'm not afraid of this being the first time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 42]: `` But we must n't let -- '' she faltered ; then went on tremulously , `` George , we 've got on so well together , we wo n't let this make a difference between us , will we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 7]: And she joined in his laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 17]: `` It will all depend on what you tell me the night before I go away .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 17]: You agree we 're going to settle things then , do n't you , Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 7]: `` I do n't promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 6]: `` Yes , you do !
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 29]: `` Well -- '' Chapter XIII Tonight George began a jubilant warfare upon his Aunt Fanny , opening the campaign upon his return home at about eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 60]: Fanny had retired , and was presumably asleep , but George , on the way to his own room , paused before her door , and serenaded her in a full baritone : `` As I walk along the Boy de Balong With my independent air , The people all declare , ` He must be a millionaire ! '
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 20]: Oh , you hear them sigh , and wish to die , And see them wink the other eye .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 12]: At the man that broke the bank at Monte Carlo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 17]: Isabel came from George 's room , where she had been reading , waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid you 'll disturb your father , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 13]: I wish you 'd sing more , though -- in the daytime !
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 7]: You have a splendid voice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 7]: `` Good-night , old lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 22]: `` I thought perhaps I -- Did n't you want me to come in with you and talk a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 4]: `` Not to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 5]: You go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 6]: Good-night , old lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 41]: He kissed her hilariously , entered his room with a skip , closed his door noisily ; and then he could be heard tossing things about , loudly humming `` The Man that Broke the Bank at Monte Carlo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 35]: Smiling , his mother knelt outside his door to pray ; then , with her `` Amen , '' pressed her lips to the bronze door-knob ; and went silently to her own apartment .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 33]: After breakfasting in bed , George spent the next morning at his grandfather 's and did not encounter his Aunt Fanny until lunch , when she seemed to be ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 12]: `` Thank you so much for the serenade , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 35]: `` Your poor father tells me he 'd just got to sleep for the first time in two nights , but after your kind attentions he lay awake the rest of last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 10]: `` Perfectly true , '' Mr. Minafer said grimly .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 18]: `` Of course , I did n't know , sir , '' George hastened to assure him .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 6]: `` I 'm awfully sorry .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 24]: But Aunt Fanny was so gloomy and excited before I went out , last evening , I thought she needed cheering up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 3]: Fanny jeered .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 5]: `` I was gloomy ?
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 4]: I was excited ?
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 7]: You mean about that engagement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 4]: Were n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 12]: I thought I heard you worrying over somebody 's being engaged .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 23]: Did n't I hear you say you 'd heard Mr. Eugene Morgan was engaged to marry some pretty little seventeen-year-old girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 11]: Fanny was stung , but she made a brave effort .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 7]: `` Did you ask Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 17]: she said , her voice almost refusing the teasing laugh she tried to make it utter .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 15]: `` Did you ask her when Fred Kinney and she -- '' `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 6]: That story was n't true .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 17]: But the other one -- '' Here he stared at Fanny , and then affected dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 14]: `` Why , what 's the matter with your face , Aunt Fanny ?
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 5]: It seems agitated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 4]: `` Agitated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 11]: Fanny said disdainfully , but her voice undeniably lacked steadiness .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 4]: `` Agitated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 6]: `` Oh , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 4]: Mr. Minafer interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 9]: `` Let 's have a little peace ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 9]: `` I 'm willing , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 23]: `` I do n't want to see poor Aunt Fanny all stirred up over a rumour I just this minute invented myself .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 17]: She 's so excitable -- about certain subjects -- it 's hard to control her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 6]: He turned to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter with grandfather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 10]: `` Did n't you see him this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 3]: Isabel asked .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: He was glad to see me , and all that , but he seemed pretty fidgety .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 11]: Has he been having trouble with his heart again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 4]: `` Not lately .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 3]: No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 8]: `` Well , he 's not himself .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 24]: I tried to talk to him about the estate ; it 's disgraceful -- it really is -- the way things are looking .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 10]: He would n't listen , and he seemed upset .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 7]: What 's he upset over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 32]: Isabel looked serious ; however , it was her husband who suggested gloomily , `` I suppose the Major 's bothered about this Sydney and Amelia business , most likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 8]: `` What Sydney and Amelia business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 3]: George asked .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 16]: `` Your mother can tell you , if she wants to , '' Minafer said .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 16]: `` It 's not my side of the family , so I keep off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: `` It 's rather disagreeable for all of us , Georgie , '' Isabel began .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 26]: `` You see , your Uncle Sydney wanted a diplomatic position , and he thought brother George , being in Congress , could arrange it .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 47]: George did get him the offer of a South American ministry , but Sydney wanted a European ambassadorship , and he got quite indignant with poor George for thinking he 'd take anything smaller -- and he believes George did n't work hard enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 38]: George had done his best , of course , and now he 's out of Congress , and wo n't run again -- so there 's Sydney 's idea of a big diplomatic position gone for good .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 49]: Well , Sydney and your Aunt Amelia are terribly disappointed , and they say they 've been thinking for years that this town is n't really fit to live in -- ` for a gentleman , ' Sydney says -- and it is getting rather big and dirty .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 28]: So they 've sold their house and decided to go abroad to live permanently ; there 's a villa near Florence they 've often talked of buying .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 30]: And they want father to let them have their share of the estate now , instead of waiting for him to leave it to them in his will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 14]: `` Well , I suppose that 's fair enough , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 19]: `` That is , in case he intended to leave them a certain amount in his will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 9]: `` Of course that 's understood , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 28]: Father explained his will to us long ago ; a third to them , and a third to brother George , and a third to us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: Her son made a simple calculation in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 18]: Uncle George was a bachelor , and probably would never marry ; Sydney and Amelia were childless .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 32]: The Major 's only grandchild appeared to remain the eventual heir of the entire property , no matter if the Major did turn over to Sydney a third of it now .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 50]: And George had a fragmentary vision of himself , in mourning , arriving to take possession of a historic Florentine villa -- he saw himself walking up a cypress-bordered path , with ancient carven stone balustrades in the distance , and servants in mourning livery greeting the new signore .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 12]: `` Well , I suppose it 's grandfather 's own affair .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 12]: He can do it or not , just as he likes .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 11]: I do n't see why he 'd mind much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 14]: `` He seemed rather confused and pained about it , '' Isabel said .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 10]: `` I think they ought n't to urge it .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 30]: George says that the estate wo n't stand taking out the third that Sydney wants , and that Sydney and Amelia are behaving like a couple of pigs . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 33]: She laughed , continuing , `` Of course I do n't know whether they are or not : I never have understood any more about business myself than a little pig would !
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 40]: But I 'm on George 's side , whether he 's right or wrong ; I always was from the time we were children : and Sydney and Amelia are hurt with me about it , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 8]: They 've stopped speaking to George entirely .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: Poor father Family rows at his time of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 4]: George became thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 23]: If Sydney and Amelia were behaving like pigs , things might not be so simple as at first they seemed to be .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 28]: Uncle Sydney and Aunt Amelia might live an awful long while , he thought ; and besides , people did n't always leave their fortunes to relatives .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 40]: Sydney might die first , leaving everything to his widow , and some curly-haired Italian adventurer might get round her , over there in Florence ; she might be fool enough to marry again -- or even adopt somebody !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 51]: He became more and more thoughtful , forgetting entirely a plan he had formed for the continued teasing of his Aunt Fanny ; and , an hour after lunch , he strolled over to his grandfather 's , intending to apply for further information , as a party rightfully interested .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 10]: He did not carry out this intention , however .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 42]: Going into the big house by a side entrance , he was informed that the Major was upstairs in his bedroom , that his sons Sydney and George were both with him , and that a serious argument was in progress .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 48]: `` You kin stan ' right in de middle dat big , sta ` y-way , '' said Old Sam , the ancient negro , who was his informant , `` an ' you kin heah all you a-mind to wivout goin ' on up no fudda .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 25]: Mist ' Sydney an ' Mist ' Jawge talkin ' louduh 'n I evuh heah nobody ca ' y on in nish heah house !
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 10]: Quollin ' , honey , big quollin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 9]: `` All right , '' said George shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 20]: `` You go on back to your own part of the house , and do n't make any talk .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 4]: Hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 14]: `` Yessuh , yessuh , '' Sam chuckled , as he shuffled away .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 7]: `` Plenty talkin ' wivout Sam !
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 3]: Yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 10]: George went to the foot of the great stairway .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 28]: He could hear angry voices overhead -- those of his two uncles -- and a plaintive murmur , as if the Major tried to keep the peace .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 22]: Such sounds were far from encouraging to callers , and George decided not to go upstairs until this interview was over .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 16]: His decision was the result of no timidity , nor of a too sensitive delicacy .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 59]: What he felt was , that if he interrupted the scene in his grandfather 's room , just at this time , one of the three gentlemen engaging in it might speak to him in a peremptory manner -LRB- in the heat of the moment -RRB- and George saw no reason for exposing his dignity to such mischances .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 45]: Therefore he turned from the stairway , and going quietly into the library , picked up a magazine -- but he did not open it , for his attention was instantly arrested by his Aunt Amelia 's voice , speaking in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 10]: The door was open and George heard her distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 4]: `` Isabel does ?
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 3]: Isabel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 9]: she exclaimed , her tone high and shrewish .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 20]: `` You need n't tell me anything about Isabel Minafer , I guess , my dear old Frank Bronson !
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 16]: I know her a little better than you do , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 27]: George heard the voice of Mr. Bronson replying -- a voice familiar to him as that of his grandfather 's attorney-in-chief and chief intimate as well .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 28]: He was a contemporary of the Major 's , being over seventy , and they had been through three years of the War in the same regiment .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 46]: Amelia addressed him now , with an effect of angry mockery , as `` my dear old Frank Bronson '' ; but that -LRB- without the mockery -RRB- was how the Amberson family almost always spoke of him : `` dear old Frank Bronson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 20]: He was a hale , thin old man , six feet three inches tall , and without a stoop .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 12]: `` I doubt your knowing Isabel , '' he said stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 24]: `` You speak of her as you do because she sides with her brother George , instead of with you and Sydney . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 4]: `` Pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 8]: Aunt Amelia was evidently in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 18]: `` You know what 's been going on over there , well enough , Frank Bronson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 13]: `` I do n't even know what you 're talking about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 7]: `` Oh , you do n't ?
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 21]: You do n't know that Isabel takes George 's side simply because he 's Eugene Morgan 's best friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 16]: `` It seems to me you 're talking pure nonsense , '' said Bronson sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 9]: `` Not impure nonsense , I hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 4]: Amelia became shrill .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 19]: `` I thought you were a man of the world : do n't tell me you 're blind !
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 34]: For nearly two years Isabel 's been pretending to chaperone Fanny Minafer with Eugene , and all the time she 's been dragging that poor fool Fanny around to chaperone her and Eugene !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 47]: Under the circumstances , she knows people will get to thinking Fanny 's a pretty slim kind of chaperone , and Isabel wants to please George because she thinks there 'll be less talk if she can keep her own brother around , seeming to approve .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: ` Talk ! '
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: She 'd better look out !
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 13]: The whole town will be talking , the first thing she knows !
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 21]: She -- '' Amelia stopped , and stared at the doorway in a panic , for her nephew stood there .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 27]: She kept her eyes upon his white face for a few strained moments , then , regaining her nerve , looked away and shrugged her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 20]: `` You were n't intended to hear what I 've been saying , George , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 15]: `` But since you seem to -- '' `` Yes , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 4]: `` So ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 6]: She shrugged her shoulders again .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 21]: `` After all , I do n't know but it 's just as well , in the long run . ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 8]: He walked up to where she sat .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 10]: `` You -- you -- '' he said thickly .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 17]: `` It seems -- it seems to me you 're -- you 're pretty common ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 25]: Amelia tried to give the impression of an unconcerned person laughing with complete indifference , but the sounds she produced were disjointed and uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 13]: She fanned herself , looking out of the open window near her .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 44]: `` Of course , if you want to make more trouble in the family than we 've already got , George , with your eavesdropping , you can go and repeat -- '' Old Bronson had risen from his chair in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 21]: `` Your aunt was talking nonsense because she 's piqued over a business matter , George , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 31]: `` She does n't mean what she said , and neither she nor any one else gives the slightest credit to such foolishness -- no one in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 13]: George gulped , and wet lines shone suddenly along his lower eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 9]: `` They -- they 'd better not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 16]: he said , then stalked out of the room , and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 26]: He stamped fiercely across the stone slabs of the front porch , descended the steps , and halted abruptly , blinking in the strong sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 33]: In front of his own gate , beyond the Major 's broad lawn , his mother was just getting into her victoria , where sat already his Aunt Fanny and Lucy Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 75]: It was a summer fashion-picture : the three ladies charmingly dressed , delicate parasols aloft ; the lines of the victoria graceful as those of a violin ; the trim pair of bays in glistening harness picked out with silver , and the serious black driver whom Isabel , being an Amberson , dared even in that town to put into a black livery coat , boots , white breeches , and cockaded hat .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 26]: They jingled smartly away , and , seeing George standing on the Major 's lawn , Lucy waved , and Isabel threw him a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 33]: But George shuddered , pretending not to see them , and stooped as if searching for something lost in the grass , protracting that posture until the victoria was out of hearing .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 31]: And ten minutes later , George Amberson , somewhat in the semblance of an angry person plunging out of the Mansion , found a pale nephew waiting to accost him .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 11]: `` I have n't time to talk , Georgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 6]: `` Yes , you have .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 5]: You 'd better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 12]: His namesake drew him away from the vicinity of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 18]: `` I want to tell you something I just heard Aunt Amelia say , in there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 13]: `` I do n't want to hear it , '' said Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 19]: `` I 've been hearing entirely too much of what ` Aunt Amelia , says , lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 25]: `` She says my mother 's on your side about this division of the property because you 're Eugene Morgan 's best friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 22]: `` What in the name of heaven has that got to do with your mother 's being on my side ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 10]: `` She said -- '' George paused to swallow .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 8]: `` She said -- '' He faltered .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 14]: `` You look sick , '' said his uncle ; and laughed shortly .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 18]: `` If it 's because of anything Amelia 's been saying , I do n't blame you !
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 7]: What else did she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 21]: George swallowed again , as with nausea , but under his uncle 's encouragement he was able to be explicit .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 16]: `` She said my mother wanted you to be friendly to her about Eugene Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 14]: She said my mother had been using Aunt Fanny as a chaperone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 7]: Amberson emitted a laugh of disgust .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 17]: `` It 's wonderful what tommy-rot a woman in a state of spite can think of !
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 17]: I suppose you do n't doubt that Amelia Amberson created this specimen of tommy-rot herself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 7]: `` I know she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 8]: `` Then what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 9]: `` She said -- '' George faltered again .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 15]: `` She said -- she implied people were -- were talking about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 8]: `` Of all the damn nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 4]: his uncle exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 6]: George looked at him haggardly .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 9]: `` You 're sure they 're not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 3]: `` Rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 30]: Your mother 's on my side about this division because she knows Sydney 's a pig and always has been a pig , and so has his spiteful wife .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 28]: I 'm trying to keep them from getting the better of your mother as well as from getting the better of me , do n't you suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 38]: Well , they 're in a rage because Sydney always could do what he liked with father unless your mother interfered , and they know I got Isabel to ask him not to do what they wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 28]: They 're keeping up the fight and they 're sore -- and Amelia 's a woman who always says any damn thing that comes into her head !
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 9]: That 's all there is to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 17]: `` But she said , '' George persisted wretchedly ; `` she said there was talk .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 12]: She said -- '' `` Look here , young fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 4]: Amberson laughed good-naturedly .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 29]: `` There probably is some harmless talk about the way your Aunt Fanny goes after poor Eugene , and I 've no doubt I 've abetted it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 12]: People ca n't help being amused by a thing like that .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 16]: Fanny was always languishing at him , twenty-odd years ago , before he left here .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 40]: Well , we ca n't blame the poor thing if she 's got her hopes up again , and I do n't know that I blame her , myself , for using your mother the way she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 9]: Amberson put his hand on George 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 26]: `` You like to tease Fanny , '' he said , `` but I would n't tease her about this , if I were you .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 9]: Fanny has n't got much in her life .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 22]: You know , Georgie , just being an aunt is n't really the great career it may sometimes appear to you !
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 21]: In fact , I do n't know of anything much that Fanny has got , except her feeling about Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 22]: She 's always had it -- and what 's funny to us is pretty much life-and-death to her , I suspect .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 15]: Now , I 'll not deny that Eugene Morgan is attracted to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 42]: He is ; and that 's another case of ` always was ' ; but I know him , and he 's a knight , George -- a crazy one , perhaps , if you 've read ` Don Quixote . '
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 34]: And I think your mother likes him better than she likes any man outside her own family , and that he interests her more than anybody else -- and ` always has . '
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 17]: And that 's all there is to it , except -- '' `` Except what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 8]: George asked quickly , as he paused .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 22]: `` Except that I suspect -- '' Amberson chuckled , and began over : `` I 'll tell you in confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 16]: I think Fanny 's a fairly tricky customer , for such an innocent old girl !
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 26]: There is n't any real harm in her , but she 's a great diplomatist -- lots of cards up her lace sleeves , Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 16]: By the way , did you ever notice how proud she is of her arms ?
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: Always flashing 'em at poor Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 7]: And he stopped to laugh again .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 14]: `` I do n't see anything confidential about that , '' George complained .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 10]: `` I thought -- '' `` Wait a minute !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 24]: My idea is -- do n't forget it 's a confidential one , but I 'm devilish right about it , young Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 14]: -- it 's this : Fanny uses your mother for a decoy duck .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 34]: She does everything in the world she can to keep your mother 's friendship with Eugene going , because she thinks that 's what keeps Eugene about the place , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 19]: Fanny 's always with your mother , you see ; and whenever he sees Isabel he sees Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 22]: Fanny thinks he 'll get used to the idea of her being around , and some day her chance may come !
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 16]: You see , she 's probably afraid -- perhaps she even knows , poor thing !
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 25]: -- that she would n't get to see much of Eugene if it were n't for Isabel 's being such a friend of his .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 4]: D'you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 8]: `` Well -- I suppose so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 9]: George 's brow was still dark , however .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 15]: `` If you 're sure whatever talk there is , is about Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 23]: If that 's so -- '' `` Do n't be an ass , '' his uncle advised him lightly , moving away .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 24]: `` I 'm off for a week 's fishing to forget that woman in there , and her pig of a husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 14]: -LRB- His gesture toward the Mansion indicated Mr. and Mrs. Sydney Amberson . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 22]: `` I recommend a like course to you , if you 're silly enough to pay any attention to such rubbishings !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 20]: George was partially reassured , but still troubled : a word haunted him like the recollection of a nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 4]: `` Talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 27]: He stood looking at the houses across the street from the Mansion ; and though the sunshine was bright upon them , they seemed mysteriously threatening .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 23]: He had always despised them , except the largest of them , which was the home of his henchman , Charlie Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 46]: The Johnsons had originally owned a lot three hundred feet wide , but they had sold all of it except the meager frontage before the house itself , and five houses were now crowded into the space where one used to squire it so spaciously .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 77]: Up and down the street , the same transformation had taken place : every big , comfortable old brick house now had two or three smaller frame neighbours crowding up to it on each side , cheap-looking neighbours , most of them needing paint and not clean -- and yet , though they were cheap looking , they had cost as much to build as the big brick houses , whose former ample yards they occupied .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 33]: Only where George stood was there left a sward as of yore ; the great , level , green lawn that served for both the Major 's house and his daughter 's .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 28]: This serene domain -- unbroken , except for the two gravelled carriage-drives -- alone remained as it had been during the early glories of the Amberson Addition .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 19]: George stared at the ugly houses opposite , and hated them more than ever ; but he shivered .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 36]: Perhaps the riffraff living in those houses sat at the windows to watch their betters ; perhaps they dared to gossip -- He uttered an exclamation , and walked rapidly toward his own front gate .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 18]: The victoria had returned with Miss Fanny alone ; she jumped out briskly and the victoria waited .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 6]: `` Where 's mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 9]: George asked sharply , as he met her .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 5]: `` At Lucy 's .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 19]: I only came back to get some embroidery , because we found the sun too hot for driving .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 7]: I 'm in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 19]: But , going into the house with her , he detained her when she would have hastened upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 17]: `` I have n't time to talk now , Georgie ; I 'm going right back .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 11]: I promised your mother -- '' `` You listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 13]: `` What on earth -- '' He repeated what Amelia had said .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 45]: This time , however , he spoke coldly , and without the emotion he had exhibited during the recital to his uncle : Fanny was the one who showed agitation during this interview , for she grew fiery red , and her eyes dilated .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 16]: `` What on earth do you want to bring such trash to me for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 6]: she demanded , breathing fast .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 31]: `` I merely wished to know two things : whether it is your duty or mine to speak to father of what Aunt Amelia -- '' Fanny stamped her foot .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 6]: `` You little fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 7]: `` You awful little fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 11]: `` I decline -- '' `` Decline , my hat !
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 21]: Your father 's a sick man , and you -- '' `` He does n't seem so to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 8]: `` Well , he does to me !
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 13]: And you want to go troubling him with an Amberson family row !
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 13]: It 's just what that cat would love you to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 14]: `` Well , I -- '' `` Tell your father if you like !
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 24]: It will only make him a little sicker to think he 's got a son silly enough to listen to such craziness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 12]: `` Then you 're sure there is n't any talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 7]: Fanny disdained a reply in words .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 13]: She made a hissing sound of utter contempt and snapped her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 17]: Then she asked scornfully : `` What 's the other thing you wanted to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 5]: George 's pallor increased .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 35]: `` Whether it might n't be better , under the circumstances , '' he said , `` if this family were not so intimate with the Morgan family -- at least for a time .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 12]: It might be better -- '' Fanny stared at him incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 10]: `` You mean you 'd quit seeing Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 35]: `` I had n't thought of that side of it , but if such a thing were necessary on account of talk about my mother , I -- I -- '' He hesitated unhappily .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 34]: `` I suggested that if all of us -- for a time -- perhaps only for a time -- it might be better if -- '' `` See here , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 9]: `` We 'll settle this nonsense right now .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 34]: If Eugene Morgan comes to this house , for instance , to see me , your mother ca n't get up and leave the place the minute he gets here , can she ?
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 11]: What do you want her to do : insult him ?
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 10]: Or perhaps you 'd prefer she 'd insult Lucy ?
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 7]: That would do just as well .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 10]: What is it you 're up to , anyhow ?
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 16]: Do you really love your Aunt Amelia so much that you want to please her ?
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 35]: Or do you really hate your Aunt Fanny so much that you want to -- that you want to -- '' She choked and sought for her handkerchief ; suddenly she began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 10]: `` Oh , see here , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 11]: `` I do n't hate you , '' Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 5]: `` That 's silly .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 9]: I do n't -- '' `` You do !
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 3]: You do !
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 33]: You want to -- you want to destroy the only thing -- that I -- that I ever -- '' And , unable to continue , she became inaudible in her handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 27]: George felt remorseful , and his own troubles were lightened : all at once it became clear to him that he had been worrying about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 28]: He perceived that his Aunt Amelia was indeed an old cat , and that to give her scandalous meanderings another thought would be the height of folly .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 49]: By no means unsusceptible to such pathos as that now exposed before him , he did not lack pity for Fanny , whose almost spoken confession was lamentable ; and he was granted the vision to understand that his mother also pitied Fanny infinitely more than he did .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 6]: This seemed to explain everything .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 10]: He patted the unhappy lady awkwardly upon her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 6]: `` There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 7]: `` I did n't mean anything .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 18]: Of course the only thing to do about Aunt Amelia is to pay no attention to her .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 8]: It 's all right , Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 4]: Do n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 9]: I feel a lot better now , myself .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 11]: Come on ; I 'll drive back there with you .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 11]: It 's all over , and nothing 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 7]: Ca n't you cheer up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 24]: Fanny cheered up ; and presently the customarily hostile aunt and nephew were driving out Amberson Boulevard amiably together in the hot sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 38]: Chapter XIV `` Almost '' was Lucy 's last word on the last night of George 's vacation -- that vital evening which she had half consented to agree upon for `` settling things '' between them .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 8]: `` Almost engaged , '' she meant .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 47]: And George , discontented with the `` almost , '' but contented that she seemed glad to wear a sapphire locket with a tiny photograph of George Amberson Minafer inside it , found himself wonderful in a new world at the final instant of their parting .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 51]: For , after declining to let him kiss her `` good-bye , '' as if his desire for such a ceremony were the most preposterous absurdity in the world , she had leaned suddenly close to him and left upon his cheek the veriest feather from a fairy 's wing .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 9]: She wrote him a month later : No .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 7]: It must keep on being almost .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 6]: Is n't almost pretty pleasant ?
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 10]: You know well enough that I care for you .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 25]: I did from the first minute I saw you , and I 'm pretty sure you knew it -- I 'm afraid you did .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 8]: I 'm afraid you always knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 18]: I 'm not conventional and cautious about being engaged , as you say I am , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 38]: -LRB- I always read over the `` dears '' in your letters a time or two , as you say you do in mine -- only I read all of your letters a time or two ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 11]: But it 's such a solemn thing it scares me .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 22]: It means a good deal to a lot of people besides you and me , and that scares me , too .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 25]: You write that I take your feeling for me `` too lightly '' and that I `` take the whole affair too lightly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 5]: Is n't that odd !
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 18]: Because to myself I seem to take it as something so much more solemn than you do .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 40]: I should n't be a bit surprised to find myself an old lady , some day , still thinking of you -- while you 'd be away and away with somebody else perhaps , and me forgotten ages ago !
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 15]: `` Lucy Morgan , '' you 'd say , when you saw my obituary .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 4]: `` Lucy Morgan ?
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 11]: Let me see : I seem to remember the name .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 16]: Did n't I know some Lucy Morgan or other , once upon a time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 25]: Then you 'd shake your big white head and stroke your long white beard -- you 'd have such a distinguished long white beard !
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 8]: and you 'd say , ` No .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 20]: I do n't seem to remember any Lucy Morgan ; I wonder what made me think I did ? '
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 4]: And poor me !
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 21]: I 'd be deep in the ground , wondering if you 'd heard about it and what you were saying !
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 4]: Good-bye for to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 8]: Do n't work too hard -- dear !
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 31]: George immediately seized pen and paper , plaintively but vigorously requesting Lucy not to imagine him with a beard , distinguished or otherwise , even in the extremities of age .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 43]: Then , after inscribing his protest in the matter of this visioned beard , he concluded his missive in a tone mollified to tenderness , and proceeded to read a letter from his mother which had reached him simultaneously with Lucy 's .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 14]: Isabel wrote from Asheville , where she had just arrived with her husband .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 33]: I think your father looks better already , darling , though we 've been here only a few hours It may be we 've found just the place to build him up .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 36]: The doctors said they hoped it would prove to be , and if it is , it would be worth the long struggle we had with him to get him to give up and come .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 37]: Poor dear man , he was so blue , not about his health but about giving up the worries down at his office and forgetting them for a time -- if he only will forget them !
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 43]: It took the pressure of the family and all his best friends , to get him to come -- but father and brother George and Fanny and Eugene Morgan all kept at him so constantly that he just had to give in .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 39]: I 'm afraid that in my anxiety to get him to do what the doctors wanted him to , I was n't able to back up brother George as I should in his difficulty with Sydney and Amelia .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 5]: I 'm so sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 33]: George is more upset than I 've ever seen him -- they 've got what they wanted , and they 're sailing before long , I hear , to live in Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 22]: Father said he could n't stand the constant persuading -- I 'm afraid the word he used was `` nagging . ''
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 9]: I ca n't understand people behaving like that .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 12]: George says they may be Ambersons , but they 're vulgar !
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 9]: I 'm afraid I almost agree with him .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 9]: At least , I think they were inconsiderate .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 19]: But I do n't see why I 'm unburdening myself of all this to you , poor darling !
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 28]: We 'll have forgotten all about it long before you come home for the holidays , and it should mean little or nothing to you , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 8]: Forget that I 've been so foolish !
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 34]: Your father is waiting for me to take a walk with him -- that 's a splendid sign , because he has n't felt he could walk much , at home , lately .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 7]: I must n't keep him waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 26]: Be careful to wear your mackintosh and rubbers in rainy weather , and , as soon as it begins to get colder , your ulster .
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 8]: Wish you could see your father now .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 5]: Looks so much better !
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 13]: We plan to stay six weeks if the place agrees with him .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 7]: It does really seem to already !
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 13]: He 's just called in the door to say he 's waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: Do n't smoke too much , darling boy .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 6]: Devotedly , your mother Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 15]: But she did not keep her husband there for the six weeks she anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 9]: She did not keep him anywhere that long .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 51]: Three weeks after writing this letter , she telegraphed suddenly to George that they were leaving for home at once ; and four days later , when he and a friend came whistling into his study , from lunch at the club , he found another telegram upon his desk .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 10]: He read it twice before he comprehended its import .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 10]: Papa left us at ten this morning , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 2]: Mother .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 9]: The friend saw the change in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 6]: `` Not bad news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 10]: George lifted utterly dumfounded eyes from the yellow paper .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 9]: `` My father , '' he said weakly .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 10]: `` She says -- she says he 's dead .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 8]: I 've got to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 28]: His Uncle George and the Major met him at the station when he arrived -- the first time the Major had ever come to meet his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 39]: The old gentleman sat in his closed carriage -LRB- which still needed paint -RRB- at the entrance to the station , but he got out and advanced to grasp George 's hand tremulously , when the latter appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 5]: `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 11]: he said , and patted him repeatedly upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 4]: `` Poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 4]: Poor Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 37]: George had not yet come to a full realization of his loss : so far , his condition was merely dazed ; and as the Major continued to pat him , murmuring `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 23]: over and over , George was seized by an almost irresistible impulse to tell his grandfather that he was not a poodle .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 26]: But he said `` Thanks , '' in a low voice , and got into the carriage , his two relatives following with deferential sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 29]: He noticed that the Major 's tremulousness did not disappear , as they drove up the street , and that he seemed much feebler than during the summer .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 36]: Principally , however , George was concerned with his own emotion , or rather , with his lack of emotion ; and the anxious sympathy of his grandfather and his uncle made him feel hypocritical .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 30]: He was not grief-stricken ; but he felt that he ought to be , and , with a secret shame , concealed his callousness beneath an affectation of solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 29]: But when he was taken into the room where lay what was left of Wilbur Minafer , George had no longer to pretend ; his grief was sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 50]: It needed only the sight of that forever inert semblance of the quiet man who had been always so quiet a part of his son 's life -- so quiet a part that George had seldom been consciously aware that his father was indeed a part of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 22]: As the figure lay there , its very quietness was what was most lifelike ; and suddenly it struck George hard .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 27]: And in that unexpected , racking grief of his son , Wilbur Minafer became more vividly George 's father than he had ever been in life .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 22]: When George left the room , his arm was about his black-robed mother , his shoulders were still shaken with sobs .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 35]: He leaned upon his mother ; she gently comforted him ; and presently he recovered his composure and became self-conscious enough to wonder if he had not been making an unmanly display of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 14]: `` I 'm all right again , mother , '' he said awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 23]: `` Do n't worry about me : you 'd better go lie down , or something ; you look pretty pale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 15]: Isabel did look pretty pale , but not ghastly pale , as Fanny did .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 37]: Fanny 's grief was overwhelming ; she stayed in her room , and George did not see her until the next day , a few minutes before the funeral , when her haggard face appalled him .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 39]: But by this time he was quite himself again , and during the short service in the cemetery his thoughts even wandered so far as to permit him a feeling of regret not directly connected with his father .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 85]: Beyond the open flower-walled grave was a mound where new grass grew ; and here lay his great-uncle , old John Minafer , who had died the previous autumn ; and beyond this were the graves of George 's grandfather and grandmother Minafer , and of his grandfather Minafer 's second wife , and her three sons , George 's half-uncles , who had been drowned together in a canoe accident when George was a child -- Fanny was the last of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 54]: Next beyond was the Amberson family lot , where lay the Major 's wife and their sons Henry and Milton , uncles whom George dimly remembered ; and beside them lay Isabel 's older sister , his Aunt Estelle , who had died , in her girlhood , long before George was born .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 35]: The Minafer monument was a granite block , with the name chiseled upon its one polished side , and the Amberson monument was a white marble shaft taller than any other in that neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 36]: But farther on there was a newer section of the cemetery , an addition which had been thrown open to occupancy only a few years before , after dexterous modern treatment by a landscape specialist .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 54]: There were some large new mausoleums here , and shafts taller than the Ambersons ' , as well as a number of monuments of some sculptural pretentiousness ; and altogether the new section appeared to be a more fashionable and important quarter than that older one which contained the Amberson and Minafer lots .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 27]: This was what caused George 's regret , during the moment or two when his mind strayed from his father and the reading of the service .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 94]: On the train , going back to college , ten days later , this regret -LRB- though it was as much an annoyance as a regret -RRB- recurred to his mind , and a feeling developed within him that the new quarter of the cemetery was in bad taste -- not architecturally or sculpturally perhaps , but in presumption : it seemed to flaunt a kind of parvenu ignorance , as if it were actually pleased to be unaware that all the aristocratic and really important families were buried in the old section .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 38]: The annoyance gave way before a recollection of the sweet mournfulness of his mother 's face , as she had said good-bye to him at the station , and of how lovely she looked in her mourning .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 50]: He thought of Lucy , whom he had seen only twice , and he could not help feeling that in these quiet interviews he had appeared to her as tinged with heroism -- she had shown , rather than said , how brave she thought him in his sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 23]: But what came most vividly to George 's mind , during these retrospections , was the despairing face of his Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 15]: Again and again he thought of it ; he could not avoid its haunting .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 36]: And for days , after he got back to college , the stricken likeness of Fanny would appear before him unexpectedly , and without a cause that he could trace in his immediately previous thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 14]: Her grief had been so silent , yet it had so amazed him .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 64]: George felt more and more compassion for this ancient antagonist of his , and he wrote to his mother about her : I 'm afraid poor Aunt Fanny might think now father 's gone we wo n't want her to live with us any longer and because I always teased her so much she might think I 'd be for turning her out .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 50]: I do n't know where on earth she 'd go or what she could live on if we did do something like this , and of course we never would do such a thing , but I 'm pretty sure she had something of the kind on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 18]: She did n't say anything , but the way she looked is what makes me think so .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 10]: Honestly , to me she looked just scared sick .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 18]: You tell her there is n't any danger in the world of my treating her like that .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 13]: Tell her everything is to go on just as it always has .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 6]: Tell her to cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 14]: Chapter XV Isabel did more for Fanny than telling her to cheer up .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 48]: Everything that Fanny inherited from her father , old Aleck Minafer , had been invested in Wilbur 's business ; and Wilbur 's business , after a period of illness corresponding in dates to the illness of Wilbur 's body , had died just before Wilbur did .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 20]: George Amberson and Fanny were both `` wiped out to a miracle of precision , '' as Amberson said .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 20]: They `` owned not a penny and owed not a penny , '' he continued , explaining his phrase .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 23]: `` It 's like the moment just before drowning : you 're not under water and you 're not out of it .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 12]: All you know is that you 're not dead yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 27]: He spoke philosophically , having his `` prospects '' from his father to fall back upon ; but Fanny had neither `` prospects '' nor philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 43]: However , a legal survey of Wilbur 's estate revealed the fact that his life insurance was left clear of the wreck ; and Isabel , with the cheerful consent of her son , promptly turned this salvage over to her sister-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 64]: Invested , it would yield something better than nine hundred dollars a year , and thus she was assured of becoming neither a pauper nor a dependent , but proved to be , as Amberson said , adding his efforts to the cheering up of Fanny , `` an heiress , after all , in spite of rolling mills and the devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 13]: She was unable to smile , and he continued his humane gayeties .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 33]: `` See what a wonderfully desirable income nine hundred dollars is , Fanny : a bachelor , to be in your class , must have exactly forty-nine thousand one hundred a year .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 48]: Then , you see , all you need to do , in order to have fifty thousand a year , is to be a little encouraging when some bachelor in your class begins to show by his haberdashery what he wants you to think about him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 34]: She looked at him wanly , murmured a desolate response -- she had `` sewing to do '' -- and left the room ; while Amberson shook his head ruefully at his sister .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 16]: `` I 've often thought that humor was not my forte , '' he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 3]: `` Lord !
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 10]: She does n't ` cheer up ' much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 12]: The collegian did not return to his home for the holidays .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 15]: Instead , Isabel joined him , and they went South for the two weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 70]: She was proud of her stalwart , good-looking son at the hotel where they stayed , and it was meat and drink to her when she saw how people stared at him in the lobby and on the big verandas -- indeed , her vanity in him was so dominant that she was unaware of their staring at her with more interest and an admiration friendlier than George evoked .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 49]: Happy to have him to herself for this fortnight , she loved to walk with him , leaning upon his arm , to read with him , to watch the sea with him -- perhaps most of all she liked to enter the big dining room with him .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 26]: Yet both of them felt constantly the difference between this Christmastime and other Christmas-times of theirs -- in all , it was a sorrowful holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 39]: But when Isabel came East for George 's commencement , in June , she brought Lucy with her -- and things began to seem different , especially when George Amberson arrived with Lucy 's father on Class Day .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 41]: Eugene had been in New York , on business ; Amberson easily persuaded him to this outing ; and they made a cheerful party of it , with the new graduate of course the hero and center of it all .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 7]: His uncle was a fellow alumnus .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 25]: `` Yonder was where I roomed when I was here , '' he said , pointing out one of the university buildings to Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 22]: `` I do n't know whether George would let my admirers place a tablet to mark the spot , or not .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 11]: He owns all these buildings now , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 10]: `` Did n't you , when you were here ?
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: Like uncle , like nephew . ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 12]: `` Do n't tell George you think he 's like me .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 16]: Just at this time we should be careful of the young gentleman 's feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 15]: `` If we were n't he might n't let us exist at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 29]: `` I 'm sure I did n't have it so badly at his age , '' Amberson said reflectively , as they strolled on through the commencement crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 36]: `` For one thing , I had brothers and sisters , and my mother did n't just sit at my feet as George 's does ; and I was n't an only grandchild , either .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 19]: Father 's always spoiled Georgie a lot more than he did any of his own ' children . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 3]: Eugene laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 18]: `` You need only three things to explain all that 's good and bad about Georgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 4]: `` Three ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 8]: `` He 's Isabel 's only child .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 5]: He 's an Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 6]: He 's a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 23]: `` Well , Mister Bones , of these three things which are the good ones and which are the bad ones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 9]: `` All of them , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 16]: It happened that just then they came in sight of the subject of their discourse .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 32]: George was walking under the elms with Lucy , swinging a stick and pointing out to her various objects and localities which had attained historical value during the last four years .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 48]: The two older men marked his gestures , careless and graceful ; they observed his attitude , unconsciously noble , his easy proprietorship of the ground beneath his feet and round about , of the branches overhead , of the old buildings beyond , and of Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 13]: `` I do n't know , '' Eugene said , smiling whimsically .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 15]: When I spoke of his being a human being -- I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 8]: Perhaps it 's more like deity . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 10]: `` I wonder if I was like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 5]: ` Amberson groaned . '
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 18]: `` You do n't suppose every Amberson has had to go through it , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 5]: `` Do n't worry !
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 34]: At least half of it is a combination of youth , good looks , and college ; and even the noblest Ambersons get over their nobility and come to be people in time .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 9]: It takes more than time , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 12]: `` I should say it did take more than time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 9]: his friend agreed , shaking a rueful head .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 20]: Then they walked over to join the loveliest Amberson , whom neither time nor trouble seemed to have touched .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 32]: She stood alone , thoughtful under the great trees , chaperoning George and Lucy at a distance ; but , seeing the two friends approaching , she came to meet them .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 10]: `` It 's charming , is n't it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 28]: she said , moving her black-gloved hand to indicate the summery dressed crowd strolling about them , or clustering in groups , each with its own hero .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 17]: `` They seem so eager and so confident , all these boys -- it 's touching .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 12]: But of course youth does n't know it 's touching . ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 3]: Amberson coughed .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 15]: `` No , it does n't seem to take itself as pathetic , precisely !
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 11]: Eugene and I were just speaking of something like that .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 16]: Do you know what I think whenever I see these smooth , triumphal young faces ?
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 17]: I always think : ` Oh , how you 're going to catch it ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 21]: `` Life 's most ingenious : it 's got a special walloping for every mother 's son of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 23]: `` Maybe , '' said Isabel , troubled -- `` maybe some of the mothers can take the walloping for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 5]: `` Not one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 8]: her brother assured her , with emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 24]: `` Not any more than she can take on her own face the lines that are bound to come on her son 's .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 18]: I suppose you know that all these young faces have got to get lines on 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 13]: `` Maybe they wo n't , '' she said , smiling wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 15]: `` Maybe times will change , and nobody will have to wear lines . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 18]: `` Times have changed like that for only one person that I know , '' Eugene said .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 22]: And as Isabel looked inquiring , he laughed , and she saw that she was the `` only one person . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 12]: His implication was justified , moreover , and she knew it .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 4]: She blushed charmingly .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 12]: `` Which is it puts the lines on the faces ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 3]: Amberson asked .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 7]: `` Is it age or trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 19]: Of course we ca n't decide that wisdom does it -- we must be polite to Isabel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 15]: `` I 'll tell you what puts the lines there , '' Eugene said .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 25]: `` Age puts some , and trouble puts some , and work puts some , but the deepest are carved by lack of faith .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 12]: The serenest brow is the one that believes the most . ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 5]: `` In what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 4]: Isabel asked gently .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 5]: `` In everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 24]: She looked at him inquiringly , and he laughed as he had a moment before , when she looked at him that way .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 43]: She continued to look at him inquiringly a moment or two longer , and there was an unconscious earnestness in her glance , something trustful as well as inquiring , as if she knew that whatever he meant it was all right .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 16]: Then her eyes drooped thoughtfully , and she seemed to address some inquiries to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 5]: She looked up suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 23]: `` Why , I believe , '' she said , in a tone of surprise , `` I believe I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 7]: And at that both men laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 4]: `` Isabel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 4]: her brother exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 7]: `` You 're a foolish person !
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 12]: There are times when you look exactly fourteen years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 15]: But this reminded her of her real affair in that part of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 8]: `` Where have the children got to ?
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 18]: We must take Lucy pretty soon , so that George can go and sit with the Class .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 8]: We must catch up with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 20]: She took her brother 's arm , and the three moved on , looking about them in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 19]: `` Curious , '' Amberson remarked , as they did not immediately discover the young people they sought .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 19]: `` Even in such a concourse one would think we could n't fail to see the proprietor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 10]: `` Several hundred proprietors today , '' Eugene suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 17]: `` No ; they 're only proprietors of the university , '' said George 's uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 12]: `` We 're looking for the proprietor of the universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 6]: `` There he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 11]: cried Isabel fondly , not minding this satire at all .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 9]: `` And does n't he look it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 85]: Her escorts were still laughing at her when they joined the proprietor of the universe and his pretty friend , and though both Amberson and Eugene declined to explain the cause of their mirth , even upon Lucy 's urgent request , the portents of the day were amiable , and the five made a happy party -- that is to say , four of them made a happy audience for the fifth , and the mood of this fifth was gracious and cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 55]: George took no conspicuous part in either the academic or the social celebrations of his class ; he seemed to regard both sets of exercises with a tolerant amusement , his own `` crowd '' `` not going in much for either of those sorts of things , '' as he explained to Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 43]: What his crowd had gone in for remained ambiguous ; some negligent testimony indicating that , except for an astonishing reliability which they all seemed to have attained in matters relating to musical comedy , they had not gone in for anything .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 51]: Certainly the question one of them put to Lucy , in response to investigations of hers , seemed to point that way : `` Do n't you think , '' he said , `` really , do n't you think that being things is rather better than doing things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 28]: He said `` rahthuh bettuh '' for `` rather better , '' and seemed to do it deliberately , with perfect knowledge of what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 23]: Later , Lucy mocked him to George , and George refused to smile : he somewhat inclined to such pronunciations , himself .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 16]: This inclination was one of the things that he had acquired in the four years .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 30]: What else he had acquired , it might have puzzled him to state , had anybody asked him and required a direct reply within a reasonable space of time .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 53]: He had learned how to pass examinations by `` cramming '' ; that is , in three or four days and nights he could get into his head enough of a selected fragment of some scientific or philosophical or literary or linguistic subject to reply plausibly to six questions out of ten .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 33]: He could retain the information necessary for such a feat just long enough to give a successful performance ; then it would evaporate utterly from his brain , and leave him undisturbed .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 44]: George , like his `` crowd , '' not only preferred `` being things '' to `` doing things , '' but had contented himself with four years of `` being things '' as a preparation for going on `` being things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 63]: And when Lucy rather shyly pressed him for his friend 's probable definition of the `` things '' it seemed so superior and beautiful to be , George raised his eyebrows slightly , meaning that she should have understood without explanation ; but he did explain : `` Oh , family and all that -- being a gentleman , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 13]: Lucy gave the horizon a long look , but offered no comment .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 32]: Chapter XVI `` Aunt Fanny does n't look much better , '' George said to his mother , a few minutes after their arrival , on the night they got home .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 27]: He stood with a towel in her doorway , concluding some sketchy ablutions before going downstairs to a supper which Fanny was hastily preparing for them .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 33]: Isabel had not telegraphed ; Fanny was taken by surprise when they drove up in a station cab at eleven o'clock ; and George instantly demanded `` a little decent food . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 19]: -LRB- Some criticisms of his had publicly disturbed the composure of the dining-car steward four hours previously . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 25]: `` I never saw anybody take things so hard as she seems to , '' he observed , his voice muffled by the towel .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 10]: `` Does n't she get over it at all ?
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 27]: I thought she 'd feel better when we turned over the insurance to her -- gave it to her absolutely , without any strings to it .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 9]: She looks about a thousand years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 15]: `` She looks quite girlish , sometimes , though , '' his mother said .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 21]: `` Has she looked that way much since father -- '' `` Not so much , '' Isabel said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 11]: `` But she will , as times goes on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 24]: `` Time 'll have to hurry , then , it seems to me , '' George observed , returning to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 34]: When they went down to the dining room , he pronounced acceptable the salmon salad , cold beef , cheese , and cake which Fanny made ready for them without disturbing the servants .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 38]: The journey had fatigued Isabel , she ate nothing , but sat to observe with tired pleasure the manifestations of her son 's appetite , meanwhile giving her sister-in-law a brief summary of the events of commencement .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 37]: But presently she kissed them both good-night -- taking care to kiss George lightly upon the side of his head , so as not to disturb his eating -- and left aunt and nephew alone together .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 24]: `` It never was becoming to her to look pale , '' Fanny said absently , a few moments after Isabel 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 10]: `` Wha 'd you say , Aunt Fanny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 10]: I suppose your mother 's been being pretty gay ?
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 5]: Going a lot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 6]: `` How could she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 4]: George asked cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 18]: `` In mourning , of course all she could do was just sit around and look on .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 15]: That 's all Lucy could do either , for the matter of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 10]: `` I suppose so , '' his aunt assented .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 8]: `` How did Lucy get home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 6]: George regarded her with astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 16]: `` Why , on the train with the rest of us , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 11]: `` I did n't mean that , '' Fanny explained .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 7]: `` I meant from the station .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 15]: Did you drive out to their house with her before you came here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 11]: She drove home with her father , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 6]: `` Oh , I see .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 11]: So Eugene came to the station to meet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 6]: `` To meet us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 11]: George echoed , renewing his attack upon the salmon salad .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 6]: `` How could he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 24]: `` I do n't know what you mean , '' Fanny said drearily , in the desolate voice that had become her habit .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 14]: `` I have n't seen him while your mother 's been away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 7]: `` Naturally , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 8]: `` He 's been East himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 9]: At this Fanny 's drooping eyelids opened wide .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 7]: `` Did you see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 15]: `` Well , naturally , since he made the trip home with us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 5]: `` He did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 4]: she said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 11]: `` He 's been with you all the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 16]: `` No ; only on the train and the last three days before we left .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 8]: Uncle George got him to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 30]: Fanny 's eyelids drooped again , and she sat silent until George pushed back his chair and lit a cigarette , declaring his satisfaction with what she had provided .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 12]: `` You 're a fine housekeeper , '' he said benevolently .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 17]: `` You know how to make things look dainty as well as taste the right way .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 31]: I do n't believe you 'd stay single very long if some of the bachelors and widowers around town could just once see -- '' She did not hear him .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 11]: `` It 's a little odd , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 6]: `` What 's odd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 15]: `` Your mother 's not mentioning that Mr. Morgan had been with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 41]: `` Did n't think of it , I suppose , '' said George carelessly ; and , his benevolent mood increasing , he conceived the idea that a little harmless rallying might serve to elevate his aunt 's drooping spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 15]: `` I 'll tell you something , in confidence , '' he said solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 6]: She looked up , startled .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 30]: `` Well , it struck me that Mr. Morgan was looking pretty absent-minded , most of the time ; and he certainly is dressing better than he used to .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 22]: Uncle George told me he heard that the automobile factory had been doing quite well -- won a race , too !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 29]: I should n't be a bit surprised if all the young fellow had been waiting for was to know he had an assured income before he proposed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 8]: `` What ` young fellow ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 53]: `` This young fellow Morgan , '' laughed George ; `` Honestly , Aunt Fanny , I should n't be a bit surprised to have him request an interview with me any day , and declare that his intentions are honourable , and ask my permission to pay his addresses to you .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 8]: What had I better tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 5]: Fanny burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 3]: George cried .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 6]: `` I was only teasing .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 31]: I did n't mean -- '' `` Let me alone , '' she said lifelessly ; and , continuing to weep , rose and began to clear away the dishes .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 14]: `` Please , Aunt Fanny -- '' `` Just let me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 4]: George was distressed .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 10]: `` I did n't mean anything , Aunt Fanny !
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 14]: I did n't know you 'd got so sensitive as all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 23]: `` You 'd better go up to bed , '' she said desolately , going on with her work and her weeping .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 14]: `` Anyhow , '' he insisted , `` do let these things wait .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 13]: Let the servants ` tend to the table in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 7]: `` But , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 7]: `` Just let me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 6]: `` Oh , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 8]: George groaned , going to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 4]: There he turned .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 21]: `` See here , Aunt Fanny , there 's not a bit of use your bothering about those dishes tonight .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 20]: What 's the use of a butler and three maids if -- '' `` Just let me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 21]: He obeyed , and could still hear a pathetic sniffing from the dining room as he went up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 28]: he grunted , as he reached his own room ; and his thought was that living with a person so sensitive to kindly raillery might prove lugubrious .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 27]: He whistled , long and low , then went to the window and looked through the darkness to the great silhouette of his grandfather 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 21]: Lights were burning over there , upstairs ; probably his newly arrived uncle was engaged in talk with the Major .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 23]: George 's glance lowered , resting casually upon the indistinct ground , and he beheld some vague shapes , unfamiliar to him .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 31]: Formless heaps , they seemed ; but , without much curiosity , he supposed that sewer connections or water pipes might be out of order , making necessary some excavations .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 29]: He hoped the work would not take long ; he hated to see that sweep of lawn made unsightly by trenches and lines of dirt , even temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 27]: Not greatly disturbed , however , he pulled down the shade , yawned , and began to , undress , leaving further investigation for the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 29]: But in the morning he had forgotten all about it , and raised his shade , to let in the light , without even glancing toward the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 21]: Not until he had finished dressing did he look forth from his window , and then his glance was casual .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 18]: The next instant his attitude became electric , and he gave utterance to a bellow of dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 42]: He ran from his room , plunged down the stairs , out of the front door , and , upon a nearer view of the destroyed lawn , began to release profanity upon the breezeless summer air , which remained unaffected .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 31]: Between his mother 's house and his grandfather 's , excavations for the cellars of five new houses were in process , each within a few feet of its neighbour .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 24]: Foundations of brick were being laid ; everywhere were piles of brick and stacked lumber , and sand heaps and mortar ' beds .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 50]: It was Sunday , and so the workmen implicated in these defacings were denied what unquestionably ; they would have considered a treat ; but as the fanatic orator continued the monologue , a gentleman in flannels emerged upward from one of the excavations , and regarded him contemplatively .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 8]: `` Obtaining any relief , nephew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 6]: he inquired with some interest .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 30]: `` You must have learned quite a number of those expressions in childhood -- it 's so long since I 'd heard them I fancied they were obsolete . ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 7]: `` Who would n't swear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 4]: George demanded hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 17]: `` In the name of God , what does grandfather mean , doing such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 26]: `` My private opinion is , '' said Amberson gravely , `` he desires to increase his income by building these houses to rent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 22]: `` Well , in the name of God , ca n't he increase his income any other way but this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 15]: `` In the name of God , it would appear he could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 5]: `` It 's beastly !
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 6]: It 's a damn degradation !
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 6]: It 's a crime ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 24]: `` I do n't know about its being a crime , '' said his uncle , stepping over some planks to join him .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 9]: `` It might be a mistake , though .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 21]: Your mother said not to tell you until we got home , so as not to spoil commencement for you .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 9]: She rather feared you 'd be upset . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 3]: `` Upset !
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 13]: Oh , my Lord , I should think I would be upset !
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 7]: He 's in his second childhood .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 32]: What did you let him do it for , in the name of -- '' `` Make it in the name of heaven this time , George ; it 's Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: Well , I thought , myself , it was a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 7]: `` I should say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 16]: `` I wanted him to put up an apartment building instead of these houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 5]: `` An apartment building !
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 3]: Here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 9]: `` Yes ; that was my idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 7]: George struck his hands together despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 5]: `` An apartment house !
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 6]: Oh , my Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 5]: `` Do n't worry !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 18]: Your grandfather would n't listen to me , but he 'll wish he had , some day .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 31]: He says that people are n't going to live in miserable little flats when they can get a whole house with some grass in front and plenty of backyard behind .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 59]: He sticks it out that apartment houses will never do in a town of this type , and when I pointed out to him that a dozen or so of 'em already are doing , he claimed it was just the novelty , and that they 'd all be empty as soon as people got used to 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: So he 's putting up these houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 11]: `` Is he getting miserly in his old age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 3]: `` Hardly !
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 9]: Look what he gave Sydney and Amelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 17]: `` I do n't mean he 's a miser , of course , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 32]: `` Heaven knows he 's liberal enough with mother and me ; but why on earth did n't he sell something or other rather than do a thing like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 28]: `` As a matter of fact , '' Amberson returned coolly , `` I believe he has sold something or other , from time to time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 21]: `` Well , in heaven 's name , '' George cried , `` what did he do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 11]: `` To get money , '' his uncle mildly replied .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 7]: `` That 's my deduction . ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 12]: `` I suppose you 're joking -- or trying to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 16]: `` That 's the best way to look at it , '' Amberson said amiably .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 29]: `` Take the whole thing as a joke -- and in the meantime , if you have n't had your breakfast -- '' `` I have n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 14]: `` Then if I were you I 'd go in and gets some .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 27]: And '' -- he paused , becoming serious -- `` and if I were you I would n't say anything to your grandfather about this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 20]: `` I do n't think I could trust myself to speak to him about it , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 34]: `` I want to treat him respectfully , because he is my grandfather , but I do n't believe I could if I talked to him about such a thing as this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 45]: And with a gesture of despair , plainly signifying that all too soon after leaving bright college years behind him he had entered into the full tragedy of life , George turned bitterly upon his heel and went into the house for his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 30]: His uncle , with his head whimsically upon one side , gazed after him not altogether unsympathetically , then descended again into the excavation whence he had lately emerged .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 53]: Being a philosopher he was not surprised , that afternoon , in the course of a drive he took in the old carriage with the Major , when , George was encountered upon the highway , flashing along in his runabout with Lucy beside him and Pendennis doing better than three minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 20]: `` He seems to have recovered , '' Amberson remarked : `` Looks in the highest good spirits . ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 8]: `` Your grandson , '' Amberson explained .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 21]: `` He was inclined to melancholy this morning , but seemed jolly enough just now when they passed us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 7]: `` What was he melancholy about ?
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 17]: Not getting remorseful about all the money he 's spent at college , was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 10]: The Major chuckled feebly , but with sufficient grimness .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 16]: `` I wonder what he thinks I 'm made of , '' he concluded querulously .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 24]: `` Gold , '' his son suggested , adding gently , `` And he 's right about part of you , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 5]: `` What part ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 5]: `` Your heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 5]: The Major laughed ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 16]: `` I suppose that may account for how heavy it feels , sometimes , nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 24]: This town seems to be rolling right over that old heart you mentioned , George -- rolling over it and burying it under !
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 24]: When I think of those devilish workmen digging up my lawn , yelling around my house -- '' `` Never mind , father .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 6]: Do n't think of it .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 17]: When things are a nuisance it 's a good idea not to keep remembering 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 12]: `` I try not to , '' the old gentleman murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 17]: `` I try to keep remembering that I wo n't be remembering anything very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 21]: And , somehow convinced that this thought was a mirthful one , he laughed loudly , and slapped his knee .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: `` Not so very long now , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 10]: he chuckled , continuing to echo his own amusement .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 6]: `` Not so very long .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 6]: Not so very long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 60]: Chapter XVII Young George paid his respects to his grandfather the following morning , having been occupied with various affairs and engagements on Sunday until after the Major 's bedtime ; and topics concerned with building or excavations were not introduced into the conversation , which was a cheerful one until George lightly mentioned some new plans of his .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 37]: He was a skillful driver , as the Major knew , and he spoke of his desire to extend his proficiency in this art : in fact , be entertained the ambition to drive a four-in-hand .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 50]: However , as the Major said nothing , and merely sat still , looking surprised , George went on to say that he did not propose to `` go in for coaching just at the start '' ; he thought it would be better to begin with a tandem .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 52]: He was sure Pendennis could be trained to work as a leader ; and all that one needed to buy at present , he said , would be `` comparatively inexpensive -- a new trap , and the harness , of course , and a good bay to match Pendennis . ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 16]: He did not care for a special groom ; one of the stablemen would do .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 9]: At this point the Major decided to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 11]: `` You say one of the stablemen would do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 12]: he inquired , his widened eyes remaining fixed upon his grandson .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 18]: `` That 's lucky , because one 's all there is , just at present , George .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 7]: Old fat Tom does it all .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 14]: Did n't you notice , when you took Pendennis out , yesterday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 11]: `` Oh , that will be all right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 9]: My mother can lend me her man . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 5]: `` Can she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 6]: The old gentleman smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 8]: `` I wonder -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 6]: `` What , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 13]: `` Whether you might n't care to go to law-school somewhere perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 16]: I 'd be glad to set aside a sum that would see you through . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 12]: This senile divergence from the topic in hand surprised George painfully .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 14]: `` I have no interest whatever in the law , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 22]: `` I do n't care for it , and the idea of being a professional man has never appealed to me .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 28]: None of the family has ever gone in for that sort of thing , to my knowledge , and I do n't care to be the first .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 21]: I was speaking of driving a tandem -- '' `` I know you were , '' the Major said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 4]: George looked hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 18]: Of course if the idea does n't appeal to you -- '' And he rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 13]: The Major ran a tremulous hand through his hair , sighing deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 18]: `` I -- I do n't like to refuse you anything , Georgie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 35]: `` I do n't know that I often have refused you whatever you wanted -- in reason -- '' `` You 've always been more than generous , sir , '' George interrupted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 31]: `` And if the idea of a tandem does n't appeal to you , why -- of course -- '' And he waved his hand , heroically dismissing the tandem .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 7]: The Major 's distress became obvious .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 28]: `` Georgie , I 'd like to , but -- but I 've an idea tandems are dangerous to drive , and your mother might be anxious .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 12]: She -- '' `` No , sir ; I think not .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 20]: She felt it would be rather a good thing -- help to keep me out in the open air .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 24]: But if perhaps your finances -- '' `` Oh , it is n't that so much , '' the old gentleman said hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 10]: `` I was n't thinking of that altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 4]: He laughed uncomfortably .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 32]: `` I guess we could still afford a new horse or two , if need be -- '' `` I thought you said -- '' The Major waved his hand airily .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 43]: `` Oh , a few retrenchments where things were useless ; nothing gained by a raft of idle darkies in the stable -- nor by a lot of extra land that might as well be put to work for us in rentals .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 27]: And if you want this thing so very much -- '' `` It 's not important enough to bother about , really , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 20]: `` Well , let 's wait till autumn then , '' said the Major in a tone of relief .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 21]: `` We 'll see about it in the autumn , if you 're still in the mind for it then .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 8]: That will be a great deal better .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 13]: You remind me of it , along in September -- or October .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 9]: We 'll see what can be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 6]: He rubbed his hands cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 14]: `` We 'll see what can be done about it then , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 5]: We 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 15]: And George , in reporting this conversation to his mother , was ruefully humorous .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 32]: `` In fact , the old boy cheered up so much , '' he told her , `` you 'd have thought he 'd got a real load off his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 29]: He seemed to think he 'd fixed me up perfectly , and that I was just as good as driving a tandem around his library right that minute !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 26]: Of course I know he 's anything but miserly ; still I ca n't help thinking he must be salting a lot of money away .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 38]: I know prices are higher than they used to be , but he does n't spend within thousands of what he used to , and we certainly ca n't be spending more than we always have spent .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 7]: Where does it all go to ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 19]: Uncle George told me grandfather had sold some pieces of property , and it looks a little queer .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 26]: If he 's really ` property poor , ' of course we ought to be more saving than we are , and help him out .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 18]: I do n't mind giving up a tandem if it seems a little too expensive just now .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 18]: I 'm perfectly willing to live quietly till he gets his bank balance where he wants it .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 32]: But I have a faint suspicion , not that he 's getting miserly -- not that at all -- but that old age has begun to make him timid about money .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 25]: There 's no doubt about it , he 's getting a little queer : he ca n't keep his mind on a subject long .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 39]: Right in the middle of talking about one thing he 'll wander off to something else ; and I should n't be surprised if he turned out to be a lot better off than any of us guess .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 22]: It 's entirely possible that whatever he 's sold just went into government bonds , or even his safety deposit box .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 32]: There was a friend of mine in college had an old uncle like that : made the whole family think he was poor as dirt -- and then left seven millions .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 23]: People get terribly queer as they get old , sometimes , and grandfather certainly does n't act the way he used to .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 9]: He seems to be a totally different man .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 19]: For instance , he said he thought tandem driving might be dangerous -- '' `` Did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 4]: Isabel asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 14]: `` Then I 'm glad he does n't want you to have one .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: I did n't dream -- '' `` But it 's not .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: There is n't the slightest -- '' Isabel had a bright idea .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 3]: `` Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 18]: Instead of a tandem would n't it interest you to get one of Eugene 's automobiles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: `` I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 8]: They 're fast enough , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 29]: In fact , running one of those things is getting to be quite on the cards for sport , and people go all over the country in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 41]: But they 're dirty things , and they keep getting out of order , so that you 're always lying down on your back in the mud , and -- '' `` Oh , no , '' she interrupted eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 6]: `` Have n't you noticed ?
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 39]: You do n't see nearly so many people doing that nowadays as you did two or three years ago , and , when you do , Eugene says it 's apt to be one of the older patterns .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 19]: The way they make them now , you can get at most of the machinery from the top .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 11]: I do think you 'd be interested , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 4]: George remained indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 9]: `` Possibly -- but I hardly think so .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 24]: I know a lot of good people are really taking them up , but still -- '' `` But still ' what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 6]: she said as he paused .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 34]: `` But still -- well , I suppose I 'm a little old-fashioned and fastidious , but I 'm afraid being a sort of engine driver never will appeal to me , mother .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 30]: It 's exciting , and I 'd like that part of it , but still it does n't seem to me precisely the thing a gentleman ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 9]: Too much overalls and monkey-wrenches and grease ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 18]: `` But Eugene says people are hiring mechanics to do all that sort of thing for them .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 25]: They 're beginning to have them just the way they have coachmen ; and he says it 's developing into quite a profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 26]: `` I know that , mother , of course ; but I 've seen some of these mechanics , and they 're not very satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 49]: For one thing , most of them only pretend to understand the machinery and they let people break down a hundred miles from nowhere , so that about all these fellows are good for is to hunt up a farmer and hire a horse to pull the automobile .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 31]: And friends of mine at college that 've had a good deal of experience tell me the mechanics who do understand the engines have no training at all as servants .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 4]: They 're awful !
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 19]: They say anything they like , and usually speak to members of the family as ` Say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 17]: No , I believe I 'd rather wait for September and a tandem , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 33]: Nevertheless , George sometimes consented to sit in an automobile , while waiting for September , and he frequently went driving in one of Eugene 's cars with Lucy and her father .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 44]: He even allowed himself to be escorted with his mother and Fanny through the growing factory , which was now , as the foreman of the paint shop informed the visitors , `` turning out a car and a quarter a day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 28]: George had seldom been more excessively bored , but his mother showed a lively interest in everything , wishing to have all the machinery explained to her .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 40]: It was Lucy who did most of the explaining , while her father looked on and laughed at the mistakes she made , and Fanny remained in the background with George , exhibiting a bleakness that overmatched his boredom .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 69]: From the factory Eugene took them to lunch at a new restaurant , just opened in the town , a place which surprised Isabel with its metropolitan air , and , though George made fun of it to her , in a whisper , she offered everything the tribute of pleased exclamations ; and her gayety helped Eugene 's to make the little occasion almost a festive one .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 20]: George 's ennui disappeared in spite of himself , and he laughed to see his mother in such spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 19]: `` I did n't know mineral waters could go to a person 's head , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 8]: `` Or perhaps it 's this place .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 20]: It might pay to have a new restaurant opened somewhere in town every time you get the blues . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 9]: Fanny turned to him with a wan smile .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 15]: `` Oh , she does n't ` get the blues , ' George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 27]: Then she added , as if fearing her remark might be thought unpleasantly significant , `` I never knew a person of a more even disposition .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 9]: I wish I could be like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 27]: And though the tone of this afterthought was not so enthusiastic as she tried to make it , she succeeded in producing a fairly amiable effect .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 18]: `` No , '' Isabel said , reverting to George 's remark , and overlooking Fanny 's .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 14]: `` What makes me laugh so much at nothing is Eugene 's factory .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 84]: Would n't anybody be delighted to see an old friend take an idea out of the air like that -- an idea that most people laughed at him for -- would n't any old friend of his be happy to see how he 'd made his idea into such a splendid , humming thing as that factory -- all shiny steel , clicking and buzzing away , and with all those workmen , such muscled looking men and yet so intelligent looking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 3]: `` Hear !
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 3]: Hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 3]: George applauded .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 11]: `` We seem to have a lady orator among us .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 9]: I hope the waiters wo n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 6]: Isabel laughed , not discouraged .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 14]: `` It 's beautiful to see such a thing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 12]: `` It makes us all happy , dear old Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 17]: And with a brave gesture she stretched out her hand to him across the small table .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 31]: He took it quickly , giving her a look in which his laughter tried to remain , but vanished before a gratitude threatening to become emotional in spite of him .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 9]: Isabel , however , turned instantly to Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 24]: `` Give him your hand , Fanny , '' she said gayly ; and , as Fanny mechanically obeyed , `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 3]: Isabel cried .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 22]: `` If brother George were here , Eugene would have his three oldest and best friends congratulating him all at once .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 11]: We know what brother George thinks about it , though .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 8]: It 's just beautiful , Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 55]: Probably if her brother George had been with them at the little table , he would have made known what he thought about herself , for it must inevitably have struck him that she was in the midst of one of those `` times '' when she looked `` exactly fourteen years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 28]: Lucy served as a proxy for Amberson , perhaps , when she leaned toward George and whispered : `` Did you ever see anything so lovely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 5]: `` As what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 20]: George inquired , not because he misunderstood , but because he wished to prolong the pleasant neighbourliness of whispering .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 5]: `` As your mother !
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 6]: Think of her doing that !
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 5]: She 's a darling !
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 30]: And papa '' -- here she imperfectly repressed a tendency to laugh -- `` papa looks as if he were either going to explode or utter loud sobs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 14]: Eugene commanded his features , however , and they resumed their customary apprehensiveness .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 25]: `` I used to write verse , '' he said -- `` if you remember -- '' `` Yes , '' Isabel interrupted gently .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 5]: `` I remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 20]: `` I do n't recall that I 've written any for twenty years or so , '' he continued .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 27]: `` But I 'm almost thinking I could do it again , to thank you for making a factory visit into such a kind celebration . ''
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 4]: `` Gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 5]: Lucy whispered , giggling .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 17]: `` Are n't they sentimental '' `` People that age always are , '' George returned .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 9]: `` They get sentimental over anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 11]: Factories or restaurants , it does n't matter what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 29]: And both of them were seized with fits of laughter which they managed to cover under the general movement of departure , as Isabel had risen to go .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 47]: Outside , upon the crowded street , George helped Lucy into his runabout , and drove off , waving triumphantly , and laughing at Eugene who was struggling with the engine of his car , in the tonneau of which Isabel and Fanny had established themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 26]: `` Looks like a hand-organ man grinding away for pennies , '' said George , as the runabout turned the corner and into National Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: `` I 'll still take a horse , any day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 89]: He was not so cocksure , half an hour later , on an open road , when a siren whistle wailed behind him , and before the sound had died away , Eugene 's car , coming from behind with what seemed fairly like one long leap , went by the runabout and dwindled almost instantaneously in perspective , with a lace handkerchief in a black-gloved hand fluttering sweet derision as it was swept onward into minuteness -- a mere white speck -- and then out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 5]: George was undoubtedly impressed .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 19]: `` Your Father does know how to drive some , '' the dashing exhibition forced him to admit .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 23]: `` Of course Pendennis is n't as young as he was , and I do n't care to push him too hard .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 37]: I would n't mind handling one of those machines on the road like that , myself , if that was all there was to it -- no cranking to do , or fooling with the engine .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 15]: Well , I enjoyed part of that lunch quite a lot , Lucy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 5]: `` The salad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 6]: Your whispering to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 4]: `` Blarney ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 12]: George made no response , but checked Pendennis to a walk .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 12]: Whereupon Lucy protested quickly : `` Oh , do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 11]: Do you want him to trot his legs off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 15]: `` No , but -- '' `` No , but ' -- what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 32]: She spoke with apparent gravity : `` I know when you make him walk it 's so you can give all your attention to -- to proposing to me again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 25]: And as she turned a face of exaggerated color to him , `` By the Lord , but you 're a little witch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 3]: George cried .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 10]: `` George , do let Pendennis trot again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 6]: `` I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 6]: She clucked to the horse .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 6]: `` Get up , Pendennis !
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 2]: Trot !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 3]: Go on !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 3]: Commence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 18]: Pendennis paid no attention ; she meant nothing to him , and George laughed at her fondly .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 13]: `` You are the prettiest thing in this world , Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 84]: `` When I see you in winter , in furs , with your cheeks red , I think you 're prettiest then , but when I see you in summer , in a straw hat and a shirtwaist and a duck skirt and white gloves and those little silver buckled slippers , and your rose-coloured parasol , and your cheeks not red but with a kind of pinky glow about them , then I see I must have been wrong about the winter !
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 18]: When are you going to drop the ` almost ' and say we 're really engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 7]: `` Oh , not for years !
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 13]: So there 's the answer , and Let 's trot again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 18]: But George was persistent ; moreover , he had become serious during the last minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: `` I want to know , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 7]: `` I really mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 16]: `` Let 's do n't be serious , George , '' she begged him hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 9]: `` Let 's talk of something pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 6]: He was a little offended .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 18]: `` Then it is n't pleasant for you to know that I want to marry you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 29]: At this she became as serious as he could have asked ; she looked down , and her lip quivered like that of a child about to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 19]: Suddenly she put her hand upon one of his for just an instant , and then withdrew it .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 4]: `` Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 4]: he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 8]: `` Dear , what 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 10]: You look as if you were going to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 24]: You always do that , '' he went on plaintively , `` whenever I can get you to talk about marrying me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 9]: `` I know it , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 8]: `` Well , why do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 23]: Her eyelids flickered , and then she looked up at him with a sad gravity , tears seeming just at the poise .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 18]: `` One reason 's because I have a feeling that it 's never going to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 8]: `` It 's just a feeling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 17]: `` You have n't any reason or -- '' `` It 's just a feeling . ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 30]: `` Well , if that 's all , '' George said , reassured , and laughing confidently , `` I guess I wo n't be very much troubled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 14]: But at once he became serious again , adopting the tone of argument .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 28]: `` Lucy , how is anything ever going to get a chance to come of it , so long as you keep sticking to ` almost ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 39]: Does n't it strike you as unreasonable to have a ` feeling ' that we 'll never be married , when what principally stands between us is the fact that you wo n't be really engaged to me ?
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 6]: That does seem pretty absurd !
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 12]: Do n't you care enough about me to marry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 8]: She looked down again , pathetically troubled .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 12]: `` Wo n't you always care that much about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 13]: `` I 'm -- yes -- I 'm afraid so , George .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 9]: I never do change much about anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 19]: `` Well , then , why in the world wo n't you drop the ` almost ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 4]: Her distress increased .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 15]: `` Everything is -- everything -- '' `` What about ` everything ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 9]: `` Everything is so -- so unsettled . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 10]: And at that he uttered an exclamation of impatience .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 9]: `` If you are n't the queerest girl !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 7]: What is ` unsettled ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 28]: `` Well , for one thing , '' she said , able to smile at his vehemence , `` you have n't settled on anything to do .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 14]: At least , if you have you 've never spoken of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 23]: As she spoke , she gave him the quickest possible side glance of hopeful scrutiny ; then looked away , not happily .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 28]: Surprise and displeasure were intentionally visible upon the countenance of her companion ; and he permitted a significant period of silence to elapse before making any response .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 25]: `` Lucy , '' he said , finally , with cold dignity , `` I should like to ask you a few questions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 26]: `` The first is : Have n't you perfectly well understood that I do n't mean to go into business or adopt a profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 12]: `` I was n't quite sure , '' she said gently .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 10]: `` I really did n't know -- quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 12]: `` Then of course it 's time I did tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 41]: I never have been able to see any occasion for a man 's going into trade , or being a lawyer , or any of those things if his position and family were such that he did n't need to .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 46]: You know , yourself , there are a lot of people in the East -- in the South , too , for that matter -- that do n't think we 've got any particular family or position or culture in this part of the country .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 18]: I 've met plenty of that kind of provincial snobs myself , and they 're pretty galling .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 36]: There were one or two men in my crowd at college , their families had lived on their income for three generations , and they never dreamed there was anybody in their class out here .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 24]: I had to show them a thing or two , right at the start , and I guess they wo n't forget it !
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 26]: Well , I think it 's time all their sort found out that three generations can mean just as much out here as anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 21]: That 's the way I feel about it , and let me tell you I feel it pretty deeply ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 12]: `` But what are you going to do , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 16]: George 's earnestness surpassed hers ; he had become flushed and his breathing was emotional .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 29]: As he confessed , with simple genuineness , he did feel what he was saying `` pretty deeply '' ; and in truth his state approached the tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 13]: `` I expect to live an honourable life , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 20]: `` I expect to contribute my share to charities , and to take part in -- in movements . ''
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 5]: `` What kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 10]: `` Whatever appeals to me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 8]: Lucy looked at him with grieved wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 18]: `` But you really do n't mean to have any regular business or profession at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 7]: `` I certainly do not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: George returned promptly and emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 14]: `` I was afraid so , '' she said in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 12]: George continued to breathe deeply throughout another protracted interval of silence .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 25]: Then he said , `` I should like to revert to the questions I was asking you , if you do n't mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 5]: `` No , George .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 28]: I think we 'd better -- '' `` Your father is a business man -- '' `` He 's a mechanical genius , '' Lucy interrupted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 7]: `` Of course he 's both .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 16]: And he was a lawyer once -- he 's done all sorts of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 23]: I merely wished to ask if it 's his influence that makes you think I ought to ` do ' something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 4]: Lucy frowned slightly .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 23]: `` Why , I suppose almost everything I think or say must be owing to his influence in one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 30]: We have n't had anybody but each other for so many years , and we always think about alike , so of course -- '' `` I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 8]: And George 's brow darkened with resentment .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 9]: `` So that 's it , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 28]: It 's your father 's idea that I ought to go into business and that you ought n't to be engaged to me until I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 11]: Lucy gave a start , her denial was so quick .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 10]: I 've never once spoken to him about it .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 3]: Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 18]: George looked at her keenly , and he jumped to a conclusion not far from the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 19]: `` But you know without talking to him that it 's the way he does feel about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 4]: I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 4]: She nodded gravely .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 7]: George 's brow grew darker still .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 35]: `` Do you think I 'd be much of a man , '' he said , slowly , `` if I let any other man dictate to me my own way of life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 3]: `` George !
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 19]: Who 's ` dictating ' your -- '' `` It seems to me it amounts to that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 9]: I only know how papa thinks about things .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 16]: He 's never , never spoken unkindly , or ` dictatingly ' of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 25]: She lifted her hand in protest , and her face was so touching in its distress that for the moment George forgot his anger .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 8]: He seized that small , troubled hand .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 8]: `` Lucy , '' he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 11]: `` Do n't you know that I love you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 7]: `` Yes -- I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 8]: `` Do n't you love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 7]: `` Yes -- I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 19]: `` Then what does it matter what your father thinks about my doing something or not doing anything ?
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 10]: He has his way , and I have mine .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 18]: I do n't believe in the whole world scrubbing dishes and selling potatoes and trying law cases .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 39]: Why , look at your father 's best friend , my Uncle George Amberson -- he 's never done anything in his life , and -- '' `` Oh , yes , he has , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 7]: `` He was in politics . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 14]: `` Well , I 'm glad he 's out , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 19]: `` Politics is a dirty business for a gentleman , and Uncle George would tell you that himself .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 11]: Lucy , let 's not talk any more about it .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 13]: Let me tell mother when I get home that we 're engaged .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 7]: Wo n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 21]: `` Is it because -- '' For a fleeting instant she touched to her cheek the hand that held hers .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 18]: `` No , '' she said , and gave him a sudden little look of renewed gayety .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 11]: `` Let 's let it stay ` almost ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 15]: `` Because your father -- '' `` Oh , because it 's better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 5]: George 's voice shook .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 8]: `` Is n't it your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 13]: `` It 's his ideals I 'm thinking of -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 11]: George dropped her hand abruptly and anger narrowed his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 11]: `` I know what you mean , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 22]: `` I dare say I do n't care for your father 's ideals any more than he does for mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 49]: He tightened the reins , Pendennis quickening eagerly to the trot ; and when George jumped out of the runabout before Lucy 's gate , and assisted her to descend , the silence in which they parted was the same that had begun when Pendennis began to trot .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 21]: Chapter XVIII That evening , after dinner , George sat with his mother and his Aunt Fanny upon the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 74]: In former summers , when they sat outdoors in the evening , they had customarily used an open terrace at the side of the house , looking toward the Major 's , but that more private retreat now afforded too blank and abrupt a view of the nearest of the new houses ; so , without consultation , they had abandoned it for the Romanesque stone structure in front , an oppressive place .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 43]: Its oppression seemed congenial to George ; he sat upon the copestone of the stone parapet , his back against a stone pilaster ; his attitude not comfortable , but rigid , and his silence not comfortable , either , but heavy .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 36]: However , to the eyes of his mother and his aunt , who occupied wicker chairs at a little distance , he was almost indistinguishable except for the stiff white shield of his evening frontage .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 28]: `` It 's so nice of you always to dress in the evening , Georgie , '' his mother said , her glance resting upon this surface .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 26]: `` Your Uncle George always used to , and so did father , for years ; but they both stopped quite a long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 30]: Unless there 's some special occasion , it seems to me we do n't see it done any more , except on the stage and in the magazines . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 41]: He made no response , and Isabel , after waiting a little while , as if she expected one , appeared to acquiesce in his mood for silence , and turned her head to gaze thoughtfully out at the street .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 16]: There , in the highway , the evening life of the Midland city had begun .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 122]: A rising moon was bright upon the tops of the shade trees , where their branches met overhead , arching across the street , but only filtered splashings of moonlight reached the block pavement below ; and through this darkness flashed the firefly lights of silent bicycles gliding by in pairs and trios -- or sometimes a dozen at a time might come , and not so silent , striking their little bells ; the riders ' voices calling and laughing ; while now and then a pair of invisible experts would pass , playing mandolin and guitar as if handle-bars were of no account in the world -- their music would come swiftly , and then too swiftly die away .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 40]: Surreys rumbled lightly by , with the plod-plod of honest old horses , and frequently there was the glitter of whizzing spokes from a runabout or a sporting buggy , and the sharp , decisive hoof-beats of a trotter .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 69]: Then , like a cowboy shooting up a peaceful camp , a frantic devil would hurtle out of the distance , bellowing , exhaust racketing like a machine gun gone amuck -- and at these horrid sounds the surreys and buggies would hug the curbstone , and the bicycles scatter to cover , cursing ; while children rushed from the sidewalks to drag pet dogs from the street .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 29]: The thing would roar by , leaving a long wake of turbulence ; then the indignant street would quiet down for a few minutes -- till another came .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 33]: `` There are a great many more than there used to be , '' Miss Fanny observed , in her lifeless voice , as the lull fell after one of these visitations .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 38]: `` Eugene is right about that ; there seem to be at least three or four times as many as there were last summer , and you never hear the ragamuffins shouting ` Get a horse ! '
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 17]: nowadays ; but I think he may be mistaken about their going on increasing after this .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 17]: I do n't believe we 'll see so many next summer as we do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 3]: asked Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 33]: `` Because I 've begun to agree with George about their being more a fad than anything else , and I think it must be the height of the fad just now .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 32]: You know how roller-skating came in -- everybody in the world seemed to be crowding to the rinks -- and now only a few children use rollers for getting to school .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 12]: Besides , people wo n't permit the automobiles to be used .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 11]: Really , I think they 'll make laws against them .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 18]: You see how they spoil the bicycling and the driving ; people just seem to hate them !
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 11]: They 'll never stand it -- never in the world !
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 43]: Of course I 'd be sorry to see such a thing happen to Eugene , but I should n't be really surprised to see a law passed forbidding the sale of automobiles , just the way there is with concealed weapons . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 4]: `` Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 4]: exclaimed her sister-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 8]: `` You 're not in earnest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 7]: `` I am , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 13]: Isabel 's sweet-toned laugh came out of the dusk where she sat .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 20]: `` Then you did n't mean it when you told Eugene you 'd enjoyed the drive this afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 14]: `` I did n't say it so very enthusiastically , did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 14]: `` Perhaps not , but he certainly thought he 'd pleased you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 21]: `` I do n't think I gave him any right to think he 'd pleased me '' Fanny said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 8]: Why should n't you , Fanny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 25]: Fanny did not reply at once , and when she did , her voice was almost inaudible , but much more reproachful than plaintive .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 20]: `` I hardly think I 'd want any one to get the notion he 'd pleased me just now .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 11]: It hardly seems time , yet -- to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 65]: Isabel made no response , and for a time the only sound upon the dark veranda was the creaking of the wicker rocking-chair in which Fanny sat -- a creaking which seemed to denote content and placidity on the part of the chair 's occupant , though at this juncture a series of human shrieks could have been little more eloquent of emotional disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 16]: However , the creaking gave its hearer one great advantage : it could be ignored .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 10]: `` Have you given up smoking , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 4]: Isabel asked presently .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 15]: `` I hoped perhaps you had , because you 've not smoked since dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 10]: We sha n't mind if you care to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 6]: `` No , thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 36]: There was silence again , except for the creaking of the rocking-chair ; then a low , clear whistle , singularly musical , was heard softly rendering an old air from `` Fra Diavolo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 4]: The creaking stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 8]: `` Is that you , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 4]: Fanny asked abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 7]: `` Is that me what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 10]: `` Whistling ` On Yonder Rock Reclining ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 9]: `` It 's I , '' said Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 8]: `` Oh , '' Fanny said dryly .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 7]: `` Does it disturb you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 24]: I had an idea George was depressed about something , and merely wondered if he could be making such a cheerful sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 6]: And Fanny resumed her creaking .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 8]: `` Is she right , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 18]: his mother asked quickly , leaning forward in her chair to peer at him through the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 22]: `` You did n't eat a very hearty dinner , but I thought it was probably because of the warm weather .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 7]: Are you troubled about anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 4]: he said angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 5]: `` That 's good .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 14]: I thought we had such a nice day , did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 29]: `` I suppose so , '' he muttered , and , satisfied , she leaned back in her chair ; but `` Fra Diavolo '' was not revived .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 21]: After a time she rose , went to the steps , and stood for several minutes looking across the street .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: Then her laughter was faintly heard .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 8]: `` Are you laughing about something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 3]: Fanny inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 4]: `` Pardon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 22]: Isabel did not turn , but continued her observation of what had interested her upon the opposite side of the street .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 11]: `` I asked : Were you laughing at something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 7]: `` Yes , I was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 5]: And she laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 11]: `` It 's that funny , fat old Mrs. Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 17]: She has a habit of sitting at her bedroom window with a pair of opera-glasses . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 3]: `` Really .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 21]: You can see the window through the place that was left when we had the dead walnut tree cut down .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 17]: She looks up and down the street , but mostly at father 's and over here .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 27]: Sometimes she forgets to put out the light in her room , and there she is , spying away for all the world to see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 16]: However , Fanny made no effort to observe this spectacle , but continued her creaking .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 16]: `` I 've always thought her a very good woman , '' she said primly .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 9]: `` So she is , '' Isabel agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 56]: `` She 's a good , friendly old thing , a little too intimate in her manner , sometimes , and if her poor old opera-glasses afford her the quiet happiness of knowing what sort of young man our new cook is walking out with , I 'm the last to begrudge it to her !
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 14]: Do n't you want to come and look at her , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 11]: I had n't noticed what you were talking about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 9]: `` It 's nothing , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 13]: `` Only a funny old lady -- and she 's gone now .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 16]: I 'm going , too -- at least , I 'm going indoors to read .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 19]: It 's cooler in the house , but the heat 's really not bad anywhere , since nightfall .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 4]: Summer 's dying .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 12]: How quickly it goes , once it begins to die . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 28]: When she had gone into the house , Fanny stopped rocking , and , leaning forward , drew her black gauze wrap about her shoulders and shivered .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: `` Is n't it queer , '' she said drearily , `` how your mother can use such words ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 9]: `` What words are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 3]: George asked .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 11]: `` Words like ` die ' and ` dying . '
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 23]: I do n't see how she can bear to use them so soon after your poor father -- '' She shivered again .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 28]: `` It 's almost a year , '' George said absently , and he added : `` It seems to me you 're using them yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 3]: Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 7]: `` Yes , you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 6]: `` Just this minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 3]: said Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 10]: `` You mean when I repeated what she said ?
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 10]: That 's hardly the same thing , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 10]: He was not enough interested to argue the point .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 19]: `` I do n't think you 'll convince anybody that mother 's unfeeling , '' he said indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 9]: `` I 'm not trying to convince anybody .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 27]: I mean merely that in my opinion -- well , perhaps it may be just as wise for me to keep my opinions to myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 24]: She paused expectantly , but her possible anticipation that George would urge her to discard wisdom and reveal her opinion was not fulfilled .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 19]: His back was toward her , and he occupied himself with opinions of his own about other matters .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 12]: Fanny may have felt some disappointment as she rose to withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 19]: However , at the last moment she halted with her hand upon the latch of the screen door .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 12]: `` There 's one thing I hope , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 23]: `` I hope at least she wo n't leave off her full mourning on the very anniversary of Wilbur 's death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 14]: The light door clanged behind her , and the sound annoyed her nephew .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 40]: He had no idea why she thus used inoffensive wood and wire to dramatize her departure from the veranda , the impression remaining with him being that she was critical of his mother upon some point of funeral millinery .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 36]: Throughout the desultory conversation he had been profoundly concerned with his own disturbing affairs , and now was preoccupied with a dialogue taking place -LRB- in his mind -RRB- between himself and Miss Lucy Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 15]: As he beheld the vision , Lucy had just thrown herself at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 9]: `` George , you must forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 6]: `` Papa was utterly wrong !
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 34]: I have told him so , and the truth is that I have come to rather dislike him as you do , and as you always have , in your heart of hearts .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 18]: George , I understand you : thy people shall be my people and thy gods my gods .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 10]: George , wo n't you take me back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 11]: `` Lucy , are you sure you understand me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 25]: And in the darkness George 's bodily lips moved in unison with those which uttered the words in his imaginary rendering of this scene .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 30]: An eavesdropper , concealed behind the column , could have heard the whispered word `` sure , '' the emphasis put upon it in the vision was so poignant .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 13]: `` You say you understand me , but are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 22]: Weeping , her head bowed almost to her waist , the ethereal Lucy made reply : `` Oh , so sure !
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 10]: I will never listen to father 's opinions again .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 13]: I do not even care if I never see him again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 11]: `` Then I pardon you , '' he said gently .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 24]: This softened mood lasted for several moments -- until he realized that it had been brought about by processes strikingly lacking in substance .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 16]: Abruptly he swung his feet down from the copestone to the floor of the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 5]: `` Pardon nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 69]: No meek Lucy had thrown herself in remorse at his feet ; and now he pictured her as she probably really was at this moment : sitting on the white steps of her own front porch in the moonlight , with red-headed Fred Kinney and silly Charlie Johnson and four or five others -- all of them laughing , most likely , and some idiot playing the guitar !
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 8]: George spoke aloud : `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 32]: And because of an impish but all too natural reaction of the mind , he could see Lucy with much greater distinctness in this vision than in his former pleasing one .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 17]: For a moment she was miraculously real before him , every line and colour of her .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 100]: He saw the moonlight shimmering in the chiffon of her skirts brightest on her crossed knee and the tip of her slipper ; saw the blue curve of the characteristic shadow behind her , as she leaned back against the white step ; saw the watery twinkling of sequins in the gauze wrap over her white shoulders as she moved , and the faint , symmetrical lights in her black hair -- and not one alluring , exasperating twentieth-of-an-inch of her laughing profile was spared him as she seemed to turn to the infernal Kinney -- `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 10]: And George began furiously to pace the stone floor .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 4]: `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 36]: By this hard term -- a favourite with him since childhood 's scornful hour -- he meant to indicate , not Lucy , but the young gentlemen who , in his vision , surrounded her .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 4]: `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 13]: he said again , aloud , and again : `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 33]: At that moment , as it happened , Lucy was playing chess with her father ; and her heart , though not remorseful , was as heavy as George could have wished .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 24]: But she did not let Eugene see that she was troubled , and he was pleased when he won three games of her .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 5]: Usually she beat him .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 42]: Chapter XIX George went driving the next afternoon alone , and , encountering Lucy and her father on the road , in one of Morgan 's cars , lifted his hat , but nowise relaxed his formal countenance as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 24]: Eugene waved a cordial hand quickly returned to the steering-wheel ; but Lucy only nodded gravely and smiled no more than George did .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 41]: Nor did she accompany Eugene to the Major 's for dinner , the following Sunday evening , though both were bidden to attend that feast , which was already reduced in numbers and gayety by the absence of George Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 15]: Eugene explained to his host that Lucy had gone away to visit a school-friend .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 26]: The information , delivered in the library , just before old Sam 's appearance to announce dinner , set Miss Minafer in quite a flutter .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 6]: `` Why , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 8]: she said , turning to her nephew .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 12]: `` How does it happen you did n't tell us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 40]: And with both hands opening , as if to express her innocence of some conspiracy , she exclaimed to the others , `` He 's never said one word to us about Lucy 's planning to go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 10]: `` Probably afraid to , '' the Major suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 20]: `` Did n't know but he might break down and cry if he tried to speak of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 18]: He clapped his grandson on the shoulder , inquiring jocularly , `` That it , Georgie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 45]: Georgie made no reply , but he was red enough to justify the Major 's developing a chuckle into laughter ; though Miss Fanny , observing her nephew keenly , got an impression that this fiery blush was in truth more fiery than tender .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 35]: She caught a glint in his eye less like confusion than resentment , and saw a dilation of his nostrils which might have indicated not so much a sweet agitation as an inaudible snort .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 24]: Fanny had never been lacking in curiosity , and , since her brother 's death , this quality was more than ever alert .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 50]: The fact that George had spent all the evenings of the past week at home had not been lost upon her , nor had she failed to ascertain , by diplomatic inquiries , that since the day of the visit to Eugene 's shops George had gone driving alone .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 32]: At the dinner-table she continued to observe him , sidelong ; and toward the conclusion of the meal she was not startled by an episode which brought discomfort to the others .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 27]: After the arrival of coffee the Major was rallying Eugene upon some rival automobile shops lately built in a suburb , and already promising to flourish .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 38]: `` I suppose they 'll either drive you out of the business , '' said the old gentleman , `` or else the two of you 'll drive all the rest of us off the streets . ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 29]: `` If we do , we 'll even things up by making the streets five or ten times as long as they are now , '' Eugene returned .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 10]: `` How do you propose to do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 30]: `` It is n't the distance from the center of a town that counts , '' said Eugene ; `` it 's the time it takes to get there .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 32]: This town 's already spreading ; bicycles and trolleys have been doing their share , but the automobile is going to carry city streets clear out to the county line . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 5]: The Major was skeptical .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 8]: `` Dream on , fair son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 40]: `` It 's lucky for us that you 're only dreaming ; because if people go to moving that far , real estate values in the old residence part of town are going to be stretched pretty thin . ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 10]: `` I 'm afraid so , '' Eugene assented .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 23]: `` Unless you keep things so bright and clean that the old section will stay more attractive than the new ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 5]: `` Not very likely !
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 24]: How are things going to be kept ` bright and clean ' with soft coal , and our kind of city government ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 10]: `` They are n't , '' Eugene replied quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 18]: `` There 's no hope of it , and already the boarding-house is marching up National Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 21]: There are two in the next block below here , and there are a dozen in the half-mile below that .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 28]: My relatives , the Sharons , have sold their house and are building in the country -- at least , they call it ` the country . '
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 11]: It will be city in two or three years . ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 8]: the Major exclaimed , affecting ` dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 17]: `` So your little shops are going to ruin all your old friends , Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 22]: `` Unless my old friends take warning in time , or abolish smoke and get a new kind of city government .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 12]: I should say the best chance is to take Warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 4]: the Major laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 20]: `` You have enough faith in miracles , Eugene -- granting that trolleys and bicycles and automobiles are miracles .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 17]: So you think they 're to change the face of the land , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 16]: `` They 're already doing it , Major ; and it ca n't be stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 10]: Automobiles -- '' At this point he was interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 5]: George was the interrupter .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 38]: He had said nothing since entering the dining room , but now he spoke in a loud and peremptory voice , using the tone of one in authority who checks idle prattle and settles a matter forever .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 11]: `` Automobiles are a useless nuisance , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 7]: There fell a moment 's silence .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 30]: Isabel gazed incredulously at George , colour slowly heightening upon her cheeks and temples , while Fanny watched him with a quick eagerness , her eyes alert and bright .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 15]: But Eugene seemed merely quizzical , as if not taking this brusquerie to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 6]: The Major was seriously disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 9]: `` What did you say , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 11]: he asked , though George had spoken but too distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 28]: `` I said all automobiles were a nuisance , '' George answered , repeating not only the words but the tone in which he had uttered them .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 15]: And he added , `` They 'll never amount to anything but a nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 9]: They had no business to be invented . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 4]: The Major frowned .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 20]: `` Of course you forget that Mr. Morgan makes them , and also did his share in inventing them .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 14]: If you were n't so thoughtless he might think you rather offensive . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 12]: `` That would be too bad , '' said George coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 11]: `` I do n't think I could survive it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 16]: Again there was a silence , while the Major stared at his grandson , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 7]: But Eugene began to laugh cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 15]: `` I 'm not sure he 's wrong about automobiles , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 22]: `` With all their speed forward they may be a step backward in civilization -- that is , in spiritual civilization .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 24]: It may be that they will not add to the beauty of the world , nor to the life of men 's souls .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 5]: I am not sure .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 20]: But automobiles have come , and they bring a greater change in our life than most of us suspect .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 20]: They are here , and almost all outward things are going to be different because of what they bring .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 15]: They are going to alter war , and they are going to alter peace .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 27]: I think men 's minds are going to be changed in subtle ways because of automobiles ; just how , though , I could hardly guess .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 38]: But you ca n't have the immense outward changes that they will cause without some inward ones , and it may be that George is right , and that the spiritual alteration will be bad for us .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 52]: Perhaps , ten or twenty years from now , if we can see the inward change in men by that time , I should n't be able to defend the gasoline engine , but would have to agree with him that automobiles ` had no business to be invented . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 29]: He laughed good-naturedly , and looking at his watch , apologized for having an engagement which made his departure necessary when he would so much prefer to linger .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 39]: Then he shook hands with the Major , and bade Isabel , George , and Fanny a cheerful good-night -- a collective farewell cordially addressed to all three of them together -- and left them at the table .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 10]: Isabel turned wondering , hurt eyes upon her son .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 6]: `` George , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 7]: `` What did you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 37]: `` Just what I said , '' he returned , lighting one of the Major 's cigars , and his manner was imperturbable enough to warrant the definition -LRB- sometimes merited by imperturbability -RRB- of stubbornness .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 28]: Isabel 's hand , pale and slender , upon the tablecloth , touched one of the fine silver candlesticks aimlessly : the fingers were seen to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 8]: `` Oh , he was hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 14]: `` I do n't see why he should be , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 9]: `` I did n't say anything about him .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 14]: He did n't seem to me to be hurt -- seemed perfectly cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 9]: What made you think he was hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 6]: `` I know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 9]: was all of her reply , half whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 12]: The Major stared hard at George from under his white eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 14]: `` You did n't mean ` him , ' you say , George ?
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 48]: I suppose if we had a clergyman as a guest here you 'd expect him not to be offended , and to understand that your remarks were neither personal nor untactful , if you said the church was a nuisance and ought never to have been invented .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 10]: By Jove , but you 're a puzzle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 12]: `` In what way , may I ask , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 24]: `` We seem to have a new kind of young people these days , '' the old gentleman returned , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 39]: `` It 's a new style of courting a pretty girl , certainly , for a young fellow to go deliberately out of his way to try and make an enemy of her father by attacking his business !
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 3]: By Jove !
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 11]: That 's a new way to win a woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 25]: George flushed angrily and seemed about to offer a retort , but held his breath for a moment ; and then held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 9]: It was Isabel who responded to the Major .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 13]: `` Eugene would never be anybody 's enemy -- he could n't !
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: -- and last of all Georgie 's .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 38]: I 'm afraid he was hurt , but I do n't fear his not having understood that George spoke without thinking of what he was saying -- I mean , with-out realizing its bearing on Eugene . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 15]: Again George seemed upon the point of speech , and again controlled the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 23]: He thrust his hands in his pockets , leaned back in his chair , and smoked , staring inflexibly at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 12]: `` Well , well , '' said his grandfather , rising .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 11]: `` It was n't a very successful little dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 39]: Thereupon he offered his arm to his daughter , who took it fondly , and they left the room , Isabel assuring him that all his little dinners were pleasant , and that this one was no exception .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 49]: George did not move , and Fanny , following the other two , came round the table , and paused close beside his chair ; but George remained posed in his great imperturbability , cigar between teeth , eyes upon ceiling , and paid no attention to her .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 19]: Fanny waited until the sound of Isabel 's and the Major 's voices became inaudible in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 37]: Then she said quickly , and in a low voice so eager that it was unsteady : `` George , you 've struck just the treatment to adopt : you 're doing the right thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 23]: She hurried out , scurrying after the others with a faint rustling of her black skirts , leaving George mystified but incurious .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 38]: He did not understand why she should bestow her approbation upon him in the matter , and cared so little whether she did or not that he spared himself even the trouble of being puzzled about it .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 17]: In truth , however , he was neither so comfortable nor so imperturbable as he appeared .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 51]: He felt some gratification : he had done a little to put the man in his place -- that man whose influence upon his daughter was precisely the same thing as a contemptuous criticism of George Amberson Minafer , and of George Amberson Minafer 's `` ideals of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 19]: Lucy 's going away without a word was intended , he supposed , as a bit of punishment .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 28]: Well , he was n't the sort of man that people were allowed to punish : he could demonstrate that to them -- since they started it !
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 19]: It appeared to him as almost a kind of insolence , this abrupt departure -- not even telephoning !
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 26]: Probably she wondered how he would take it ; she even might have supposed he would show some betraying chagrin when he heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 23]: He had no idea that this was just what he had shown ; and he was satisfied with his evening 's performance .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 44]: Nevertheless , he was not comfortable in his mind ; though he could not have explained his inward perturbations , for he was convinced , without any confirmation from his Aunt Fanny , that he had done `` just the right thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 49]: Chapter XX Isabel came to George 's door that night , and when she had kissed him good-night she remained in the open doorway with her hand upon his shoulder and her eyes thoughtfully lowered , so that her wish to say something more than good-night was evident .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 27]: Not less obvious was her perplexity about the manner of saying it ; and George , divining her thought , amiably made an opening for her .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 19]: `` Well , old lady , '' he said indulgently , `` you need n't look so worried .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 9]: I wo n't be tactless with Morgan again .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 12]: After this I 'll just keep out of his way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 50]: Isabel looked up , searching his face with the fond puzzlement which her eyes sometimes showed when they rested upon him ; then she glanced down the hall toward Fanny 's room , and , after another moment of hesitation , came quickly in , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 24]: `` Dear , '' she said , `` I wish you 'd tell me something : Why do n't you like Eugene ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 29]: `` Oh , I like him well enough , '' George returned , with a short laugh , as he sat down and began to unlace his shoes .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 12]: `` I like him well enough -- in his place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 10]: `` No , dear , '' she said hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 25]: `` I 've had a feeling from the very first that you did n't really like him -- that you really never liked him .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 63]: Sometimes you 've seemed to be friendly with him , and you 'd laugh with him over something in a jolly , companionable way , and I 'd think I was wrong , and that you really did like him , after all ; but to-night I 'm sure my other feeling was the right one : you do n't like him .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 19]: I ca n't understand it , dear ; I do n't see what can be the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 7]: `` Nothing 's the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 38]: This easy declaration naturally failed to carry great weight , and Isabel went on , in her troubled voice , `` It seems so queer , especially when you feel as you do about his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 14]: At this , George stopped unlacing his shoes abruptly , and sat up .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 10]: `` How do I feel about his daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 18]: `` Well , it 's seemed -- as if -- as if -- '' Isabel began timidly .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 35]: `` It did seem -- At least , you have n't looked at any other girl , ever since they came here and -- and certainly you 've seemed very much interested in her .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 9]: Certainly you 've been very great friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 8]: `` Well , what of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 37]: `` It 's only that I 'm like your grandfather : I ca n't see how you could be so much interested in a girl and -- and not feel very pleasantly toward her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 34]: `` Well , I 'll tell you something , '' George said slowly ; and a frown of concentration could be seen upon his brow , as from a profound effort at self-examination .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 26]: `` I have n't ever thought much on that particular point , but I admit there may be a little something in what you say .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 26]: The truth is , I do n't believe I 've ever thought of the two together , exactly -- at least , not until lately .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 17]: I 've always thought of Lucy just as Lucy , and of Morgan just as Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 17]: I 've always thought of her as a person herself , not as anybody 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 11]: I do n't see what 's very extraordinary about that .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 27]: You 've probably got plenty of friends , for instance , that do n't care much about your son -- '' `` No , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 4]: she protested quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 24]: `` And if I knew anybody who felt like that , I would n't -- '' `` Never mind , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 10]: `` I 'll try to explain a little more .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 23]: If I have a friend , I do n't see that it 's incumbent upon me to like that friend 's relatives .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 17]: If I did n't like them , and pretended to , I 'd be a hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 29]: If that friend likes me and wants to stay my friend ` he 'll have to stand my not liking his relatives , or else he can quit .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 13]: I decline to be a hypocrite about it ; that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 23]: Now , suppose I have certain ideas or ideals which I have chosen for the regulation of my own conduct in life .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 56]: Suppose some friend of mine has a relative with ideals directly the opposite of mine , and my friend believes more in the relative 's ideals than in mine : Do you think I ought to give up my own just to please a person who 's taken up ideals that I really despise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 49]: `` No , dear ; of course people ca n't give up their ideals ; but I do n't see what this has to do with dear little Lucy and -- '' `` I did n't say it had anything to do with them , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 34]: `` I was merely putting a case to show how a person would be justified in being a friend of one member of a family , and feeling anything but friendly toward another .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 15]: I do n't say , though , that I feel unfriendly to Mr. Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 41]: I do n't say that I feel friendly to him , and I do n't say that I feel unfriendly ; but if you really think that I was rude to him to-night -- '' `` Just thoughtless , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 29]: You did n't see that what you said to-night -- '' `` Well , I 'll not say anything of that sort again where he can hear it .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 8]: There , is n't that enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 34]: This question , delivered with large indulgence , met with no response ; for Isabel , still searching his face with her troubled and perplexed gaze , seemed not to have heard it .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 22]: On that account , George repeated it , and rising , went to her and patted her reassuringly upon the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 17]: `` There , old lady , you need n't fear my tactlessness will worry you again .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 38]: I ca n't quite promise to like people I do n't care about one way or another , but you can be sure I 'll be careful , after this , not to let them see it .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 21]: It 's all right , and you 'd better toddle along to bed , because I want to undress . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 23]: `` But , George , '' she said earnestly , `` you would like him , if you 'd just let yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 8]: You say you do n't dislike him .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 7]: Why do n't you like him ?
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 7]: I ca n't understand at all .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 15]: What is it that you do n't -- '' `` There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 12]: `` It 's all right , and you toddle along . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 13]: `` But , George , dear -- '' `` Now , now !
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 9]: I really do want to get into bed .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 6]: Good-night , old lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 5]: `` Good-night , dear .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 17]: But -- '' `` Let 's not talk of it any more , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 15]: `` It 's all right , and nothing in the world to worry about .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 6]: So good-night , old lady .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 19]: I 'll be polite enough to him , never fear -- if we happen to be thrown together .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 4]: So good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 23]: `` But , George , dear -- '' `` I 'm going to bed , old lady ; so good-night . '' '
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 6]: Thus the interview closed perforce .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 32]: She kissed him again before going slowly to her own room , her perplexity evidently not dispersed ; but the subject was not renewed between them the next day or subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 50]: Nor did Fanny make any allusion to the cryptic approbation she had bestowed upon her nephew after the Major 's `` not very successful little dinner '' ; though she annoyed George by looking at him oftener and longer than he cared to be looked at by an aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 40]: He could not glance her way , it seemed , without finding her red-rimmed eyes fixed upon him eagerly , with an alert and hopeful calculation in them which he declared would send a nervous man , into fits .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 18]: For thus , one day , he broke out , in protest : `` It would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 4]: he repeated vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 10]: `` Given time it would -- straight into fits !
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 9]: What do you find the matter with me ?
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 8]: Is my tie always slipping up behind ?
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 8]: Ca n't you look at something else ?
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 3]: My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 15]: We 'd better buy a cat for you to stare at , Aunt Fanny !
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 8]: A cat could stand it , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 13]: What in the name of goodness do you expect to see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 10]: But Fanny laughed good-naturedly , and was not offended .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 18]: `` It 's more as if I expected you to see something , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 7]: she said quietly , still laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 11]: `` Now , what do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 5]: `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 8]: `` All right , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 11]: But for heaven 's sake stare at somebody else awhile .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 7]: Try it on the house-maid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 56]: `` Well , well , '' Fanny said indulgently , and then chose to be more obscure in her meaning than ever , for she adopted a tone of deep sympathy for her final remark , as she left him : `` I do n't wonder you 're nervous these days , poor boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 16]: And George indignantly supposed that she referred to the ordeal of Lucy 's continued absence .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 44]: During this period he successfully avoided contact with Lucy 's father , though Eugene came frequently to the house , and spent several evenings with Isabel and Fanny ; and sometimes persuaded them and the Major to go for an afternoon 's motoring .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 22]: He did not , however , come again to the Major 's Sunday evening dinner , even when George Amberson returned .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 21]: Sunday evening was the time , he explained , for going over the week 's work with his factory managers .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 50]: When Lucy came home the autumn was far enough advanced to smell of burning leaves , and for the annual editorials , in the papers , on the purple haze , the golden branches , the ruddy fruit , and the pleasure of long tramps in the brown forest .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 41]: George had not heard of her arrival , and he met her , on the afternoon following that event , at the Sharons ' , where he had gone in the secret hope that he might hear something about her .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 51]: Janie Sharon had just begun to tell him that she heard Lucy was expected home soon , after having `` a perfectly gorgeous time '' -- information which George received with no responsive enthusiasm -- when Lucy came demurely in , a proper little autumn figure in green and brown .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 60]: Her cheeks were flushed , and her dark eyes were bright indeed ; evidences , as George supposed , of the excitement incidental to the perfectly gorgeous time just concluded ; though Janie and Mary Sharon both thought they were the effect of Lucy 's having seen George 's runabout in front of the house as she came in .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 34]: George took on colour , himself , as , he rose and nodded indifferently ; and the hot suffusion to which he became subject extended its area to include his neck and ears .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 31]: Nothing could have made him much more indignant than his consciousness of these symptoms of the icy indifference which it was his purpose not only to show but to feel .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 32]: She kissed her cousins , gave George her hand , said `` How d'you do , '' and took a chair beside Janie with a composure which augmented George 's indignation .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 9]: `` How d'you do , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 31]: `` I trust that ah -- I trust -- I do trust -- '' He stopped , for it seemed to him that the word `` trust '' sounded idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 25]: Then , to cover his awkwardness , he coughed , and even to his own rosy ears his cough was ostentatiously a false one .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 24]: Whereupon , seeking to be plausible , he coughed again , and instantly hated himself : the sound he made was an atrocity .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 43]: Meanwhile , Lucy sat silent , and the two Sharon girls leaned forward , staring at him with strained eyes , their lips tightly compressed ; and both were but too easily diagnosed as subject to an agitation which threatened their self-control .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 4]: He began again .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 15]: `` I er -- I hope you have had a -- a pleasant time .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 9]: I er -- I hope you are well .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 48]: I hope you are extremely -- I hope extremely -- extremely -- '' And again he stopped in the midst of his floundering , not knowing how to progress beyond `` extremely , '' and unable to understand why the infernal word kept getting into his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 3]: Lucy said .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 40]: George was never more furious ; he felt that he was `` making a spectacle of himself '' ; and no young gentleman in the world was more loath than George Amberson Minafer to look a figure of fun .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 30]: And while he stood there , undeniably such a figure , with Janie and Mary Sharon threatening to burst at any moment , if laughter were longer denied them .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 16]: Lucy sat looking at him with her eyebrows delicately lifted in casual , polite inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 10]: Her own complete composure was what most galled him .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 8]: `` Nothing of the slightest importance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 5]: he managed to say .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 6]: `` I was just leaving .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 4]: Good afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 41]: And with long strides he reached the door and hastened through the hall ; but before he closed the front door he heard from Janie and Mary Sharon the outburst of wild , irrepressible emotion which his performance had inspired .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 24]: He drove home in a tumultuous mood , and almost ran down two ladies who were engaged in absorbing conversation at a crossing .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 56]: They were his Aunt Fanny and the stout Mrs. Johnson ; a jerk of the reins at the last instant saved them by a few inches ; but their conversation was so interesting that they were unaware of their danger , and did not notice the runabout , nor how close it came to them .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 48]: George was so furious with himself and with the girl whose unexpected coming into a room could make him look such a fool , that it might have soothed him a little if he had actually run over the two absorbed ladies without injuring them beyond repair .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 27]: At least , he said to himself that he wished he had ; it might have taken his mind off of himself for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 25]: For , in truth , to be ridiculous -LRB- and know it -RRB- was one of several things that George was unable to endure .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 4]: He was savage .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 39]: He drove into the Major 's stable too fast , the sagacious Pendennis saving himself from going through a partition by a swerve which splintered a shaft of the runabout and almost threw the driver to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 21]: George swore , and then swore again at the fat old darkey , Tom , for giggling at his swearing .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 4]: `` Hoopee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 4]: said old Tom .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 14]: `` Mus ' been some white lady use Mist ' Jawge mighty bad !
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 27]: White lady say , ` No , suh , I ain ' go 'n out ridin ' ` ith Mist ' Jawge no mo ' ! '
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 6]: Mist ' Jawge drive in .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 7]: ` Dam de dam worl ' !
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 5]: Dam de dam hoss !
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 6]: Dam de dam nigga ' !
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 6]: Dam de dam dam ! '
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 3]: Hoopee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 6]: `` That 'll do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 4]: George said sternly .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 4]: `` Yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 25]: George strode from the stable , crossed the Major 's back yard , then passed behind the new houses , on his way home .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 35]: These structures were now approaching completion , but still in a state of rawness hideous to George -- though , for that matter , they were never to be anything except hideous to him .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 59]: Behind them , stray planks , bricks , refuse of plaster and lath , shingles , straw , empty barrels , strips of twisted tin and broken tiles were strewn everywhere over the dried and pitted gray mud where once the suave lawn had lain like a green lake around those stately islands , the two Amberson houses .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 45]: And George 's state of mind was not improved by his present view of this repulsive area , nor by his sensations when he kicked an uptilted shingle only to discover that what uptilted it was a brickbat on the other side of it .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 15]: After that , the whole world seemed to be one solid conspiracy of malevolence .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 39]: In this temper he emerged from behind the house nearest to his own , and , glancing toward the street , saw his mother standing with Eugene Morgan upon the cement path that led to the front gate .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 41]: She was bareheaded , and Eugene held his hat and stick in his hand ; evidently he had been calling upon her , and she had come from the house with him , continuing their conversation and delaying their parting .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 73]: They had paused in their slow walk from the front door to the gate , yet still stood side by side , their shoulders almost touching , as though neither Isabel nor Eugene quite realized that their feet had ceased to bear them forward ; and they were not looking at each other , but at some indefinite point before them , as people do who consider together thoughtfully and in harmony .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 37]: The conversation was evidently serious ; his head was bent , and Isabel 's lifted left hand rested against her cheek ; but all the significances of their thoughtful attitude denoted companionableness and a shared understanding .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 57]: Yet , a stranger , passing , would not have thought them married : somewhere about Eugene , not quite to be located , there was a romantic gravity ; and Isabel , tall and graceful , with high colour and absorbed eyes , was visibly no wife walking down to the gate with her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 5]: George stared at them .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 54]: A hot dislike struck him at the sight of Eugene ; and a vague revulsion , like a strange , unpleasant taste in his mouth , came over him as he looked at his mother : her manner was eloquent of so much thought about her companion and of such reliance upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 64]: And the picture the two thus made was a vivid one indeed , to George , whose angry eyes , for some reason , fixed themselves most intently upon Isabel 's lifted hand , upon the white ruffle at her wrist , bordering the graceful black sleeve , and upon the little indentations in her cheek where the tips of her fingers rested .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 59]: She should not have worn white at her wrist , or at the throat either , George felt ; and then , strangely , his resentment concentrated upon those tiny indentations at the tips of her fingers -- actual changes , however slight and fleeting , in his mother 's face , made because of Mr. Eugene Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 24]: For the moment , it seemed to George that Morgan might have claimed the ownership of a face that changed for him . .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 8]: It was as if he owned Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 33]: The two began to walk on toward the gate , where they stopped again , turning to face each other , and Isabel 's glance , passing Eugene , fell upon George .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 43]: Instantly she smiled and waved her hand to him ; while Eugene turned and nodded ; but George , standing as in some rigid trance , and staring straight at them , gave these signals of greeting no sign of recognition whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 13]: Upon this , Isabel called to him , waving her hand again .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 4]: `` Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 5]: she called , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 6]: `` Wake up , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 5]: Georgie , hello ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 22]: George turned away as if he had neither seen nor heard , and stalked into the house by the side door .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 61]: Chapter XXI He went to his room , threw off his coat , waistcoat , collar , and tie , letting them lie where they chanced to fall , and then , having violently enveloped himself in a black velvet dressing-gown , continued this action by lying down with a vehemence that brought a wheeze of protest from his bed .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 27]: His repose was only a momentary semblance , however , for it lasted no longer than the time it took him to groan `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 4]: between his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 25]: Then he sat up , swung his feet to the floor , rose , and began to pace up and down the large room .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 42]: He had just been consciously rude to his mother for the first time in his life ; for , with all his riding down of populace and riffraff , he had never before been either deliberately or impulsively disregardful of her .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 28]: When he had hurt her it had been accidental ; and his remorse for such an accident was always adequate compensation -- and more -- to Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 26]: But now he had done a rough thing to her ; and he did not repent ; rather he was the more irritated with her .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 52]: And when he heard her presently go by his door with a light step , singing cheerfully to herself as she went to her room , he perceived that she had mistaken his intention altogether , or , indeed , had failed to perceive that he had any intention at all .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 38]: Evidently she had concluded that he refused to speak to her and Morgan out of sheer absent-mindedness , supposing him so immersed in some preoccupation that he had not seen them or heard her calling to him .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 31]: Therefore there was nothing of which to repent , even if he had been so minded ; and probably Eugene himself was unaware that any disapproval had recently been expressed .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 3]: George snorted .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 13]: What sort of a dreamy loon did they take him to be ?
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 60]: There came a delicate , eager tapping at his door , not done with a knuckle but with the tip of a fingernail , which was instantly clarified to George 's mind 's eye as plainly as if he saw it : the long and polished white-mooned pink shield on the end of his Aunt Fanny 's right forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 25]: But George was in no mood for human communications , and even when things went well he had little pleasure in Fanny 's society .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 36]: Therefore it is not surprising that at the sound of her tapping , instead of bidding her enter , he immediately crossed the room with the intention of locking the door to keep her out .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 25]: Fanny was too eager , and , opening the door before he reached it , came quickly in , and closed it behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 48]: She was in a street dress and a black hat , with a black umbrella in her black-gloved hand -- for Fanny 's heavy mourning , at least , was nowhere tempered with a glimpse of white , though the anniversary of Wilbur 's death had passed .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 31]: An infinitesimal perspiration gleamed upon her pale skin ; she breathed fast , as if she had run up the stairs ; and excitement was sharp in her widened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 18]: Her look was that of a person who had just seen something extraordinary or heard thrilling news .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 11]: `` Now , what on earth do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 5]: her chilling nephew demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 22]: `` George , '' she said hurriedly , `` I saw what you did when you would n't speak to them .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 22]: I was sitting with Mrs. Johnson at her front window , across the street , and I saw it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 6]: `` You did right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 19]: Fanny said with a vehemence not the less spirited because she suppressed her voice almost to a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 6]: `` You did exactly right !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 32]: You 're behaving splendidly about the whole thing , and I want to tell you I know your father would thank you if he could see what you 're doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 5]: `` My Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 6]: George broke out at her .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 6]: `` You make me dizzy !
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 18]: For heaven 's sake quit the mysterious detective business -- at least do quit it around me !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 22]: Go and try it on somebody else , if you like ; but I do n't want to hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 12]: She began to tremble , regarding him with a fixed gaze .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 25]: `` You do n't care to hear then , '' she said huskily , `` that I approve of what you 're doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 4]: `` Certainly not !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 29]: Since I have n't the faintest idea what you think I 'm ` doing , ' naturally I do n't care whether you approve of it or not .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 14]: All I 'd like , if you please , is to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 21]: I 'm not giving a tea here , this afternoon , if you 'll permit me to mention it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 27]: Fanny 's gaze wavered ; she began to blink ; then suddenly she sank into a chair and wept silently , but with a terrible desolation .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 10]: `` Oh , for the Lord 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 3]: he moaned .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 11]: `` What in the world is wrong with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 27]: `` You 're always picking on me , '' she quavered wretchedly , her voice indistinct with the wetness that bubbled into it from her tears .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: `` You do -- you always pick on me !
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 16]: You 've always done it -- always -- ever since you were a little boy !
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 14]: Whenever anything goes wrong with you , you take it out on me !
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 3]: You do !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 41]: You always -- '' George flung to heaven a gesture of despair ; it seemed to him the last straw that Fanny should have chosen this particular time to come and sob in his room over his mistreatment of her !
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 7]: `` Oh , my Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 37]: he whispered ; then , with a great effort , addressed her in a reasonable tone : `` Look here , Aunt Fanny ; I do n't see what you 're making all this fuss about .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 19]: Of course I know I 've teased you sometimes , but -- '' `` Teased ' me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 5]: `` Teased ' me !
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 21]: Oh , it does seem too hard , sometimes -- this mean old life of mine does seem too hard !
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 9]: I do n't think I can stand it !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 9]: Honestly , I do n't think I can !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 46]: I came in here just to show you I sympathized with you -- just to say something pleasant to you , and you treat me as if I were -- oh , no , you would n't treat a servant the way you treat me !
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 14]: You would n't treat anybody in the world like this except old Fanny !
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 7]: ` Old Fanny ' you say .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 19]: ` It 's nobody but old Fanny , so I 'll kick her -- nobody will resent it .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 10]: I 'll kick her all I want to ! '
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 3]: You do !
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 10]: That 's how you think of me-I know it !
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 26]: And you 're right : I have n't got anything in the world , since my brother died -- nobody -- nothing -- nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 6]: `` Oh my Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: George groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 54]: Fanny spread out her small , soaked handkerchief , and shook it in the air to dry it a little , crying as damply and as wretchedly during this operation ' as before -- a sight which gave George a curious shock to add to his other agitations , it seemed so strange .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 32]: `` I ought not to have come , '' she went on , `` because I might have known it would only give you an excuse to pick on me again !
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 12]: I 'm sorry enough I came , I can tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 59]: I did n't mean to speak of it again to you , at all ; and I would n't have , but I saw how you treated them , and I guess I got excited about it , and could n't help following the impulse -- but I 'll know better next time , I can tell you !
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 33]: I 'll keep my mouth shut as I meant to , and as I would have , if I had n't got excited and if I had n't felt sorry for you .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 14]: But what does it matter to anybody if I 'm sorry for them ?
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 7]: I 'm only old Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 6]: `` Oh , good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 23]: How can it matter to me who 's sorry for me when I do n't know what they 're sorry about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 15]: `` You 're so proud , '' she quavered , `` and so hard !
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 60]: I tell you I did n't mean to speak of it to you , and I never , never in the world would have told you about it , nor have made the faintest reference to it , if I had n't seen that somebody else had told you , or you 'd found out for yourself some way .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 26]: I -- '' In despair of her intelligence , and in some doubt of his own , George struck the palms of his hands together .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 8]: `` Somebody else had told me what ?
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 9]: I 'd found what out for myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 10]: `` How people are talking about your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 57]: Except for the incidental teariness of her voice , her tone was casual , as though she mentioned a subject previously discussed and understood ; for Fanny had no doubt that George had only pretended to be mystified because , in his pride , he would not in words admit that he knew what he knew .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 4]: he asked incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 20]: `` Of course I understood what you were doing , '' Fanny went on , drying her handkerchief again .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 35]: `` It puzzled other people when you began to be rude to Eugene , because they could n't see how you could treat him as you did when you were so interested in Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 64]: But I remembered how you came to me , that other time when there was so much talk about Isabel ; and I knew you 'd give Lucy up in a minute , if it came to a question of your mother 's reputation , because you said then that -- '' `` Look here , '' George interrupted in a shaking voice .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 23]: `` Look here , I 'd like -- '' He stopped , unable to go on , his agitation was so great .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 29]: His chest heaved as from hard running , and his complexion , pallid at first , had become mottled ; fiery splotches appearing at his temples and cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 40]: `` What do you mean by telling me -- telling me there 's talk about -- about -- '' He gulped , and began again : `` What do you mean by using such words as ` reputation ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 20]: What do you mean , speaking of a ` question ' of my -- my mother 's reputation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 18]: Fanny looked up at him woefully over the handkerchief which she now applied to her reddened nose .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 15]: `` God knows I 'm sorry for you , George , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 31]: `` I wanted to say so , but it 's only old Fanny , so whatever she says -- even when it 's sympathy -- pick on her for it !
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 4]: Hammer her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 3]: She sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 4]: `` Hammer her !
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 9]: It 's only poor old lonely Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 6]: `` You look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 4]: George said harshly .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 33]: `` When I spoke to my Uncle George after that rotten thing I heard Aunt Amelia say about my mother , he said if there was any gossip it was about you !
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 20]: He said people might be laughing about the way you ran after Morgan , but that was all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 15]: Fanny lifted her hands , clenched them , and struck them upon her knees .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 9]: `` Yes ; it 's always Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 10]: `` Ridiculous old Fanny -- always , always ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 5]: `` You listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 3]: George said .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 36]: `` After I 'd talked to Uncle George I saw you ; and you said I had a mean little mind for thinking there might be truth in what Aunt Amelia said about people talking .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 4]: You denied it .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 27]: And that was n't the only time ; you 'd attacked me before then , because I intimated that Morgan might be coming here too often .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 31]: You made me believe that mother let him come entirely on your account , and now you say -- '' `` I think he did , '' Fanny interrupted desolately .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 22]: `` I think he did come as much to see me as anything -- for a while it looked like it .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 9]: Anyhow , he liked to dance with me .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 32]: He danced with me as much as he danced with her , and he acted as if he came on my account at least as much as he did on hers .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 28]: He did act a good deal that way -- and if Wilbur had n't died -- '' `` You told me there was n't any talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 15]: `` I did n't think there was much , then , '' Fanny protested .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 11]: `` I did n't know how much there was . ''
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 18]: `` People do n't come and tell such things to a person 's family , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 24]: You do n't suppose anybody was going to say to George Amberson that his sister was getting herself talked about , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 12]: Or that they were going to say much to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 25]: `` You told me , '' said George , fiercely , `` that mother never saw him except when she was chaperoning you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 14]: `` They were n't much alone together , then , '' Fanny returned .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 8]: `` Hardly ever , before Wilbur died .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 14]: But you do n't suppose that stops people from talking , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 39]: Your father never went anywhere , and people saw Eugene with her everywhere she went -- and though I was with them people just thought '' -- she choked -- `` they just thought I did n't count !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 13]: ` Only old Fanny Minafer , ' I suppose they 'd say !
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 19]: Besides , everybody knew that he 'd been engaged to her -- '' `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 3]: George cried .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 5]: `` Everybody knows it .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 17]: Do n't you remember your grandfather speaking of it at the Sunday dinner one night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 17]: `` He did n't say they were engaged or -- '' `` Well , they were !
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 24]: Everybody knows it ; and she broke it off on account of that serenade when Eugene did n't know what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 36]: He drank when he was a young man , and she would n't stand it , but everybody in this town knows that Isabel has never really cared for any other man in her life !
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 3]: Poor Wilbur !
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 13]: He was the only soul alive that did n't know it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 24]: Nightmare had descended upon the unfortunate George ; he leaned back against the foot-board of his bed , gazing wildly at his aunt .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 12]: `` I believe I 'm going crazy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 20]: `` You mean when you told me there was n't any talk , you told me a falsehood ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 3]: Fanny gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 5]: `` You did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 28]: `` I tell you I did n't know how much talk there was , and it would n't have amounted to much if Wilbur had lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 19]: And Fanny completed this with a fatal admission : `` I did n't want you to interfere . ''
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 14]: George overlooked the admission ; his mind was not now occupied with analysis .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 30]: `` What do you mean , '' he asked , `` when you say that if father had lived , the talk would n't have amounted to anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 13]: `` Things might have been -- they might have been different . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 10]: `` You mean Morgan might have married you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 3]: Fanny gulped .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 13]: Because I do n't know that I 'd have accepted him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 13]: She had ceased to weep , and now she sat up stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 32]: `` I certainly did n't care enough about him to marry him ; I would n't have let myself care that much until he showed that he wished to marry me .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 9]: I 'm not that sort of person ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 11]: The poor lady paid her vanity this piteous little tribute .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 34]: `` What I mean is , if Wilbur had n't died , people would n't have had it proved before their very eyes that what they 'd been talking about was true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 40]: `` You say -- you say that people believe -- '' George shuddered , then forced himself to continue , in a sick voice : `` They believe my mother is -- is in love with that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 5]: `` Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 43]: `` And because he comes here -- and they see her with him driving -- and all that -- they think they were right when they said she was in -- in love with him before -- before my father died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 15]: She looked at him gravely with her eyes now dry between their reddened lids .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 22]: `` Why , George , '' she said , gently , `` do n't you know that 's what they say ?
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 18]: You must know that everybody in town thinks they 're going to be married very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 14]: George uttered an incoherent cry ; and sections of him appeared to writhe .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 9]: He was upon the verge of actual nausea .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 6]: `` You know it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 6]: Fanny cried , getting up .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 22]: `` You do n't think I 'd have spoken of it to you unless I was sure you knew it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 21]: Her voice was wholly genuine , as it had been throughout the wretched interview : Fanny 's sincerity was unquestionable .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 16]: `` George , I would n't have told you , if you did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 29]: What other reason could you have for treating Eugene as you did , or for refusing to speak to them like that a while ago in the yard ?
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 7]: Somebody must have told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 6]: `` Who told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 8]: `` Who told you there was talk ?
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 5]: Where is this talk ?
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 6]: Where does it come from ?
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 5]: Who does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 13]: `` Why , I suppose pretty much everybody , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 10]: `` I know it must be pretty general . ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 6]: `` Who said so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 6]: George stepped close to her .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 18]: `` You say people do n't speak to a person of gossip about that person 's family .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 10]: Well , how did you hear it , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 8]: How did you get hold of it ?
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 4]: Answer me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 4]: Fanny looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 32]: `` Well , of course nobody not one 's most intimate friends would speak to them about such things , and then only in the kindest , most considerate way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 15]: `` Who 's spoken of it to you in any way at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 3]: George demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 7]: `` Why -- '' Fanny hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 6]: `` You answer me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 13]: `` I hardly think it would be fair to give names . ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 8]: `` Look here , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 18]: `` One of your most intimate friends is that mother of Charlie Johnson 's , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 8]: Has she ever mentioned this to you ?
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 6]: You say everybody is talking .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 5]: Is she one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 25]: `` Oh , she may have intimated -- '' `` I 'm asking you : Has she ever spoken of it to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 48]: `` She 's a very kind , discreet woman , George ; but she may have intimated -- '' George had a sudden intuition , as there flickered into his mind the picture of a street-crossing and two absorbed ladies almost run down by a fast horse .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 12]: `` You and she have been talking about it to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 13]: `` You were talking about it with her not two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 6]: Do you deny it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 11]: `` I -- '' `` Do you deny it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 6]: `` That 's enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 10]: She caught at his arm as he turned away .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 11]: `` What are you going to do , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 15]: `` I 'll not talk about it , now , '' he said heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 17]: `` I think you 've done a good deal for one day , Aunt Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 15]: And Fanny , seeing the passion in his face , began to be alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 35]: She tried to retain possession of the black velvet sleeve which her fingers had clutched , and he suffered her to do so , but used this leverage to urge her to the door .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 21]: `` George , you know I 'm sorry for you , whether you care or not , '' she whimpered .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 23]: `` I never in the world would have spoken of it , if I had n't thought you knew all about it .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 17]: I would n't have -- '' But he had opened the door with his free hand .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 5]: `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 21]: he said , and she was obliged to pass out into the hall , the door closing quickly behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 65]: Chapter XXII George took off his dressing-gown and put on a collar and a tie , his fingers shaking so that the tie was not his usual success ; then he picked up his coat and waistcoat , and left the room while still in process of donning them , fastening the buttons , as he ran down the front stairs to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 45]: It was not until he reached the middle of the street that he realized that he had forgotten his hat ; and he paused for an irresolute moment , during which his eye wandered , for no reason , to the Fountain of Neptune .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 29]: This castiron replica of too elaborate sculpture stood at the next corner , where the Major had placed it when the Addition was laid out so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 59]: The street corners had been shaped to conform with the great octagonal basin , which was no great inconvenience for horse-drawn vehicles , but a nuisance to speeding automobiles ; and , even as George looked , one of the latter , coming too fast , saved itself only by a dangerous skid as it rounded the fountain .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 41]: This skid was to George 's liking , though he would have been more pleased to see the car go over , for he was wishing grief and destruction , just then , upon all the automobiles in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 27]: His eyes rested a second or two longer upon the Fountain of Neptune , not an enlivening sight even in the shielding haze of autumn twilight .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 45]: For more than a year no water had run in the fountain : the connections had been broken , and the Major was evasive about restorations , even when reminded by his grandson that a dry fountain is as gay as a dry fish .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 43]: Soot streaks and a thousand pits gave Neptune the distinction , at least , of leprosy , which the mermaids associated with him had been consistent in catching ; and his trident had been so deeply affected as to drop its prongs .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 48]: Altogether , this heavy work of heavy art , smoked dry , hugely scabbed , cracked , and crumbling , was a dismal sight to the distracted eye of George Amberson Minafer , and its present condition of craziness may have added a mite to his own .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 71]: His own was sufficient , with no additions , however , as he stood looking at the Johnsons ' house and those houses on both sides of it -- that row of riffraff dwellings he had thought so damnable , the day when he stood in his grandfather 's yard , staring at them , after hearing what his Aunt Amelia said of the `` talk '' about his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 22]: He decided that he needed no hat for the sort of call he intended to make , and went forward hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 103]: Mrs. Johnson was at home , the Irish girl who came to the door informed him , and he was left to await the lady , in a room like an elegant well -- the Johnsons ' `` reception room '' : floor space , nothing to mention ; walls , blue calcimined ; ceiling , twelve feet from the floor ; inside shutters and gray lace curtains ; five gilt chairs , a brocaded sofa , soiled , and an inlaid walnut table , supporting two tall alabaster vases ; a palm , with two leaves , dying in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 98]: Mrs. Johnson came in , breathing noticeably ; and her round head , smoothly but economically decorated with the hair of an honest woman , seemed to be lingering far in the background of the Alpine bosom which took precedence of the rest of her everywhere ; but when she was all in the room , it was to be seen that her breathing was the result of hospitable haste to greet the visitor , and her hand , not so dry as Neptune 's Fountain , suggested that she had paused for only the briefest ablutions .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 9]: George accepted this cold , damp lump mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 10]: `` Mr. Amberson -- I mean Mr. Minafer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 13]: `` I 'm really delighted : I understood you asked for me .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 47]: Mr. Johnson 's out of the city , but Charlie 's downtown and I 'm looking for him at any minute , now , and he 'll be so pleased that you -- '' `` I did n't want to see Charlie , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 22]: `` I want '' `` Do sit down , '' the hospitable lady urged him , seating herself upon the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 6]: `` Do sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 7]: `` No , I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 21]: I wish -- '' `` Surely you 're not going to run away again , when you 've just come .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 7]: Do sit down , Mr. Minafer .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 19]: I hope you 're all well at your house and at the dear old Major 's , too .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 36]: He 's looking -- '' `` Mrs. Johnson '' George said , in a strained loud voice which arrested her attention immediately , so that she was abruptly silent , leaving her surprised mouth open .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 39]: She had already been concealing some astonishment at this unexampled visit , however , and the condition of George 's ordinarily smooth hair -LRB- for he had overlooked more than his hat -RRB- had not alleviated her perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 31]: `` Mrs. Johnson , '' he said , `` I have come to ask you a few questions which I would like you to answer , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 6]: She became grave at once .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 6]: `` Certainly , Mr. Minafer .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 19]: Anything I can -- '' He interrupted sternly , yet his voice shook in spite of its sternness .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 15]: `` You were talking with my Aunt Fanny about my mother this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 14]: At this Mrs. Johnson uttered an involuntary gasp , but she recovered herself .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 28]: `` Then I 'm sure our conversation was a very pleasant one , if we were talking of your mother , because -- '' Again he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 25]: `` My aunt has told me what the conversation virtually was , and I do n't mean to waste any time , Mrs. Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 34]: You were talking about a -- '' George 's shoulders suddenly heaved uncontrollably ; but he went fiercely on : `` You were discussing a scandal that involved my mother 's name . ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 5]: `` Mr. Minafer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 8]: `` Is n't that the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 20]: `` I do n't feel called upon to answer , Mr. Minafer , '' she said with visible agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 25]: `` I do not consider that you have any right -- '' `` My aunt told me you repeated this scandal to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 18]: `` I do n't think your aunt can have said that , '' Mrs. Johnson returned sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 27]: `` I did not repeat a scandal of any kind to your aunt and I think you are mistaken in saying she told you I did .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 22]: We may , have discussed some matters that have been a topic of comment about town -- '' `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 3]: George cried .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 7]: `` I think you may have !
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 32]: That 's what I 'm here about , and what I intend to -- '' `` Do n't tell me what you intend , please , '' Mrs. Johnson interrupted crisply .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 25]: `` And I should prefer that you would not make your voice quite so loud in this house , which I happen to own .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 53]: Your aunt may have told you -- though I think it would have been very unwise in her if she did , and not very considerate of me -- she may have told you that we discussed some such topic as I have mentioned , and possibly that would have been true .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 51]: If I talked it over with her , you may be sure I spoke in the most charitable spirit , and without sharing in other people 's disposition to put an evil interpretation on what may , be nothing more than unfortunate appearances and -- '' `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 3]: said George .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 8]: `` I ca n't stand this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 28]: `` You have the option of dropping the subject , '' Mrs. Johnson suggested tartly , and she added : `` Or of leaving the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 36]: `` I 'll do that soon enough , but first I mean to know -- '' `` I am perfectly willing to tell you anything you wish if you will remember to ask it quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 23]: I 'll also take the liberty of reminding you that I had a perfect right to discuss the subject with your aunt .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 30]: Other people may be less considerate in not confining their discussion of it , as I have , to charitable views expressed only to a member of the family .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 9]: Other people -- '' `` Other people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 6]: the unhappy George repeated viciously .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 15]: `` That 's what I want to know about -- these other people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 9]: `` I want to ask you about them .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 13]: You say you know of other people who talk about this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 7]: `` I presume they do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 5]: `` How many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 14]: `` I want to know how many other people talk about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 6]: `` Dear , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 8]: `` How should I know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 10]: `` Have n't you heard anybody mention it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 6]: `` I presume so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 10]: `` Well , how many have you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 14]: Mrs. Johnson was becoming more annoyed than apprehensive , and she showed it .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 13]: `` Really , this is n't a court-room , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 14]: `` And I 'm not a defendant in a libel-suit , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 11]: The unfortunate young man lost what remained of his balance .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 6]: `` You may be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 41]: `` I intend to know just who 's dared to say these things , if I have to force my way into every house in town , and I 'm going to make them take every word of it back !
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 29]: I mean to know the name of every slanderer that 's spoken of this matter to you and of every tattler you 've passed it on to yourself .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 15]: I mean to know -- '' `` You 'll know something pretty quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 18]: she said , rising with difficulty ; and her voice was thick with the sense of insult .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 12]: `` You 'll know that you 're out in the street .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 7]: Please to leave my house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 4]: George stiffened sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 11]: Then he bowed , and strode out of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 28]: Three minutes later , disheveled and perspiring , but cold all over , he burst into his Uncle George 's room at the Major 's without knocking .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 4]: Amberson was dressing .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 7]: `` Good gracious , Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 6]: `` What 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 18]: `` I 've just come from Mrs. Johnson 's -- across the street , '' George panted .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 8]: `` You have your own tastes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 5]: was Amberson 's comment .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 31]: `` But curious as they are , you ought to do something better with your hair , and button your waistcoat to the right buttons -- even for Mrs. Johnson !
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 8]: What were you doing over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 14]: `` She told me to leave the house , '' George said desperately .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 71]: `` I went there because Aunt Fanny told me the whole town was talking about my mother and that man Morgan -- that they say my mother is going to marry him and that proves she was too fond of him before my father died -- she said this Mrs. Johnson was one that talked about it , and I went to her to ask who were the others . ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 7]: Amberson 's jaw fell in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 10]: `` Do n't tell me you did that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 27]: he said , in a low voice ; and then , seeing that it was true , `` Oh , now you have done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 11]: Chapter XXIII `` I 've ` done it ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 3]: George cried .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 11]: `` What do you mean : I 've done it ?
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 7]: And what have I done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 38]: Amberson had collapsed into an easy chair beside his dressing-table , the white evening tie he had been about to put on dangling from his hand , which had fallen limply on the arm of the chair .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 26]: The tie dropped to the floor before he replied ; and the hand that had held it was lifted to stroke his graying hair reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 7]: `` That is too bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 6]: George folded his arms bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 8]: `` Will you kindly answer my question ?
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 11]: What have I done that was n't honourable and right ?
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 24]: Do you think these riffraff can go about bandying my mother 's name -- '' `` They can now , '' said Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 17]: `` I do n't know if they could before , but they certainly can now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 26]: His uncle sighed profoundly , picked up his tie and , preoccupied with despondency , twisted the strip of white lawn till it became unwearable .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 9]: Meanwhile , he tried to enlighten his nephew .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 18]: `` Gossip is never fatal , Georgie , '' he said , `` until it is denied .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 35]: Gossip goes on about every human being alive and about all the dead that are alive enough to be remembered , and yet almost never does any harm until some defender makes a controversy .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 35]: Gossip 's a nasty thing , but it 's sickly , and if people of good intentions will let it entirely alone , it will die , ninety-nine times out of a hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 22]: `` See here , '' George said : `` I did n't come to listen to any generalizing dose of philosophy !
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 21]: I ask you -- '' `` You asked me what you 've done , and I 'm telling you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 20]: Amberson gave him a melancholy smile , continuing : `` Suffer me to do it in my own way .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 19]: Fanny says there 's been talk about your mother , and that Mrs. Johnson does some of it .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 32]: I do n't know , because naturally nobody would come to me with such stuff or mention it before me ; but it 's presumably true -- I suppose it is .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 42]: I 've seen Fanny with Mrs. Johnson quite a lot ; and that old lady is a notorious gossip , and that 's why she ordered you out of her house when you pinned her down that she 'd been gossiping .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 34]: I have a suspicion Mrs. Johnson has been quite a comfort to Fanny in their long talks ; but she 'll probably quit speaking to her over this , because Fanny told you .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 26]: I suppose it 's true that the ` whole town , ' a lot of others , that is , do share in the gossip .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 37]: In this town , naturally , anything about any Amberson has always been a stone dropped into the centre of a pond , and a lie would send the ripples as far as a truth would .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 71]: I 've been on a steamer when the story went all over the boat , the second day out , ' that the prettiest girl on board did n't have any ears ; and you can take it as a rule that when a woman 's past thirty-five the prettier her hair is , the more certain you are to meet somebody with reliable information that it 's a wig .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 25]: You can be sure that for many years there 's been more gossip in this place about the Ambersons than about any other family .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 55]: I dare say it is n't so much so now as it used to be , because the town got too big long ago , but it 's the truth that the more prominent you are the more gossip there is about you , and the more people would like to pull you down .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 21]: Well , they ca n't do it as long as you refuse to know what gossip there is about you .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 12]: But the minute you notice it , it 's got you !
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 58]: I 'm not speaking of certain kinds of slander that sometimes people have got to take to the courts ; I 'm talking of the wretched buzzing the Mrs. John-sons do -- the thing you seem to have such a horror of -- people ` talking ' -- the kind of thing that has assailed your mother .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 19]: People who have repeated a slander either get ashamed or forget it , if they 're let alone .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 27]: Challenge them , and in self-defense they believe everything they 've said : they 'd rather believe you a sinner than believe themselves liars , naturally .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 16]: Submit to gossip and you kill it ; fight it and you make it strong .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 14]: People will forget almost any slander except one that 's been fought . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 3]: George asked .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 11]: `` I suppose so , '' his uncle murmured sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 19]: `` Well , then , may I ask what you 'd have done , in my place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 8]: `` I 'm not sure , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 26]: When I was your age I was like you in many ways , especially in not being very cool-headed , so I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 18]: Youth ca n't be trusted for much , except asserting itself and fighting and making love . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 3]: George snorted .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 14]: `` May I ask what you think I ought to have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 5]: `` Nothing . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 4]: ` Nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 29]: George echoed , mocking bitterly `` I suppose you think I mean to let my mother 's good name -- '' `` Your mother 's good name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 6]: Amberson cut him off impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 11]: `` Nobody has a good name in a bad mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 12]: Nobody has a good name in a silly mouth , either .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 57]: Well , your mother 's name was in some silly mouths , and all you 've done was to go and have a scene with the worst old woman gossip in the town -- a scene that 's going to make her into a partisan against your mother , whereas she was a mere prattler before .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 14]: Do n't you suppose she 'll be all over town with this to-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 2]: To-morrow ?
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 19]: Why , she 'll have her telephone going to-night as long as any of her friends are up !
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 18]: People that never heard anything about this are going to hear it all now , with embellishments .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 37]: And she 'll see to it that everybody who 's hinted anything about poor Isabel will know that you 're on the warpath ; and that will put them on the defensive and make them vicious .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 24]: The story will grow as it spreads and -- '' George unfolded his arms to strike his right fist into his left palm .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 14]: `` But do you suppose I 'm going to tolerate such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 11]: `` What do you suppose I 'll be doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 5]: `` Nothing helpful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 11]: `` Oh , you think so , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 11]: `` You can do absolutely nothing , '' said Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 6]: `` Nothing of any use .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 12]: The more you do the more harm you 'll do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 5]: `` You 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 25]: I 'm going to stop this thing if I have to force my way into every house on National Avenue and Amberson Boulevard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 12]: His uncle laughed rather sourly , but made no other comment .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 11]: `` Well , what do you propose to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 3]: George demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 14]: `` Do you propose to sit there -- '' `` Yes . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 17]: -- and let this riffraff bandy my mother 's good name back and forth among them ?
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 9]: Is that what you propose to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 12]: `` It 's all I can do , '' Amberson returned .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 37]: `` It 's all any of us can do now : just sit still and hope that the thing may die down in time , in spite of your stirring up that awful old woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 15]: George drew a long breath , then advanced and stood close before his uncle .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 23]: `` Did n't you understand me when I told you that people are saying my mother means to marry this man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 8]: `` Yes , I understood you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 18]: `` You say that my going over there has made matters worse , '' George went on .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 16]: `` How about it if such a -- such an unspeakable marriage did take place ?
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 22]: Do you think that would make people believe they 'd been wrong in saying -- you know what they say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 16]: `` No , '' said Amberson deliberately ; `` I do n't believe it would .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 21]: There 'd be more badness in the bad mouths and more silliness in the silly mouths , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 40]: But it would n't hurt Isabel and Eugene , if they never heard of it ; and if they did hear of it , then they could take their choice between placating gossip or living for their own happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 12]: If they have decided to marry -- '' George almost staggered .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 5]: `` Good God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 8]: `` You speak of it calmly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 7]: Amberson looked up at him inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 12]: `` Why should n't they marry if they want to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 8]: `` It 's their own affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 7]: `` Why should n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 3]: George echoed .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 7]: `` Why should n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 5]: Why should n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 23]: I do n't see anything precisely monstrous about two people getting married when they 're both free and care about each other .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 9]: What 's the matter with their marrying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 7]: `` It would be monstrous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 3]: George shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 32]: `` Monstrous even if this horrible thing had n't happened , but now in the face of this -- oh , that you can sit there and even speak of it !
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 4]: Your own sister !
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 3]: O God !
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 20]: Oh -- '' He became incoherent , swinging away from Amberson and making for the door , wildly gesturing .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 13]: `` For heaven 's sake , do n't be so theatrical ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 20]: said his uncle , and then , seeing that George was leaving the room : `` Come back here .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 11]: You must n't speak to your mother of this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 23]: `` Do n't ` tend to , '' George said indistinctly ; and he plunged out into the big dimly lit hall .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 41]: He passed his grandfather 's room on the way to the stairs ; and the Major was visible within , his white head brightly illumined by a lamp , as he bent low over a ledger upon his roll-top desk .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 40]: He did not look up , and his grandson strode by the door , not really conscious of the old figure stooping at its tremulous work with long additions and subtractions that refused to balance as they used to .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 17]: George went home and got a hat and overcoat without seeing either his mother or Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 19]: Then he left word that he would be out for dinner , and hurried away from the house .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 22]: He walked the dark streets of Amberson Addition for an hour , then went downtown and got coffee at a restaurant .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 29]: After that he walked through the lighted parts of the town until ten o'clock , when he turned north and came back to the purlieus of the Addition .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 26]: He strode through the length and breadth of it again , his hat pulled down over his forehead , his overcoat collar turned up behind .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 51]: He walked fiercely , though his feet ached , but by and by he turned homeward , and , when he reached the Major 's , went in and sat upon the steps of the huge stone veranda in front -- an obscure figure in that lonely and repellent place .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 25]: All lights were out at the Major 's , and finally , after twelve , he saw his mother 's window darken at home .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 25]: He waited half an hour longer , then crossed the front yards of the new houses and let himself noiselessly in the front door .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 25]: The light in the hall had been left burning , and another in his own room , as he discovered when he got there .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 28]: He locked the door quickly and without noise , but his fingers were still upon the key when there was a quick footfall in the hall outside .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 6]: `` Georgie , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 12]: He went to the other end of the room before replying .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 12]: `` I 'd been wondering where you were , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 5]: `` Had you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 24]: There was a pause ; then she said timidly : `` Wherever it was , I hope you had a pleasant evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 15]: After a silence , `` Thank you , '' he said , without expression .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 8]: Another silence followed before she spoke again .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 14]: `` You would n't care to be kissed good-night , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 21]: And with a little flurry of placative laughter , she added : `` At your age , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 13]: `` I 'm going to bed , now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 4]: `` Goodnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 23]: Another silence seemed blanker than those which had preceded it , and finally her voice came -- it was blank , too .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 4]: `` Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 110]: After he was in bed his thoughts became more tumultuous than ever ; while among all the inchoate and fragmentary sketches of this dreadful day , now rising before him , the clearest was of his uncle collapsed in a big chair with a white tie dangling from his hand ; and one conviction , following upon that picture , became definite in George 's mind : that his Uncle George Amberson was a hopeless dreamer from whom no help need be expected , an amiable imbecile lacking in normal impulses , and wholly useless in a struggle which required honour to be defended by a man of action .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 62]: Then would return a vision of Mrs. Johnson 's furious round head , set behind her great bosom like the sun far sunk on the horizon of a mountain plateau -- and her crackling , asthmatic voice ... `` Without sharing in other people 's disposition to put an evil interpretation on what may be nothing more than unfortunate appearances . ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 25]: ... `` Other people may be less considerate in not confirming their discussion of it , as I have , to charitable views . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 9]: ... `` you 'll know something pretty quick !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 11]: You 'll know you 're out in the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 21]: ... And then George would get up again -- and again -- and pace the floor in his bare feet .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 48]: That was what the tormented young man was doing when daylight came gauntly in at his window -- pacing the floor , rubbing his head in his hands , and muttering : `` It ca n't be true : this ca n't be happening to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 56]: Chapter XXIV Breakfast was brought to him in his room , as usual ; but he did not make his normal healthy raid upon the dainty tray : the food remained untouched , and he sustained himself upon coffee -- four cups of it , which left nothing of value inside the glistening little percolator .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 31]: During this process he heard his mother being summoned to the telephone in the hall , not far from his door , and then her voice responding : `` Yes ?
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 6]: Oh , it 's you !
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 4]: Indeed I should !
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 7]: ... Of course . . . .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 10]: Then I 'll expect you about three ... Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 5]: Good-bye till then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 39]: A few minutes later he heard her speaking to someone beneath his window and , looking out , saw her directing the removal of plants from a small garden bed to the Major 's conservatory for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 44]: There was an air of briskness about her ; as she turned away to go into the house , she laughed gaily with the Major 's gardener over something he said , and this unconcerned cheerfulness of her was terrible to her son .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 45]: He went to his desk , and , searching the jumbled contents of a drawer , brought forth a large , unframed photograph of his father , upon which he gazed long and piteously , till at last hot tears stood in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 76]: It was strange how the inconsequent face of Wilbur seemed to increase in high significance during this belated interview between father and son ; and how it seemed to take on a reproachful nobility -- and yet , under the circumstances , nothing could have been more natural than that George , having paid but the slightest attention to his father in life , should begin to deify him , now that he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 7]: `` Poor , poor father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 5]: the son whispered brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 13]: `` Poor man , I 'm glad you did n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 49]: He wrapped the picture in a sheet of newspaper , put it under his arm , and , leaving the house hurriedly and stealthily , went downtown to the shop of a silversmith , where he spent sixty dollars on a resplendently festooned silver frame for the picture .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 43]: Having lunched upon more coffee , he returned to the house at two o'clock , carrying the framed photograph with him , and placed it upon the centre-table in the library , the room most used by Isabel and Fanny and himself .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 24]: Then he went to a front window of the long `` reception room , '' and sat looking out through the lace curtains .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 40]: The house was quiet , though once or twice he heard his mother and Fanny moving about upstairs , and a ripple of song in the voice of Isabel -- a fragment from the romantic ballad of Lord Bateman .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 62]: `` Lord Bateman was a noble lord , A noble lord of high degree ; And he sailed West and he sailed East , Far countries for to see ... '' The words became indistinct ; the air was hummed absently ; the humming shifted to a whistle , then drifted out of hearing , and the place was still again .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 16]: George looked often at his watch , but his vigil did not last an hour .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 30]: At ten minutes of three , peering through the curtain , he saw an automobile stop in front of the house and Eugene Morgan jump lightly down from it .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 50]: The car was of a new pattern , low and long , with an ample seat in the tonneau , facing forward ; and a professional driver sat at the wheel , a strange figure in leather , goggled out of all personality and seemingly part of the mechanism .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 76]: Eugene himself , as he came up the cement path to the house , was a figure of the new era which was in time to be so disastrous to stiff hats and skirted coats ; and his appearance afforded a debonair contrast to that of the queer-looking duck capering : at the Amberson Ball in an old dress coat , and chugging up National Avenue through the snow in his nightmare of a sewing-machine .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 57]: Eugene , this afternoon , was richly in the new outdoor mode : motoring coat was soft gray fur ; his cap and gloves were of gray suede ; and though Lucy 's hand may have shown itself in the selection of these garnitures , he wore them easily , even with becoming hint of jauntiness .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 26]: Some change might be his face , too , for a successful man is seldom to be mistaken , especially if his temper be genial .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 9]: Eugene had begun to look like a millionaire .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 42]: But above everything else , what was most evident about him , as he came up the path , was confidence in the happiness promised by his errand ; the anticipation in his eyes could have been read by a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 32]: His look at the door of Isabel 's house was the look of a man who is quite certain that the next moment will reveal something ineffably charming , inexpressibly dear .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 31]: When the bell rang , George waited at the entrance of the `` reception room '' until a housemaid came through the hall on her way to answer the summons .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 13]: `` You need n't mind , Mary , '' he told her .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 12]: `` I 'll see who it is and what they want .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 8]: Probably it 's only a pedlar . ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 22]: `` Thank you , sir , Mister George , '' said Mary ; and returned to the rear of the house .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 24]: George went slowly to the front door , and halted , regarding the misty silhouette of the caller upon the ornamental frosted glass .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 45]: After a minute of waiting , this silhouette changed outline so that an arm could be distinguished -- an arm outstretched toward the bell , as if the gentleman outside doubted whether or not it had sounded , and were minded to try again .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 23]: But before the gesture was completed George abruptly threw open the door , and stepped squarely upon the middle of the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 22]: A slight change shadowed the face of Eugene ; his look of happy anticipation gave way to something formal and polite .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 12]: `` How do you do , George , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 30]: `` Mrs. Minafer expects to go driving with me , I believe -- if you 'll be so kind as to send her word that I 'm here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 7]: George made not the slightest movement .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 22]: Eugene was incredulous , even when his second glance revealed how hot of eye was the haggard young man before him .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 13]: I said -- '' `` I heard you , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 19]: `` You said you had an engagement with my mother , and I told you , No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 21]: Eugene gave him a steady look , and then he quietly : `` What is the -- the difficulty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 20]: George kept his own voice quiet enough , but that , did not mitigate the vibrant fury of it .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 20]: `` My -- mother will have no interest in knowing that you came here to-day , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 7]: `` Or any other day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 27]: Eugene continued to look at him with a scrutiny in which began to gleam a profound anger , none less powerful because it was so quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 11]: `` I am afraid I do not understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 26]: `` I doubt if I could make it much plainer , '' George said , raising his voice slightly , `` but I 'll try .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 18]: You 're not wanted in this house , Mr. Morgan , now or at any other time .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 8]: Perhaps you 'll understand -- this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 14]: And with the last word he closed the door in Eugene 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 41]: Then , not moving away , he stood just inside door , and noted that the misty silhouette remained upon the frosted glass for several moments , as if the forbidden gentleman debated in his mind what course to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 7]: `` Let him ring again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 4]: George thought grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 12]: `` Or try the side door -- or the kitchen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 60]: But Eugene made no further attempt ; the silhouette disappeared ; footsteps could be heard withdrawing across the floor of the veranda ; and George , returning to the window in the `` reception room , '' was rewarded by the sight of an automobile manufacturer in baffled retreat , with all his wooing furs and fineries mocking him .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 58]: Eugene got into his car slowly , not looking back at the house which had just taught him such a lesson ; and it was easily visible -- even from a window seventy feet distant -- that he was not the same light suitor who had jumped so gallantly from the car only a few minutes earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 28]: Observing the heaviness of his movements as he climbed into the tonneau , George indulged in a sickish throat rumble which bore a distant cousinship to mirth .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 41]: The car was quicker than its owner ; it shot away as soon as he had sunk into his seat ; and George , having watched its impetuous disappearance from his field of vision , ceased to haunt the window .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 37]: He went to the library , and , seating himself beside the table whereon he had placed the photograph of his father , picked up a book , and pretended to be engaged in reading it .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 27]: Presently Isabel 's buoyant step was heard descending the stairs , and her low , sweet whistling , renewing the air of `` Lord Bateman . ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 79]: She came into the library , still whistling thoughtfully , a fur coat over her arm , ready to put on , and two veils round her small black hat , her right hand engaged in buttoning the glove upon her left ; and , as the large room contained too many pieces of heavy furniture , and the inside shutters excluded most of the light of day , she did not at once perceive George 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 59]: Instead , she went to the bay window at the end of the room , which afforded a view of the street , and glanced out expectantly ; then bent her attention upon her glove ; after that , looked out toward the street again , ceased to whistle , and turned toward the interior of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 6]: `` Why , Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 28]: She came , leaned over from behind him , and there was a faint , exquisite odour as from distant apple blossoms as she kissed his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 18]: `` Dear , I waited lunch almost an hour for you , but you did n't come !
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 7]: Did you lunch out somewhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 9]: He did not look up from the book .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 9]: `` Did you have plenty to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 5]: `` Are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 16]: Would n't you like to have Maggie get you something now in the dining room ?
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 17]: Or they could bring it to you here , if you think it would be cozier .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 21]: Sha n't I -- '' A tinkling bell was audible , and she moved to the doorway into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 9]: `` I 'm going out driving , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 28]: I -- '' She interrupted herself to address the housemaid , who was passing through the hall : `` I think it 's Mr. Morgan , Mary .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 10]: Tell him I 'll be there at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 3]: Mary returned .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 8]: `` Twas a pedlar , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 5]: `` Another one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 5]: Isabel said , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 19]: `` I thought you said it was a pedlar when the bell rang a little while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 22]: `` Mister George said it was , ma'am ; he went to the door , '' Mary informed her , disappearing .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 15]: `` There seem to be a great many of them , '' Isabel mused .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 11]: `` What did yours want to sell , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 7]: `` He did n't say . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 10]: `` You must have cut him off short ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 24]: she laughed ; and then , still standing in the doorway , she noticed the big silver frame upon the table beside him .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: `` Gracious , Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 7]: `` You have been investing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 21]: and as she came across the room for a closer view , `` Is it -- is it Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 8]: she asked half timidly , half archly .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 31]: But the next instant she saw whose likeness was thus set forth in elegiac splendour -- and she was silent , except for a long , just-audible `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 7]: He neither looked up nor moved .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 19]: `` That was nice of you , Georgie , '' she said , in a low voice presently .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 19]: `` I ought to have had it framed , myself , when I gave it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 32]: He said nothing , and , standing beside him , she put her hand gently upon his shoulder , then as gently withdrew it , and went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 33]: But she did not go upstairs ; he heard the faint rustle of her dress in the hall , and then the sound of her footsteps in the `` reception room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 51]: After a time , silence succeeded even these slight tokens of her presence ; whereupon George rose and went warily into the hall , taking care to make no noise , and he obtained an oblique view of her through the open double doors of the `` reception room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 27]: She was sitting in the chair which he had occupied so long ; and she was looking out of the window expectantly -- a little troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 30]: He went back to the library , waited an interminable half hour , then returned noiselessly to the same position in the hall , where he could see her .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 9]: She was still sitting patiently by the window .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 8]: Waiting for that man , was she ?
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 10]: Well , it might be quite a long wait !
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 21]: And the grim George silently ascended the stairs to his own room , and began to pace his suffering floor .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 35]: Chapter XXV He left his door open , however , and when he heard the front door-bell ring , by and by , he went half way down the stairs and stood to listen .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 17]: He was not much afraid that Morgan would return , but he wished to make sure .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 26]: Mary appeared in the hall below him , but , after a glance toward the front of the house , turned back , and withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 8]: Evidently Isabel had gone to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 62]: Then a murmur was heard , and George Amberson 's voice , quick and serious : `` I want to talk to you , Isabel '' ... and another murmur ; then Isabel and her brother passed the foot of the broad , dark stairway , but did not look up , and remained unconscious of the watchful presence above them .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 52]: Isabel still carried her cloak upon her arm , but Amberson had taken her hand , and retained it ; and as he led her silently into the library there was something about her attitude , and the pose of her slightly bent head , that was both startled and meek .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 26]: Thus they quickly disappeared from George 's sight , hand in hand ; and Amberson at once closed the massive double doors of the library .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 37]: For a time all that George could hear was the indistinct sound of his uncle 's voice : what he was saying could not be surmised , though the troubled brotherliness of his tone was evident .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 44]: He seemed to be explaining something at considerable length , and there were moments when he paused , and George guessed that his mother was speaking , but her voice must have been very low , for it was entirely inaudible to him .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 6]: Suddenly he did hear her .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 18]: Through the heavy doors her outcry came , clear and loud : `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 42]: It was a cry of protest , as if something her brother told her must be untrue , or , if it were true , the fact he stated must be undone ; and it was a sound of sheer pain .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 51]: Another sound of pain , close to George , followed it ; this was a vehement sniffling which broke out just above him , and , looking up , he saw Fanny Minafer on the landing , leaning over the banisters and applying her handkerchief to her eyes and nose .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 14]: `` I can guess what that was about , '' she whispered huskily .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 13]: `` He 's just told her what you did to Eugene ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 10]: George gave her a dark look over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 10]: `` You go on back to your room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 28]: he said ; and he began to descend the stairs ; but Fanny , guessing his purpose , rushed down and caught his arm , detaining him .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 9]: `` You 're not going in there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 5]: , she whispered huskily .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 13]: `` You do n't -- '' `` Let go of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 7]: But she clung to him savagely .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 10]: `` No , you do n't , Georgie Minafer !
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 7]: You 'll keep away from there !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 4]: You will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 12]: `` You let go of -- '' `` I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 5]: You come back here !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 17]: You 'll come upstairs and let them alone ; that 's what you 'll do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 61]: And with such passionate determination did she clutch and tug , never losing a grip of him somewhere , though George tried as much as he could , without hurting her , to wrench away -- with such utter forgetfulness of her maiden dignity did she assault him , that she forced him , stumbling upward , to the landing .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 29]: `` Of all the ridiculous -- '' he began furiously ; but she spared one hand from its grasp of his sleeve and clapped it over his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 5]: `` Hush up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 18]: Never for an instant in this grotesque struggle did Fanny raise her voice above a husky whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 4]: `` Hush up !
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 13]: It 's indecent -- like squabbling outside the door of an operating-room !
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 13]: Go on to the top of the stairs -- go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 20]: And when George had most unwillingly obeyed , she planted herself in his way , on the top step .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 10]: `` The idea of your going in there now !
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 9]: I never heard of such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 21]: And with the sudden departure of the nervous vigour she had shown so amazingly , she began to cry again .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 7]: `` I was an awful fool !
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 18]: I thought you knew what was going on or I never , never would have done it .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 15]: Do you suppose I dreamed you 'd go making everything into such a tragedy ?
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 4]: Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 13]: `` I do n't care what you dreamed , '' George muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 25]: But Fanny went on , always taking care to keep her voice from getting too loud , in spite of her most grievous agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 20]: `` Do you dream I thought you 'd go making such a fool of yourself at Mrs. Johnson 's ?
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 8]: Oh , I saw her this morning !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 28]: She would n't talk to me , but I met George Amberson on my way back , and he told me what you 'd done over there !
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 19]: And do you dream I thought you 'd do what you 've done here this afternoon to Eugene ?
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 8]: Oh , I knew that , too !
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 33]: I was looking out of the front bedroom window , and I saw him drive up , and then go away again , and I knew you 'd been to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 18]: Of course he went to George Amberson about it , and that 's why George is here .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 24]: He 's got to tell Isabel the whole thing now , and you wanted to go in there interfering -- God knows what !
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 19]: You stay here and let her brother tell her ; he 's got some consideration for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 10]: `` I suppose you think I have n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 13]: George said , challenging her , and at that Fanny laughed witheringly .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 3]: `` You !
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 5]: Considerate of anybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 10]: `` I 'm considerate of her good name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 4]: he said hotly .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 23]: `` It seems to me that 's about the first thing to be considerate of , in being considerate of a person !
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 22]: And look here : it strikes me you 're taking a pretty different tack from what you did yesterday afternoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 5]: Fanny wrung her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 8]: `` I did a terrible thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 3]: she lamented .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 15]: `` Now that it 's done and too late I know what it was !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 13]: I did n't have sense enough just to let things go on .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 29]: I did n't have any business to interfere , and I did n't mean to interfere -- I only wanted to talk , and let out a little !
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 11]: I did think you already knew everything I told you .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 3]: I did !
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 20]: And I 'd rather have cut my hand off than stir you up to doing what you have done !
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 22]: I was just suffering so that I wanted to let out a little -- I did n't mean any real harm .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 15]: But now I see what 's happened -- oh , I was a fool !
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 7]: I had n't any business interfering .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 23]: Eugene never would have looked at me , anyhow , and , oh , why could n't I have seen that before !
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 17]: He never came here a single time in his life except on her account , never !
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 24]: and I might have let them alone , because he would n't have looked at me even if he 'd never seen Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 27]: And they have n't done any harm : she made Wilbur happy , and she was a true wife to him as long as he lived .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 33]: It was n't a crime for her to care for Eugene all the time ; she certainly never told him she did -- and she gave me every chance in the world !
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 21]: She left us alone together every time she could -- even since Wilbur died -- but what was the use ?
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 31]: And here I go , not doing myself a bit of good by it , and just '' -- Fanny wrung her hands again -- `` just ruining them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 15]: `` I suppose you mean I 'm doing that , '' George said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 12]: she sobbed , and drooped upon the stairway railing , exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 16]: `` On the contrary , I mean to save my mother from a calamity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 32]: Fanny looked at him wanly , in a tired despair ; then she stepped by him and went slowly to her own door , where she paused and beckoned to him .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 8]: `` Just come here a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 4]: he asked impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 11]: `` I just wanted to say something to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 11]: `` Well , for heaven 's sake , say it !
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 7]: There 's nobody to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 20]: Nevertheless , after a moment , as she beckoned him again , he went to her , profoundly annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 8]: `` Well , what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 21]: `` George , '' she said in a low voice , `` I think you ought to be told something .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 13]: If I were you , I 'd let my mother alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 7]: `` Oh , my Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 14]: `` I 'm doing these things for her , not against her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 14]: A mildness had come upon Fanny , and she had controlled her weeping .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 6]: She shook her head gently .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 13]: `` No , I 'd let her alone if I were you .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 12]: I do n't think she 's very well , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 3]: `` She !
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 11]: I never saw a healthier person in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 16]: She does n't let anybody know , but she goes to the doctor regularly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 10]: `` Women are always going to doctors regularly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 6]: He told her to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 5]: George was not impressed .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 22]: `` It 's nothing at all ; she spoke of it to me years ago -- some kind of family failing .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 13]: She said grandfather had it , too ; and look at him !
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 8]: Has n't proved very serious with him !
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 33]: You act as if I 'd done something wrong in sending that man about his business , and as if I were going to persecute my mother , instead of protecting her .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 7]: By Jove , it 's sickening !
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 39]: You told me how all the riffraff in town were busy with her name , and then the minute I lift my hand to protect her , you begin to attack me and -- '' `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 11]: Fanny checked him , laying her hand on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 7]: `` Your uncle is going . ''
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 21]: The library doors were heard opening , and a moment later there came the sound of the front door closing .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 19]: George moved toward the head of the stairs , then stood listening ; but the house was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 28]: Fanny made a slight noise with her lips to attract his attention , and , when he glanced toward her , shook her head at him urgently .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 9]: `` Let her alone , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 8]: `` She 's down there by herself .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 5]: Do n't go down .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 5]: Let her alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 30]: She moved a few steps toward him and halted , her face pallid and awestruck , and then both stood listening for anything that might break the silence downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 71]: No sound came to them ; that poignant silence was continued throughout long , long minutes , while the two listeners stood there under its mysterious spell ; and in its plaintive eloquence -- speaking , as it did , of the figure alone in the big , dark library , where dead Wilbur 's new silver frame gleamed in the dimness -- there was something that checked even George .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 33]: Above the aunt and nephew , as they kept this strange vigil , there was a triple window of stained glass , to illumine the landing and upper reaches of the stairway .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 55]: Figures in blue and amber garments posed gracefully in panels , conceived by some craftsman of the Eighties to represent Love and Purity and Beauty , and these figures , leaded to unalterable attitudes , were little more motionless than the two human beings upon whom fell the mottled faint light of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 11]: The colours were growing dull ; evening was coming on .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 38]: Fanny Minafer broke the long silence with a sound from her throat , a stilled gasp ; and with that great companion of hers , her handkerchief , retired softly to the loneliness of her own chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 29]: After she had gone George looked about him bleakly , then on tiptoe crossed the hall and went into his own room , which was filled with twilight .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 27]: Still tiptoeing , though he could not have said why , he went across the room and sat down heavily in a chair facing the window .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 19]: Outside there was nothing but the darkening air and the wall of the nearest of the new houses .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 31]: He had not slept at all , the night before , and he had eaten nothing since the preceding day at lunch , but he felt neither drowsiness nor hunger .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 29]: His set determination filled him , kept him but too wide awake , and his gaze at the grayness beyond the window was wide -- eyed and bitter .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 15]: Darkness had closed in when there was a step in the room behind him .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 36]: Then someone knelt beside the chair , two arms went round him with infinite compassion , a gentle head rested against his shoulder , and there came the faint scent as of apple-blossoms far away .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 14]: `` You must n't be troubled , darling , '' his mother whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 5]: Chapter XXVI George choked .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 26]: For an instant he was on the point of breaking down , but he commanded himself , bravely dismissing the self-pity roused by her compassion .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 9]: `` How can I help but be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 6]: `` No , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 4]: She soothed him .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 5]: `` You must n't .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 12]: You must n't be troubled , no matter what happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 9]: `` That 's easy enough to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 11]: he protested ; and he moved as if to rise .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 13]: `` Just let 's stay like this a little while , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 6]: Just a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 41]: I want to tell you : brother George has been here , and he told me everything about -- about how unhappy you 'd been -- and how you went so gallantly to that old woman with the operaglasses . ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 7]: Isabel gave a sad little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 9]: `` What a terrible old woman she is !
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 13]: What a really terrible thing a vulgar old woman can be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 13]: `` Mother , I -- '' And again he moved to rise .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 4]: `` Must you ?
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 11]: It seemed to me such a comfortable way to talk .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 22]: Well -- '' She yielded ; he rose , helped her to her feet , and pressed the light into being .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 36]: As the room took life from the sudden lines of fire within the bulbs Isabel made a deprecatory gesture , and , with a faint laugh of apologetic protest , turned quickly away from George .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 22]: What she meant was : `` You must n't see my face until I 've made it nicer for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 37]: Then she turned again to him , her eyes downcast , but no sign of tears in them , and she contrived to show him that there was the semblance of a smile upon her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 20]: She still wore her hat , and in her unsteady fingers she held a white envelope , somewhat crumpled .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 41]: `` Now , mother -- '' `` Wait , dearest , '' she said ; and though he stood stone cold , she lifted her arms , put them round him again , and pressed her cheek lightly to his .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 12]: `` Oh , you do look so troubled , poor dear !
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 32]: One thing you could n't doubt , beloved boy : you know I could never care for anything in the world as I care for you -- never , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 14]: `` Now , mother -- '' She released him , and stepped back .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 8]: `` Just a moment more , dearest .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 8]: I want you to read this first .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 8]: We can get at things better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 60]: She pressed into his hand the envelope she had brought with her , and as he opened it , and began to read the long enclosure , she walked slowly to the other end of the room ; then stood there , with her back to him , and her head drooping a little , until he had finished .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 11]: The sheets of paper were covered with Eugene 's handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 10]: George Amberson will bring you this , dear Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 7]: He is waiting while I write .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 23]: He and I have talked things over , and before he gives this to you he will tell you what has happened .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 65]: Of course I 'm rather confused , and have n't had time to think matters out very definitely , and yet I believe I should have been better prepared for what took place to-day -- I ought to have known it was coming , because I have understood for quite a long time that young George was getting to dislike me more and more .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 42]: Somehow , I 've never been able to get his friendship ; he 's always had a latent distrust of me -- or something like distrust -- and perhaps that 's made me sometimes a little awkward and diffident with him .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 25]: I think it may be he felt from the first that I cared a great deal about you , and he naturally resented it .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 38]: I think perhaps he felt this even during all the time when I was so careful -- at least I thought I was -- not to show , even to you , how immensely I did care .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 28]: And he may have feared that you were thinking too much about me -- even when you were n't and only liked me as an old friend .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 19]: It 's perfectly comprehensible to me , also , that at his age one gets excited about gossip .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 34]: Dear Isabel , what I 'm trying to get at , in my confused way , is that you and I do n't care about this nonsensical gossip , ourselves , at all .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 33]: Yesterday I thought the time had come when I could ask you to marry me , and you were dear enough to tell me `` sometime it might come to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 44]: Well , you and I , left to ourselves , and knowing what we have been and what we are , we 'd pay as much attention to `` talk '' as we would to any other kind of old cats ' mewing !
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 33]: We 'd not be very apt to let such things keep us from the plenty of life we have left to us for making up to ourselves for old unhappinesses and mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 36]: But now we 're faced with -- not the slander and not our own fear of it , because we have n't any , but someone else 's fear of it -- your son 's .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 24]: And , oh , dearest woman in the world , I know what your son is to you , and it frightens me !
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 36]: Let me explain a little : I do n't think he 'll change -- at twenty-one or twenty-two so many things appear solid and permanent and terrible which forty sees are nothing but disappearing miasma .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 15]: Forty ca n't tell twenty about this ; that 's the pity of it !
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 11]: Twenty can find out only by getting to be forty .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 23]: And so we come to this , dear : Will you live your own life your way , or George 's way ?
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 19]: I 'm going a little further , because it would be fatal not to be wholly frank now .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 33]: George will act toward you only as your long worship of him , your sacrifices -- all the unseen little ones every day since he was born -- will make him act .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 27]: Dear , it breaks my heart for you , but what you have to oppose now is the history of your own selfless and perfect motherhood .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 30]: I remember saying once that what you worshipped in your son was the angel you saw in him -- and I still believe that is true of every mother .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 27]: But in a mother 's worship she may not see that the Will in her son should not always be offered incense along with the angel .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 47]: I grow sick with fear for you -- for both you and me -- when I think how the Will against us two has grown strong through the love you have given the angel -- and how long your own sweet Will has served that other .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 7]: Are you strong enough , Isabel ?
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 6]: Can you make the fight ?
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 25]: I promise you that if you will take heart for it , you will find so quickly that it has all amounted to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 15]: You shall have happiness , and , in a little while , only happiness .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 26]: You need only to write me a line -- I ca n't come to your house -- and tell me where you will meet me .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 24]: We will come back in a month , and the angel in your son will bring him to you ; I promise it .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 24]: What is good in him will grow so fine , once you have beaten the turbulent Will -- but it must be beaten !
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 32]: Your brother , that good friend , is waiting with such patience ; I should not keep him longer -- and I am saying too much for wisdom , I fear .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 22]: But , oh , my dear , wo n't you be strong -- such a little short strength it would need !
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 18]: Do n't strike my life down twice , dear -- this time I 've not deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 2]: Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 46]: Concluding this missive , George tossed it abruptly from him so that one sheet fell upon his bed and the others upon the floor ; and at the faint noise of their falling Isabel came , and , kneeling , began to gather them up .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 9]: `` Did you read it , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 13]: George 's face was pale no longer , but pink with fury .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 7]: `` Yes , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 6]: `` All of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 8]: she asked gently , as she rose .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 4]: `` Certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 43]: She did not look at him , but kept her eyes downcast upon the letter in her hands , tremulously rearranging the sheets in order as she spoke -- and though she smiled , her smile was as tremulous as her hands .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 8]: Nervousness and an irresistible timidity possessed her .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 14]: `` I -- I wanted to say , George , '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 71]: `` I felt that if -- if some day it should happen -- I mean , if you came to feel differently about it , and Eugene and I -- that is if we found that it seemed the most sensible thing to do -- I was afraid you might think it would be a little queer about -- Lucy , I mean if -- if she were your step-sister .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 56]: Of course , she 'd not be even legally related to you , and if you -- if you cared for her -- '' Thus far she got stumblingly with what she wanted to say , while George watched her with a gaze that grew harder and hotter ; but here he cut her off .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 15]: `` I have already given up all idea of Lucy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 35]: `` Naturally , I could n't have treated her father as I deliberately did treat him -- I could hardly have done that and expected his daughter ever to speak to me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 17]: Isabel gave a quick cry of compassion , but he allowed her no opportunity to speak .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 38]: `` You need n't think I 'm making any particular sacrifice , '' he said sharply , `` though I would , quickly enough , if I thought it necessary in a matter of honour like this .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 30]: I was interested in her , and I could even say I did care for her ; but she proved pretty satisfactorily that she cared little enough about me !
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 54]: She went away right in the midst of a -- of a difference of opinion we were having ; she did n't even let me know she was going , and never wrote a line to me , and then came back telling everybody she 'd had ' a perfectly gorgeous time ! '
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 7]: That 's quite enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 22]: I 'm not precisely the sort to arrange for that kind of thing to be done to me more than once !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 23]: The truth is , we 're not congenial and we 'd found that much out , at least , before she left .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 27]: We should never have been happy ; she was ` superior ' all the time , and critical of me -- not very pleasant , that !
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 14]: I was disappointed in her , and I might as well say it .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 27]: I do n't think she has the very deepest nature in the world , and -- '' But Isabel put her hand timidly on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 34]: `` Georgie , dear , this is only a quarrel : all young people have them before they get adjusted , and you must n't let -- '' `` If you please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 9]: he said emphatically , moving back from her .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 7]: `` This is n't that kind .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 16]: It 's all over , and I do n't care to speak of it again .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 4]: It 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 6]: Do n't you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 9]: `` But , dear -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 15]: I want to talk to you about this letter of her father 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 30]: `` Yes , dear , that 's why -- '' `` It 's simply the most offensive piece of writing that I 've ever held in my hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 8]: She stepped back from him , startled .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 23]: `` But , dear , I thought -- '' `` I ca n't understand your even showing me such a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 12]: `` How did you happen to bring it to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 8]: `` Your uncle thought I 'd better .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 26]: He thought it was the simplest thing to do , and he said that he 'd suggested it to Eugene , and Eugene had agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: They thought -- '' `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 4]: George said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 11]: `` I should like to hear what they thought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 12]: `` They thought it would be the most straightforward thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 6]: George drew a long breath .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 11]: `` Well , what do you think , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 20]: `` I thought it would be the simplest and most straightforward thing ; I thought they were right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 4]: `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 9]: We 'll agree it was simple and straightforward .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 12]: Now , what do you think of that letter itself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 6]: She hesitated , looking away .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 26]: `` I -- of course I do n't agree with him in the way he speaks of you , dear -- except about the angel !
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 12]: I do n't agree with some of the things he implies .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 14]: You 've always been unselfish -- nobody knows that better than your mother .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 45]: When Fanny was left with nothing , you were so quick and generous to give up what really should have come to you , and -- '' `` And yet , '' George broke in , `` you see what he implies about me .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 27]: Do n't you think , really , that this was a pretty insulting letter for that man to be asking you to hand your son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 24]: `` You can see how fair he means to be , and he did n't ask for me to give it to you .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 14]: It was brother George who -- '' `` Never mind that , now !
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 26]: You say he tries to be fair , and yet do you suppose it ever occurs to him that I 'm doing my simple duty ?
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 14]: That I 'm doing what my father would do if he were alive ?
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 22]: That I 'm doing what my father would ask me to do if he could speak from his grave out yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 20]: Do you suppose it ever occurs to that man for one minute that I 'm protecting my mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 22]: George raised his voice , advancing upon the helpless lady fiercely ; and she could only bend her head before him .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 32]: `` He talks about my ` Will ' -- how it must be beaten down ; yes , and he asks my mother to do that little thing to please him !
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 3]: What for ?
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 12]: Why does he want me ` beaten ' by my mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 9]: Because I 'm trying to protect her name !
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 59]: He 's got my mother 's name bandied up and down the streets of this town till I ca n't step in those streets without wondering what every soul I meet is thinking of me and of my family , and now he wants you to marry him so that every gossip in town will say ` There !
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 6]: What did I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 9]: I guess that proves it 's true ! '
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 41]: You ca n't get away from it ; that 's exactly what they 'd say , and this man pretends he cares for you , and yet asks you to marry him and give them the right to say it .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 17]: He says he and you do n't care what they say , but I know better !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 13]: He may not care-probably he 's that kind -- but you do .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 20]: There never was an Amberson yet that would let the Amberson name go trailing in the dust like that !
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 77]: It 's the proudest name in this town and it 's going to stay the proudest ; and I tell you that 's the deepest thing in my nature -- not that I 'd expect Eugene Morgan to understand -- the very deepest thing in my nature is to protect that name , and to fight for it to the last breath when danger threatens it , as it does now -- through my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 21]: He turned from her , striding up and down and tossing his arms about , in a tumult of gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 18]: `` I ca n't believe it of you , that you 'd think of such a sacrilege !
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 9]: That 's what it would be -- sacrilege !
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 25]: When he talks about your unselfishness toward me , he 's right -- you have been unselfish and you have been a perfect mother .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 5]: But what about him ?
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 19]: Is it unselfish of him to want you to throw away your good name just to please him ?
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 15]: That 's all he asks of you -- and to quit being my mother !
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 12]: Do you think I can believe you really care for him ?
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 4]: I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 18]: You are my mother and you 're an Amberson -- and I believe you 're too proud !
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 19]: You 're too proud to care for a man who could write such a letter as that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 27]: He stopped , faced her , and spoke with more self-control : `` Well , what are you going to do about it , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 10]: George was right about his mother 's being proud .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 39]: And even when she laughed with a negro gardener , or even those few times in her life when people saw her weep , Isabel had a proud look -- something that was independent and graceful and strong .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 27]: But she did not have it now : she leaned against the wall , beside his dressing-table , and seemed beset with humility and with weakness .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 4]: Her head drooped .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 14]: `` What answer are you going to make to such a letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: George demanded , like a judge on the bench .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 15]: `` I -- I do n't quite know , dear , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 8]: `` Wait , '' she begged him .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 8]: `` I 'm so -- confused . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 13]: `` I want to know what you 're going to write him .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 24]: Do you think if you did what he wants you to I could bear to stay another day in this town , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 17]: Do you think I could ever bear even to see you again if you married him ?
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 16]: I 'd want to , but you surely know I just -- could n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 13]: She made a futile gesture , and seemed to breathe with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 37]: `` I -- I was n't -- quite sure , '' she faltered , `` about -- about it 's being wise for us to be married -- even before knowing how you feel about it .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 14]: I was n't even sure it was quite fair to -- to Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 24]: I have -- I seem to have that family trouble -- like father 's -- that I spoke to you about once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 8]: She managed a deprecatory little dry laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 23]: `` Not that it amounts to much , but I was n't at all sure that it would be fair to him .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 15]: Marrying does n't mean so much , after all -- not at my age .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 18]: It 's enough to know that -- that people think of you -- and to see them .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 45]: I thought we were all -- oh , pretty happy the way things were , and I do n't think it would mean giving up a great deal for him or me , either , if we just went on as we have been .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 16]: I -- I see him almost every day , and -- '' `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 8]: George 's voice was loud and stern .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 14]: `` Do you think you could go on seeing him after this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 16]: She had been talking helplessly enough before ; her tone was little more broken now .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 10]: `` Not -- not even -- see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 6]: `` How could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 3]: George cried .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 20]: `` Mother , it seems to me that if he ever set foot in this house again -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 7]: I ca n't speak of it !
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 26]: Could you see him , knowing what talk it makes every time he turns into this street , and knowing what that means to me ?
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 13]: Oh , I do n't understand all this -- I do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 34]: If you 'd told me , a year ago , that such things were going to happen , I 'd have thought you were insane -- and now I believe I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 30]: Then , after a preliminary gesture of despair , as though he meant harm to the ceiling , he flung himself heavily , face downward , upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 32]: His anguish was none the less real for its vehemence ; and the stricken lady came to him instantly and bent over him , once more enfolding him in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 23]: She said nothing , but suddenly her tears fell upon his head ; she saw them , and seemed to be startled .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 9]: `` Oh , this wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 17]: `` I 've never let you see me cry before , except when your father died .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 5]: I must n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 7]: And she ran from the room .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 19]: ... A little while after she had gone , George rose and began solemnly to dress for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 56]: At one stage of these conscientious proceedings he put on , temporarily , his long black velvet dressing-gown , and , happening to catch sight in his pier glass of the picturesque and medieval figure thus presented , he paused to regard it ; and something profoundly theatrical in his nature came to the surface .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 102]: His lips moved ; he whispered , half-aloud , some famous fragments : `` Tis not alone my inky cloak , good mother , Nor customary suits of solemn black ... '' For , in truth , the mirrored princely image , with hair dishevelled on the white brow , and the long tragic fall of black velvet from the shoulders , had brought about -LRB- in his thought at least -RRB- some comparisons of his own times , so out of joint , with those of that other gentle prince and heir whose widowed mother was minded to marry again .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 21]: `` But I have that within which passeth show ; These but the trappings and the suits of Woe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 29]: Not less like Hamlet did he feel and look as he sat gauntly at the dinner table with Fanny to partake of a meal throughout which neither spoke .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 29]: Isabel had sent word `` not to wait '' for her , an injunction it was as well they obeyed , for she did not come at all .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 21]: But with the renewal of sustenance furnished to his system , some relaxation must have occurred within the high-strung George .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 15]: Dinner was not quite finished when , without warning , sleep hit him hard .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 34]: His burning eyes could no longer restrain the lids above them ; his head sagged beyond control ; and he got to his feet , and went lurching upstairs , yawning with exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 41]: From the door of his room , which he closed mechanically , with his eyes shut , he went blindly to his bed , fell upon it soddenly , and slept -- with his face full upturned to the light .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 14]: It was after midnight when he woke , and the room was dark .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 48]: He had not dreamed , but he woke with the sense that somebody or something had been with him while he slept -- somebody or something infinitely compassionate ; somebody or something infinitely protective , that would let him come to no harm and to no grief .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 10]: He got up , and pressed the light on .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 29]: Pinned to the cover of his dressing-table was a square envelope , with the words , `` For you , dear , '' written in pencil upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 15]: But the message inside was in ink , a little smudged here and there .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 28]: I have been out to the mail-box , darling , with a letter I 've written to Eugene , and he 'll have it in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 22]: It would be unfair not to let him know at once , and my decision could not change if I waited .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: It would always be the same .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 57]: I think it , is a little better for me to write to you , like this , instead of waiting till you wake up and then telling you , because I 'm foolish and might cry again , and I took a vow once , long ago , that you should never see me cry .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 14]: Not that I 'll feel like crying when we talk things over tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 24]: I 'll be `` all right and fine '' -LRB- as you say so often -RRB- by that time -- do n't fear .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 38]: I think what makes me most ready to cry now is the thought of the terrible suffering in your poor face , and the unhappy knowledge that it is I , your mother who put it there .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 6]: It shall never come again !
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 12]: I love you better than anything and everything else on earth .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 9]: God gave you to me -- and oh !
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 27]: how thankful I have been every day of my life for that sacred gift -- and nothing can ever come between me and God 's gift .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 31]: I can not hurt you , and I can not let you stay hurt as you have been -- not another instant after you wake up , my darling boy !
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 6]: It is beyond my power .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 14]: And Eugene was right -- I know you could n't change about this .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 11]: Your suffering shows how deep-seated the feeling is within you .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 40]: So I 've written him just about what I think you would like me to -- though I told him I would always be fond of him and always his best friend , and I hoped his dearest friend .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 8]: He 'll understand about not seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 16]: He 'll understand that , though I did n't say it in so many words .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 11]: You must n't trouble about that -- he 'll understand .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: Good-night , my darling , my beloved , my beloved !
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 6]: You must n't be troubled .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 38]: I think I should n't mind anything very much so long as I have you `` all to myself '' -- as people say -- to make up for your long years away from me at college .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 17]: We 'll talk of what 's best to do in the morning , sha n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 14]: And for all this pain you 'll forgive your loving and devoted mother .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 2]: Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 78]: Chapter XXVII Having finished some errands downtown , the next afternoon , George Amberson Minafer was walking up National Avenue on his homeward way when he saw in the distance , coming toward him , upon the same side of the street , the figure of a young lady -- a figure just under the middle height , comely indeed , and to be mistaken for none other in the world -- even at two hundred yards .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 40]: To his sharp discomfiture his heart immediately forced upon him the consciousness of its acceleration ; a sudden warmth about his neck made him aware that he had turned red , and then , departing , left him pale .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 39]: For a panicky moment he thought of facing about in actual flight ; he had little doubt that Lucy would meet him with no token of recognition , and all at once this probability struck him as unendurable .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 24]: And if she did not speak , was it the proper part of chivalry to lift his hat and take the cut bareheaded ?
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 27]: Or should the finer gentleman acquiesce in the lady 's desire for no further acquaintance , and pass her with stony mien and eyes constrained forward ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 8]: George was a young man badly flustered .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 19]: But the girl approaching him was unaware of his trepidation , being perhaps somewhat preoccupied with her own .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 16]: She saw only that he was pale , and that his eyes were darkly circled .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 43]: But here he was advantaged with her , for the finest touch to his good looks was given by this toning down ; neither pallor nor dark circles detracting from them , but rather adding to them a melancholy favour of distinction .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 62]: George had retained his mourning , a tribute completed down to the final details of black gloves and a polished ebony cane -LRB- which he would have been pained to name otherwise than as a `` walking-stick '' -RRB- and in the aura of this sombre elegance his straight figure and drawn face were not without a tristful and appealing dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 43]: In everything outward he was cause enough for a girl 's cheek to flush , her heart to beat faster , and her eyes to warm with the soft light that came into Lucy 's now , whether she would or no .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 29]: If his spirit had been what his looks proclaimed it , she would have rejoiced to let the light glow forth which now shone in spite of her .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 33]: For a long time , thinking of that spirit of his , and what she felt it should be , she had a persistent sense : `` It must be there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 11]: but she had determined to believe this folly no longer .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 21]: Nevertheless , when she met him at the Sharons ' , she had been far less calm than she seemed .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 24]: People speaking casually of Lucy were apt to define her as `` a little beauty , '' a definition short of the mark .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 39]: She was `` a little beauty , '' but an independent , masterful , sell-reliant little American , of whom her father 's earlier gipsyings and her own sturdiness had made a woman ever since she was fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 58]: But though she was the mistress of her own ways and no slave to any lamp save that of her own conscience , she had a weakness : she had fallen in love with George Amberson Minafer at first sight , and no matter how she disciplined herself , she had never been able to climb out .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 11]: The thing had happened to her ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 29]: George had looked just the way she had always wanted someone to look -- the riskiest of all the moonshine ambushes wherein tricky romance snares credulous young love .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 21]: But what was fatal to Lucy was that this thing having happened to her , she could not change it .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 50]: No matter what she discovered in George 's nature she was unable to take away what she had given him ; and though she could think differently about him , she could not feel differently about him , for she was one of those too faithful victims of glamour .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 39]: When she managed to keep the picture of George away from her mind 's eye , she did well enough ; but when she let him become visible , she could not choose but love what she disdained .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 49]: She was a little angel who had fallen in love with high-handed Lucifer ; quite an experience , and not apt to be soon succeeded by any falling in love with a tamer party -- and the unhappy truth was that George did make better men seem tame .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 17]: But though she was a victim , she was a heroic one , anything but helpless .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 19]: As they drew nearer , George tried to prepare himself to meet her with some remnants of aplomb .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 65]: He decided that he would keep on looking straight ahead , and lift his hand toward his hat at the very last moment when it would be possible for her to see him out of the corner of her eye : then when she thought it over later , she would not be sure whether he had saluted her or merely rubbed his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 60]: And there was the added benefit that any third person who might chance to look from a window , or from a passing carriage , would not think that he was receiving a snub , because he did not intend to lift his hat , but , timing the gesture properly , would in fact actually rub his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 67]: These were the hasty plans which occupied his thoughts until he was within about fifty feet of her -- when he ceased to have either plans or thoughts , he had kept his eyes from looking full at her until then , and as he saw her , thus close at hand , and coming nearer , a regret that was dumfounding took possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 16]: For the first time he had the sense of having lost something of overwhelming importance .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 25]: Lucy did not keep to the right , but came straight to meet him , smiling , and with her hand offered to him .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 14]: `` Why -- you -- '' he stammered , as he took it .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 20]: `` Have n't you -- '' What he meant to say was , `` Have n't you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 7]: `` Have n't I what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 14]: she asked ; and he saw that Eugene had not yet told her .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 16]: `` May I -- may I turn and walk with you a little way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 6]: `` Yes , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 4]: she said cordially .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 31]: He would not have altered what had been done : he was satisfied with all that -- satisfied that it was right , and that his own course was right .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 18]: But he began to perceive a striking inaccuracy in some remarks he had made to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 100]: Now when he had put matters in such shape that even by the relinquishment of his `` ideals of life '' he could not have Lucy , knew that he could never have her , and knew that when Eugene told her the history of yesterday he could not have a glance or word even friendly from her -- now when he must in good truth `` give up all idea of Lucy , '' he was amazed that he could have used such words as `` no particular sacrifice , '' and believed them when he said them !
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 35]: She had looked never in his life so bewitchingly pretty as she did today ; and as he walked beside her he was sure that she was the most exquisite thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: `` Lucy , '' he said huskily , `` I want to tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 5]: Something that matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 17]: `` I hope it 's a lively something then , '' she said ; and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 14]: `` Papa 's been so glum to-day he 's scarcely spoken to me .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 29]: Your Uncle George Amberson came to see him an hour ago and they shut themselves up in the library , and your uncle looked as glum as papa .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 16]: I 'd be glad if you 'll tell me a funny story , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 49]: `` Well , it may seem one to you , '' he said bitterly , `` Just to begin with : when you went away you did n't let me know ; not even a word -- not a line -- '' Her manner persisted in being inconsequent .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 9]: `` Why , no , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 10]: `` I just trotted off for some visits . ''
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 21]: `` Well , at least you might have -- '' `` Why , no , '' she said again briskly .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 8]: `` Do n't you remember , George ?
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 25]: We 'd had a grand quarrel , and did n't speak to each other all the way home from a long , long drive !
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 27]: So , as we could n't play together like good children , of course it was plain that we ought n't to play at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 4]: `` Play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 27]: What I mean is that we 'd come to the point where it was time to quit playing -- well , what we were playing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 13]: `` At being lovers , you mean , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 10]: `` Something like that , '' she said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 18]: `` For us two , playing at being lovers was just the same as playing at cross-purposes .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 22]: I had all the purposes , and that gave you all the crossness : things were n't getting along at all .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 5]: It was absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 13]: `` Well , have it your own way , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 9]: `` It need n't have been absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 11]: `` No , it could n't help but be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 5]: she informed him cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 19]: `` The way I am and the way you are , it could n't ever be anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: So what was the use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 16]: `` I do n't know , '' he sighed , and his sigh was abysmal .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 42]: `` But what I wanted to tell you is this : when you went away , you did n't let me know and did n't care how or when I heard it , but I 'm not like that with you .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 8]: This time , I 'm going away .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 9]: That 's what I wanted to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 10]: I 'm going away tomorrow night -- indefinitely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 4]: She nodded sunnily .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 7]: `` That 's nice for you .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 14]: I hope you 'll have ever so jolly a time , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 13]: `` I do n't expect to have a particularly jolly time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 23]: `` Well , then , '' she laughed , `` if I were you I do n't think I 'd go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 14]: It seemed impossible to impress this distracting creature , to make her serious .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 17]: `` Lucy , '' he said desperately , `` this is our last walk together . ''
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 4]: `` Evidently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 13]: she said , `` if you 're going away tomorrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 22]: `` Lucy -- this may be the last time I 'll see you -- ever -- ever in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 37]: At that she looked at him quickly , across her shoulder , but she smiled as brightly as before , and with the same cordial inconsequence : `` Oh , I can hardly think that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 13]: `` And of course I 'd be awfully sorry to think it .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 13]: You 're not moving away , are you , to live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 24]: `` And even if you were , of course you 'd be coming back to visit your relatives every now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 11]: `` I do n't know when I 'm coming back .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 15]: Mother and I are starting to-morrow night for a trip around the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 7]: At this she did look thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 9]: `` Your mother is going with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 17]: `` Lucy , does n't it make any difference to you that I am going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 9]: At this her cordial smile instantly appeared again .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 10]: `` Yes , of course , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 12]: `` I 'm sure I 'll miss you ever so much .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 8]: Are you to be gone long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 6]: He stared at her wanly .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 10]: `` I told you indefinitely , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 15]: `` We 've made no plans -- at all -- for coming back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 10]: `` That does sound like a long trip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 4]: she exclaimed admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 25]: `` Do you plan to be travelling all the time , or will you stay in some one place the greater part of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 13]: I think it would be lovely to -- '' `` Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 9]: He halted ; and she stopped with him .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 35]: They had come to a corner at the edge of the `` business section '' of the city , and people were everywhere about them , brushing against them , sometimes , in passing .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 16]: `` I ca n't stand this , '' George said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 28]: `` I 'm just about ready to go in this drug-store here , and ask the clerk for something to keep me from dying in my tracks !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 12]: It 's quite a shock , you see , Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 17]: `` To find out certainly , at last , how deeply you 've cared for me !
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 10]: To see how much difference this makes to you !
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 10]: By Jove , I have mattered to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 9]: Her cordial smile was tempered now with good-nature .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 4]: She laughed indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 16]: `` Surely you do n't want me to do pathos on a downtown corner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 11]: `` You would n't ` do pathos ' anywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 14]: `` Well -- do n't you think pathos is generally rather fooling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 13]: `` I ca n't stand this any longer , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 5]: `` I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 5]: Good-bye , Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 5]: He took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 16]: `` It 's good-bye -- I think it 's good-bye for good , Lucy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 3]: `` Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 12]: I do hope you 'll have the most splendid trip . ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 14]: She gave his hand a cordial little grip , then released it lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 8]: `` Give my love to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 15]: He turned heavily away , and a moment later glanced back over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 71]: She had not gone on , but stood watching him , that same casual , cordial smile on her face to the very last ; and now , as he looked back , she emphasized her friendly unconcern by waving her small hand to him cheerily , though perhaps with the slightest hint of preoccupation , as if she had begun to think of the errand that brought her downtown .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 33]: In his mind , George had already explained her to his own poignant dissatisfaction -- some blond pup , probably , whom she had met during that `` perfectly gorgeous time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 11]: And he strode savagely onward , not looking back again .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 13]: But Lucy remained where she was until he was out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 20]: Then she went slowly into the drugstore which had struck George as a possible source of stimulant for himself .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 28]: `` Please let me have a few drops of aromatic spirits of ammonia in a glass of water , '' she said , with the utmost composure .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 6]: `` Yes , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 22]: said the impressionable clerk , who had been looking at her through the display window as she stood on the corner .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 43]: But a moment later , as he turned from the shelves of glass jars against the wall , with the potion she had asked for in his hand , he uttered an exclamation : `` For goshes ' sake , Miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 27]: And , describing this adventure to his fellow-boarders , that evening , `` Sagged pretty near to the counter , she was , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 22]: `` If I had n't been a bright , quick , ready-for-anything young fella she 'd ` a ' flummixed plum !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 26]: I was watchin ' her out the window -- talkin ' to some young s ` iety fella , and she was all right then .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 13]: She was all right when she come in the store , too .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 21]: Yes , sir ; the prettiest girl that ever walked in our place and took one good look at me .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 18]: I reckon it must be the truth what some you town wags say about my face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 32]: Chapter XXVIII At that hour the heroine of the susceptible clerk 's romance was engaged in brightening the rosy little coal fire under the white mantelpiece in her pretty white-and-blue boudoir .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 53]: Four photographs all framed in decorous plain silver went to the anthracite 's fierce destruction -- frames and all -- and three packets of letters and notes in a charming Florentine treasure-box of painted wood ; nor was the box , any more than the silver frames , spared this rousing finish .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 35]: Thrown heartily upon live coal , the fine wood sparkled forth in stars , then burst into an alarming blaze which scorched the white mantelpiece , but Lucy stood and looked on without moving .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 15]: It was not Eugene who told her what had happened at Isabel 's door .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 39]: When she got home , she found Fanny Minafer waiting for her -- a secret excursion of Fanny 's for the purpose , presumably , of `` letting out '' again ; because that was what she did .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 58]: She told Lucy everything -LRB- except her own lamentable part in the production of the recent miseries -RRB- and concluded with a tribute to George : `` The worst of it is , he thinks he 's been such a hero , and Isabel does , too , and that makes him more than twice as awful .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 17]: It 's been the same all his life : everything he did was noble and perfect .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 25]: He had a domineering nature to begin with , and she let it go on , and fostered it till it absolutely ruled her .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 18]: I never saw a plainer case of a person 's fault making them pay for having it !
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 32]: She goes about , overseeing the packing and praising George and pretending to be perfectly cheerful about what he 's making her do and about the dreadful things he 's done .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 19]: She pretends he did such a fine thing -- so manly and protective -- going to Mrs. Johnson .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 25]: And so heroic -- doing what his ` principles ' made him -- even though he knew what it would cost him with you !
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 17]: And all the while it 's almost killing her -- what he said to your father !
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 55]: She 's always been lofty enough , so to speak , and had the greatest idea of the Ambersons being superior to the rest of the world , and all that , but rudeness , or anything like a ` scene , ' or any bad manners -- they always just made her sick !
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 20]: But she could never see what George 's manners were -- oh , it 's been a terrible adulation !
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 37]: ... It 's going to be a task for me , living in that big house , all alone : you must come and see me -- I mean after they 've gone , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 13]: I 'll go crazy if I do n't see something of people .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 12]: I 'm sure you 'll come as often as you can .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 21]: I know you too well to think you 'll be sensitive about coming there , or being reminded of George .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 35]: Thank heaven you 're too well-balanced , '' Miss Fanny concluded , with a profound fervour , `` you 're too well-balanced to let anything affect you deeply about that -- that monkey ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 67]: The four photographs and the painted Florentine box went to their cremation within the same hour that Miss Fanny spoke ; and a little later Lucy called her father in , as he passed her door , and pointed to the blackened area on the underside of the mantelpiece , and to the burnt heap upon the coal , where some metallic shapes still retained outline .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 35]: She flung her arms about his neck in passionate sympathy , telling him that she knew what had happened to him ; and presently he began to comfort her and managed an embarrassed laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 9]: `` Well , well -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 18]: `` I was too old for such foolishness to be getting into my head , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 32]: `` And if you knew how I despise myself for -- for ever having thought one instant about -- oh , Miss Fanny called him the right name : that monkey !
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 4]: He is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 31]: `` There , I think I agree with you , '' Eugene said grimly , and in his eyes there was a steady light of anger that was to last .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 13]: `` Yes , I think I agree with you about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 18]: `` There 's only one thing to do with such a person , '' she said vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 15]: `` That 's to put him out of our thoughts forever -- forever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 54]: And yet , the next day , at six o'clock , which was the hour , Fanny had told her , when George and his mother were to leave upon their long journey , Lucy touched that scorched place on her mantel with her hand just as the little clock above it struck .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 49]: Then , after this odd , unconscious gesture , she went to a window and stood between the curtains , looking out into the cold November dusk ; and in spite of every reasoning and reasonable power within her , a pain of loneliness struck through her heart .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 33]: The dim street below her window , the dark houses across the way , the vague air itself -- all looked empty , and cold and -LRB- most of all -RRB- uninteresting .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 19]: Something more sombre than November dusk took the colour from them and gave them that air of desertion .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 75]: The light of her fire , flickering up behind her showed suddenly a flying group of tiny snowflakes nearing the window-pane ; and for an instant she felt the sensation of being dragged through a snows drift under a broken cutter , with a boy 's arms about her -- an arrogant , handsome , too-conquering boy , who nevertheless did his best to get hurt himself , keeping her from any possible harm .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 28]: She shook the picture out of her eyes indignantly , then came and sat before her fire , and looked long and long at the blackened mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 23]: She did not have the mantelpiece repainted -- and , since she did not , might as well have kept his photographs .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 19]: One forgets what made the scar upon his hand but not what made the scar upon his wall .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 47]: She played no marche funebre upon her piano , even though Chopin 's romantic lamentation was then at the top of nine-tenths of the music-racks in the country , American youth having recently discovered the distinguished congeniality between itself and this deathless bit of deathly gloom .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 45]: She did not even play `` Robin Adair '' ; she played `` Bedelia '' and all the new cake-walks , for she was her father 's housekeeper , and rightly looked upon the office as being the same as that of his heart-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 20]: Therefore it was her affair to keep both house and heart in what state of cheerfulness might be contrived .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 93]: She made him `` go out '' more than ever ; made him take her to all the gayeties of that winter , declining to go herself unless he took her , and , though Eugene danced no more , and quoted Shakespeare to prove all lightfoot caperings beneath the dignity of his age , she broke his resolution for him at the New Year 's Eve `` Assembly '' and half coaxed , half dragged him forth upon the floor , and made him dance the New Year in with her .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 60]: New faces appeared at the dances of the winter ; new faces had been appearing everywhere , for that matter , and familiar ones were disappearing , merged in the increasing crowd , or gone forever and missed a little and not long ; for the town was growing and changing as it never had grown and changed before .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 29]: It was heaving up in the middle incredibly ; it was spreading incredibly ; and as it heaved and spread , it befouled itself and darkened its sky .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 109]: Its boundary was mere shapelessness on the run ; a raw , new house would appear on a country road ; four or five others would presently be built at intervals between it and the outskirts of the town ; the country road would turn into an asphalt street with a brick-faced drugstore and a frame grocery at a corner ; then bungalows and six-room cottages would swiftly speckle the open green spaces -- and a farm had become a suburb which would immediately shoot out other suburbs into the country , on one side , and , on the other , join itself solidly to the city .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 53]: You drove between pleasant fields and woodland groves one spring day ; and in the autumn , passing over the same ground , you were warned off the tracks by an interurban trolley-car 's gonging , and beheld , beyond cement sidewalks just dry , new house-owners busy `` moving in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 11]: Gasoline and electricity were performing the miracles Eugene had predicted .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 10]: But the great change was in the citizenry itself .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 28]: What was left of the patriotic old-stock generation that had fought the Civil War , and subsequently controlled politics , had become venerable and was little heeded .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 27]: The descendants of the pioneers and early settlers were merging into the new crowd , becoming part of it , little to be distinguished from it .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 45]: What happened to Boston and to Broadway happened in degree to the Midland city ; the old stock became less and less typical , and of the grown people who called the place home , less than a third had been born in it .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 58]: There was a German quarter ; there was a Jewish quarter ; there was a negro quarter -- square miles of it -- called `` Bucktown '' ; there were many Irish neighbourhoods ; and there were large settlements of Italians , and of Hungarians , and of Rumanians , and of Serbians and other Balkan peoples .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 17]: But not the emigrants , themselves , were the almost dominant type on the streets downtown .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 42]: That type was the emigrant 's prosperous offspring : descendant of the emigrations of the Seventies and Eighties and Nineties , those great folk-journeyings in search not so directly of freedom and democracy as of more money for the same labour .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 17]: A new Midlander -- in fact , a new American -- was beginning dimly to emerge .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 11]: A new spirit of citizenship had already sharply defined itself .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 20]: It was idealistic , and its ideals were expressed in the new kind of young men in business downtown .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 17]: They were optimists -- optimists to the point of belligerence -- their motto being `` Boost !
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 5]: Do n't Knock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 15]: And they were hustlers , believing in hustling and in honesty because both paid .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 18]: They loved their city and worked for it with a plutonic energy which was always ardently vocal .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 51]: They were viciously governed , but they sometimes went so far to struggle for better government on account of the helpful effect of good government on the price of real estate and `` betterment '' generally ; the politicians could not go too far with them , and knew it .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 65]: The idealists planned and strove and shouted that their city should become a better , better , and better city -- and what they meant , when they used the word `` better , '' was `` more prosperous , '' and the core of their idealism was this : `` The more prosperous my beloved city , the more prosperous beloved I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 67]: They had one supreme theory : that the perfect beauty and happiness of cities and of human life was to be brought about by more factories ; they had a mania for factories ; there was nothing they would not do to cajole a factory away from another city ; and they were never more piteously embittered than when another city cajoled one away from them .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 50]: What they meant by Prosperity was credit at the bank ; but in exchange for this credit they got nothing that was not dirty , and , therefore , to a sane mind , valueless ; since whatever was cleaned was dirty again before the cleaning was half done .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 15]: For , as the town grew , it grew dirty with an incredible completeness .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 22]: The idealists put up magnificent business buildings and boasted of them , but the buildings were begrimed before they were finished .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 18]: They boasted of their libraries , of their monuments and statues ; and poured soot on them .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 18]: They boasted of their schools , but the schools were dirty , like the children within them .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 12]: This was not the fault of the children or their mothers .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 21]: It was the fault of the idealists , who said : `` The more dirt , the more prosperity . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 31]: They drew patriotic , optimistic breaths of the flying powdered filth of the streets , and took the foul and heavy smoke with gusto into the profundities of their lungs .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 3]: `` Boost !
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 5]: Do n't knock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 3]: they said .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 27]: And every year or so they boomed a great Clean-up Week , when everybody was supposed to get rid of the tin cans in his backyard .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 24]: They were happiest when the tearing down and building up were most riotous , and when new factory districts were thundering into life .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 63]: In truth , the city came to be like the body of a great dirty man , skinned , to show his busy works , yet wearing a few barbaric ornaments ; and such a figure carved , coloured , and discoloured , and set up in the market-place , would have done well enough as the god of the new people .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 48]: Such a god they had indeed made in their own image , as all peoples make the god they truly serve ; though of course certain of the idealists went to church on Sunday , and there knelt to Another , considered to be impractical in business .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 22]: But while the Growing went on , this god of their market-place was their true god , their familiar and spirit-control .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 48]: They did not know that they were his helplessly obedient slaves , nor could they ever hope to realize their serfdom -LRB- as the first step toward becoming free men -RRB- until they should make the strange and hard discovery that matter should serve man 's spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 18]: `` Prosperity '' meant good credit at the bank , black lungs , and housewives ' Purgatory .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 24]: The women fought the dirt all they could ; but if they let the air into their houses they let in the dirt .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 17]: It shortened their lives , and kept them from the happiness of ever seeing anything white .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 31]: And thus , as the city grew , the time came when Lucy , after a hard struggle , had to give up her blue-and-white curtains and her white walls .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 25]: Indoors , she put everything into dull gray and brown , and outside had the little house painted the dark green nearest to black .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 32]: Then she knew , of course , that everything was as dirty as ever , but was a little less distressed because it no longer looked so dirty as it was .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 8]: These were bad times for Amberson Addition .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 45]: This quarter , already old , lay within a mile of the centre of the town , but business moved in other directions ; and the Addition 's share of Prosperity was only the smoke and dirt , with the bank credit left out .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 50]: The owners of the original big houses sold them , or rented them to boarding-house keepers , and the tenants of the multitude of small houses moved `` farther out '' -LRB- where the smoke was thinner -RRB- or into apartment houses , which were built by dozens now .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 44]: Cheaper tenants took their places , and the rents were lower and lower , and the houses shabbier and shabbier -- for all these shabby houses , burning soft coal , did their best to help in the destruction of their own value .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 44]: They helped to make the quarter so dingy and the air so foul to breathe that no one would live there who had money enough to get `` farther out '' where there were glimpses of ungrayed sky and breaths of cleaner winds .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 31]: And with the coming of the new speed , `` farther out '' was now as close to business as the Addition had been in the days of its prosperity .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 6]: Distances had ceased to matter .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 24]: The five new houses , built so closely where had been the fine lawn of the Amberson Mansion , did not look new .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 42]: When they were a year old they looked as old as they would ever look ; and two of them were vacant , having never been rented , for the Major 's mistake about apartment houses had been a disastrous one .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 11]: `` He guessed wrong , '' George Amberson said . .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 10]: `` He guessed wrong at just the wrong time !
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 33]: Housekeeping in a house is harder than in an apartment ; and where the smoke and dirt are as thick as they are in the Addition , women ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 17]: People were crazy for apartments -- too bad he could n't have seen it in time .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 3]: Poor man !
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 32]: he digs away at his ledgers by his old gas drop-light lamp almost every night -- he still refuses to let the Mansion be torn up for wiring , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 16]: But he had one painful satisfaction this spring : he got his taxes lowered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 18]: Amberson laughed ruefully , and Fanny Minafer asked how the Major could have managed such an economy .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 34]: They were sitting upon the veranda at Isabel 's one evening during the third summer of the absence of their nephew and his mother ; and the conversation had turned toward Amberson finances .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 17]: `` I said it was a ` painful satisfaction , ' Fanny , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 22]: `` The property has gone down in value , and they assessed it lower than they did fifteen years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 16]: `` But farther out -- '' `` Oh , yes , ` farther out ! '
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 14]: Prices are magnificent ` farther out , ' and farther in , too !
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 13]: We just happen to be the wrong spot , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 24]: Not that I do n't think something could be done if father would let me have a hand ; but he wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 11]: He ca n't , I suppose I ought to say .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 40]: He 's ` always done his own figuring , ' he says ; and it 's his lifelong habit to keep his affairs : and even his books , to himself , and just hand us out the money .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 10]: Heaven knows he 's done enough of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 30]: He sighed ; and both were silent , looking out at the long flares of the constantly passing automobile headlights , shifting in vast geometric demonstrations against the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 27]: Now and then a bicycle wound its nervous way among these portents , or , at long intervals , a surrey or buggy plodded forlornly by .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 18]: `` There seem to be so many ways of making money nowadays , '' Fanny said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 31]: `` Every day I hear of a new fortune some person has got hold of , one way or another -- nearly always it 's somebody you never heard of .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 33]: It does n't seem all to be in just making motor cars ; I hear there 's a great deal in manufacturing these things that motor cars use -- new inventions particularly .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 34]: I met dear old Frank Bronson the other day , and he told me -- '' `` Oh , yes , even dear old Frank 's got the fever , '' Amberson laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 10]: `` He 's as wild as any of them .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 13]: He told me about this invention he 's gone into , too .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 6]: ` Millions in it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 26]: Some new electric headlight better than anything yet -- ` every car in America ca n't help but have 'em , ' and all that .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 36]: He 's putting half he 's laid by into it , and the fact is , he almost talked me into getting father to ` finance me ' enough for me to go into it .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 3]: Poor father !
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 6]: he 's financed me before !
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 33]: I suppose he would again if I had the heart to ask him ; and this seems to be a good thing , though probably old Frank is a little too sanguine .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 12]: At any rate , I 've been thinking it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 9]: `` So have I , '' Fanny admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 13]: `` He seemed to be certain it would pay twenty-five per cent .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 21]: the first year , and enormously more after that ; and I 'm only getting four on my little principal .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 25]: People are making such enormous fortunes out of everything to do with motor cars , it does seem as if -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 14]: `` Well , I told him I 'd think it over seriously . ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 16]: `` We may turn out to be partners and millionaires then , '' Amberson laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 11]: `` I thought I 'd ask Eugene 's advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 10]: `` I wish you would , '' said Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 15]: `` He probably knows exactly how much profit there would be in this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 32]: Eugene 's advice was to `` go slow '' : he thought electric lights for automobiles were `` coming -- someday but probably not until certain difficulties could be overcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 45]: Altogether , he was discouraging , but by this time his two friends `` had the fever '' as thoroughly as old Frank Bronson himself had it ; for they had been with Bronson to see the light working beautifully in a machine shop .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 35]: They were already enthusiastic , and after asking Eugene 's opinion they argued with him , telling him how they had seen with their own eyes that the difficulties he mentioned had been overcome .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 4]: `` Perfectly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 3]: Fanny cried .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 22]: `` And if it worked in the shop it 's bound to work any place else , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 52]: He would not agree that it was `` bound to '' -- yet , being pressed , was driven to admit that `` it might , '' and , retiring from what was developing into an oratorical contest , repeated a warning about not `` putting too much into it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 28]: George Amberson also laid stress on this caution later , though the Major had `` financed him '' again , and he was `` going in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 21]: `` You must be careful to leave yourself a ` margin of safety , ' Fanny , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 44]: `` I 'm confident that is a pretty conservative investment of its kind , and all the chances are with us , but you must be careful to leave yourself enough to fall back on , in case anything should go wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 4]: Fanny deceived him .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 45]: In the impossible event of `` anything going wrong '' she would have enough left to `` live on , '' she declared , and laughed excitedly , for she was having the best time that had come to her since Wilbur 's death .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 27]: Like so many women for whom money has always been provided without their understanding how , she was prepared to be a thorough and irresponsible plunger .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 54]: Amberson , in his wearier way , shared her excitement , and in the winter , when the exploiting company had been formed , and he brought Fanny , her importantly engraved shares of stock , he reverted to his prediction of possibilities , made when they first spoke of the new light .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 14]: `` We seem to be partners , all right , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 18]: `` Now let 's go ahead and be millionaires before Isabel and young George come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 7]: `` When they come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 19]: she echoed sorrowfully -- and it was a phrase which found an evasive echo in Isabel 's letters .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 34]: In these letters Isabel was always planning pleasant things that she and Fanny and the Major and George and `` brother George '' would do -- when she and her son came home .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 16]: `` They 'll find things pretty changed , I 'm afraid , '' Fanny said .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 9]: `` If they ever do come home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 22]: Amberson went over , the next summer , and joined his sister and nephew in Paris , where they were living .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 24]: `` Isabel does want to come home , '' he told Fanny gravely , on the day of his return , in October .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 54]: `` She 's wanted to for a long while -- and she ought to come while she can stand the journey -- '' And he amplified this statement , leaving Fanny looking startled and solemn when Lucy came by to drive him out to dinner at the new house Eugene had just completed .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 60]: This was no white-and-blue cottage , but a great Georgian picture in brick , five miles north of Amberson Addition , with four acres of its own hedged land between it and its next neighbour ; and Amberson laughed wistfully as they turned in between the stone and brick gate pillars , and rolled up the crushed stone driveway .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 19]: `` I wonder , Lucy , if history 's going on forever repeating itself , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 31]: `` I wonder if this town 's going on building up things and rolling over them , as poor father once said it was rolling over his poor old heart .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 39]: It looks like it : here 's the Amberson Mansion again , only it 's Georgian instead of nondescript Romanesque ; but it 's just the same Amberson Mansion that my father built long before you were born .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 16]: The only difference is that it 's your father who 's built this one now .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 12]: It 's all the same , in the long run . ''
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 58]: Lucy did not quite understand , but she laughed as a friend should , and , taking his arm , showed him through vast rooms where ivory-panelled walls and trim window hangings were reflected dimly in dark , rugless floors , and the sparse furniture showed that Lucy had been `` collecting '' with a long purse .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 7]: `` You have been going it !
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 33]: Fanny tells me you had a great ` house-warming ' dance , and you keep right on being the belle of the ball , not any softer-hearted than you used to be .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 32]: Fred Kinney 's father says you 've refused Fred so often that he got engaged to Janie Sharon just to prove that someone would have him in spite of his hair .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 29]: Well , the material world do move , and you 've got the new kind of house it moves into nowadays -- if it has the new price !
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 37]: And even the grand old expanses of plate glass we used to be so proud of at the other Amberson Mansion -- they 've gone , too , with the crowded heavy gold and red stuff .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 2]: Curious !
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 51]: We 've still got the plate glass windows , though all we can see out of 'em is the smoke and the old Johnson house , which is a counter-jumper 's boardinghouse now , while you 've got a view , and you cut it all up into little panes .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 14]: Well , you 're pretty refreshingly out of the smoke up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 11]: `` Yes , for a while , '' Lucy laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 13]: `` Until it comes and we have to move out farther . ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 13]: `` No , you 'll stay here , '' he assured her .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 13]: `` It will be somebody else who 'll move out farther . ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 44]: He continued to talk of the house after Eugene arrived , and gave them no account of his journey until they had retired from the dinner table to Eugene 's library , a gray and shadowy room , where their coffee was brought .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 27]: Then , equipped with a cigar , which seemed to occupy his attention , Amberson spoke in a casual tone of his sister and her son .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 27]: `` I found Isabel as well as usual , '' he said , `` only I 'm afraid ` as usual ' is n't particularly well .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 19]: Sydney and Amelia had been up to Paris in the spring , but she had n't seen them .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 10]: Somebody told her they were there , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 48]: They 'd left Florence and were living in Rome ; Amelia 's become a Catholic and is said to give great sums to charity and to go about with the gentry in consequence , but Sydney 's ailing and lives in a wheel-chair most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 13]: It struck me Isabel ought to be doing the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 48]: He paused , bestowing minute care upon the removal of the little band from his cigar ; and as he seemed to have concluded his narrative , Eugene spoke out of the shadow beyond a heavily shaded lamp : `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 4]: he asked quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 24]: `` Oh , she 's cheerful enough , '' said Amberson , still not looking at either his young hostess or her father .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 15]: `` At least , '' he added , `` she manages to seem so .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 13]: I 'm afraid she has n't been really well for several years .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 28]: She is n't stout you know -- she has n't changed in looks much -- and she seems rather alarmingly short of breath for a slender person .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 21]: Father 's been that way for years , of course ; but never nearly so much as Isabel is now .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 39]: Of course she makes nothing of it , but it seemed rather serious to me when I noticed she had to stop and rest twice to get up the one short flight of stairs in their two-floor apartment .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 16]: I told her I thought she ought to make George let her come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 5]: `` Let her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 8]: Eugene repeated , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 7]: `` Does she want to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 7]: `` She does n't urge it .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 38]: George seems to like the life there-in his grand , gloomy , and peculiar way ; and of course she 'll never change about being proud of him and all that -- he 's quite a swell .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 21]: But in spite of anything she said , rather than because , I know she does indeed want to come .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 40]: She 'd like to be with father , of course ; and I think she 's -- well , she intimated one day that she feared it might even happen that she would n't get to see him again .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 66]: At the time I thought she referred to his age and feebleness , but on the boat , coming home , I remembered the little look of wistfulness , yet of resignation , with which she said it , and it struck me all at once that I 'd been mistaken : I saw she was really thinking of her own state of health . ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 18]: `` I see , '' Eugene said , his voice even lower than it had been before .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 15]: `` And you say he wo n't ` let ' her come home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 13]: Amberson laughed , but still continued to be interested in his cigar .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 11]: `` Oh , I do n't think he uses force !
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 7]: He 's very gentle with her .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 38]: I doubt if the subject is mentioned between them , and yet -- and yet , knowing my interesting nephew as you do , would n't you think that was about the way to put it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 12]: `` Knowing him as I do-yes , '' said Eugene slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 16]: `` Yes , I should think that was about the way to put it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 35]: A murmur out of the shadows beyond him -- a faint sound , musical and feminine , yet expressive of a notable intensity -- seemed to indicate that Lucy was of the same opinion .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 40]: Chapter XXIX `` Let her '' was correct ; but the time came -- and it came in the spring of the next year when it was no longer a question of George 's letting his mother come home .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 47]: He had to bring her , and to bring her quickly if she was to see her father again ; and Amberson had been right : her danger of never seeing him again lay not in the Major 's feebleness of heart but in her own .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 47]: As it was , George telegraphed his uncle to have a wheeled chair at the station , for the journey had been disasterous , and to this hybrid vehicle , placed close to the platform , her son carried her in his arms when she arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 31]: She was unable to speak , but patted her brother 's and Fanny 's hands and looked `` very sweet , '' Fanny found the desperate courage to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 39]: She was lifted from the chair into a carriage , and seemed a little stronger as they drove home ; for once she took her hand from George 's , and waved it feebly toward the carriage window .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 7]: `` Changed , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 5]: `` So changed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 10]: `` You mean the town , '' Amberson said .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 16]: `` You mean the old place is changed , do n't you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 11]: She smiled and moved her lips : `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 33]: `` It 'll change to a happier place , old dear , '' he said , `` now that you 're back in it , and going to get well again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 14]: But she only looked at him wistfully , her eyes a little frightened .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 42]: When the carriage stopped , her son carried her into the house , and up the stairs to her own room , where a nurse was waiting ; and he came out a moment later , as the doctor went in .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 21]: At the end of the hall a stricken group was clustered : Amberson , and Fanny , and the Major .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 25]: George , deathly pale and speechless , took his grandfather 's hand , but the old gentleman did not seem to notice his action .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 13]: `` When are they going to let me see my daughter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 4]: he asked querulously .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 22]: `` They told me to keep out of the way while they carried her in , because it might upset her .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 14]: I wish they 'd let me go in and speak to my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 9]: I think she wants to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 56]: He was right -- presently the doctor came out and beckoned to him ; and the Major shuffled forward , leaning on a shaking cane ; his figure , after all its Years of proud soldierliness , had grown stooping at last , and his untrimmed white hair straggled over the back of his collar .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 20]: He looked old -- old and divested of the world -- as he crept toward his daughter 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 26]: Her voice was stronger , for the waiting group heard a low cry of tenderness and welcome as the old man reached the open doorway .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 6]: Then the door was closed .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 7]: Fanny touched her nephew 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 18]: `` George , you must need something to eat -- I know she 'd want you to .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 14]: I 've had things ready : I knew she 'd want me to .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 21]: You 'd better go down to the dining room : there 's plenty on the table , waiting for you .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 9]: She 'd want you to eat something . ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 13]: He turned a ghastly face to her , it was so panic-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 10]: `` I do n't want anything to eat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 4]: he said savagely .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 32]: And he began to pace the floor , taking care not to go near Isabel 's door , and that his footsteps were muffled by the long , thick hall rug .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 24]: After a while he went to where Amberson , with folded arms and bowed head , had seated himself near the front window .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 9]: `` Uncle George , '' he said hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 10]: `` I did n't -- '' `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 21]: `` Oh , my God , I did n't think this thing the matter with her could ever be serious !
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 6]: I -- '' He gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 19]: `` When that doctor I had meet us at the boat -- '' He could not go on .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 14]: Amberson only nodded his head , and did not otherwise change his attitude .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 6]: Isabel lived through the night .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 12]: At eleven O'clock Fanny came timidly to George in his room .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 9]: `` Eugene is here , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 5]: `` He 's downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 7]: He wants -- '' She gulped .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 12]: `` He wants to know if he ca n't see her .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 8]: I did n't know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 6]: I said I 'd see .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 27]: I did n't know -- the doctor said -- '' `` The doctor said we ` must keep her peaceful , ' '' George said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 13]: `` Do you think that man 's coming would be very soothing ?
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 3]: My God !
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 37]: if it had n't been for him this might n't have happened : we could have gone on living here quietly , and -- why , it would be like taking a stranger into her room !
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 19]: She has n't even spoken of him more than twice in all the time we 've been away .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 9]: Does n't he know how sick she is ?
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 14]: You tell him the doctor said she had to be quiet and peaceful .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 12]: That 's what he did say , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 4]: Fanny acquiesced tearfully .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 6]: `` I 'll tell him .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 15]: I 'll tell him the doctor said she was to be kept very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 13]: I -- I did n't know -- '' And she pottered out .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 47]: An hour later the nurse appeared in George 's doorway ; she came noiselessly , and his back was toward her ; but he jumped as if he had been shot , and his jaw fell , he so feared what she was going to say .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 8]: `` She wants to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 28]: The terrified mouth shut with a click ; and he nodded and followed her ; but she remained outside his mother 's room while he went in .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 36]: Isabel 's eyes were closed , and she did not open them or move her head , but she smiled and edged her hand toward him as he sat on a stool beside the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 15]: He took that slender , cold hand , and put it to his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 12]: `` Darling , did you -- get something to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 10]: She could only whisper , slowly and with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 21]: It was as if Isabel herself were far away , and only able to signal what she wanted to say .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 6]: `` Yes , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 7]: `` All you -- needed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 6]: `` Yes , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 27]: She did not speak again for a time ; then , `` Are you sure you did n't -- did n't catch cold coming home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 9]: `` I 'm all right , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 5]: `` That 's good .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 17]: It 's sweet -- it 's sweet -- '' `` What is , mother darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 10]: `` To feel -- my hand on your cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 8]: I -- I can feel it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 27]: But this frightened him horribly -- that she seemed so glad she could feel it , like a child proud of some miraculous seeming thing accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 31]: It frightened him so that he could not speak , and he feared that she would know how he trembled ; but she was unaware , and again was silent .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 23]: Finally she spoke again : `` I wonder if -- if Eugene and Lucy know that we 've come -- home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 8]: `` I 'm sure they do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 9]: `` Has he -- asked about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 8]: `` Yes , he was here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 7]: `` Has he -- gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 6]: `` Yes , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 4]: She sighed faintly .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 12]: `` I 'd like -- '' `` What , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 11]: `` I 'd like to have -- seen him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 10]: It was just audible , this little regretful murmur .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 8]: Several minutes passed before there was another .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 15]: `` Just -- just once , '' she whispered , and then was still .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 36]: She seemed to have fallen asleep , and George moved to go , but a faint pressure upon his fingers detained him , and he remained , with her hand still pressed against his cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 35]: After a while he made sure she was asleep , and moved again , to let the nurse come in , and this time there was no pressure of the fingers to keep him .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 41]: She was not asleep , but thinking that if he went he might get some rest , and be better prepared for what she knew was coming , she commanded those longing fingers of hers -- and let him go .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 52]: He found the doctor standing with the nurse in the hall ; and , telling them that his mother was drowsing now , George went back to his own room , where he was startled to find his grandfather lying on the bed , and his uncle leaning against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 17]: They had gone home two hours before , and he did not know they had returned .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 33]: `` The doctor thought we 'd better come over , '' Amberson said , then was silent , and George , shaking violently , sat down on the edge of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 17]: His shaking continued , and from time to time he wiped heavy sweat from his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 46]: The hours passed , and sometimes the old man upon the bed would snore a little , stop suddenly , and move as if to rise , but George Amberson would set a hand upon his shoulder , and murmur a reassuring word or two .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 31]: Now and then , either uncle or nephew would tiptoe into the hall and look toward Isabel 's room , then come tiptoeing back , the other watching him haggardly .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 17]: Once George gasped defiantly : `` That doctor in New York said she might get better !
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 7]: Do n't you know he did ?
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 10]: Do n't you know he said she might ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 5]: Amberson made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 39]: Dawn had been murking through the smoky windows , growing stronger for half an hour , when both men started violently at a sound in the hall ; and the Major sat up on the bed , unchecked .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 29]: It was the voice of the nurse speaking to Fanny Minafer , and the next moment , Fanny appeared in the doorway , making contorted efforts to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 15]: Amberson said weakly : `` Does she want us -- to come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 14]: But Fanny found her voice , and uttered a long , loud cry .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 23]: She threw her arms about George , and sobbed in an agony of loss and compassion : `` She loved you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 3]: she wailed .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 5]: `` She loved you !
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 4]: She loved you !
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 9]: Oh , how she did love you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 6]: Isabel had just left them .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 36]: Chapter XXX Major Amberson remained dry-eyed through the time that followed : he knew that this separation from his daughter would be short , that the separation which had preceded it was the long one .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 37]: He worked at his ledgers no more under his old gas drop-light , but would sit all evening staring into the fire , in his bedroom , and not speaking unless someone asked him a question .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 36]: He seemed almost unaware of what went on around him , and those who were with him thought him dazed by Isabel 's death , guessing that he was lost in reminiscences and vague dreams .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 60]: `` Probably his mind is full of pictures of his youth , or the Civil War , and the days when he and mother were young married people and all of us children were jolly little things -- and the city was a small town with one cobbled street and the others just dirt roads with board sidewalks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 17]: This was George Amberson 's conjecture , and the others agreed ; but they were mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 12]: The Major was engaged in the profoundest thinking of his life .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 59]: No business plans which had ever absorbed him could compare in momentousness with the plans that absorbed him now , for he had to plan how to enter the unknown country where he was not even sure of being recognized as an Amberson -- not sure of anything , except that Isabel would help him if she could .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 16]: His absorption produced the outward effect of reverie , but of course it was not .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 74]: The Major was occupied with the first really important matter that had taken his attention since he came home invalided , after the Gettysburg campaign , and went into business ; and he realized that everything which had worried him or delighted him during this lifetime between then and to-day -- all his buying and building and trading and banking -- that it all was trifling and waste beside what concerned him now .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 42]: He seldom went out of his room , and often left untouched the meals they brought to him there ; and this neglect caused them to shake their heads mournfully , again mistaking for dazedness the profound concentration of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 34]: Meanwhile , the life of the little bereft group still forlornly centering upon him began to pick up again , as life will , and to emerge from its own period of dazedness .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 14]: It was not Isabel 's father but her son who was really dazed .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 38]: A month after her death he walked abruptly into Fanny 's room , one night , and found her at her desk , eagerly adding columns of figures with which she had covered several sheets of paper .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 57]: This mathematical computation was concerned with her future income to be produced by the electric headlight , now just placed on the general market ; but Fanny was ashamed to be discovered doing anything except mourning , and hastily pushed the sheets aside , even as she looked over her shoulder to greet her hollow-eyed visitor .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 3]: `` George !
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 5]: You startled me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 14]: `` I beg your pardon for not knocking , '' he said huskily .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 7]: `` I did n't think . ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 11]: She turned in her chair and looked at him solicitously .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 11]: `` Sit down , George , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 22]: I just wanted -- '' `` I could hear you walking up and down in your room , '' said Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 22]: `` You were doing it ever since dinner , and it seems to me you 're at it almost every evening .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 26]: I do n't believe it 's good for you -- and I know it would worry your mother terribly if she -- '' Fanny hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 26]: `` See here , '' George said , breathing fast , `` I want to tell you once more that what I did was right .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 14]: How could I have done anything else but what I did do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 7]: `` About what , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 5]: `` About everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 8]: he exclaimed ; and he became vehement .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 11]: `` I did the right thing , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 22]: In heaven 's name , I 'd like to know what else there was for anybody in my position to do !
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 25]: It would have been a dreadful thing for me to just let matters go on and not interfere -- it would have been terrible !
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 11]: What else on earth was there for me to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 11]: I had to stop that talk , did n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 9]: Could a son do less than I did ?
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 10]: Did n't it cost me something to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 33]: Lucy and I 'd had a quarrel , but that would have come round in time -- and it meant the end forever when I turned her father back from our door .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 28]: I knew what it meant , yet I went ahead and did it because knew it had to be done if the talk was to be stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 9]: I took mother away for the same reason .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 9]: I knew that would help to stop it .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 12]: And she was happy over there -- she was perfectly happy .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 19]: I tell you , I think she had a happy life , and that 's my only consolation .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 29]: She did n't live to be old ; she was still beautiful and young looking , and I feel she 'd rather have gone before she got old .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 30]: She 'd had a good husband , and all the comfort and luxury that anybody could have -- and how could it be called anything but a happy life ?
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 28]: She was always cheerful , and when I think of her I can always see her laughing -- I can always hear that pretty laugh of hers .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 26]: When I can keep my mind off of the trip home , and that last night , I always think of her gay and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 14]: So how on earth could she have had anything but a happy life ?
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 16]: People that are n't happy do n't look cheerful all the time , do they ?
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 14]: They look unhappy if they are unhappy ; that 's how they look !
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 21]: See here '' -- he faced her challengingly -- `` do you deny that I did the right thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 25]: `` Oh , I do n't pretend to judge , '' Fanny said soothingly , for his voice and gesture both partook of wildness .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 11]: `` I know you think you did , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 6]: `` Think I did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 4]: he echoed violently .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 7]: `` My God in heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 11]: And he began to walk up and down the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 8]: `` What else was there to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 7]: What , choice did I have ?
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 11]: Was there any other way of stopping the talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 24]: He stopped , close in front of her , gesticulating , his voice harsh and loud : `` Do n't you hear me ?
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 20]: I 'm asking you : Was there any other way on earth of protecting her from the talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 5]: Miss Fanny looked away .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 15]: `` It died down before long , I think , '' she said nervously .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 12]: `` That shows I was right , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 36]: `` If I had n't acted as I did , that slanderous old Johnson woman would have kept on with her slanders -- she 'd still be -- '' `` No , '' Fanny interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 5]: `` She 's dead .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 14]: She dropped dead with apoplexy one day about six weeks after you left .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 31]: I did n't mention it in my letters because I did n't want -- I thought -- '' `` Well , the other people would have kept on , then .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 21]: They 'd have -- '' `` I do n't know , '' said Fanny , still averting her troubled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 9]: `` Things are so changed here , George .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 16]: The other people you speak of -- one hardly knows what 's become of them .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 91]: Of course not a great many were doing the talking , and they -- well , some of them are dead , and some might as well be -- you never see them any more -- and the rest , whoever they were , are probably so mixed in with the crowds of new people that seem never even to have heard of us -- and I 'm sure we certainly never heard of them -- and people seem to forget things so soon -- they seem to forget anything .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 11]: You ca n't imagine how things have changed here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 8]: George gulped painfully before he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 24]: `` You -- you mean to sit there and tell me that if I 'd just let things go on -- Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 9]: He swung away , walking the floor again .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 11]: `` I tell you I did the only right thing !
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 24]: If you do n't think so , why in the name of heaven ca n't you say what else I should have done ?
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 27]: It 's easy enough to criticize , but the person who criticizes a man ought at least to tell him what else he should have done !
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 7]: You think I was wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 11]: `` I 'm not saying so , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 8]: `` You did at the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 9]: `` You said enough then , I think !
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 19]: Well , what have you to say now , if you 're so sure I was wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 6]: `` Nothing , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 11]: `` It 's only because you 're afraid to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 69]: he said , and he went on with a sudden bitter divination : `` You 're reproaching yourself with what you had to do with all that ; and you 're trying to make up for it by doing and saying what you think mother would want you to , and you think I could n't stand it if I got to thinking I might have done differently .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 5]: Oh , I know !
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 16]: That 's exactly what 's in your mind : you do think I was wrong !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 5]: So does Uncle George .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 26]: I challenged him about it the other day , and he answered just as you 're answering -- evaded , and tried to be gentler .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 10]: I do n't care to be handled with gloves !
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 22]: I tell you I was right , and I do n't need any coddling by people that think I was n't !
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 29]: And I suppose you believe I was wrong not to let Morgan see her that last night when he came here , and she -- she was dying .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 17]: If you do , why in the name of God did you come and ask me ?
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 7]: You could have taken him in !
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 7]: She did want to see him .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 8]: She -- '' Miss Fanny looked startled .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 12]: `` You think -- '' `` She told me so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 7]: And the tortured young man choked .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 9]: `` She said -- ` just once . '
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 15]: She said ` I 'd like to have seen him -- just once ! '
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: She meant -- to tell him good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 6]: That 's what she meant !
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 16]: And you put this on me , too ; you put this responsibility on me !
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 19]: But I tell you , and I told Uncle George , that the responsibility is n't all mine !
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 40]: If you were so sure I was wrong all the time -- when I took her away , and when I turned Morgan out -- if you were so sure , what did you let me do it for ?
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 16]: You and Uncle George were grown people , both of you , were n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 36]: You were older than I , and if you were so sure you were wiser than I , why did you just stand around with your hands hanging down , and let me go ahead ?
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 15]: You could have stopped it if it was wrong , could n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 5]: Fanny shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 10]: `` No , George , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 7]: `` Nobody could have stopped you .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 13]: You were too strong , and -- '' `` And what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 4]: he demanded loudly .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 10]: `` And she loved you -- too well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 30]: George stared at her hard , then his lower lip began to move convulsively , and he set his teeth upon it but could not check its frantic twitching .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 7]: He ran out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 6]: She sat still , listening .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 41]: He had plunged into his mother 's room , but no sound came to Fanny 's ears after the sharp closing of the door ; and presently she rose and stepped out into the hall -- but could hear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 78]: The heavy black walnut door of Isabel 's room , as Fanny 's troubled eyes remained fixed upon it , seemed to become darker and vaguer ; the polished wood took the distant ceiling light , at the end of the hall , in dim reflections which became mysterious ; and to Fanny 's disturbed mind the single sharp point of light on the bronze door-knob was like a continuous sharp cry in the stillness of night .
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 52]: What interview was sealed away from human eye and ear within the lonely darkness on the other side of that door -- in that darkness where Isabel 's own special chairs were , and her own special books , and the two great walnut wardrobes filled with her dresses and wraps ?
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 14]: What tragic argument might be there vainly striving to confute the gentle dead ?
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 14]: `` In God 's name , what else could I have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 33]: For his mother 's immutable silence was surely answering him as Isabel in life would never have answered him , and he was beginning to understand how eloquent the dead can be .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 21]: They can not stop their eloquence , no matter how they have loved the living : they can not choose .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 22]: And so , no matter in what agony George should cry out , `` What else could I have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 38]: and to the end of his life no matter how often he made that wild appeal , Isabel was doomed to answer him with the wistful , faint murmur : `` I 'd like to have-seen him .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 6]: Just -- just once . ''
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 67]: A cheerful darkey went by the house , loudly and tunelessly whistling some broken thoughts upon women , fried food and gin ; then a group of high school boys , returning homeward after important initiations , were heard skylarking along the sidewalk , rattling sticks on the fences , squawking hoarsely , and even attempting to sing in the shocking new voices of uncompleted adolescence .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 39]: For no reason , and just as a poultry yard falls into causeless agitation , they stopped in front of the house , and for half an hour produced the effect of a noisy multitude in full riot .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 54]: To the woman standing upstairs in the hall , this was almost unbearable ; and she felt that she would have to go down and call to them to stop ; but she was too timid , and after a time went back to her room , and sat at her desk again .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 38]: She left the door open , and frequently glanced out into the hall , but gradually became once more absorbed in the figures which represented her prospective income from her great plunge in electric lights for automobiles .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 11]: She did not hear George return to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 37]: A superstitious person might have thought it unfortunate that her partner in this speculative industry -LRB- as in Wilbur 's disastrous rolling-mills -RRB- was that charming but too haphazardous man of the world , George Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 54]: He was one of those optimists who believe that if you put money into a great many enterprises one of them is sure to turn out a fortune , and therefore , in order to find the lucky one , it is only necessary to go into a large enough number of them .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 50]: Altogether gallant in spirit , and beautifully game under catastrophe , he had gone into a great many , and the unanimity of their `` bad luck , '' as he called it , gave him one claim to be a distinguished person , if he had no other .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 62]: In business he was ill fated with a consistency which made him , in that alone , a remarkable man ; and he declared , with some earnestness , that there was no accounting for it except by the fact that there had been so much good luck in his family before he was born that something had to balance it .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 37]: `` You ought to have thought of my record and stayed out , '' he told Fanny , one day the next spring , when the affairs of the headlight company had begun to look discouraging .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 21]: `` I feel the old familiar sinking that 's attended all my previous efforts to prove myself a business genius .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 55]: I think it must be something like the feeling an aeronaut has when his balloon bursts , and , looking down , he sees below him the old home farm where he used to live -- I mean the feeling he 'd have just before he flattened out in that same old clay barnyard .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 25]: Things do look bleak , and I 'm only glad you did n't go into this confounded thing to the extent I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 5]: Miss Fanny grew pink .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 8]: `` But it must go right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 15]: `` We saw with our own eyes how perfectly it worked in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 25]: The light was so bright no one could face it , and so there ca n't be any reason for it not to work .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 17]: It simply -- '' `` Oh , you 're right about that , '' Amberson said .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 12]: `` It certainly was a perfect thing -- in the shop !
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 21]: The only thing we did n't know was how fast an automobile had to go to keep the light going .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 12]: It appears that this was a matter of some importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 81]: `` Well , how fast does one have to -- '' `` To keep the light from going entirely out , '' he informed her with elaborate deliberation , `` it is computed by those enthusiasts who have bought our product -- and subsequently returned it to us and got their money back -- they compute that a motor car must maintain a speed of twenty-five miles an hour , or else there wo n't be any light at all .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 27]: To make the illumination bright enough to be noticed by an approaching automobile , they state the speed must be more than thirty miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 33]: At thirty-five , objects in the path of the light begin to become visible ; at forty they are revealed distinctly ; and at fifty and above we have a real headlight .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 31]: Unfortunately many people do n't care to drive that fast at all times after dusk , especially in the traffic , or where policemen are likely to become objectionable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 23]: `` But think of that test on the road when we -- '' `` That test was lovely , '' he admitted .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 29]: `` The inventor made us happy with his oratory , and you and Frank Bronson and I went whirling through the night at a speed that thrilled us .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 19]: It was an intoxicating sensation : we were intoxicated by the lights , the lights and the music .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 23]: We must never forget that drive , with the cool wind kissing our cheeks and the road lit up for miles ahead .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 10]: We must never forget it and we never shall .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 14]: It cost -- '' `` But something 's got to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 6]: `` It has , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 14]: My something would seem to be leaving my watch at my uncle 's .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 14]: Luckily , you -- '' The pink of Fanny 's cheeks became deeper .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 14]: `` But is n't that man going to do anything to remedy it ?
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 16]: ca n't he try to -- '' `` He can try , '' said Amberson .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 8]: `` He is trying , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 27]: I 've sat in the shop watching him try for several beautiful afternoons , while outside the windows all Nature was fragrant with spring and smoke .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 35]: He hums ragtime to himself as he tries , and I think his mind is wandering to something else less tedious -- to some new invention in which he 'd take more interest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 12]: `` But you must n't let him , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 10]: `` You must make him keep on trying ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 10]: He understands that 's what I sit there for .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 6]: I 'll keep sitting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 34]: However , in spite of the time he spent sitting in the shop , worrying the inventor of the fractious light , Amberson found opportunity to worry himself about another matter of business .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 9]: This was the settlement of Isabel 's estate .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 18]: `` It 's curious about the deed to her house , '' he said to his nephew .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 13]: `` You 're absolutely sure it was n't among her papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 13]: `` Mother did n't have any papers , '' George told him .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 5]: `` None at all .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 26]: All she ever had to do with business was to deposit the cheques grandfather gave her and then write her own cheques against them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 15]: `` The deed to the house was never recorded , '' Amberson said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 11]: `` I 've been over to the courthouse to see .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 22]: I asked father if he never gave her one , and he did n't seem able to understand me at first .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 22]: Then he finally said he thought he must have given her a deed long ago ; but he was n't sure .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 7]: I rather think he never did .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 19]: I think it would be just as well to get him to execute one now in your favour .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 9]: I 'll speak to him about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 3]: George sighed .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 26]: `` I do n't think I 'd bother him about it : the house is mine , and you and I understand that it is .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 29]: That 's enough for me , and there is n't likely to be much trouble between you and me when we come to settling poor grandfather 's estate .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 25]: I 've just been with him , and I think it would only confuse him for you to speak to him about it again .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 30]: I notice he seems distressed if anybody tries to get his attention -- he 's a long way off , somewhere , and he likes to stay that way .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 28]: I think -- I think mother would n't want us to bother him about it ; I 'm sure she 'd tell us to let him alone .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 8]: He looks so white and queer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 5]: Amberson shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 13]: `` Not much whiter and queerer than you do , young fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 20]: You 'd better begin to get some air and exercise and quit hanging about in the house all day .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 26]: I wo n't bother him any more than I can help ; but I 'll have the deed made out ready for his signature . ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 9]: `` I would n't bother him at all .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 17]: I do n't see -- '' `` You might see , '' said his uncle uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 54]: `` The estate is just about as involved and mixed-up as an estate can well get , to the best of my knowledge ; and I have n't helped it any by what he let me have for this infernal headlight scheme which has finally gone trolloping forever to where the woodbine twineth .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 21]: Leaves me flat , and poor old Frank Bronson just half flat , and Fanny -- well , thank heaven !
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 15]: I kept her from going in so deep that it would leave her flat .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 12]: It 's rough on her as it is , I suspect .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 8]: You ought to have that deed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 6]: Do n't bother him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: `` I 'll bother him as little as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 16]: I 'll wait till some day when he seems to brighten up a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 6]: But Amberson waited too long .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 18]: The Major had already taken eleven months since his daughter 's death to think important things out .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 23]: He had got as far with them as he could , and there was nothing to detain him longer in the world .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 63]: One evening his grandson sat with him -- the Major seemed to like best to have young George with him , so far as they were able to guess his preferences -- and the old gentleman made a queer gesture : he slapped his knee as if he had made a sudden discovery , or else remembered that he had forgotten something .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 14]: George looked at him with an air of inquiry , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 12]: He had grown to be almost as silent as his grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 9]: However , the Major spoke without being questioned .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 12]: `` It must be in the sun , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 31]: `` There was n't anything here but the sun in the first place , and the earth came out of the sun , and we came out of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 14]: So , whatever we are , we must have been in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 26]: We go back to the earth we came out of , so the earth will go back to the sun that it came out of .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 24]: And time means nothing -- nothing at all -- so in a little while we 'll all be back in the sun together .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 20]: I wish -- '' He moved his hand uncertainly as if reaching for something , and George jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 9]: `` Did you want anything , grandfather ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 10]: `` Would you like a glass of water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 5]: `` No -- no .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 9]: No ; I do n't want anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 41]: The reaching hand dropped back upon the arm of his chair , and he relapsed into silence ; but a few minutes later he finished the sentence he had begun : `` I wish -- somebody could tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 82]: The next day he had a slight cold , but he seemed annoyed when his son suggested calling the doctor , and Amberson let him have his own way so far , in fact , that after he had got up and dressed , the following morning , he was all alone when he went away to find out what he had n't been able to think out -- all those things he had wished `` somebody '' would tell him .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 37]: Old Sam , shuffling in with the breakfast tray , found the Major in his accustomed easy-chair by the fireplace -- and yet even the old darkey could see instantly that the Major was not there .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 37]: Chapter XXXI When the great Amberson Estate went into court for settlement , `` there was n't any , '' George Amberson said -- that is , when the settlement was concluded there was no estate .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 10]: `` I guessed it , '' Amberson went on .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 25]: `` As an expert on prosperity , my career is disreputable , but as a prophet of calamity I deserve a testimonial banquet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 23]: He reproached himself bitterly for not having long ago discovered that his father had never given Isabel a deed to her house .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 10]: `` And those pigs , Sydney and Amelia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 13]: he added , for this was another thing he was bitter about .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 7]: `` They wo n't do anything .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 14]: I 'm sorry I gave them the opportunity of making a polished refusal .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 21]: Amelia 's letter was about half in Italian ; she could n't remember enough ways of saying no in English .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 16]: One has to live quite a long while to realize there are people like that !
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 33]: The estate was badly crippled , even before they took out their ` third , ' and the ` third ' they took was the only good part of the rotten apple .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 27]: Well , I did n't ask them for restitution on my own account , and at least it will save you some trouble , young George .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 16]: Never waste any time writing to them ; you must n't count on them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 10]: `` I do n't , '' George said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 9]: `` I do n't count on anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 23]: `` Oh , we 'll not feel that things are quite desperate , '' Amberson laughed , but not with great cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 12]: `` We 'll survive , Georgie -- you will , especially .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 48]: For my part I 'm a little too old and too accustomed to fall back on somebody else for supplies to start a big fight with life : I 'll be content with just surviving , and I can do it on an eighteen-hundred-dollar -- a-year consulship .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 24]: An ex-congressman can always be pretty sure of getting some such job , and I hear from Washington the matter 's about settled .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 52]: I 'll live pleasantly enough with a pitcher of ice under a palm tree , and black folks to wait on me -- that part of it will be like home -- and I 'll manage to send you fifty dollars every now and then , after I once get settled .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 5]: So much for me !
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 37]: But you -- of course you 've had a poor training for making your own way , but you 're only a boy after all , and the stuff of the old stock is in you .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 8]: It 'll come out and do something .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 20]: I 'll never forgive myself about that deed : it would have given you something substantial to start with .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 59]: Still , you have a little tiny bit , and you 'll have a little tiny salary , too ; and of course your Aunt Fanny 's here , and she 's got something you can fall back on if you get too pinched , until I can begin to send you a dribble now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 53]: George 's `` little tiny bit '' was six hundred dollars which had come to him from the sale of his mother 's furniture ; and the `` little tiny salary '' was eight dollars a week which old Frank Bronson was to pay him for services as a clerk and student-at-law .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 54]: Old Frank would have offered more to the Major 's grandson , but since the death of that best of clients and his own experience with automobile headlights , he was not certain of being able to pay more and at the same time settle his own small bills for board and lodging .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 16]: George had accepted haughtily , and thereby removed a burden from his uncle 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 44]: Amberson himself , however , had not even a `` tiny bit '' ; though he got his consular appointment ; and to take him to his post he found it necessary to borrow two hundred of his nephew 's six hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 12]: `` It makes me sick , George , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 13]: `` But I 'd better get there and get that salary started .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 34]: Of course Eugene would do anything in the world , and the fact is he wanted to , but I felt that -- ah -- under the circumstances -- '' `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 6]: George exclaimed , growing red .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 40]: `` I ca n't imagine one of the family -- '' He paused , not finding it necessary to explain that `` the family '' should n't turn a man from the door and then accept favours from him .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 9]: `` I wish you 'd take more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 3]: Amberson declined .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 22]: `` One thing I 'll say for you , young George ; you have n't a stingy bone in your body .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 14]: That 's the Amberson stock in you -- and I like it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 17]: He added something to this praise of his nephew on the day he left for Washington .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 21]: He was not to return , but to set forth from the capital on the long journey to his post .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 22]: George went with him to the station , and their farewell was lengthened by the train 's being several minutes late .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 34]: `` I may not see you again , Georgie , '' Amberson said ; and his voice was a little husky as he set a kind hand on the young man 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 50]: `` It 's quite probable that from this time on we 'll only know each other by letter -- until you 're notified as my next of kin that there 's an old valise to be forwarded to you , and perhaps some dusty curios from the consulate mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 43]: Well , it 's an odd way for us to be saying good-bye : one would n't have thought it , even a few years ago , but here we are , two gentlemen of elegant appearance in a state of bustitude .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 14]: We ca n't ever tell what will happen at all , can we ?
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 38]: Once I stood where we 're standing now , to say good-bye to a pretty girl -- only it was in the old station before this was built , and we called it the ` depot . '
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 28]: She 'd been visiting your mother , before Isabel was married , and I was wild about her , and she admitted she did n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 20]: In fact , we decided we could n't live without each other , and we were to be married .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 32]: But she had to go abroad first with her father , and when we came to say good-bye we knew we would n't see each other again for almost a year .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 15]: I thought I could n't live through it -- and she stood here crying .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 39]: Well , I do n't even know where she lives now , or if she is living -- and I only happen to think of her sometimes when I 'm here at the station waiting for a train .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 39]: If she ever thinks of me she probably imagines I 'm still dancing in the ballroom at the Amberson Mansion , and she probably thinks of the Mansion as still beautiful -- still the finest house in town .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 14]: Life and money both behave like loose quicksilver in a nest of cracks .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 20]: And when they 're gone we ca n't tell where -- or what the devil we did with 'em !
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 52]: But I believe I 'll say now -- while there is n't much time left for either of us to get embarrassed about it -- I believe I 'll say that I 've always been fond of you , Georgie , but I ca n't say that I always liked you .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 12]: Sometimes I 've felt you were distinctly not an acquired taste .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 36]: Until lately , one had to be fond of you just naturally -- this is n't very ` tactful , ' of course -- for if he did n't , well , he would n't !
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 28]: We all spoiled you terribly when you were a little boy and let you grow up en prince -- and I must say you took to it !
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 46]: But you 've received a pretty heavy jolt , and I had enough of your disposition , myself , at your age , to understand a little of what cocksure youth has to go through inside when it finds that it can make terrible mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 4]: Poor old fellow !
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 66]: You get both kinds of jolts together , spiritual and material -- and you 've taken them pretty quietly and -- well , with my train coming into the shed , you 'll forgive me for saying that there have been times when I thought you ought to be hanged -- but I 've always been fond of you , and now I like you !
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 43]: And just for a last word : there may be somebody else in this town who 's always felt about you like that -- fond of you , I mean , no matter how much it seemed you ought to be hanged .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 10]: You might try -- Hello , I must run .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 24]: I 'll send back the money as fast as they pay me -- so , good-bye and God bless you , Georgie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 29]: He passed through the gates , waved his hat cheerily from the other side of the iron screen , and was lost from sight in the hurrying crowd .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 29]: And as he disappeared , an unexpected poignant loneliness fell upon his nephew so heavily and so suddenly that he had no energy to recoil from the shock .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 21]: It seemed to him that the last fragment of his familiar world had disappeared , leaving him all alone forever .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 32]: He walked homeward slowly through what appeared to be the strange streets of a strange city ; and , as a matter of fact , the city was strange to him .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 24]: He had seen little of it during his years in college , and then had followed the long absence and his tragic return .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 35]: Since that he had been `` scarcely outdoors at all , '' as Fanny complained , warning him that his health would suffer , and he had been downtown only in a closed carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 8]: He had not realized the great change .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 16]: The streets were thunderous ; a vast energy heaved under the universal coating of dinginess .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 17]: George walked through the begrimed crowds of hurrying strangers and saw no face that he remembered .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 39]: Great numbers of the faces were even of a kind he did not remember ever to have seen ; they were partly like the old type that his boyhood knew , and partly like types he knew abroad .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 50]: He saw German eyes with American wrinkles at their corners ; he saw Irish eyes and Neapolitan eyes , Roman eyes , Tuscan eyes , eyes of Lombardy , of Savoy , Hungarian eyes , Balkan eyes , Scandinavian eyes -- all with a queer American look in them .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 33]: He saw Jews who had been German Jews , Jews who had been Russian Jews , Jews who had been Polish Jews but were no longer German or Russian or Polish Jews .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 90]: All the people were soiled by the smoke-mist through which they hurried , under the heavy sky that hung close upon the new skyscrapers ; and nearly all seemed harried by something impending , though here and there a women with bundles would be laughing to a companion about some adventure of the department stores , or perhaps an escape from the charging traffic of the streets -- and not infrequently a girl , or a free-and-easy young matron , found time to throw an encouraging look to George .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 37]: He took no note of these , and , leaving the crowded sidewalks , turned north into National Avenue , and presently reached the quieter but no less begrimed region of smaller shops and old-fashioned houses .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 60]: Those latter had been the homes of his boyhood playmates ; old friends of his grandfather had lived here ; -- in this alley he had fought with two boys at the same time , and whipped them ; in that front yard he had been successfully teased into temporary insanity by a. Sunday-school class of pinky little girls .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 96]: On that sagging porch a laughing woman had fed him and other boys with doughnuts and gingerbread ; yonder he saw the staggered relics of the iron picket fence he had made his white pony jump , on a dare , and in the shabby , stone-faced house behind the fence he had gone to children 's parties , and , when he was a little older he had danced there often , and fallen in love with Mary Sharon , and kissed her , apparently by force , under the stairs in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 52]: The double front doors , of meaninglessly carved walnut , once so glossily varnished , had been painted smoke gray , but the smoke grime showed repulsively , even on the smoke gray ; and over the doors a smoked sign proclaimed the place to be a `` Stag Hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 44]: Other houses had become boarding-houses too genteel for signs , but many were franker , some offering `` board by the day , week or meal , '' and some , more laconic , contenting themselves with the label : `` Rooms . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 47]: One , having torn out part of an old stone-trimmed bay window for purposes of commercial display , showed forth two suspended petticoats and a pair of oyster-coloured flannel trousers to prove the claims of its black-and-gilt sign : `` French Cleaning and Dye House . ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 29]: Its next neighbour also sported a remodelled front and permitted no doubt that its mission in life was to attend cosily upon death : `` J. M. Rolsener .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 2]: Caskets .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 5]: The Funeral Home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 41]: And beyond that , a plain old honest four-square gray-painted brick house was flamboyantly decorated with a great gilt scroll on the railing of the old-fashioned veranda : `` Mutual Benev ' t Order Cavaliers and Dames of Purity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 7]: This was the old Minafer house .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 56]: George passed it without perceptibly wincing ; in fact , he held his head up , and except for his gravity of countenance and the prison pallor he had acquired by too constantly remaining indoors , there was little to warn an acquaintance that he was not precisely the same George Amberson Minafer known aforetime .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 23]: He was still so magnificent , indeed , that there came to his ears a waft of comment from a passing automobile .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 27]: This was a fearsome red car , glittering in brass , with half-a-dozen young people in it whose motorism had reached an extreme manifestation in dress .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 56]: The ladies of this party were favourably affected at sight of the pedestrian upon the sidewalk , and , as the machine was moving slowly , and close to the curb , they had time to observe him in detail , which they did with a frankness not pleasing to the object of their attentions .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 22]: `` One sees so many nice-looking people one does n't know nowadays , '' said the youngest of the young ladies .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 11]: `` This old town of ours is really getting enormous .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 10]: I should n't mind knowing who he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 23]: `` I do n't know , '' the youth beside her said , loudly enough to be heard at a considerable distance .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 31]: `` I do n't know who he is , but from his looks I know who he thinks he is : he thinks he 's the Grand Duke Cuthbert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 38]: There was a burst of tittering as the car gathered speed and rolled away , with the girl continuing to look back until her scandalized companions forced her to turn by pulling her hood over her face .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 28]: She made an impression upon George , so deep a one , in fact , that he unconsciously put his emotion into a muttered word : Riffraff !
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 67]: This was the last `` walk home '' he was ever to take by the route he was now following : up National Avenue to Amberson Addition and the two big old houses at the foot of Amberson Boulevard ; for tonight would be the last night that he and Fanny were to spend in the house which the Major had forgotten to deed to Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 21]: To-morrow they were to `` move out , '' and George was to begin his work in Bronson 's office .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 33]: He had not come to this collapse without a fierce struggle -- but the struggle was inward , and the rolling world was not agitated by it , and rolled calmly on .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 39]: For of all the `` ideals of life '' which the world , in its rolling , inconsiderately flattens out to nothingness , the least likely to retain a profile is that ideal which depends upon inheriting money .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 38]: George Amberson , in spite of his record of failures in business , had spoken shrewdly when he realized at last that money , like life , was `` like quicksilver in a nest of cracks . ''
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 35]: And his nephew had the awakening experience of seeing the great Amberson Estate vanishing into such a nest -- in a twinkling , it seemed , now that it was indeed so utterly vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 40]: His uncle had suggested that he might write to college friends ; perhaps they could help him to something better than the prospect offered by Bronson 's office ; but George flushed and shook his head , without explaining .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 24]: In that small and quietly superior `` crowd '' of his he had too emphatically supported the ideal of being rather than doing .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 17]: He could not appeal to one of its members now to help him to a job .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 30]: Besides , they were not precisely the warmest-hearted crew in the world , and he had long ago dropped the last affectation of a correspondence with any of them .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 30]: He was as aloof from any survival of intimacy with his boyhood friends in the city , and , in truth , had lost track of most of them .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 54]: `` The Friends of the Ace , '' once bound by oath to succour one another in peril or poverty , were long ago dispersed ; one or two had died ; one or two had gone to live elsewhere ; the others were disappeared into the smoky bigness of the heavy city .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 75]: Of the brethren , there remained within his present cognizance only his old enemy , the red-haired Kinney , now married to Janie Sharon , and Charlie Johnson , who , out of deference to his mother 's memory , had passed the Amberson Mansion one day , when George stood upon the front steps , and , looking in fiercely , had looked away with continued fierceness -- his only token of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 45]: On this last homeward walk of his , when George reached the entrance to Amberson Addition -- that is , when he came to where the entrance had formerly been -- he gave a little start , and halted for a moment to stare .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 21]: This was the first time he had noticed that the stone pillars , marking the entrance , had been removed .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 27]: Then he realized that for a long time he had been conscious of a queerness about this corner without being aware of what made the difference .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 38]: National Avenue met Amberson Boulevard here at an obtuse angle , and the removal of the pillars made the Boulevard seem a cross-street of no overpowering importance -- certainly it did not seem to be a boulevard !
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 24]: At the next corner Neptune 's Fountain remained , and one could still determine with accuracy what its designer 's intentions had been .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 29]: It stood in sore need of just one last kindness ; and if the thing had possessed any friends they would have done that doleful shovelling after dark .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 21]: George did not let his eyes linger upon the relic ; nor did he look steadfastly at the Amberson Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 35]: Massive as the old house was , it managed to look gaunt : its windows stared with the skull emptiness of all windows in empty houses that are to be lived in no more .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 50]: Of course the rowdy boys of the neighbourhood had been at work : many of these haggard windows were broken ; the front door stood ajar , forced open ; and idiot salacity , in white chalk , was smeared everywhere upon the pillars and stonework of the verandas .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 20]: George walked by the Mansion hurriedly , and came home to his mother 's house for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 68]: Emptiness was there , too , and the closing of the door resounded through bare rooms ; for downstairs there was no furniture in the house except a kitchen table in the dining room , which Fanny had kept `` for dinner , '' she said , though as she was to cook and serve that meal herself George had his doubts about her name for it .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 30]: Upstairs , she had retained her own furniture , and George had been living in his mother 's room , having sent everything from his own to the auction .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 26]: Isabel 's room was still as it had been , but the furniture would be moved with Fanny 's to new quarters in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 48]: Fanny had made plans for her nephew as well as herself ; she had found a three-room `` kitchenette apartment '' in an apartment house where several old friends of hers had established themselves -- elderly widows of citizens once `` prominent '' and other retired gentry .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 40]: People used their own `` kitchenettes '' for breakfast and lunch , but there was a table-d'hote arrangement for dinner on the ground floor ; and after dinner bridge was played all evening , an attraction powerful with Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 33]: She had `` made all the arrangements , '' she reported , and nervously appealed for approval , asking if she had n't shown herself `` pretty practical '' in such matters .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 19]: George acquiesced absent-mindedly , not thinking of what she said and not realizing to what it committed him .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 106]: He began to realize it now , as he wandered about the dismantled house ; he was far from sure that he was willing to go and live in a `` three-room apartment '' with Fanny and eat breakfast and lunch with her -LRB- prepared by herself in the `` kitchenette '' -RRB- and dinner at the table d'hote in `` such a pretty Colonial dining room '' -LRB- so Fanny described it -RRB- at a little round table they would have all to themselves in the midst of a dozen little round tables which other relics of disrupted families would have all to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 34]: For the first time , now that the change was imminent , George began to develop before his mind 's eye pictures of what he was in for ; and they appalled him .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 28]: He decided that such a life verged upon the sheerly unbearable , and that after all there were some things left that he just could n't stand .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 54]: So he made up his mind to speak to his aunt about it at `` dinner , '' and tell her that he preferred to ask Bronson to let him put a sofa-bed , a trunk , and a folding rubber bathtub behind a screen in the dark rear room of the office .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 28]: George felt that this would be infinitely more tolerable ; and he could eat at restaurants , especially as about all he ever wanted nowadays was coffee .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 59]: But at `` dinner '' he decided to put off telling Fanny of his plan until later : she was so nervous , and so distressed about the failure of her efforts with sweetbreads and macaroni ; and she was so eager in her talk of how comfortable they would be `` by this time to-morrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 64]: She fluttered on , her nervousness increasing , saying how `` nice '' it would be for him , when he came from work in the evenings , to be among `` nice people -- people who know who we are , '' and to have a pleasant game of bridge with `` people who are really old friends of the family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 41]: When they stopped probing among the scorched fragments she had set forth , George lingered downstairs , waiting for a better opportunity to introduce his own subject , but when he heard dismaying sounds from the kitchen he gave up .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 50]: There was a crash , then a shower of crashes ; falling tin clamoured to be heard above the shattering of porcelain ; and over all rose Fanny 's wail of lamentation for the treasures saved from the sale , but now lost forever to the `` kitchenette . ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 15]: Fanny was nervous indeed ; so nervous that she could not trust her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 31]: For a moment George thought she might have been injured , but , before he reached the kitchen , he heard her sweeping at the fragments , and turned back .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 9]: He put off speaking to Fanny until morning .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 37]: Things more insistent than his vague plans for a sofa-bed in Bronson 's office had possession of his mind as he went upstairs , moving his hand slowly along the smooth walnut railing of the balustrade .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 28]: Half way to the landing he stopped , turned , and stood looking down at the heavy doors masking the black emptiness that had been the library .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 42]: Here he had stood on what he now knew was the worst day of his life ; here he had stood when his mother passed through that doorway , hand-in-hand with her brother , to learn what her son had done .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 26]: He went on more heavily , more slowly ; and , more heavily and slowly still , entered Isabel 's room and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 22]: He did not come forth again , and bade Fanny good-night through the closed door when she stopped outside it later .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 15]: `` I 've put all the lights out , George , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 7]: `` Everything 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 8]: `` Very well , '' he called .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 4]: `` Good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 5]: She did not go .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 21]: `` I 'm sure we 're going to enjoy the new little home , George , '' she said timidly .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 19]: `` I 'll try hard to make things nice for you , and the people really are lovely .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 13]: You must n't feel as if things are altogether gloomy , George .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 11]: I know everything 's going to turn out all right .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 33]: You 're young and strong and you have a good mind and I 'm sure -- '' she hesitated -- `` I 'm sure your mother 's watching over you , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 5]: Good-night , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 7]: `` Good-night , Aunt Fanny . ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 39]: His voice had a strangled sound in spite of him ; but she seemed not to notice it , and he heard her go to her own room and lock herself in with bolt and key against burglars .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 28]: She had said the one thing she should not have said just then : `` I 'm sure your mother 's watching over you , Georgie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 18]: She had meant to be kind , but it destroyed his last chance for sleep that night .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 26]: He would have slept little if she had not said it , but since she had said it , he could not sleep at all .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 61]: For he knew that it was true -- if it could be true -- and that his mother , if she still lived in spirit , would be weeping on the other side of the wall of silence , weeping and seeking for some gate to let her through so that she could come and `` watch over him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 38]: He felt that if there were such gates they were surely barred : they were like those awful library doors downstairs , which had shut her in to begin the suffering to which he had consigned her .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 7]: The room was still Isabel 's .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 64]: Nothing had been changed : even the photographs of George , of the Major , and of `` brother George '' still stood on her dressing-table , and in a drawer of her desk was an old picture of Eugene and Lucy , taken together , which George had found , but had slowly closed away again from sight , not touching it .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 24]: To-morrow everything would be gone ; and he had heard there was not long to wait before the house itself would be demolished .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 42]: The very space which tonight was still Isabel 's room would be cut into new shapes by new walls and floors and ceilings ; yet the room would always live , for it could not die out of George 's memory .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 22]: It would live as long as he did , and it would always be murmurous with a tragic , wistful whispering .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 83]: And if space itself can be haunted , as memory is haunted , then some time , when the space that was Isabel 's room came to be made into the small bedrooms and `` kitchenettes '' already designed as its destiny , that space might well be haunted and the new occupants come to feel that some seemingly causeless depression hung about it -- a wraith of the passion that filled it throughout the last night that George Minafer spent there .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 79]: Whatever remnants of the old high-handed arrogance were still within him , he did penance for his deepest sin that night -- and it may be that to this day some impressionable , overworked woman in a `` kitchenette , '' after turning out the light will seem to see a young man kneeling in the darkness , shaking convulsively , and , with arms outstretched through the wall , clutching at the covers of a shadowy bed .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 22]: It may seem to her that she hears the faint cry , over and over : `` Mother , forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 6]: God , forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 47]: Chapter XXXII At least , it may be claimed for George that his last night in the house where he had been born was not occupied with his own disheartening future , but with sorrow for what sacrifices his pride and youth had demanded of others .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 20]: And early in the morning he came downstairs and tried to help Fanny make coffee on the kitchen range .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 52]: `` There was something I wanted to say to you last night , Aunt Fanny , '' he said , as she finally discovered that an amber fluid , more like tea than coffee , was as near ready to be taken into the human system as it would ever be .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 11]: `` I think I 'd better do it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 41]: She set the coffee-pot back upon the stove with a little crash , and , looking at him in a desperate anxiety , began to twist her dainty apron between her fingers without any consciousness of what she was doing .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 31]: `` Why -- why -- '' she stammered ; but she knew what he was going to say , and that was why she had been more and more nervous .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 25]: `` Had n't -- perhaps -- perhaps we 'd better get the -- the things moved to the little new home first , George .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 32]: Let 's -- '' He interrupted quietly , though at her phrase , `` the little new home , '' his pungent impulse was to utter one loud shout and run .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 13]: `` It was about this new place that I wanted to speak .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 12]: I 've been thinking it over , and I 've decided .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 60]: I want you to take all the things from mother 's room and use them and keep them for me , and I 'm sure the little apartment will be just what you like ; and with the extra bedroom probably you could find some woman friend to come and live there , and share the expense with you .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 19]: But I 've decided on another arrangement for myself , and so I 'm not going with you .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 24]: I do n't suppose you 'll mind much , and I do n't see why you should mind -- particularly , that is .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 17]: I 'm not very lively company these days , or any days , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 59]: I ca n't imagine you , or any one else , being much attached to me , so -- '' He stopped in amazement : no chair had been left in the kitchen , but Fanny gave a despairing glance around her , in search of one , then sank abruptly , and sat flat upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 12]: `` You 're going to leave me in the lurch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 11]: `` What on earth -- '' George sprang to her .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 8]: `` Get up , Aunt Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 5]: I 'm too weak .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 7]: Let me alone , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 42]: And as he released the wrist he had seized to help her , she repeated the dismal prophecy which for days she had been matching against her hopes : `` You 're going to leave me -- in the lurch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 8]: `` Why no , Aunt Fanny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 3]: he protested .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 14]: `` At first I 'd have been something of a burden on you .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 14]: I 'm to get eight dollars a week ; about thirty-two a month .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 56]: The rent 's thirty-six dollars a month , and the table-d'hote dinner runs up to over twenty-two dollars apiece , so with my half of the rent -- eighteen dollars -- I 'd have less than nothing left out of my salary to pay my share of the groceries for all the breakfasts and luncheons .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 28]: You see you 'd not only be doing all the housework and cooking , but you 'd be paying more of the expenses than I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 15]: She stared at him with such a forlorn blankness as he had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 11]: `` I 'd be paying -- '' she said feebly .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 12]: `` I 'd be paying -- '' `` Certainly you would .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 16]: You 'd be using more of your money than -- '' `` My money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 14]: Fanny 's chin drooped upon her thin chest , and she laughed miserably .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 7]: `` I 've got twenty-eight dollars .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 5]: That 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 11]: `` You mean until the interest is due again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 11]: `` I mean that 's all , '' Fanny said .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 9]: `` I mean that 's all there is .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 15]: There wo n't be any more interest because there is n't any principal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 12]: `` Why , you told -- '' She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 11]: `` No , I have n't told you anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 7]: `` Then it was Uncle George .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 11]: He told me you had enough to fall back on .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 14]: That 's just what he said : ` to fall back on . '
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 39]: He said you 'd lost more than you should , in the headlight company , but he 'd insisted that you should hold out enough to live on , and you 'd very wisely followed his advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 9]: `` I know , '' she said weakly .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 6]: `` I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 76]: He did n't know , or else he 'd forgotten , how much Wilbur 's insurance amounted to , and I -- oh , it seemed such a sure way to make a real fortune out of a little -- and I thought I could do something for you , George , if you ever came to need it -- and it all looked so bright I just thought I 'd put it all in .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 17]: I did -- every cent except my last interest payment -- and it 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 5]: `` Good Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 16]: George began to pace up and down on the worn planks of the bare floor .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 18]: `` Why on earth did you wait till now to tell such a thing as this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 15]: `` I could n't tell till I had to , '' she said piteously .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 10]: `` I could n't till George Amberson went away .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 63]: He could n't do anything to help , anyhow , and I just did n't want him to talk to me about it -- he 's been at me so much about not putting more in than I could afford to lose , and said he considered he had my -- my word I was n't putting more than that in it .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 9]: So I thought : What was the use ?
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 22]: What was the use of going over it all with him and having him reproach me , and probably reproach himself ?
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 14]: It would n't do any good -- not any good on earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 11]: She got out her lace handkerchief and began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 14]: `` Nothing does any good , I guess , in this old world .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 11]: Oh , how tired of this old world I am !
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 8]: I did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 23]: I just tried to go ahead and be as practical as I could , and arrange some way for us to live .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 12]: Oh , I knew you did n't want me , George !
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 25]: You always teased me and berated me whenever you had a chance from the time you were a little boy -- you did so !
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 27]: Later , you 've tried to be kinder to me , but you do n't want me around -- oh , I can see that much !
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 15]: You do n't suppose I want to thrust myself on you , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 39]: It is n't very pleasant to be thrusting yourself on a person you know does n't want you -- but I knew you ought n't to be left all alone in the world ; it is n't good .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 37]: I knew your mother 'd want me to watch over you and try to have something like a home for you -- I know she 'd want me to do what I tried to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 19]: Fanny 's tears were bitter now , and her voice , hoarse and wet , was tragically sincere .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 74]: `` I tried -- I tried to be practical -- to look after your interests -- to make things as nice for you as I could -- I walked my heels down looking for a place for us to live -- I walked and walked over this town -- I did n't ride one block on a street-car -- I would n't use five cents no matter how tired I -- Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 4]: She sobbed uncontrollably .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 20]: and now -- you do n't want -- you want -- you want to leave me in the lurch !
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 7]: You -- '' George stopped walking .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 30]: `` In God 's name , Aunt Fanny , '' he said , `` quit spreading out your handkerchief and drying it and then getting it all wet again !
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 5]: I mean stop crying !
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 2]: Do !
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 9]: And for heaven 's sake , get up .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 23]: Do n't sit there with your back against the boiler and -- '' `` It 's not hot , '' Fanny sniffled .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 10]: `` It 's cold ; the plumbers disconnected it .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 9]: I would n't mind if they had n't .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 12]: I would n't mind if it burned me , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 7]: `` Oh , my Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 9]: He went to her , and lifted her .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 9]: `` For God 's sake , get up !
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 21]: Come , let 's take the coffee into the other room , and see what 's to be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 50]: He got her to her feet ; she leaned upon him , already somewhat comforted , and , with his arm about her , he conducted her to the dining room and seated her in one of the two kitchen chairs which had been placed at the rough table .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 9]: he said , `` get over it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 42]: Then he brought the coffee-pot , some lumps of sugar in a tin pan , and , finding that all the coffee-cups were broken , set water glasses upon the table , and poured some of the pale coffee into them .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 18]: By this time Fanny 's spirits had revived appreciably : she looked up with a plaintive eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 24]: `` I had bought all my fall clothes , George , '' she said ; `` and I paid every bill I owed .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 12]: I do n't owe a cent for clothes , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 26]: `` That 's good , '' he said wanly , and he had a moment of physical dizziness that decided him to sit down quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 20]: For an instant it seemed to him that he was not Fanny 's nephew , but married to her .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 10]: He passed his pale hand over his paler forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 15]: `` Well , let 's see where we stand , '' he said feebly .
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 15]: `` Let 's see if we can afford this place you 've selected . ''
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 5]: Fanny continued to brighten .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 30]: `` I 'm sure it 's the most practical plan we could possibly have worked out , George -- and it is a comfort to be among nice people .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 25]: I think we 'll both enjoy it , because the truth is we 've been keeping too much to ourselves for a long while .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 8]: It is n't good for people . ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 11]: `` I was thinking about the money , Aunt Fanny .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 18]: You see -- '' `` I 'm sure we can manage it , '' she interrupted quickly .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 25]: `` There really is n't a cheaper place in town that we could actually live in and be -- '' Here she interrupted herself .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 37]: There 's one great economy I forgot to tell you , and it 's especially an economy for you , because you 're always too generous about such things : they do n't allow any tipping .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 8]: They have signs that prohibit it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 10]: `` That 's good , '' he said grimly .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 34]: `` But the rent is thirty-six dollars a month ; the dinner is twenty-two and a half for each of us , and we 've got to have some provision for other food .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 19]: We wo n't need any clothes for a year , perhaps -- '' `` Oh , longer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 20]: `` So you see -- '' `` I see that forty-five and thirty-six make eighty-one , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 22]: `` At the lowest , we need a hundred dollars a month -- and I 'm going to make thirty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 24]: `` I thought of that , George , '' she said confidently , `` and I 'm sure it will be all right .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 14]: You 'll be earning a great deal more than that very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 30]: `` I do n't see any prospect of it -- not till I 'm admitted to the bar , and that will be two years at the earliest . ''
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 7]: Fanny 's confidence was not shaken .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 16]: `` I know you 'll be getting on faster than -- '' `` Faster ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 4]: George echoed gravely .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 14]: `` We 've got to have more than that to start with . ''
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 13]: `` Well , there 's the six hundred dollars from the sale .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 9]: Six hundred and twelve dollars it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 14]: `` It is n't six hundred and twelve now , '' said George .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 10]: `` It 's about one hundred and sixty . ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 6]: Fanny showed a momentary dismay .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 68]: `` Why , how -- '' `` I lent Uncle George two hundred ; I gave fifty apiece to old Sam and those two other old darkies that worked for grandfather so long , and ten to each of the servants here -- '' `` And you gave me thirty-six , '' she said thoughtfully , `` for the first month 's rent , in advance . ''
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 4]: `` Did I ?
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 4]: I 'd forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 62]: Well , with about a hundred and sixty in bank and our expenses a hundred a month , it does n't seem as if this new place -- '' `` Still , '' she interrupted , `` we have paid the first month 's rent in advance , and it does seem to be the most practical -- '' George rose .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 12]: `` See here , Aunt Fanny , '' he said decisively .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 10]: `` You stay here and look after the moving .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 23]: Old Frank does n't expect me until afternoon , this first day , but I 'll go and see him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 28]: It was early , and old Frank , just established at his big , flat-topped desk , was surprised when his prospective assistant and pupil walked in .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 20]: He was pleased , as well as surprised , however , and rose , offering a cordial old hand .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 6]: `` The real flare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 8]: `` The real flare for the law .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 4]: That 's right !
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 8]: Could n't wait till afternoon to begin !
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 24]: I 'm delighted that you -- '' `` I wanted to say -- '' George began , but his patron cut him off .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 9]: `` Wait just a minute , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 26]: I 've prepared a little speech of welcome , and even though you 're five hours ahead of time , I mean to deliver it .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 43]: First of all , your grandfather was my old war-comrade and my best client ; for years I prospered through my connection with his business , and his grandson is welcome in my office and to my best efforts in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 82]: But I want to confess , Georgie , that during your earlier youth I may have had some slight feeling of -- well , prejudice , not altogether in your favour ; but whatever slight feeling it was , it began to vanish on that afternoon , a good while ago , when you stood up to your Aunt Amelia Amberson as you did in the Major 's library , and talked to her as a man and a gentleman should .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 18]: I saw then what good stuff was in you -- and I always wanted to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 55]: If my prejudice had n't altogether vanished after that , the last vestiges disappeared during these trying times that have come upon you this past year , when I have been a witness to the depth of feeling you 've shown and your quiet consideration for your grandfather and for everyone else around you .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 32]: I just want to add that I think you 'll find an honest pleasure now in industry and frugality that would n't have come to you in a more frivolous career .
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 40]: The law is a jealous mistress and a stern mistress , but a -- '' George had stood before him in great and increasing embarrassment ; and he was unable to allow the address to proceed to its conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 8]: `` I ca n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 4]: he burst out .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 11]: `` I ca n't take her for my mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 18]: `` I 've come to tell you , I 've got to find something that 's quicker .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 12]: I ca n't -- '' Old Frank got a little red .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 10]: `` Let 's sit down , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 7]: `` What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 4]: George told him .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 15]: The old gentleman listened sympathetically , only murmuring : `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 9]: from time to time , and nodding acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 16]: `` You see she 's set her mind on this apartment , '' George explained .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 35]: `` She 's got some old cronies there , and I guess she 's been looking forward to the games of bridge and the kind of harmless gossip that goes on in such places .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 27]: Really , it 's a life she 'd like better than anything else -- better than that she 's lived at home , I really believe .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 23]: It struck me she 's just about got to have it , and after all she could hardly have anything less . ''
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 16]: `` This comes pretty heavily upon me , you know , '' said old Frank .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 25]: `` I got her into that headlight company , and she fooled me about her resources as much as she did your Uncle George .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 32]: I was never your father 's adviser , if you remember , and when the insurance was turned over to her some other lawyer arranged it -- probably your father 's .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 16]: But it comes pretty heavily on me , and I feel a certain responsibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 7]: I 'm taking the responsibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 10]: And George smiled with one corner of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 13]: `` She 's not your aunt , you know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 45]: `` Well , I 'm unable to see , even if she 's yours , that a young man is morally called upon to give up a career at the law to provide his aunt with a favourable opportunity to play bridge whist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 7]: `` No , '' George agreed .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 26]: `` But I have n't begun my ` career at the law ' so it ca n't be said I 'm making any considerable sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 11]: I 'll tell you how it is , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 23]: He flushed , and , looking out of the streaked and smoky window beside which he was sitting , spoke with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 25]: `` I feel as if -- as if perhaps I had one or two pretty important things in my life to make up for .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 6]: Well , I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 13]: I ca n't make them up to -- to whom I would .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 29]: It 's struck me that , as I could n't , I might be a little decent to somebody else , perhaps -- if I could manage it !
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 13]: I never have been particularly decent to poor old Aunt Fanny . ''
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 14]: `` Oh , I do n't know : I should n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 14]: A little youthful teasing -- I doubt if she 's minded so much .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 37]: She felt your father 's death terrifically , of course , but it seems to me she 's had a fairly comfortable life-up to now -- if she was disposed to take it that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 16]: `` But ` up to now ' is the important thing , '' George said .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 25]: `` Now is now -- and you see I ca n't wait two years to be admitted to the bar and begin to practice .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 26]: I 've got to start in at something else that pays from the start , and that 's what I 've come to you about .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 9]: I have an idea , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'm glad of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 6]: said old Frank , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 18]: `` I ca n't think of anything just at this minute that pays from the start . ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 11]: `` I only know of one thing , myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 13]: George flushed again , but managed to laugh at his own embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 20]: `` I suppose I 'm about as ignorant of business as anybody in the world , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 32]: `` But I 've heard they pay very high wages to people in dangerous trades ; I 've always heard they did , and I 'm sure it must be true .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 34]: I mean people that handle touchy chemicals or high explosives -- men in dynamite factories , or who take things of that sort about the country in wagons , and shoot oil wells .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 48]: I thought I 'd see if you could n't tell me something more about it , or else introduce me to someone who could , and then I thought I 'd see if I could n't get something of the kind to do as soon as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 39]: My nerves are good ; I 'm muscular , and I 've got a steady hand ; it seemed to me that this was about the only line of work in the world that I 'm fitted for .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 11]: I wanted to get started to-day if I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 8]: Old Frank gave him a long stare .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 40]: At first this scrutiny was sharply incredulous ; then it was grave ; finally it developed into a threat of overwhelming laughter ; a forked vein in his forehead became more visible and his eyes seemed about to protrude .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 17]: But he controlled his impulse ; and , rising , took up his hat and overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 8]: `` All right , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 26]: `` If you 'll promise not to get blown up , I 'll go with you to see if we can find the job . ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 32]: Then , meaning what he said , but amazed that he did mean it , he added : `` You certainly are the most practical young man I ever met ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 7]: Chapter XXXIII They found the job .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 28]: It needed an apprenticeship of only six weeks , during which period George was to receive fifteen dollars a week ; after that he would get twenty-eight .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 24]: This settled the apartment question , and Fanny was presently established in a greater contentment than she had known for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 28]: Early every morning she made something she called -LRB- and believed to be -RRB- coffee for George , and he was gallant enough not to undeceive her .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 33]: She lunched alone in her `` kitchenette , '' for George 's place of employment was ten miles out of town on an interurban trolley-line , and he seldom returned before seven .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 19]: Fanny found partners for bridge by two o'clock almost every afternoon , and she played until about six .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 25]: Then she got George 's `` dinner clothes '' out for him -- he maintained this habit -- and she changed her own dress .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 53]: When he arrived he usually denied that he was tired , though he sometimes looked tired , particularly during the first few months ; and he explained to her frequently -- looking bored enough with her insistence -- that his work was `` fairly light , and fairly congenial , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 22]: Fanny had the foggiest idea of what it was , though she noticed that it roughened his hands and stained them .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 15]: `` Something in those new chemical works , '' she explained to casual inquirers .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 10]: It was not more definite in her own mind .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 35]: Respect for George undoubtedly increased within her , however , and she told him she 'd always had a feeling he might `` turn out to be a mechanical genius , or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 14]: George assented with a nod , as the easiest course open to him .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 36]: He did not take a hand at bridge after dinner : his provisions ' for Fanny 's happiness refused to extend that far , and at the table d'hote he was a rather discouraging boarder .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 65]: He was considered `` affected '' and absurdly `` up-stage '' by the one or two young men , and the three or four young women , who enlivened the elderly retreat ; and was possibly less popular there than he had been elsewhere during his life , though he was now nothing worse than a coldly polite young man who kept to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 66]: After dinner he would escort his aunt from the table in some state -LRB- not wholly unaccompanied by a leerish wink or two from the wags of the place -RRB- and he would leave her at the door of the communal parlours and card rooms , with a formality in his bow of farewell which afforded an amusing contrast to Fanny 's always voluble protests .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 34]: -LRB- She never failed to urge loudly that he really must come and play , just this once , and not go hiding from everybody in his room every evening like this ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 62]: At least some of the other inhabitants found the contrast amusing , for sometimes , as he departed stiffly toward the elevator , leaving her still entreating in the doorway -LRB- though with one eye already on her table , to see that it was not seized -RRB- a titter would follow him which he was no doubt meant to hear .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 10]: He did not care whether they laughed or not .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 53]: And once , as he passed the one or two young men of the place entertaining the three or four young women , who were elbowing and jerking on a settee in the lobby , he heard a voice inquiring quickly , as he passed : `` What makes people tired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 4]: `` Work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 9]: `` Well , what 's the answer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 26]: Then , with an intentional outbreak of mirth , the answer was given by two loudly whispering voices together : `` A stuck-up boarder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 5]: George did n't care .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 13]: On Sunday mornings Fanny went to church and George took long walks .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 27]: He explored the new city , and found it hideous , especially in the early spring , before the leaves of the shade trees were out .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 29]: Then the town was fagged with the long winter and blacked with the heavier smoke that had been held close to the earth by the smoke-fog it bred .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 42]: Every-thing was damply streaked with the soot : the walls of the houses , inside and out , the gray curtains at the windows , the windows themselves , the dirty cement and unswept asphalt underfoot , the very sky overhead .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 65]: Throughout this murky season he continued his explorations , never seeing a face he knew -- for , on Sunday , those whom he remembered , or who might remember him , were not apt to be found within the limits of the town , but were congenially occupied with the new outdoor life which had come to be the mode since his boyhood .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 15]: He and Fanny were pretty thoroughly buried away within the bigness of the city .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 16]: One of his Sunday walks , that spring , he made into a sour pilgrimage .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 50]: It was a misty morning of belated snow slush , and suited him to a perfection of miserableness , as he stood before the great dripping department store which now occupied the big plot of ground where once had stood both the Amberson Hotel and the Amberson Opera House .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 25]: From there he drifted to the old `` Amberson Block , '' but this was fallen into a back-water ; business had stagnated here .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 51]: The old structure had not been replaced , but a cavernous entryway for trucks had been torn in its front , and upon the cornice , where the old separate metal letters had spelt `` Amberson Block , '' there was a long billboard sign : `` Doogan Storage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 64]: To spare himself nothing , he went out National Avenue and saw the piles of slush-covered wreckage where the Mansion and his mother 's house had been , and where the Major 's ill-fated five `` new '' houses had stood ; for these were down , too , to make room for the great tenement already shaped in unending lines of foundation .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 18]: But the Fountain of Neptune was gone at last -- and George was glad that it was !
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 30]: He turned away from the devastated site , thinking bitterly that the only Amberson mark still left upon the town was the name of the boulevard -- Amberson Boulevard .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 43]: But he had reckoned without the city council of the new order , and by an unpleasant coincidence , while the thought was still in his mind , his eye fell upon a metal oblong sign upon the lamppost at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 38]: There were two of these little signs upon the lamp-post , at an obtuse angle to each other , one to give passers-by the name of National Avenue , the other to acquaint them with Amberson Boulevard .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 21]: But the one upon which should have been stenciled `` Amberson Boulevard '' exhibited the words `` Tenth Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 6]: George stared at it hard .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 19]: Then he walked quickly along the boulevard to the next corner and looked at the little sign there .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 5]: `` Tenth Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 17]: It had begun to rain , but George stood unheeding , staring at the little sign .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 5]: `` Damn them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 22]: he said finally , and , turning up his coat-collar , plodded back through the soggy streets toward `` home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 14]: The utilitarian impudence of the city authorities put a thought into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 75]: A week earlier he had happened to stroll into the large parlour of the apartment house , finding it empty , and on the center table he noticed a large , red-bound , gilt-edged book , newly printed , bearing the title : `` A Civic History , '' and beneath the title , the rubric , `` Biographies of the 500 Most Prominent Citizens and Families in the History of the City . ''
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 33]: He had glanced at it absently , merely noticing the title and sub-title , and wandered out of the room , thinking of other things and feeling no curiosity about the book .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 36]: But he had thought of it several times since with a faint , vague uneasiness ; and now when he entered the lobby he walked directly into the parlour where he had seen the book .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 46]: The room was empty , as it always was on Sunday mornings , and the flamboyant volume was still upon the table -- evidently a fixture as a sort of local Almanach de Gotha , or Burke , for the enlightenment of tenants and boarders .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 61]: He opened it , finding a few painful steel engravings of placid , chin-bearded faces , some of which he remembered dimly ; but much more numerous , and also more unfamiliar to him , were the pictures of neat , aggressive men , with clipped short hair and clipped short moustaches -- almost all of them strangers to him .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 90]: He delayed not long with these , but turned to the index where the names of the five hundred Most Prominent Citizens and Families in the History of the City were arranged in alphabetical order , and ran his finger down the column of A 's : Abbett Abbott Abrams Adam Adams Adler Akers Albertsmeyer Alexander Allen Ambrose Ambuhl Anderson Andrews Appenbasch Archer Arszman Ashcraft Austin Avey George 's eyes remained for some time fixed on the thin space between the names `` Allen '' and `` Ambrose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 40]: Then he closed the book quietly , and went up to his own room , agreeing with the elevator boy , on the way , that it was getting to be a mighty nasty wet and windy day outside .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 28]: The elevator boy noticed nothing unusual about him and neither did Fanny , when she came in from church with her hat ruined , an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 28]: And yet something had happened -- a thing which , years ago , had been the eagerest hope of many , many good citizens of the town .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 27]: They had thought of it , longed for it , hoping acutely that they might live to see the day when it would come to pass .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 15]: And now it had happened at last : Georgie Minafer had got his come-upance .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 11]: He had got it three times filled and running over .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 24]: The city had rolled over his heart , burying it under , as it rolled over the Major 's and buried it under .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 75]: The city had rolled over the Ambersons and buried them under to the last vestige ; and it mattered little that George guessed easily enough that most of the five hundred Most Prominent had paid something substantial `` to defray the cost of steel engraving , etc. '' -- the Five Hundred had heaved the final shovelful of soot upon that heap of obscurity wherein the Ambersons were lost forever from sight and history .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 9]: `` Quicksilver in a nest of cracks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 29]: Georgie Minafer had got his come-upance , but the people who had so longed for it were not there to see it , and they never knew it .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 15]: Those who were still living had forgotten all about it and all about him .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 20]: Chapter XXXIV There was one border section of the city which George never explored in his Sunday morning excursions .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 44]: This was far out to the north where lay the new Elysian Fields of the millionaires , though he once went as far in that direction as the white house which Lucy had so admired long ago -- her `` Beautiful House . ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 18]: George looked at it briefly and turned back , rumbling with an interior laugh of some grimness .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 29]: The house was white no longer ; nothing could be white which the town had reached , and the town reached far beyond the beautiful white house now .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 24]: The owners had given up and painted it a despairing chocolate , suitable to the freight-yard life it was called upon to endure .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 30]: George did not again risk going even so far as that , in the direction of the millionaires , although their settlement began at least two miles farther out .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 46]: His thought of Lucy and her father was more a sensation than a thought , and may be compared to that of a convicted cashier beset by recollections of the bank he had pillaged -- there are some thoughts to which one closes the mind .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 11]: George had seen Eugene only once since their calamitous encounter .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 52]: They had passed on opposite sides of the street , downtown ; each had been aware of the other , and each had been aware that the other was aware of him , and yet each kept his eyes straight forward , and neither had shown a perceptible alteration of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 28]: It seemed to George that he felt emanating from the outwardly imperturbable person of his mother 's old friend a hate that was like a hot wind .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 45]: At his mother 's funeral and at the Major 's he had been conscious that Eugene was there : though he had afterward no recollection of seeing him , and , while certain of his presence , was uncertain how he knew of it .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 22]: Fanny had not told him , for she understood George well enough not to speak to him of Eugene or Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 24]: Nowadays Fanny almost never saw either of them and seldom thought of them -- so sly is the way of time with life .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 38]: She was passing middle age , when old intensities and longings grow thin and flatten out , as Fanny herself was thinning and flattening out ; and she was settling down contentedly to her apartment house intimacies .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 67]: She was precisely suited by the table-d'hote life , with its bridge , its variable alliances and shifting feuds , and the long whisperings of elderly ladies at corridor corners -- those eager but suppressed conversations , all sibilance , of which the elevator boy declared he heard the words `` she said '' a million times and the word `` she , '' five million .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 9]: The apartment house suited Fanny and swallowed her .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 27]: The city was so big , now , that people disappeared into it unnoticed , and the disappearance of Fanny and her nephew was not exceptional .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 50]: People no longer knew their neighbours as a matter of course ; one lived for years next door to strangers -- that sharpest of all the changes since the old days -- and a friend would lose sight of a friend for a year , and not know it .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 12]: One May day George thought he had a glimpse of Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 17]: He was not certain , but he was sufficiently disturbed , in spite of his uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 37]: A promotion in his work now frequently took him out of town for a week , or longer , and it was upon his return from one of these absences that he had the strange experience .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 52]: He had walked home from the station , and as he turned the corner which brought him in sight of the apartment house entrance , though two blocks distant from it , he saw a charming little figure come out , get into a shiny landaulet automobile , and drive away .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 46]: Even at that distance no one could have any doubt that the little figure was charming ; and the height , the quickness and decision of motion , even the swift gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeur -- all were characteristic of Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 31]: George was instantly subjected to a shock of indefinable nature , yet definitely a shock : he did not know what he felt -- but he knew that he felt .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 31]: Heat surged over him : probably he would not have come face to face with her if the restoration of all the ancient Amberson magnificence could have been his reward .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 9]: He went on slowly , his knees shaky .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 46]: But he found Fanny not at home ; she had been out all afternoon ; and there was no record of any caller -- and he began to wonder , then to doubt if the small lady he had seen in the distance was Lucy .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 29]: It might as well have been , he said to himself -- since any one who looked like her could give him `` a jolt like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 7]: Lucy had not left a card .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 26]: She never left one when she called on Fanny ; though she did not give her reasons a quite definite form in her own mind .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 49]: She came seldom ; this was but the third time that year , and , when she did come , George was not mentioned either by her hostess or by herself -- an oddity contrived between the two ladies without either of them realizing how odd it was .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 36]: For , naturally , while Fanny was with Lucy , Fanny thought of George , and what time Lucy had George 's aunt before her eyes she could not well avoid the thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 24]: Consequently , both looked absent-minded as they talked , and each often gave a wrong answer which the other consistently failed to notice .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 28]: At other times Lucy 's thoughts of George were anything but continuous , and weeks went by when he was not consciously in her mind at all .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 110]: Her life was a busy one : she had the big house `` to keep up '' ; she had a garden to keep up , too , a large and beautiful garden ; she represented her father as a director for half a dozen public charity organizations , and did private charity work of her own , being a proxy mother of several large families ; and she had `` danced down , '' as she said , groups from eight or nine classes of new graduates returned from the universities , without marrying any of them , but she still danced -- and still did not marry .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 28]: Her father , observing this circumstance happily , yet with some hypocritical concern , spoke of it to her one day as they stood in her garden .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 18]: `` I suppose I 'd want to shoot him , '' he said , with attempted lightness .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 10]: `` But I must n't be an old pig .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 15]: I 'd build you a beautiful house close by -- just over yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 14]: That would be like -- '' she began impulsively ; then checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 43]: George Amberson 's comparison of the Georgian house to the Amberson Mansion had come into her mind , and she thought that another new house , built close by for her , would be like the house the Major built for Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 5]: `` Like what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 4]: `` Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 29]: She looked serious , and when he reverted to his idea of `` some day '' grudgingly surrendering her up to a suitor , she invented a legend .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 24]: `` Did you ever hear the Indian name for that little grove of beech trees on the other side of the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 4]: she asked him .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 10]: `` No -- and you never did either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 7]: `` Do n't be so sure !
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 63]: I read a great deal more than I used to -- getting ready for my bookish days when I 'll have to do something solid in the evenings and wo n't be asked to dance any more , even by the very youngest boys who think it 's a sporting event to dance with the oldest of the ` older girls ' .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 19]: The name of the grove was ` Loma-Nashah ' and it means ` They-Couldn ` t-Help-It ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 8]: `` Does n't sound like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 6]: `` Indian names do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 16]: There was a bad Indian chief lived in the grove before the white settlers came .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 20]: He was the worst Indian that ever lived , and his name was -- it was ` Vendonah . '
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 7]: That means ` Rides-Down-Everything ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 13]: `` His name was Vendonah , the same thing as Rides-Down-Everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 9]: `` I see , '' said Eugene thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 19]: He gave her a quick look and then fixed his eyes upon the end of the garden path .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 5]: `` Go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 11]: `` Vendonah was an unspeakable case , '' Lucy continued .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 20]: `` He was so proud that he wore iron shoes and he walked over people 's faces with them .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 38]: he was always killing people that way , and so at last the tribe decided that it was n't a good enough excuse for him that he was young and inexperienced -- he 'd have to go .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 63]: They took him down to the river , and put him in a canoe , and pushed him out from shore ; and then they ran along the bank and would n't let him land , until at last the current carried the canoe out into the middle , and then on down to the ocean , and he never got back .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 37]: They did n't want him back , of course , and if he 'd been able to manage it , they 'd have put him in another canoe and shoved him out into the river again .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 13]: But still , they did n't elect another chief in his place .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 49]: Other tribes thought that was curious , and wondered about it a lot , but finally they came to the conclusion that the beech grove people were afraid a new chief might turn out to be a bad Indian , too , and wear iron shoes like Vendonah .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 31]: But they were wrong , because the real reason was that the tribe had led such an exciting life under Vendonah that they could n't settle down to anything tamer .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 17]: He was awful , but he always kept things happening -- terrible things , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 24]: They hated him , but they were n't able to discover any other warrior that they wanted to make chief in his place .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 29]: I suppose it was a little like drinking a glass of too strong wine and then trying to take the taste out of your mouth with barley water .
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 9]: They could n't help feeling that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 8]: `` I see , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 16]: `` So that 's why they named the place ` They-Couldn ` t-Help-It ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 7]: `` It must have been . ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 18]: `` And so you 're going to stay here in your garden , '' he said musingly .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 33]: `` You think it 's better to keep on walking these sunshiny gravel paths between your flower-beds , and growing to look like a pensive garden lady in a Victorian engraving . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 14]: `` I suppose I 'm like the tribe that lived here , papa .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 7]: I had too much unpleasant excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 9]: It was unpleasant -- but it was excitement .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 19]: I do n't want any more ; in fact , I do n't want anything but you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 6]: `` You do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 22]: He looked at her keenly , and she laughed and shook her head ; but he seemed perplexed , rather doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 10]: `` What was the name of the grove ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 9]: `` The Indian name , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 4]: `` Mola-Haha . ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 16]: `` No , it was n't ; that was n't the name you said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 6]: `` I 've forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 16]: `` I see you have , '' he said , his look of perplexity remaining .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 11]: `` Perhaps you remember the chief 's name better . ''
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 6]: She shook her head again .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 6]: `` I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 40]: At this he laughed , but not very heartily , and walked slowly to the house , leaving her bending over a rose-bush , and a shade more pensive than the most pensive garden lady in any Victorian engraving .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 37]: ... Next day , it happened that this same `` Vendonah '' or `` Rides-Down-Everything '' became the subject of a chance conversation between Eugene and his old friend Kinney , father of the fire-topped Fred .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 21]: The two gentlemen found themselves smoking in neighbouring leather chairs beside a broad window at the club , after lunch .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 34]: Mr. Kinney had remarked that he expected to get his family established at the seashore by the Fourth of July , and , following a train of thought , he paused and chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 11]: `` Fourth of July reminds me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 12]: `` Have you heard what that Georgie Minafer is doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 23]: `` No , I have n't , '' said Eugene , and his friend failed to notice the crispness of the utterance .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 16]: `` Well , sir , '' Kinney chuckled again , `` it beats the devil !
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 9]: My boy Fred told me about it yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 21]: He 's a friend of this young Henry Akers , son of F. P. Akers of the Akers Chemical Company .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 50]: It seems this young Akers asked Fred if he knew a fellow named Minafer , because he knew Fred had always lived here , and young Akers had heard some way that Minafer used to be an old family name here , and was sort of curious about it .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 47]: Well , sir , you remember this young Georgie sort of disappeared , after his grandfather 's death , and nobody seemed to know much what had become of him -- though I did hear , once or twice , that he was still around somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 23]: Well , sir , he 's working for the Akers Chemical Company , out at their plant on the Thomasvile Road . ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 40]: He paused , seeming to reserve something to be delivered only upon inquiry , and Eugene offered him the expected question , but only after a cold glance through the nose-glasses he had lately found it necessary to adopt .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 7]: `` What does he do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 10]: Kinney laughed and slapped the arm of his chair .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 8]: `` He 's a nitroglycerin expert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 19]: He was gratified to see that Eugene was surprised , if not , indeed , a little startled .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 6]: `` He 's what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 8]: `` He 's an expert on nitroglycerin .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 7]: Does n't that beat the devil !
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 4]: Yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 26]: Young Akers told Fred that this George Minafer had worked like a houn ' - dog ever since he got started out at the works .
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 42]: They have a special plant for nitroglycerin , way off from the main plant , o ' course -- in the woods somewhere -- and George Minafer 's been working there , and lately they put him in charge of it .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 14]: He oversees shooting oil-wells , too , and shoots 'em himself , sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 19]: They are n't allowed to carry it on the railroads , you know -- have to team it .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 22]: Young Akers says George rides around over the bumpy roads , sitting on as much as three hundred quarts of nitroglycerin !
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 3]: My Lord !
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 5]: Talk about romantic tumbles !
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 26]: If he gets blown sky-high some day he wo n't have a bigger drop , when he comes down , than he 's already had !
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 7]: Do n't it beat the devil !
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 15]: Young Akers said he 's got all the nerve there is in the world .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 43]: Well , he always did have plenty of that -- from the time he used to ride around here on his white pony and fight all the Irish boys in Can-Town , with his long curls all handy to be pulled out .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 16]: Akers says he gets a fair salary , and I should think he ought to !
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 33]: Seems to me I 've heard the average life in that sort of work is somewhere around four years , and agents do n't write any insurance at all for nitroglycerin experts .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 3]: Hardly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 6]: `` I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 5]: Kinney rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 32]: `` Well , it 's a pretty funny thing -- pretty odd , I mean -- and I suppose it would be pass-around-the-hat for old Fanny Minafer if he blew up .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 18]: Fred told me that they 're living in some apartment house , and said Georgie supports her .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 26]: He was going to study law , but could n't earn enough that way to take care of Fanny , so he gave it up .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 8]: Fred 's wife told him all this .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 12]: Says Fanny does n't do anything but play bridge these days .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 27]: Got to playing too high for awhile and lost more than she wanted to tell Georgie about , and borrowed a little from old Frank Bronson .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 6]: Paid him back , though .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 10]: Do n't know how Fred 's wife heard it .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 9]: Women do ' hear the darndest things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 8]: `` They do , '' Eugene agreed .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 31]: `` I thought you 'd probably heard about it -- thought most likely Fred 's wife might have said something to your daughter , especially as they 're cousins . ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 6]: `` I think not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 20]: `` Well , I 'm off to the store , '' said Mr. Kinney briskly ; yet he lingered .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 24]: `` I suppose we 'll all have to club in and keep old Fanny out of the poorhouse if he does blow up .
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 13]: From all I hear it 's usually only a question of time .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 13]: They say she has n't got anything else to depend on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 6]: `` I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 10]: `` Well -- I wondered -- '' Kinney hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 18]: `` I was wondering why you had n't thought of finding something around your works for him .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 25]: They say he 's an all-fired worker and he certainly does seem to have hid some decent stuff in him under all his damfoolishness .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 44]: And you used to be such a tremendous friend of the family -- I thought perhaps you -- of course I know he 's a queer lot -- I know -- '' `` Yes , I think he is , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 9]: I have n't anything to offer him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 15]: `` I suppose not , '' Kinney returned thoughtfully , as he went out .
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 10]: `` I do n't know that I would myself .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 21]: Well , we 'll probably see his name in the papers some day if he stays with that job ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 36]: However , the nitroglycerin expert of whom they spoke did not get into the papers as a consequence of being blown up , although his daily life was certainly a continuous exposure to that risk .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 45]: Destiny has a constant passion for the incongruous , and it was George 's lot to manipulate wholesale quantities of terrific and volatile explosives in safety , and to be laid low by an accident so commonplace and inconsequent that it was a comedy .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 32]: Fate had reserved for him the final insult of riding him down under the wheels of one of those juggernauts at which he had once shouted `` Git a hoss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 51]: Nevertheless , Fate 's ironic choice for Georgie 's undoing was not a big and swift and momentous car , such as Eugene manufactured ; it was a specimen of the hustling little type that was flooding the country , the cheapest , commonest , hardiest little car ever made .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 33]: The accident took place upon a Sunday morning , on a downtown crossing , with the streets almost empty , and no reason in the world for such a thing to happen .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 62]: He had gone out for his Sunday morning walk , and he was thinking of an automobile at the very moment when the little car struck him ; he was thinking of a shiny landaulet and a charming figure stepping into it , and of the quick gesture of a white glove toward the chauffeur , motioning him to go on .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 35]: George heard a shout but did not look up , for he could not imagine anybody 's shouting at him , and he was too engrossed in the question `` Was it Lucy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 26]: He could not decide , and his lack of decision in this matter probably superinduced a lack of decision in another , more pressingly vital .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 61]: At the second and louder shout he did look up ; and the car was almost on him ; but he could not make up his mind if the charming little figure he had seen was Lucy 's and he could not make up his mind whether to go backward or forward : these questions became entangled in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 29]: Then , still not being able to decide which of two ways to go , he tried to go both -- and the little car ran him down .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 16]: It was not moving very rapidly , but it went all the way over George .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 51]: He was conscious of gigantic violence ; of roaring and jolting and concussion ; of choking clouds of dust , shot with lightning , about his head ; he heard snapping sounds as loud as shots from a small pistol , and was stabbed by excruciating pains in his legs .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 14]: Then he became aware that the machine was being lifted off of him .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 11]: People were gathering in a circle round him , gabbling .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 22]: His forehead was bedewed with the sweat of anguish , and he tried to wipe off this dampness , but failed .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 9]: He could not get his arm that far .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 30]: `` Nev ' mind , '' a policeman said ; and George could see above his eyes the skirts of the blue coat , covered with dust and sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 10]: `` Amb ` lance be here in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 9]: Nev ' mind tryin ' to move any .
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 11]: You want 'em to send for some special doctor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 7]: George 's lips formed the word .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 11]: `` Or to take you to some private hospital ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 19]: `` Tell them to take me , '' he said faintly , `` to the City Hospital . ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 6]: `` A ' right . ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 54]: A smallish young man in a duster fidgeted among the crowd , explaining and protesting , and a strident voiced girl , his companion , supported his argument , declaring to everyone her willingness to offer testimony in any court of law that every blessed word he said was the God 's truth .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 19]: `` It 's the fella that hit you , '' the policeman said , looking down on George .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 20]: `` I guess he 's right ; you must of been thinkin ' about somep 'm ' or other .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 37]: It 's wunnerful the damage them little machines can do -- you 'd never think it -- but I guess they ai n't much case ag ` in this fella that was drivin ' it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 14]: `` You bet your life they ai n't no case on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 12]: the young man in the duster agreed , with great bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 31]: He came and stood at George 's feet , addressing him heatedly : `` I 'm sorry fer you all right , and I do n't say I ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 19]: I hold nothin ' against you , but it was n't any more my fault than the statehouse !
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 33]: You run into me , much as I run into you , and if you get well you ai n't goin ' to get not one single cent out o ' me !
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 15]: This lady here was settin ' with me and we both yelled at you .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 12]: Was n't goin ' a step over eight mile an hour !
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 21]: I 'm perfectly willing to say I 'm sorry for you though , and so 's the lady with me .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 17]: We 're both willing to say that much , but that 's all , understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 31]: George 's drawn eyelids twitched ; his misted glance rested fleetingly upon the two protesting motorists , and the old imperious spirit within him flickered up in a single word .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 42]: Lying on his back in the middle of the street , where he was regarded an increasing public as an unpleasant curiosity , he spoke this word clearly from a mouth filled with dust , and from lips smeared with blood .
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 9]: It was a word which interested the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 17]: When the ambulance clanged away , he turned to a fellow patrolman who had joined him .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 14]: `` Funny what he says to the little cuss that done the damage .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 29]: That 's all he did call him -- ` nothin ' else at all -- and the cuss had broke both his legs fer him and God-knows-what-all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 7]: `` I was n't here then .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 5]: What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 4]: `` Riffraff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 27]: Chapter XXXV Eugene 's feeling about George had not been altered by his talk with Kinney in the club window , though he was somewhat disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 59]: He was not disturbed by Kinney 's hint that Fanny Minafer might be left on the hands of her friends through her nephew 's present dealings with nitroglycerin , but he was surprised that Kinney had `` led up '' with intentional tact to the suggestion that a position might be made for George in the Morgan factory .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 15]: Eugene did not care to have any suggestions about Georgie Minafer made to him .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 58]: Kinney had represented Georgie as a new Georgie -- at least in spots -- a Georgie who was proving that decent stuff had been hid in him ; in fact , a Georgie who was doing rather a handsome thing in taking a risky job for the sake of his aunt , poor old silly Fanny Minafer !
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 40]: Eugene did n't care what risks Georgie took , or how much decent stuff he had in him : nothing that Georgie would ever do in this world or the next could change Eugene Morgan 's feeling toward him .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 49]: If Eugene could possibly have brought himself to offer Georgie a position in the automobile business , he knew full well the proud devil would n't have taken it from him ; though Georgie 's proud reason would not have been the one attributed to him by Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 24]: George would never reach the point where he could accept anything material from Eugene and preserve the self-respect he had begun to regain .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 22]: But if Eugene had wished , he could easily have taken George out of the nitroglycerin branch of the chemical works .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 66]: Always interested in apparent impossibilities of invention , Eugene had encouraged many experiments in such gropings as those for the discovery of substitutes for gasoline and rubber ; and , though his mood had withheld the information from Kinney , he had recently bought from the elder Akers a substantial quantity of stock on the condition that the chemical company should establish an experimental laboratory .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 29]: He intended to buy more ; Akers was anxious to please him ; and a word from Eugene would have placed George almost anywhere in the chemical works .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 37]: George need never have known it , for Eugene 's purchases of stock were always quiet ones : the transaction remained , so far , between him and Akers , and could be kept between them .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 36]: The possibility just edged itself into Eugene 's mind ; that is , he let it become part of his perceptions long enough for it to prove to him that it was actually a possibility .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 28]: Then he half started with disgust that he should be even idly considering such a thing over his last cigar for the night , in his library .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 14]: And he threw the cigar into the empty fireplace and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 16]: His bitterness for himself might have worn away , but never his bitterness for Isabel .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 26]: He took that thought to bed with him -- and it was true that nothing George could do would ever change this bitterness of Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 9]: Only George 's mother could have changed it .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 23]: And as Eugene fell asleep that night , thinking thus bitterly of Georgie , Georgie in the hospital was thinking of Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 37]: He had come `` out of ether '' with no great nausea , and had fallen into a reverie , though now and then a white sailboat staggered foolishly into the small ward where he lay .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 34]: After a time he discovered that this happened only when he tried to open his eyes and look about him ; so he kept his eyes shut , and his thoughts were clearer .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 36]: He thought of Eugene Morgan and of the Major ; they seemed to be the same person for awhile , but he managed to disentangle them and even to understand why he had confused them .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 24]: Long ago his grandfather had been the most striking figure of success in the town : `` As rich as Major Amberson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 5]: they used to say .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 5]: Now it was Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 39]: `` If I had Eugene Morgan 's money , '' he would hear the workmen day-dreaming at the chemical works ; or , `` If Eugene Morgan had hold of this place you 'd see things hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 22]: And the boarders at the table d'hôte spoke of `` the Morgan Place '' as an eighteenth-century Frenchman spoke of Versailles .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 19]: Like his uncle , George had perceived that the `` Morgan Place '' was the new Amberson Mansion .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 62]: His reverie went back to the palatial days of the Mansion , in his boyhood , when he would gallop his pony up the driveway and order the darkey stable-men about , while they whooped and obeyed , and his grandfather , observing from a window , would laugh and call out to him , `` That 's right , Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 7]: Make those lazy rascals jump ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 22]: He remembered his gay young uncles , and how the town was eager concerning everything about them , and about himself .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 10]: What a clean , pretty town it had been !
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 28]: And in his reverie be saw like a pageant before him the magnificence of the Ambersons -- its passing , and the passing of the Ambersons themselves .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 22]: They had been slowly engulfed without knowing how to prevent it , and almost without knowing what was happening to them .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 32]: The family lot , in the shabby older quarter , out at the cemetery , held most of them now ; and the name was swept altogether from the new city .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 24]: But the new great people who had taken their places -- the Morgans and Akerses and Sheridans -- they would go , too .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 4]: George saw that .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 49]: They would pass , as the Ambersons had passed , and though some of them might do better than the Major and leave the letters that spelled a name on a hospital or a street , it would be only a word and it would not stay forever .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 18]: Nothing stays or holds or keeps where there is growth , he somehow perceived vaguely but truly .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 37]: Great Caesar dead and turned to clay stopped no hole to keep the wind away dead Caesar was nothing but a tiresome bit of print in a book that schoolboys study for awhile and then forget .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 59]: The Ambersons had passed , and the new people would pass , and the new people that came after them , and then the next new ones , and the next -- and the next -- He had begun to murmur , and the man on duty as night nurse for the ward came and bent over him .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 7]: `` Did you want something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 15]: `` There 's nothing in this family business , '' George told him confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 12]: `` Even George Washington is only something in a book . ''
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 14]: Eugene read a report of the accident in the next morning 's paper .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 62]: He was on the train , having just left for New York , on business , and with less leisure would probably have overlooked the obscure item : LEGS BROKEN G. A. Minafer , an employee of the Akers Chemical Co. , was run down by an automobile yesterday at the corner of Tennessee and Main and had both legs broken .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 19]: Minafer was to blame for the accident according to patrolman F. A. Kax , who witnessed the affair .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 27]: The automobile was a small one driven by Herbert Cottleman of 9173 Noble Avenue who stated that he was making less than 4 miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 16]: Minafer is said to belong to a family formerly of considerable prominence in the city .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 28]: He was taken to the City Hospital where physicians stated later that he was suffering from internal injuries besides the fracture of his legs but might recover .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 26]: Eugene read the item twice , then tossed the paper upon the opposite seat of his compartment , and sat looking out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 21]: His feeling toward Georgie was changed not a jot by his human pity for Georgie 's human pain and injury .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 20]: He thought of Georgie 's tall and graceful figure , and he shivered , but his bitterness was untouched .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 38]: He had never blamed Isabel for the weakness which had cost them the few years of happiness they might have had together ; he had put the blame all on the son , and it stayed there .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 39]: He began to think poignantly of Isabel : he had seldom been able to `` see '' her more clearly than as he sat looking out of his compartment window , after reading the account of this accident .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 64]: She might have been just on the other side of the glass , looking in at him -- and then he thought of her as the pale figure of a woman , seen yet unseen , flying through the air , beside the train , over the fields of springtime green and through the woods that were just sprouting out their little leaves .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 14]: He closed his eyes and saw her as she had been long ago .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 32]: He saw the brown-eyed , brown-haired , proud , gentle , laughing girl he had known when first he came to town , a boy just out of the State College .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 47]: He remembered -- as he had remembered ten thousand times before -- the look she gave him when her brother George introduced him to her at a picnic ; it was `` like hazel starlight '' he had written her , in a poem , afterward .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 31]: He remembered his first call at the Amberson Mansion , and what a great personage she seemed , at home in that magnificence ; and yet so gay and friendly .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 27]: He remembered the first time he had danced with her -- and the old waltz song began to beat in his ears and in his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 106]: They laughed and sang it together as they danced to it : `` Oh , love for a year , a week , a day , But alas for the love that lasts always -- '' Most plainly of all he could see her dancing ; and he became articulate in the mourning whisper : `` So graceful -- oh , so graceful -- '' All the way to New York it seemed to him that Isabel was near him , and he wrote of her to Lucy from his hotel the next night : I saw an account of the accident to George Minafer .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 16]: I 'm sorry , though the paper states that it was plainly his own fault .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 30]: I suppose it may have been as a result of my attention falling upon the item that I thought of his mother a great deal on the way here .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 36]: It seemed to me that I had never seen her more distinctly or so constantly , but , as you know , thinking of his mother is not very apt to make me admire him !
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 14]: Of course , however , he has my best wishes for his recovery .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 26]: He posted the letter , and by the morning 's mail he received one from Lucy written a few hours after his departure from home .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 11]: She enclosed the item he had read on the train .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 8]: I thought you might not see it .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 17]: I have seen Miss Fanny and she has got him put into a room by himself .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 27]: Oh , poor Rides-Down-Everything I have been thinking so constantly of his mother and it seemed to me that I have never seen her more distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 11]: How lovely she was -- and how she loved him !
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 20]: If Lucy had not written this letter Eugene might not have done the odd thing he did that day .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 60]: Nothing could have been more natural than that both he and Lucy should have thought intently of Isabel after reading the account of George 's accident , but the fact that Lucy 's letter had crossed his own made Eugene begin to wonder if a phenomenon of telepathy might not be in question , rather than a chance coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 49]: The reference to Isabel in the two letters was almost identical : he and Lucy , it appeared , had been thinking of Isabel at the same time -- both said `` constantly '' thinking of her -- and neither had ever `` seen her more distinctly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 10]: He remembered these phrases in his own letter accurately .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 17]: Reflection upon the circumstance stirred a queer spot in Eugene 's brain -- he had one .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 50]: He was an adventurer ; if he had lived in the sixteenth century he would have sailed the unknown new seas , but having been born in the latter part of the nineteenth , when geography was a fairly well-settled matter , he had become an explorer in mechanics .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 44]: But the fact that he was a `` hard-headed business man '' as well as an adventurer did not keep him from having a queer spot in his brain , because hard-headed business men are as susceptible to such spots as adventurers are .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 49]: Some of them are secretly troubled when they do not see the new moon over the lucky shoulder ; some of them have strange , secret incredulities -- they do not believe in geology , for instance ; and some of them think they have had supernatural experiences .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 15]: `` Of course there was nothing in it -- still it was queer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 3]: they say .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 34]: Two weeks after Isabel 's death , Eugene had come to New York on urgent business and found that the delayed arrival of a steamer gave him a day with nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 17]: His room at the hotel had become intolerable ; outdoors was intolerable ; everything was intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 32]: It seemed to him that he must see Isabel once more , hear her voice once more ; that he must find some way to her , or lose his mind .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 31]: Under this pressure he had gone , with complete scepticism , to a `` trance-medium '' of whom he had heard wild accounts from the wife of a business acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 18]: He thought despairingly that at least such an excursion would be `` trying to do something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 19]: He remembered the woman 's name ; found it in the telephone book , and made an appointment .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 55]: The experience had been grotesque , and he came away with an encouraging message from his father , who had failed to identify himself satisfactorily , but declared that everything was `` on a higher plane '' in his present state of being , and that all life was `` continuous and progressive . ''
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 31]: Mrs. Horner spoke of herself as a `` psychic '' ; but otherwise she seemed oddly unpretentious and matter-of-fact ; and Eugene had no doubt at all of her sincerity .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 46]: He was sure that she was not an intentional fraud , and though he departed in a state of annoyance with himself , he came to the conclusion that if any credulity were played upon by Mrs. Horner 's exhibitions , it was her own .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 30]: Nevertheless , his queer spot having been stimulated to action by the coincidence of the letters , he went to Mrs. Horner 's after his directors ' meeting today .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 43]: He used the telephone booth in the directors ' room to make the appointment ; and he laughed feebly at himself , and wondered what the group of men in that mahogany apartment would think if they knew what he was doing .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 39]: Mrs. Horner had changed her address , but he found the new one , and somebody purporting to be a niece of hers talked to him and made an appointment for a `` sitting '' at five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 80]: He was prompt , and the niece , a dull-faced fat girl with a magazine under her arm , admitted him to Mrs. Horner 's apartment , which smelt of camphor ; and showed him into a room with gray painted walls , no rug on the floor and no furniture except a table -LRB- with nothing on it -RRB- and two chairs : one a leather easy-chair and the other a stiff little brute with a wooden seat .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 27]: There was one window with the shade pulled down to the sill , but the sun was bright outside , and the room had light enough .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 36]: Mrs. Horner appeared in the doorway , a wan and unenterprising looking woman in brown , with thin hair artificially waved -- but not recently -- and parted in the middle over a bluish forehead .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 14]: Her eyes were small and seemed weak , but she recognized the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 20]: `` Oh , you been here before , '' she said , in a thin voice , not unmusical .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 5]: `` I recollect you .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 11]: Quite a time ago , wa 'n' t it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 9]: `` Yes , quite a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 10]: `` I recollect because I recollect you was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 9]: Anyway , you was kind of cross . ''
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 4]: She laughed faintly .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 13]: `` I 'm sorry if I seemed so , '' Eugene said .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 12]: `` Do you happen to have found out my name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 8]: She looked surprised and a little reproachful .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 5]: `` Why , no .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 10]: I never try to find out people 's name .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 35]: I do n't claim anything for the power ; I only know I have it -- and some ways it ai n't always such a blessing , neither , I can tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 19]: Eugene did not press an investigation of her meaning , but said vaguely , `` I suppose not .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 26]: Shall we -- '' `` All right , '' she assented , dropping into the leather chair , with her back to the shaded window .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 11]: `` You better set down , too , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 19]: I hope you 'll get something this time so you wo n't feel cross , but I dunno .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 10]: I ca n't never tell what they 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 45]: Well -- '' She sighed , closed her eyes , and was silent , while Eugene , seated in the stiff chair across the table from her , watched her profile , thought himself an idiot , and called himself that and other names .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 30]: And as the silence continued , and the impassive woman in the easy-chair remained impassive , he began to wonder what had led him to be such a fool .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 28]: It became clear to him that the similarity of his letter and Lucy 's needed no explanation involving telepathy , and was not even an extraordinary coincidence .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 28]: What , then , had brought him back to this absurd place and caused him to be watching this absurd woman taking a nap in a chair ?
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 12]: In brief : What the devil did he mean by it ?
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 36]: He had not the slightest interest in Mrs. Horner 's naps -- or in her teeth , which were being slightly revealed by the unconscious parting of her lips , as her breathing became heavier .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 30]: If the vagaries of his own mind had brought him into such a grotesquerie as this , into what did the vagaries of other men 's minds take them ?
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 35]: Confident that he was ordinarily saner than most people , he perceived that since he was capable of doing a thing like this , other men did even more idiotic things , in secret .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 30]: And he had a fleeting vision of sober-looking bankers and manufacturers and lawyers , well-dressed church-going men , sound citizens -- and all as queer as the deuce inside !
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 16]: How long was he going to sit here presiding over this unknown woman 's slumbers ?
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 23]: It struck him that to make the picture complete he ought to be shooing flies away from her with a palm-leaf fan .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 53]: Mrs. Horner 's parted lips closed again abruptly , and became compressed ; her shoulders moved a little , then jerked repeatedly ; her small chest heaved ; she gasped , and the compressed lips relaxed to a slight contortion , then began to move , whispering and bringing forth indistinguishable mutterings .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 16]: Suddenly she spoke in a loud , husky voice : `` Lopa is here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' Eugene said dryly .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 9]: `` That 's what you said last time .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 6]: I remember ` Lopa . '
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 12]: She 's your ` control ' I think you said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 11]: `` I 'm Lopa , '' said the husky voice .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 7]: `` I 'm Lopa herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 15]: `` You mean I 'm to suppose you 're not Mrs. Horner now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 7]: `` Never was Mrs. Horner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 58]: the voice declared , speaking undeniably from Mrs. Horner 's lips -- but with such conviction that Eugene , in spite of everything , began to feel himself in the presence of a third party , who was none the less an individual , even though she might be another edition of the apparently somnambulistic Mrs. Horner .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 11]: `` Never was Mrs. Horner or anybody but just Lopa .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 3]: Guide . ''
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 11]: `` You mean you 're Mrs. Horner 's guide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 21]: `` Your guide now , '' said the voice with emphasis , to which was incongruously added a low laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 7]: `` You came here once before .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 4]: Lopa remembers . ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 9]: `` Yes -- so did Mrs. Horner . ''
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 14]: Lopa overlooked his implication , and continued , quickly : `` You build .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 5]: Build things that go .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 16]: You came here once and old gentleman on this side , he spoke to you .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 6]: Same old gentleman here now .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 16]: He tell Lopa he 's your grandfather -- no , he says ` father . '
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 6]: He 's your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 7]: `` What 's his appearance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 8]: `` What does he look like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 4]: `` Very fine !
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 8]: White beard , but not long beard .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 10]: He says someone else wants to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 3]: See here .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 2]: Lady .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 6]: Not his wife , though .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 4]: Very fine lady !
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 7]: Fine lady , fine lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 7]: `` Is it my sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 3]: Eugene asked .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 3]: `` Sister ?
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 6]: She is shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 6]: She has pretty brown hair .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 6]: She is fond of you .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 15]: She is someone who knows you very well but she is not your sister .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 13]: She is very anxious to say something to you -- very anxious .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 12]: Very fond of you ; very anxious to talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 13]: Very glad you came here -- oh , very , glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 7]: `` What is her name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 13]: `` Name , '' the voice repeated , and seemed to ruminate .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 12]: `` Name hard to get -- always very hard for Lopa .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 2]: Name .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 11]: She wants to tell me her name to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 11]: She wants you to understand names are hard to make .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 13]: She says you must think of something that makes a sound . ''
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 18]: Here the voice seemed to put a question to an invisible presence and to receive an answer .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 9]: `` A little sound or a big sound ?
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 13]: She says it might be a little sound or a big sound .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 10]: She says a ring -- oh , Lopa knows !
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 5]: She means a bell !
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 8]: That 's it , a bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 4]: Eugene looked grave .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 10]: `` Does she mean her name is Belle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 4]: `` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 6]: Her name is longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 17]: `` Perhaps , '' he suggested , `` she means that she was a belle . ''
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 10]: She says she thinks you know what she means .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 9]: She says you must think of a colour .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 4]: What colour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 16]: Again Lopa addressed the unknown , but this time seemed to wait for an answer .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 14]: `` Perhaps she means the colour of her eyes , '' said Eugene .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 20]: She says her colour is light -- it 's a light colour and you can see through it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 4]: `` Amber ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 32]: he said , and was startled , for Mrs. Horner , with her eyes still closed , clapped her hands , and the voice cried out in delight : `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 10]: She says you know who she is from amber .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 2]: Amber !
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 2]: Amber !
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 4]: That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 15]: She says you understand what her name is from a bell and from amber .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 15]: She is laughing and waving a lace handkerchief at me because she is pleased .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 12]: She says I have made you know who it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 34]: This was the strangest moment of Eugene 's life , because , while it lasted , he believed that Isabel Amberson , who was dead , had found means to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 13]: Though within ten minutes he doubted it , he believed it then .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 29]: His elbows pressed hard upon the table , and , his head between his hands , he leaned forward , staring at the commonplace figure in the easy-chair .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 11]: `` What does she wish to say to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 9]: `` She is happy because you know her .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 6]: No -- she is troubled .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 6]: Oh -- a great trouble !
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 7]: Something she wants to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 8]: She wants so much to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 7]: She wants Lopa to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 6]: This is a great trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 17]: She says -- oh , yes , she wants you to be -- to be kind !
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 6]: That 's what she says .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 4]: That 's it .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 5]: To be kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 18]: `` Does she -- '' `` She wants you to be kind , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 9]: `` She nods when I tell you this .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 7]: Yes ; it must be right .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 7]: She is a very fine lady .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 3]: Very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 9]: She is so anxious for you to understand .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 7]: She hopes and hopes you will .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 8]: Someone else wants to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 5]: This is a man .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 21]: He says -- '' `` I do n't want to speak to any one else , '' said Eugene quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 20]: `` I want -- '' `` This man who has come says that he is a friend of yours .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 12]: He says -- '' Eugene struck the table with his fist .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 17]: `` I do n't want to speak to any one else , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 4]: he cried passionately .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 22]: `` If she is there I -- '' He caught his breath sharply , checked himself , and sat in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 13]: Could his mind so easily accept so stupendous a thing as true ?
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 4]: Evidently it could !
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 17]: Mrs. Horner spoke languidly in her own voice : `` Did you get anything satisfactory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 25]: `` I certainly hope it was n't like that other time when you was cross because they could n't get anything for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 10]: `` No , no , '' he said hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 10]: `` This was different It was very interesting . ''
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 17]: He paid her , went to his hotel , and thence to his train for home .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 63]: Never did he so seem to move through a world of dream-stuff : for he knew that he was not more credulous than other men , and , if he could believe what he had believed , though he had believed it for no longer than a moment or two , what hold had he or any other human being on reality ?
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 34]: His credulity vanished -LRB- or so he thought -RRB- with his recollection that it was he , and not the alleged `` Lopa , '' who had suggested the word `` amber . ''
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 64]: Going over the mortifying , plain facts of his experience , he found that Mrs. Horner , or the subdivision of Mrs. Horner known as `` Lopa , '' had told him to think of a bell and of a colour , and that being furnished with these scientific data , he had leaped to the conclusion that he spoke with Isabel Amberson !
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 30]: For a moment he had believed that Isabel was there , believed that she was close to him , entreating him -- entreating him `` to be kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 11]: But with this recollection a strange agitation came upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 10]: After all , had she not spoken to him ?
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 36]: If his own unknown consciousness had told the `` psychic 's '' unknown consciousness how to make the picture of the pretty brown-haired , brown-eyed lady , had n't the picture been a true one ?
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 14]: And had n't the true Isabel -- oh , indeed her very soul !
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 13]: -- called to him out of his own true memory of her ?
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 60]: And as the train roared through the darkened evening he looked out beyond his window , and saw her as he had seen her on his journey , a few days ago -- an ethereal figure flying beside the train , but now it seemed to him that she kept her face toward his window with an infinite wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 6]: `` To be kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 14]: If it had been Isabel , was that what she would have said ?
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 27]: If she were anywhere , and could come to him through the invisible wall , what would be the first thing she would say to him ?
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 18]: Ah , well enough , and perhaps bitterly enough , he knew the answer to that question !
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 9]: `` To be kind '' -- to Georgie !
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 25]: A red-cap at the station , when he arrived , leaped for his bag , abandoning another which the Pullman porter had handed him .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 7]: `` Yessuh , Mist ' Morgan .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 2]: Yessuh .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 18]: You ' car waitin ' front the station fer you , Mist ' Morgan , suh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 25]: And people in the crowd about the gates turned to stare , as he passed through , whispering , `` That 's Morgan . ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 18]: Outside , the neat chauffeur stood at the door of the touring-car like a soldier in whip-cord .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 20]: `` I 'll not go home now , Harry , '' said Eugene , when he had got in .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 8]: `` Drive to the City Hospital . ''
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , '' the man returned .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 6]: `` Miss Lucy 's there .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 14]: She said she expected you 'd come there before you went home . ''
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 5]: `` She did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 3]: Eugene stared .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 14]: `` I suppose Mr. Minafer must be pretty bad , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 14]: I understand he 's liable to get well , though , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 37]: He moved his lever into high speed , and the car went through the heavy traffic like some fast , faithful beast that knew its way about , and knew its master 's need of haste .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 11]: Eugene did not speak again until they reached the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 16]: Fanny met him in the upper corridor , and took him to an open door .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 72]: He stopped on the threshold , startled ; for , from the waxen face on the pillow , almost it seemed the eyes of Isabel herself were looking at him : never before had the resemblance between mother and son been so strong -- and Eugene knew that now he had once seen it thus startlingly , he need divest himself of no bitterness `` to be kind '' to Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 6]: George was startled , too .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 27]: He lifted a white hand in a queer gesture , half forbidding , half imploring , and then let his arm fall back upon the coverlet .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 30]: `` You must have thought my mother wanted you to come , '' he said , `` so that I could ask you to -- to forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 22]: But Lucy , who sat beside him , lifted ineffable eyes from him to her father , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 12]: `` No , just to take his hand -- gently ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 4]: She was radiant .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 9]: But for Eugene another radiance filled the room .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 27]: He knew that he had been true at last to his true love , and that through him she had brought her boy under shelter again .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 8]: Her eyes would look wistful no more .
