Parsing [sent. 1 len. 28]: AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND By George Mac Donald Author of `` Dealings with Fairies , '' `` Ranald Bannerman , '' etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 3]: CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 17]: THE HAY-LOFT I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 28]: An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there , and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer , and drowned themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 9]: My story is not the same as his .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 14]: I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 16]: I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 32]: He lived in a low room over a coach-house ; and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind , as his mother very well knew .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 30]: For one side of the room was built only of boards , and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 12]: And then let them settle between them which was the sharper !
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 39]: I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse , and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 46]: Still , this room was not very cold , except when the north wind blew stronger than usual : the room I have to do with now was always cold , except in summer , when the sun took the matter into his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 35]: Indeed , I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all ; for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 69]: And when little Diamond -- but stop : I must tell you that his father , who was a coachman , had named him after a favourite horse , and his mother had had no objection : -- when little Diamond , then , lay there in bed , he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark , or moving sleepily in their dreams .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 69]: For Diamond 's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it , because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house ; and Diamond 's father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed , because he was a quiet horse , and did not go to sleep standing , but lay down like a reasonable creature .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 77]: But , although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature , yet , when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night , and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind , he could not help wondering whether , if the wind should blow the house down , and he were to fall through into the manger , old Diamond might n't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 56]: And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long , yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake , and then young Diamond knew what o'clock it was , or at least what was to be done next , which was -- to go to sleep again as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 22]: There was hay at his feet and hay at his head , piled up in great trusses to the very roof .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 34]: Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings , which looked as if it had been sawn out for him , that he could reach his bed at all .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 23]: For the stock of hay was , of course , always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 54]: Sometimes the whole space of the loft , with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in , would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed ; sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 82]: Sometimes , when his mother had undressed him in her room , and told him to trot to bed by himself , he would creep into the heart of the hay , and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind , and how warm it was inside there in his bed , and how he could go to it when he pleased , only he would n't just yet ; he would get a little colder first .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 48]: And ever as he grew colder , his bed would grow warmer , till at last he would scramble out of the hay , shoot like an arrow into his bed , cover himself up , and snuggle down , thinking what a happy boy he was .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 25]: He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall , and blew about him all night .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 26]: For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick , and on the other side of them was the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 15]: Now , as I have already said , these boards were soft and crumbly .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 23]: To be sure , they were tarred on the outside , yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 53]: Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it , little Diamond found one night , after he lay down , that a knot had come out of one of them , and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 59]: Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right ; so he jumped out of bed again , got a little strike of hay , twisted it up , folded it in the middle , and , having thus made it into a cork , stuck it into the hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 50]: But the wind began to blow loud and angrily , and , as Diamond was falling asleep , out blew his cork and hit him on the nose , just hard enough to wake him up quite , and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 26]: He searched for his hay-cork , found it , stuck it in harder , and was just dropping off once more , when , pop !
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 19]: with an angry whistle behind it , the cork struck him again , this time on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 19]: Up he rose once more , made a fresh stopple of hay , and corked the hole severely .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 10]: But he was hardly down again before -- pop !
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: it came on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 18]: He gave it up , drew the clothes above his head , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 49]: Although the next day was very stormy , Diamond forgot all about the hole , for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother 's fire with a broken chair , a three-legged stool , and a blanket , and then sitting in it .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 39]: His mother , however , discovered it , and pasted a bit of brown paper over it , so that , when Diamond had snuggled down the next night , he had no occasion to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 11]: Presently , however , he lifted his head and listened .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 8]: Who could that be talking to him ?
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 18]: The wind was rising again , and getting very loud , and full of rushes and whistles .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 18]: He was sure some one was talking -- and very near him , too , it was .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 23]: But he was not frightened , for he had not yet learned how to be ; so he sat up and hearkened .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 26]: At last the voice , which , though quite gentle , sounded a little angry , appeared to come from the back of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 14]: He crept nearer to it , and laid his ear against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 14]: Then he heard nothing but the wind , which sounded very loud indeed .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 25]: The moment , however , that he moved his head from the wall , he heard the voice again , close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: He felt about with his hand , and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 16]: Against this he laid his ear , and then he heard the voice quite distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 30]: There was , in fact , a little corner of the paper loose , and through that , as from a mouth in the wall , the voice came .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 15]: `` What do you mean , little boy -- closing up my window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 5]: `` What window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 11]: `` You stuffed hay into it three times last night .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 11]: I had to blow it out again three times . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 9]: `` You ca n't mean this little hole !
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 15]: It is n't a window ; it 's a hole in my bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 18]: `` I did not say it was a window : I said it was my window . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 19]: `` But it ca n't be a window , because windows are holes to see out of . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: `` Well , that 's just what I made this window for . ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 14]: `` But you are outside : you ca n't want a window . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 6]: `` You are quite mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 10]: Windows are to see out of , you say .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 19]: Well , I 'm in my house , and I want windows to see out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 12]: `` But you 've made a window into my bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 23]: `` Well , your mother has got three windows into my dancing room , and you have three into my garret . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 38]: `` But I heard father say , when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall , that it was against the law , for it would look into Mr. Dyves 's garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 4]: The voice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 12]: `` The law would have some trouble to catch me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 3]: it said .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 21]: `` But if it 's not right , you know , '' said Diamond , `` that 's no matter .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 7]: You should n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 16]: `` I am so tall I am above that law , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 14]: `` You must have a tall house , then , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 14]: `` Yes ; a tall house : the clouds are inside it . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 8]: said Diamond , and thought a minute .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 21]: `` I think , then , you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: Why do n't you make a window into Mr. Dyves 's bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 17]: `` Nobody makes a window into an ash-pit , '' said the voice , rather sadly .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 13]: `` I like to see nice things out of my windows . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 29]: `` But he must have a nicer bed than I have , though mine is very nice -- so nice that I could n't wish a better . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 17]: `` It 's not the bed I care about : it 's what is in it .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 9]: -- But you just open that window . ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 17]: `` Well , mother says I should n't be disobliging ; but it 's rather hard .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: You see the north wind will blow right in my face if I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 8]: `` I am the North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 4]: `` O-o-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 5]: said Diamond , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 18]: `` Then will you promise not to blow on my face if I open your window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 8]: `` I ca n't promise that . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 9]: `` But you 'll give me the toothache .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 7]: Mother 's got it already . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 13]: `` But what 's to become of me without a window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 9]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 16]: All I say is , it will be worse for me than for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: `` No ; it will not .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: You shall not be the worse for it -- I promise you that .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 9]: You will be much the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: Just you believe what I say , and do as I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 41]: `` Well , I can pull the clothes over my head , '' said Diamond , and feeling with his little sharp nails , he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 16]: In came a long whistling spear of cold , and struck his little naked chest .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 85]: He scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes , and covered himself up : there was no paper now between him and the voice , and he felt a little -- not frightened exactly -- I told you he had not learned that yet -- but rather queer ; for what a strange person this North Wind must be that lived in the great house -- `` called Out-of-Doors , I suppose , '' thought Diamond -- and made windows into people 's beds !
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 22]: But the voice began again ; and he could hear it quite plainly , even with his head under the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 33]: It was a still more gentle voice now , although six times as large and loud as it had been , and he thought it sounded a little like his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 10]: `` What is your name , little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 3]: it asked .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 11]: `` Diamond , '' answered Diamond , under the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 7]: `` What a funny name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 13]: `` It 's a very nice name , '' returned its owner .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 12]: `` I do n't know that , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 14]: `` Well , I do , '' retorted Diamond , a little rudely .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 11]: `` Do you know to whom you are speaking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: And indeed he did not .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 17]: For to know a person 's name is not always to know the person 's self .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 10]: `` Then I must not be angry with you .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 11]: -- You had better look and see , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 21]: `` Diamond is a very pretty name , '' persisted the boy , vexed that it should not give satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 13]: `` Diamond is a useless thing rather , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: `` That 's not true .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 16]: Diamond is very nice -- as big as two -- and so quiet all night !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 19]: And does n't he make a jolly row in the morning , getting upon his four great legs !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 6]: It 's like thunder . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 13]: `` You do n't seem to know what a diamond is . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't I just !
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 15]: Diamond is a great and good horse ; and he sleeps right under me .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 54]: He is old Diamond , and I am young Diamond ; or , if you like it better , for you 're very particular , Mr. North Wind , he 's big Diamond , and I 'm little Diamond ; and I do n't know which of us my father likes best . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 25]: A beautiful laugh , large but very soft and musical , sounded somewhere beside him , but Diamond kept his head under the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 13]: `` I 'm not Mr. North Wind , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 15]: `` You told me that you were the North Wind , '' insisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 14]: `` I did not say Mister North Wind , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 19]: `` Well , then , I do ; for mother tells me I ought to be polite . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 23]: `` Then let me tell you I do n't think it at all polite of you to say Mister to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 9]: `` Well , I did n't know better .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: I 'm very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 9]: `` But you ought to know better . ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 8]: `` I do n't know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 34]: You ca n't say it 's polite to lie there talking -- with your head under the bed-clothes , and never look up to see what kind of person you are talking to .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 11]: -- I want you to come out with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 31]: `` I want to go to sleep , '' said Diamond , very nearly crying , for he did not like to be scolded , even when he deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 11]: `` You shall sleep all the better to-morrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 24]: `` Besides , '' said Diamond , `` you are out in Mr. Dyves 's garden , and I ca n't get there .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 10]: I can only get into our own yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 12]: `` Will you take your head out of the bed-clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 9]: said the voice , just a little angrily .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 9]: answered Diamond , half peevish , half frightened .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 27]: The instant he said the word , a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall , and swept the clothes off Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: He started up in terror .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 15]: Leaning over him was the large , beautiful , pale face of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 35]: Her dark eyes looked a little angry , for they had just begun to flash ; but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 98]: What was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction , so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her , hair but as Diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement , mingled with confidence -- for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty -- her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness , and fell down all about her again , till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 29]: From her eyes came all the light by which Diamond saw her face and her , hair ; and that was all he did see of her yet .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: The wind was over and gone .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 12]: `` Will you go with me now , you little Diamond ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 18]: I am sorry I was forced to be so rough with you , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 19]: `` I will ; yes , I will , '' answered Diamond , holding out both his arms .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 18]: `` But , '' he added , dropping them , `` how shall I get my clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 14]: They are in mother 's room , and the door is locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 8]: `` Oh , never mind your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 6]: You will not be cold .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: I shall take care of that .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 9]: Nobody is cold with the north wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 10]: `` I thought everybody was , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 7]: `` That is a great mistake .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 7]: Most people make it , however .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 17]: They are cold because they are not with the north wind , but without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 26]: If Diamond had been a little older , and had supposed himself a good deal wiser , he would have thought the lady was joking .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 20]: But he was not older , and did not fancy himself wiser , and therefore understood her well enough .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 7]: Again he stretched out his arms .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 9]: The lady 's face drew back a little .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 10]: `` Follow me , Diamond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said Diamond , only a little ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 7]: `` You 're not afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: said the North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 33]: `` No , ma'am ; but mother never would let me go without shoes : she never said anything about clothes , so I dare say she would n't mind that . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 13]: `` I know your mother very well , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: `` She is a good woman .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 6]: I have visited her often .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 9]: I was with her when you were born .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 10]: I saw her laugh and cry both at once .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: I love your mother , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 15]: `` How was it you did not know my name , then , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 12]: Please am I to say ma'am to you , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 10]: `` One question at a time , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 19]: I knew your name quite well , but I wanted to hear what you would say for it .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 24]: Do n't you remember that day when the man was finding fault with your name -- how I blew the window in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes , '' answered Diamond , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 14]: `` Our window opens like a door , right over the coach-house door .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 71]: And the wind -- you , ma'am -- came in , and blew the Bible out of the man 's hands , and the leaves went all flutter , flutter on the floor , and my mother picked it up and gave it back to him open , and there -- '' `` Was your name in the Bible -- the sixth stone in the high priest 's breastplate . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: -- a stone , was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 13]: `` I thought it had been a horse -- I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 10]: A horse is better than a stone any day .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 15]: Well , you see , I know all about you and your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 7]: I will go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 15]: `` Now for the next question : you 're not to call me ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 19]: You must call me just my own name -- respectfully , you know -- just North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 23]: `` Well , please , North Wind , you are so beautiful , I am quite ready to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 18]: `` You must not be ready to go with everything beautiful all at once , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 10]: `` But what 's beautiful ca n't be bad .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 9]: You 're not bad , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 8]: `` No ; I 'm not bad .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 23]: But sometimes beautiful things grow bad by doing bad , and it takes some time for their badness to spoil their beauty .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 17]: So little boys may be mistaken if they go after things because they are beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 18]: `` Well , I will go with you because you are beautiful and good , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 33]: `` Ah , but there 's another thing , Diamond : -- What if I should look ugly without being bad -- look ugly myself because I am making ugly things beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 5]: -- What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 11]: `` I do n't quite understand you , North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 7]: You tell me what then . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 8]: `` Well , I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 15]: If you see me with my face all black , do n't be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 23]: If you see me flapping wings like a bat 's , as big as the whole sky , do n't be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 48]: If you hear me raging ten times worse than Mrs. Bill , the blacksmith 's wife -- even if you see me looking in at people 's windows like Mrs. Eve Dropper , the gardener 's wife -- you must believe that I am doing my work .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 39]: Nay , Diamond , if I change into a serpent or a tiger , you must not let go your hold of me , for my hand will never change in yours if you keep a good hold .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 34]: If you keep a hold , you will know who I am all the time , even when you look at me and ca n't see me the least like the North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 7]: I may look something very awful .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 5]: Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 9]: `` Quite well , '' said little Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 19]: `` Come along , then , '' said North Wind , and disappeared behind the mountain of hay .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 9]: Diamond crept out of bed and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 18]: THE LAWN WHEN Diamond got round the corner of the hay , for a moment he hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 44]: The stair by which he would naturally have gone down to the door was at the other side of the loft , and looked very black indeed ; for it was full of North Wind 's hair , as she descended before him .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 29]: And just beside him was the ladder going straight down into the stable , up which his father always came to fetch the hay for Diamond 's dinner .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 25]: Through the opening in the floor the faint gleam of the-stable lantern was enticing , and Diamond thought he would run down that way .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 14]: The stair went close past the loose-box in which Diamond the horse lived .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 27]: When Diamond the boy was half-way down , he remembered that it was of no use to go this way , for the stable-door was locked .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 44]: But at the same moment there was horse Diamond 's great head poked out of his box on to the ladder , for he knew boy Diamond although he was in his night-gown , and wanted him to pull his ears for him .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 60]: This Diamond did very gently for a minute or so , and patted and stroked his neck too , and kissed the big horse , and had begun to take the bits of straw and hay out of his mane , when all at once he recollected that the Lady North Wind was waiting for him in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 28]: `` Good night , Diamond , '' he said , and darted up the ladder , across the loft , and down the stair to the door .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 14]: But when he got out into the yard , there was no lady .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 16]: Now it is always a dreadful thing to think there is somebody and find nobody .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 26]: Children in particular have not made up their minds to it ; they generally cry at nobody , especially when they wake up at night .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 29]: But it was an especial disappointment to Diamond , for his little heart had been beating with joy : the face of the North Wind was so grand !
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 17]: To have a lady like that for a friend -- with such long hair , too !
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: Why , it was longer than twenty Diamonds ' tails !
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 4]: She was gone .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: And there he stood , with his bare feet on the stones of the paved yard .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 13]: It was a clear night overhead , and the stars were shining .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 15]: Orion in particular was making the most of his bright belt and golden sword .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 10]: But the moon was only a poor thin crescent .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 57]: There was just one great , jagged , black and gray cloud in the sky , with a steep side to it like a precipice ; and the moon was against this side , and looked as if she had tumbled off the top of the cloud-hill , and broken herself in rolling down the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 19]: She did not seem comfortable , for she was looking down into the deep pit waiting for her .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 17]: At least that was what Diamond thought as he stood for a moment staring at her .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 46]: But he was quite wrong , for the moon was not afraid , and there was no pit she was going down into , for there were no sides to it , and a pit without sides to it is not a pit at all .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 24]: Diamond , however , had not been out so late before in all his life , and things looked so strange about him !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 37]: -- just as if he had got into Fairyland , of which he knew quite as much as anybody ; for his mother had no money to buy books to set him wrong on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 26]: I have seen this world -- only sometimes , just now and then , you know -- look as strange as ever I saw Fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 14]: But I confess that I have not yet seen Fairyland at its best .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 11]: I am always going to see it so some time .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 44]: But if you had been out in the face and not at the back of the North Wind , on a cold rather frosty night , and in your night-gown , you would have felt it all quite as strange as Diamond did .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 32]: He cried a little , just a little , he was so disappointed to lose the lady : of course , you , little man , would n't have done that !
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 71]: But for my part , I do n't mind people crying so much as I mind what they cry about , and how they cry -- whether they cry quietly like ladies and gentlemen , or go shrieking like vulgar emperors , or ill-natured cooks ; for all emperors are not gentlemen , and all cooks are not ladies -- nor all queens and princesses for that matter , either .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 15]: But it ca n't be denied that a little gentle crying does one good .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 19]: It did Diamond good ; for as soon as it was over he was a brave boy again .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 13]: `` She sha n't say it was my fault , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 14]: `` I daresay she is hiding somewhere to see what I will do .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: I will look for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 13]: So he went round the end of the stable towards the kitchen-garden .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 29]: But the moment he was clear of the shelter of the stable , sharp as a knife came the wind against his little chest and his bare legs .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 12]: Still he would look in the kitchen-garden , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 33]: But when he got round the weeping-ash that stood in the corner , the wind blew much stronger , and it grew stronger and stronger till he could hardly fight against it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 6]: And it was so cold !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 16]: All the flashy spikes of the stars seemed to have got somehow into the wind .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 22]: Then he thought of what the lady had said about people being cold because they were not with the North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 40]: How it was that he should have guessed what she meant at that very moment I can not tell , but I have observed that the most wonderful thing in the world is how people come to understand anything .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 47]: He turned his back to the wind , and trotted again towards the yard ; whereupon , strange to say , it blew so much more gently against his calves than it had blown against his shins that he began to feel almost warm by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 37]: You must not think it was cowardly of Diamond to turn his back to the wind : he did so only because he thought Lady North Wind had said something like telling him to do so .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 24]: If she had said to him that he must hold his face to it , Diamond would have held his face to it .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 17]: But the most foolish thing is to fight for no good , and to please nobody .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 14]: Well , it was just as if the wind was pushing Diamond along .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 46]: If he turned round , it grew very sharp on his legs especially , and so he thought the wind might really be Lady North Wind , though he could not see her , and he had better let her blow him wherever she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 43]: So she blew and blew , and he went and went , until he found himself standing at a door in a wall , which door led from the yard into a little belt of shrubbery , flanking Mr. Coleman 's house .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 14]: Mr. Coleman was his father 's master , and the owner of Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 27]: He opened the door , and went through the shrubbery , and out into the middle of the lawn , still hoping to find North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 30]: The soft grass was very pleasant to his bare feet , and felt warm after the stones of the yard ; but the lady was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 43]: Then he began to think that after all he must have done wrong , and she was offended with him for not following close after her , but staying to talk to the horse , which certainly was neither wise nor polite .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 23]: There he stood in the middle of the lawn , the wind blowing his night-gown till it flapped like a loose sail .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 41]: The stars were very shiny over his head ; but they did not give light enough to show that the grass was green ; and Diamond stood alone in the strange night , which looked half solid all about him .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 13]: He began to wonder whether he was in a dream or not .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 35]: It was important to determine this ; `` for , '' thought Diamond , `` if I am in a dream , I am safe in my bed , and I need n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 37]: But if I 'm not in a dream , I 'm out here , and perhaps I had better cry , or , at least , I 'm not sure whether I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 40]: He came to the conclusion , however , that , whether he was in a dream or not , there could be no harm in not crying for a little while longer : he could begin whenever he liked .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 23]: The back of Mr. Coleman 's house was to the lawn , and one of the drawing-room windows looked out upon it .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 18]: The ladies had not gone to bed ; for the light was still shining in that window .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 28]: But they had no idea that a little boy was standing on the lawn in his night-gown , or they would have run out in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 16]: And as long as he saw that light , Diamond could not feel quite lonely .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 42]: He stood staring , not at the great warrior Orion in the sky , nor yet at the disconsolate , neglected moon going down in the west , but at the drawing-room window with the light shining through its green curtains .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 33]: He had been in that room once or twice that he could remember at Christmas times ; for the Colemans were kind people , though they did not care much about children .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 22]: All at once the light went nearly out : he could only see a glimmer of the shape of the window .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 12]: Then , indeed , he felt that he was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 17]: It was so dreadful to be out in the night after everybody was gone to bed !
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 8]: That was more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: He burst out crying in good earnest , beginning with a wail like that of the wind when it is waking up .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: Perhaps you think this was very foolish ; for could he not go home to his own bed again when he liked ?
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 46]: Yes ; but it looked dreadful to him to creep up that stair again and lie down in his bed again , and know that North Wind 's window was open beside him , and she gone , and he might never see her again .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 10]: He would be just as lonely there as here .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 24]: Nay , it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 55]: At the very moment when he burst out crying , the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family , for she had not gone away when Miss Coleman did not want any more nursing , came to the back door , which was of glass , to close the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 33]: She thought she heard a cry , and , peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like Diamond 's blinkers , she saw something white on the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 27]: Too old and too wise to be frightened , she opened the door , and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 48]: And when Diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either , though Mrs. Crump was a little cross sometimes ; for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable , and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 49]: So she came up with her neck stretched out , and her head at the end of it , and her eyes foremost of all , like a snail 's , peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: When she did see , she made a great exclamation , and threw up her hands .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 28]: Then without a word , for she thought Diamond was walking in his sleep , she caught hold of him , and led him towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 31]: He made no objection , for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort , and Mrs. Crump led him straight into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 47]: Now , from the neglect of the new housemaid , the fire in Miss Coleman 's bedroom had gone out , and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing-room fire -- a disorderly proceeding which a mother 's wish could justify .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 43]: The young lady was very lovely , though not nearly so beautiful as North Wind ; and her hair was extremely long , for it came down to her knees -- though that was nothing at all to North Wind 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 49]: Yet when she looked round , with her hair all about her , as Diamond entered , he thought for one moment that it was North Wind , and , pulling his hand from Mrs. Crump 's , he stretched out his arms and ran towards Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 24]: She was so pleased that she threw down her brush , and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 33]: He saw the next moment that she was not Lady North Wind , but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 37]: Mrs. Crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep , and Diamond thought she ought to know , and did not contradict her for anything he knew , it might be so indeed .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 48]: He let them talk on about him , and said nothing ; and when , after their astonishment was over , and Miss Coleman had given him a sponge-cake , it was decreed that Mrs. Crump should take him to his mother , he was quite satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 17]: His mother had to get out of bed to open the door when Mrs. Crump knocked .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 52]: She was indeed surprised to see her , boy ; and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed , returned and had a long confabulation with Mrs. Crump , for they were still talking when Diamond fell fast asleep , and could hear them no longer .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 20]: OLD DIAMOND DIAMOND woke very early in the morning , and thought what a curious dream he had had .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 39]: But the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head , until it did not look altogether like a dream , and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 37]: He came to the conclusion that , if he had really been brought home to his mother by Mrs. Crump , she would say something to him about it , and that would settle the matter .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 30]: Then he got up and dressed himself , but , finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring , he went down the ladder to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 49]: There he found that even old Diamond was not awake yet , for he , as well as young Diamond , always got up the moment he woke , and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 32]: `` I 'll give old Diamond a surprise , '' thought the boy ; and creeping up very softly , before the horse knew , he was astride of his back .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 65]: Then it was young Diamond 's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected ; for as with an earthquake , with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither , a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs , young Diamond found himself hoisted up in the air , with both hands twisted in the horse 's mane .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 40]: The next instant old Diamond lashed out with both his hind legs , and giving one cry of terror young Diamond found himself lying on his neck , with his arms as far round it as they would go .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 29]: But then the horse stood as still as a stone , except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 47]: For when he heard young Diamond 's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about ; for young Diamond was a good boy , and old Diamond was a good horse , and the one was all right on the back of the other .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 27]: As soon as Diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place , the horse began pulling at the hay , and the boy began thinking .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 20]: He had never mounted Diamond himself before , and he had never got off him without being lifted down .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 18]: So he sat , while the horse ate , wondering how he was to reach the ground .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 19]: But while he meditated , his mother woke , and her first thought was to see her boy .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 15]: She had visited him twice during the night , and found him sleeping quietly .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: Now his bed was empty , and she was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 3]: `` Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 2]: Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: Where are you , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 4]: she called out .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 28]: Diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall , and cried aloud , -- `` Here , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: `` Where , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 11]: `` Here , mother , on Diamond 's back . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 19]: She came running to the ladder , and peeping down , saw him aloft on the great horse .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 10]: `` Come down , Diamond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 9]: `` I ca n't , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: `` How did you get up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 28]: `` Quite easily , '' answered he ; `` but when I got up , Diamond would get up too , and so here I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 18]: His mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again , and hurried down the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 44]: She did not much like going up to the horse , for she had not been used to horses ; but she would have gone into a lion 's den , not to say a horse 's stall , to help her boy .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 19]: So she went and lifted him off Diamond 's back , and felt braver all her life after .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 33]: She carried him in her arms up to her room ; but , afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking , as she supposed it , said nothing about last night .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 17]: Before the next day was over , Diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 29]: For a week his mother watched him very carefully -- going into the loft several times a night -- as often , in fact , as she woke .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 8]: Every time she found him fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: All that week it was hard weather .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 19]: The grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 40]: And as Diamond 's shoes were not good , and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him , she would not let him run out .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 65]: He played all his games over and over indoors , especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby 's cradle ; and if they did not go very fast , they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world , although one of them had only three legs , and the other only half a back .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 37]: At length his mother brought home his new shoes , and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: The sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: All the world was new to him .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 51]: A great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house ; above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light , above that a golden cloud , and over that the blue of the wintry heavens .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 29]: And Diamond thought that , next to his own home , he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 20]: For it is not fine things that make home a nice place , but your mother and your father .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 39]: As he was looking at the lovely colours , the gates were thrown open , and there was old Diamond and his friend in the carriage , dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 5]: And in they came .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 58]: Diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him , but , careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape , with a red edge to every fold , he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 23]: To be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 23]: As he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 13]: And once more he was almost sure that it was no dream .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 21]: At all events , he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 14]: He opened the door , and passed through the little belt of shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 14]: Not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 15]: Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 4]: There was one !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: He ran and knelt down to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 17]: It was a primrose -- a dwarfish thing , but perfect in shape -- a baby-wonder .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 64]: As he stooped his face to see it close , a little wind began to blow , and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered , but the primrose lay still in the green hollow , looking up at the sky , and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 21]: It was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 22]: All at once Diamond thought it was saying its prayers , and he ought not to be staring at it so .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 14]: He ran to the stable to see his father make Diamond 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 31]: Then his father took him in his arms , carried him up the ladder , and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 12]: `` Miss is very poorly , '' said Diamond 's father .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 24]: `` Mis ` ess has been to the doctor with her to-day , and she looked very glum when she came out again .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: I was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said . ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 10]: `` And did n't Miss look glum too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 15]: `` Not half as glum as Mis ` ess , '' returned the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 25]: `` You see -- '' But he lowered his voice , and Diamond could not make out more than a word here and there .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 36]: For Diamond 's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at , and one of the best of drivers , but one of the most discreet of servants as well .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 44]: Therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife , whom he had proved better than himself long ago , and was careful that even Diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 15]: It was bed-time soon , and Diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 10]: He awoke all at once , in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 12]: `` Open the window , Diamond , '' said a voice .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 14]: Now Diamond 's mother had once more pasted up North Wind 's window .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 7]: `` Are you North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 12]: said Diamond : `` I do n't hear you blowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 9]: `` No ; but you hear me talking .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 12]: Open the window , for I have n't overmuch time . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 13]: `` But , please , North Wind , where 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: You left me all alone last time . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 26]: He had got up on his knees , and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 27]: For now that North Wind spoke again , he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 14]: `` Yes , but that was your fault , '' returned North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 21]: `` I had work to do ; and , besides , a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 18]: `` But I 'm not a gentleman , '' said Diamond , scratching away at the paper .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 14]: `` I hope you wo n't say so ten years after this . ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 21]: `` I 'm going to be a coachman , and a coachman is not a gentleman , '' persisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 16]: `` We call your father a gentleman in our house , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 12]: `` He does n't call himself one , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 22]: `` That 's of no consequence : every man ought to be a gentleman , and your father is one . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 30]: Diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice , and getting hold of the edge of it , tore it off .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 17]: The next instant a young girl glided across the bed , and stood upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 19]: said Diamond , quite dismayed ; `` I did n't know -- who are you , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 7]: `` I 'm North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: `` Are you really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 4]: Make haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 10]: `` But you 're no bigger than me . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: `` Do you think I care about how big or how little I am ?
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 8]: Did n't you see me this evening ?
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 6]: I was less then . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 5]: Where was you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 8]: `` Behind the leaves of the primrose .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 8]: Did n't you see them blowing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 15]: `` Make haste , then , if you want to go with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 13]: `` But you are not big enough to take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 10]: I think you are only Miss North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 13]: `` I am big enough to show you the way , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 14]: But if you wo n't come , why , you must stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: `` I must dress myself .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 23]: I did n't mind with a grown lady , but I could n't go with a little girl in my night-gown . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 14]: I 'm not in such a hurry as I was the other night .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 21]: Dress as fast as you can , and I 'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 10]: `` Do n't hurt it , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 22]: North Wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles , and was gone in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 47]: Diamond saw -- for it was a starlit night , and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now -- the gleam of something vanishing down the stair , and , springing out of bed , dressed himself as fast as ever he could .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 21]: Then he crept out into the yard , through the door in the wall , and away to the primrose .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 23]: Behind it stood North Wind , leaning over it , and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 16]: `` Come along , '' she said , jumping up and holding out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 5]: Diamond took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 18]: It was cold , but so pleasant and full of life , it was better than warm .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: She led him across the garden .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 12]: With one bound she was on the top of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 7]: Diamond was left at the foot .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: `` Stop , stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 11]: `` Please , I ca n't jump like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 22]: `` You do n't try '' said North Wind , who from the top looked down a foot taller than before .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 16]: `` Give me your hand again , and I will , try '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 21]: She reached down , Diamond laid hold of her hand , gave a great spring , and stood beside her .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 6]: `` This is nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 13]: Another bound , and they stood in the road by the river .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 32]: It was full tide , and the stars were shining clear in its depths , for it lay still , waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 6]: They walked along its side .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 23]: But they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples , and the stars had vanished from its bosom .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 11]: And North Wind was now tall as a full-grown girl .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 19]: Her hair was flying about her head , and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 22]: But she turned aside and went up a narrow lane , and as she went her hair fell down around her .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 32]: `` I have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night , '' she said , `` before I get out to sea , and I must set about it at once .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: The disagreeable work must be looked after first . ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 19]: So saying , she laid hold of Diamond and began to run , gliding along faster and faster .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: Diamond kept up with her as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 22]: She made many turnings and windings , apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 15]: Once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 39]: At the foot of the stair North Wind stood still , and Diamond , hearing a great growl , started in terror , and there , instead of North Wind , was a huge wolf by his side .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 16]: He let go his hold in dismay , and the wolf bounded up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 25]: The windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing , and the sound of a great fall came from above .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: Diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 20]: `` Surely , '' he thought , `` North Wind ca n't be eating one of the children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 17]: Coming to himself all at once , he rushed after her with his little fist clenched .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 44]: There were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs , and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them , who stared at him , but none of them were of the people of the house , and they said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 31]: Before he reached the head of the stair , however , North Wind met him , took him by the hand , and hurried down and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 14]: `` I hope you have n't eaten a baby , North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: said Diamond , very solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 11]: North Wind laughed merrily , and went tripping on faster .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 39]: Her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps , and wherever it passed over withered leaves , they went fleeing and whirling in spirals , and running on their edges like wheels , all about her feet .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 17]: `` No , '' she said at last , `` I did not eat a baby .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 21]: You would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 24]: You would have seen how I served a nurse that was calling a child bad names , and telling her she was wicked .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 5]: She had been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: I saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 7]: `` And you frightened her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 6]: `` I believe so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 6]: answered North Wind laughing merrily .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 23]: `` I flew at her throat , and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 21]: She 'll be turned away to-morrow -- and quite time , if they knew as much as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 11]: `` But did n't you frighten the little one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: `` She never saw me .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 16]: The woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 5]: said Diamond , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 25]: `` Why should you see things , '' returned North Wind , `` that you would n't understand or know what to do with ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 13]: Good people see good things ; bad people , bad things . ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 9]: `` Then are you a bad thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 40]: For you see me , Diamond , dear , '' said the girl , and she looked down at him , and Diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 17]: `` I had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 35]: If I had put on any other shape than a wolf 's she would not have seen me , for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 23]: `` I do n't know what you mean , '' said Diamond , `` but I suppose it 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 11]: They were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 16]: It was Primrose Hill , in fact , although Diamond had never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 26]: The moment they reached the top , North Wind stood and turned her face towards London The stars were still shining clear and cold overhead .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 9]: There was not a cloud to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 13]: The air was sharp , but Diamond did not find it cold .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 20]: `` Now , '' said the lady , `` whatever you do , do not let my hand go .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 26]: I might have lost you the last time , only I was not in a hurry then : now I am in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 8]: Yet she stood still for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 17]: NORTH WIND AND as she stood looking towards London , Diamond saw that she was trembling .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 9]: `` Are you cold , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 30]: `` No , Diamond , '' she answered , looking down upon him with a smile ; `` I am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 15]: Those careless , greedy , untidy children make it in such a mess . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 28]: As she spoke he could have told by her voice , if he had not seen with his eyes , that she was growing larger and larger .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 45]: Her head went up and up towards the stars ; and as she grew , still trembling through all her body , her hair also grew -- longer and longer , and lifted itself from her head , and went out in black waves .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 26]: The next moment , however , it fell back around her , and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 24]: Then she put her hands behind her head , and gathered some of her hair , and began weaving and knotting it together .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 61]: When she had done , she bent down her beautiful face close to his , and said -- `` Diamond , I am afraid you would not keep hold of me , and if I were to drop you , I do n't know what might happen ; so I have been making a place for you in my hair .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 3]: Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: Diamond held out his arms , for with that grand face looking at him , he believed like a baby .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 23]: She took him in her hands , threw him over her shoulder , and said , `` Get in , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 21]: And Diamond parted her hair with his hands , crept between , and feeling about soon found the woven nest .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 19]: It was just like a pocket , or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 30]: North Wind put her hands to her back , felt all about the nest , and finding it safe , said -- `` Are you comfortable , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 10]: The next moment he was rising in the air .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 12]: North Wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 18]: Her hair went streaming out from her , till it spread like a mist over the stars .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: She flung herself abroad in space .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 29]: Diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which , parted and interwoven , formed his shelter , for he could not help being a little afraid .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 30]: As soon as he had come to himself , he peeped through the woven meshes , for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 14]: The earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 10]: Trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 37]: A great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the Zoological Gardens , mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds ; but it died away in a moment behind them .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 22]: And now there was nothing but the roofs of houses , sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 32]: Chimney-pots fell , and tiles flew from the roofs ; but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 34]: There was a great roaring , for the wind was dashing against London like a sea ; but at North Wind 's back Diamond , of course , felt nothing of it all .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 7]: He was in a perfect calm .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 12]: He could hear the sound of it , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: By and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 22]: There were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him , like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 30]: Then he looked up to the sky , but could see no stars ; they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady 's hair which swept between .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 13]: He began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 4]: He would try .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 17]: `` Please , North Wind , '' he said , `` what is that noise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 24]: From high over his head came the voice of North Wind , answering him , gently -- `` The noise of my besom .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 23]: I am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky ; only I 'm busy with the floor now . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 14]: `` What makes the houses look as if they were running away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 10]: `` I am sweeping so fast over them . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 27]: `` But , please , North Wind , I knew London was very big , but I did n't know it was so big as this .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: It seems as if we should never get away from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 18]: `` We are going round and round , else we should have left it long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 12]: `` Is this the way you sweep , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: `` Yes ; I go round and round with my great besom . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 20]: `` Please , would you mind going a little slower , for I want to see the streets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 9]: `` You wo n't see much now . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 12]: `` Because I have nearly swept all the people home . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 22]: I forgot , '' said Diamond , and was quiet after that , for he did not want to be troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: But she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses , and Diamond could see down into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 9]: There were very few people about , though .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 14]: The lamps flickered and flared again , but nobody seemed to want them .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: Suddenly Diamond espied a little girl coming along a street .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: She was dreadfully blown by the wind , and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 27]: It seemed as if the wind had a spite at her -- it kept worrying her like a wild beast , and tearing at her rags .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 6]: She was so lonely there !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 19]: please , North Wind , '' he cried , `` wo n't you help that little girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 13]: `` No , Diamond ; I must n't leave my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 12]: `` But why should n't you be kind to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 7]: `` I am kind to her .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: I am sweeping the wicked smells away . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 12]: `` But you 're kinder to me , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: Why should n't you be as kind to her as you are to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 7]: `` There are reasons , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 10]: Everybody ca n't be done to all the same .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 10]: Everybody is not ready for the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 16]: `` But I do n't see why I should be kinder used than she . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 20]: `` Do you think nothing 's to be done but what you can see , Diamond , you silly !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 5]: It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 10]: Of course you can help her if you like .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 15]: You 've got nothing particular to do at this moment ; I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 8]: do let me help her , then .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 12]: But you wo n't be able to wait , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 14]: `` No , I ca n't wait ; you must do it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 16]: And , mind , the wind will get a hold of you , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 14]: `` Do n't you want me to help her , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 10]: `` Not without having some idea what will happen .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 29]: If you break down and cry , that wo n't be much of a help to her , and it will make a goose of little Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 10]: `` I want to go , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: `` Only there 's just one thing -- how am I to get home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 16]: `` If you 're anxious about that , perhaps you had better go with me .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: I am bound to take you home again , if you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 12]: cried Diamond , who was still looking after the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 16]: `` I 'm sure the wind will blow her over , and perhaps kill her .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 6]: Do let me go . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 13]: They had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 8]: There was a lull in the roaring .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 45]: `` Well , though I can not promise to take you home , '' said North Wind , as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses , `` I can promise you it will be all right in the end .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 6]: You will get home somehow .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 11]: Have you made up your mind what to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 14]: `` Yes ; to help the little girl , '' said Diamond firmly .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 27]: The same moment North Wind dropt into the street and stood , only a tall lady , but with her hair flying up over the housetops .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 19]: She put her hands to her back , took Diamond , and set him down in the street .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 20]: The same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast , and all but blown away .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 20]: North Wind stepped back a step , and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 8]: A chimney-pot clashed at Diamond 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 45]: He turned in terror , but it was to look for the little girl , and when he turned again the lady had vanished , and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 22]: The little girl was scudding before the blast , her hair flying too , and behind her she dragged her broom .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 17]: Her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 27]: Diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway , thinking to stop her ; but she passed him like a bird , crying gently and pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 3]: `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 2]: stop !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: little girl , '' shouted Diamond , starting in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 21]: `` I ca n't , '' wailed the girl , `` the wind wo n't leave go of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 13]: Diamond could run faster than she , and he had no broom .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 26]: In a few moments he had caught her by the frock , but it tore in his hand , and away went the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 49]: So he had to run again , and this time he ran so fast that he got before her , and turning round caught her in his arms , when down they went both together , which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 12]: asked Diamond , rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 21]: The arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 11]: `` Home , '' she said , gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: `` Then I will go with you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 28]: And then they were silent for a while , for the wind blew worse than ever , and they had both to hold on to the lamp-post .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 7]: `` Where is your crossing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 6]: asked the girl at length .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 10]: `` I do n't sweep , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 9]: `` What do you do , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 3]: asked she .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 11]: `` You ai n't big enough for most things . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 18]: `` I do n't know what I do do , '' answered he , feeling rather ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 6]: `` Nothing , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: My father 's Mr. Coleman 's coachman . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 7]: `` Have you a father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 18]: she said , staring at him as if a boy with a father was a natural curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: Have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 3]: returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 7]: `` No ; nor mother neither .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 9]: Old Sal 's all I 've got . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 7]: And she began to cry again .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 19]: `` I would n't go to her if she was n't good to me , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 8]: `` But you must go somewheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 14]: `` Move on , '' said the voice of a policeman behind them .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 11]: `` I told you so , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 6]: `` You must go somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 7]: They 're always at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: `` But old Sal does n't beat you , does she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 7]: `` I wish she would . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: asked Diamond , quite bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: `` She would if she was my mother .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 25]: But she would n't lie abed a-cuddlin ' of her ugly old bones , and laugh to hear me crying at the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 14]: `` You do n't mean she wo n't let you in to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 12]: `` It 'll be a good chance if she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 11]: `` Why are you out so late , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 25]: `` My crossing 's a long way off at the West End , and I had been indulgin ' in door-steps and mewses . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 13]: `` We 'd better have a try anyhow , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 5]: `` Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 42]: As he spoke Diamond thought he caught a glimpse of North Wind turning a corner in front of them ; and when they turned the corner too , they found it quiet there , but he saw nothing of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 24]: `` Now you lead me , '' he said , taking her hand , `` and I 'll take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 27]: The girl withdrew her hand , but only to dry her eyes with her frock , for the other had enough to do with her broom .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 27]: She put it in his again , and led him , turning after turning , until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 4]: There she knocked .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 13]: `` I should n't like to live here , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 22]: `` Oh , yes , you would , if you had nowhere else to go to , '' answered the girl .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 10]: `` I only wish we may get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 13]: `` I do n't want to go in , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: `` Where do you mean to go , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 7]: `` Home to my home . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 6]: `` Where 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 8]: `` I do n't exactly know . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 11]: `` Then you 're worse off than I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 20]: `` Oh no , for North Wind -- '' began Diamond , and stopped , he hardly knew why .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: said the girl , as she held her ear to the door listening .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 6]: But Diamond did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: Neither did old Sal .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 11]: `` I told you so , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 7]: `` She is wide awake hearkening .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 8]: But we do n't get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 9]: `` What will you do , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 8]: `` Move on , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 5]: `` Oh , anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: Bless you , I 'm used to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 13]: `` Had n't you better come home with me , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 16]: `` That 's a good joke , when you do n't know where it is .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 4]: Come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 5]: `` But where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 7]: `` Oh , nowheres in particular .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 4]: Come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 3]: Diamond obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 7]: The wind had now fallen considerably .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 41]: They wandered on and on , turning in this direction and that , without any reason for one way more than another , until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 9]: By this time they were both very tired .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 54]: Diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry , and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of North Wind ; not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good ; but he thought he had been of no use to her .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 24]: He was mistaken there , for she was far happier for having Diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 10]: She did not seem so tired as he was .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 12]: `` Do let us rest a bit , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: `` Let 's see , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 9]: `` There 's something like a railway there .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 8]: Perhaps there 's an open arch . ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 23]: They went towards it and found one , and , better still , there was an empty barrel lying under the arch .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 3]: `` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: here we are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 16]: `` A barrel 's the jolliest bed going -- on the tramp , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 13]: We 'll have forty winks , and then go on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 11]: She crept in , and Diamond crept in beside her .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 24]: They put their arms round each other , and when he began to grow warm , Diamond 's courage began to come back .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 6]: `` This is jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: `` I 'm so glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 15]: `` I do n't think so much of it , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 10]: `` I 'm used to it , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 23]: But I ca n't think how a kid like you comes to be out all alone this time o ' night . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 36]: She called him a kid , but she was not really a month older than he was ; only she had had to work for her bread , and that so soon makes people older .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: `` But I should n't have been out so late if I had n't got down to help you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 10]: `` North Wind is gone home long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 23]: `` I think you must ha ' got out o ' one o ' them Hidget Asylms , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 19]: `` You said something about the north wind afore that I could n't get the rights of . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: So now , for the sake of his character , Diamond had to tell her the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 9]: She did not believe a word of it .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 15]: She said he was n't such a flat as to believe all that bosh .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 21]: But as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch , and set the barrel rolling .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 39]: So they made haste to get out of it , for they had no notion of being rolled over and over as if they had been packed tight and would n't hurt , like a barrel of herrings .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 27]: `` I thought we should have had a sleep , '' said Diamond ; `` but I ca n't say I 'm very sleepy after all .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 9]: Come , let 's go on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 25]: They wandered on and on , sometimes sitting on a door-step , but always turning into lanes or fields when they had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 18]: They found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 22]: It was a waste kind of spot below , bounded by an irregular wall , with a few doors in it .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 15]: Outside lay broken things in general , from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 30]: But the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground , a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 17]: Nor could Diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 7]: To his dismay it burst open .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 9]: When they came to themselves they peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 9]: It was the back door of a garden .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 6]: `` Ah , ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 15]: cried Diamond , after staring for a few moments , `` I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 6]: North Wind takes nobody in !
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 8]: Here I am in master 's garden !
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 44]: I tell you what , little girl , you just bore a hole in old Sal 's wall , and put your mouth to it , and say , ` Please , North Wind , may n't I go out with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 10]: and then you 'll see what 'll come . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: `` I daresay I shall .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 17]: But I 'm out in the wind too often already to want more of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 13]: `` I said with the North Wind , not in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: `` It 's all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 8]: `` It 's not all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 7]: `` It is all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 7]: `` But I know best . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 6]: `` And I know better .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: I 'll box your ears , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: Diamond got very angry .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 45]: But he remembered that even if she did box his ears , he mus n't box hers again , for she was a girl , and all that boys must do , if girls are rude , is to go away and leave them .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 8]: So he went in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 9]: `` Good-bye , mister '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: This brought Diamond to his senses .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 12]: `` I 'm sorry I was cross , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 14]: `` Come in , and my mother will give you some breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: I must be off to my crossing .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 6]: It 's morning now . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 12]: `` I 'm very sorry for you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 26]: `` Well , it is a life to be tired of -- what with old Sal , and so many holes in my shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 8]: `` I wonder you 're so good .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: I should kill myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , you would n't !
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 26]: When I think of it , I always want to see what 's coming next , and so I always wait till next is over .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 8]: I suppose there 's somebody happy somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 8]: But it ai n't in them carriages .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 3]: Oh my !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 13]: how they do look sometimes -- fit to bite your head off !
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: She ran up the hill and disappeared behind it .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 19]: Then Diamond shut the door as he best could , and ran through the kitchen-garden to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 14]: And was n't he glad to get into his own blessed bed again !
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 12]: THE SUMMER-HOUSE DIAMOND said nothing to his mother about his adventures .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 43]: He had half a notion that North Wind was a friend of his mother , and that , if she did not know all about it , at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 71]: At the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all , especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day , although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it , at least for the first few days after he had been with her .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 13]: The girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 17]: Besides , he felt sure that North Wind would tell him if he ought to speak .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 14]: It was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: Indeed nothing remarkable took place in Diamond 's history until the following week .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 6]: This was what happened then .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 49]: Diamond the horse wanted new shoes , and Diamond 's father took him out of the stable , and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge , when he saw his little boy standing by the pump , and looking at him wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 48]: Then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup , left his hold of the mane and bridle , came across to his boy , lifted him up , and setting him on the horse 's back , told him to sit up like a man .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 8]: He then led away both Diamonds together .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 105]: The boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs , and he cowered towards the withers , grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar ; but when his father looked back at him , saying once more , `` Sit up , Diamond , '' he let the mane go and sat up , notwithstanding that the horse , thinking , I suppose , that his master had said to him , `` Come up , Diamond , '' stepped out faster .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 9]: For both the Diamonds were just grandly obedient .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 22]: And Diamond soon found that , as he was obedient to his father , so the horse was obedient to him .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 74]: For he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle , and when his father , whose hand was upon it , felt the boy pull it towards him , he looked up and smiled , and , well pleased , let go his hold , and left Diamond to guide Diamond ; and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 16]: It was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 26]: And another discovery he made was that , in order to guide the horse , he had in a measure to obey the horse first .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 27]: If he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse 's body , he could not guide him ; he must fall off .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 11]: The blacksmith lived at some distance , deeper into London .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 45]: As they crossed the angle of a square , Diamond , who was now quite comfortable on his living throne , was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride , when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 29]: The lady was his father 's mistress , Mrs. Coleman , and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off North Wind 's back .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: He drew Diamond 's bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from Mrs. Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 20]: But she had given one at the last crossing , and the hand returned only to grasp its broom .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 6]: Diamond could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 31]: He had a penny in his pocket , a gift of the same lady the day before , and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 17]: He tumbled off , I say , for he did tumble when he reached the ground .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 18]: But he got up in an instant , and ran , searching his pocket as he ran .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 18]: She made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure , but with a bewildered stare .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 19]: She thought first : `` Then he was on the back of the North Wind after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 35]: but , looking up at the sound of the horse 's feet on the paved crossing , she changed her idea , saying to herself , `` North Wind is his father 's horse !
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 7]: That 's the secret of it !
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 8]: Why could n't he say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 10]: And she had a mind to refuse the penny .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 29]: But his smile put it all right , and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a `` Thank you , mister .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: Did they wollop you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 3]: answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: `` They never wollops me . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 4]: `` Lor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 9]: said the little girl , and was speechless .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 50]: Meantime his father , looking up , and seeing the horse 's back bare , suffered a pang of awful dread , but the next moment catching sight of him , took him up and put him on , saying -- `` Do n't get off again , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: The horse might have put his foot on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 17]: `` No , father , '' answered the boy , and rode on in majestic safety .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 9]: The summer drew near , warm and splendid .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 18]: Miss Coleman was a little better in health , and sat a good deal in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 14]: One day she saw Diamond peeping through the shrubbery , and called him .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 34]: He talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that , and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 40]: He never touched any of the flowers or blossoms , for he was not like some boys who can not enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces , and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 34]: A week even makes such a long time in a child 's life , that Diamond had begun once more to feel as if North Wind were a dream of some far-off year .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 54]: One hot evening , he had been sitting with the young mistress , as they called her , in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn -- a wonderful thing for beauty , the boy thought , for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 23]: It grew dusky , and the lady began to feel chill , and went in , leaving the boy in the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 35]: He sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips , which , although they had closed for the night , could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 16]: All at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 22]: that is something done , '' said a voice -- a gentle , merry , childish voice , but so tiny .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 6]: `` At last it was .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 15]: I thought he would have had to stay there all night , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 4]: I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 22]: Diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away , it was so small and yet so clear .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 24]: He had never seen a fairy , but he had heard of such , and he began to look all about for one .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 14]: And there was the tiniest creature sliding down the stem of the tulip !
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 11]: `` Are you the fairy that herds the bees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 22]: he asked , going out of the summer-house , and down on his knees on the green shore of the tulip-bed .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 13]: `` I 'm not a fairy , '' answered the little creature .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 16]: `` It would become you better to ask how you are to know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: `` You 've just told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 17]: But what 's the use of knowing a thing only because you 're told it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 14]: `` Well , how am I to know you are not a fairy ?
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 8]: You do look very like one . ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 16]: `` In the first place , fairies are much bigger than you see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 13]: said Diamond reflectively ; `` I thought they were very little . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 17]: `` But they might be tremendously bigger than I am , and yet not very big .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 18]: Why , I could be six times the size I am , and not be very huge .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 26]: Besides , a fairy ca n't grow big and little at will , though the nursery-tales do say so : they do n't know better .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 4]: You stupid Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: have you never seen me before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 29]: And , as she spoke , a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground , and the creature laid her hand on Diamond 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 11]: In a moment he knew that it was North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 30]: `` I am very stupid , '' he said ; `` but I never saw you so small before , not even when you were nursing the primrose . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 19]: `` Must you see me every size that can be measured before you know me , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 18]: `` But how could I think it was you taking care of a great stupid bumble-bee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 17]: `` The more stupid he was the more need he had to be taken care of .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 53]: What with sucking honey and trying to open the door , he was nearly dated ; and when it opened in the morning to let the sun see the tulip 's heart , what would the sun have thought to find such a stupid thing lying there -- with wings too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 13]: `` But how do you have time to look after bees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 8]: `` I do n't look after bees .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 8]: I had this one to look after .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: It was hard work , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 4]: `` Hard work !
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 22]: Why , you could blow a chimney down , or -- or a boy 's cap off , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 11]: `` Both are easier than to blow a tulip open .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 11]: But I scarcely know the difference between hard and easy .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: I am always able for what I have to do .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 17]: When I see my work , I just rush at it -- and it is done .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 6]: But I must n't chatter .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 10]: I have got to sink a ship to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: `` Sink a ship !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 6]: with men in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: `` Yes , and women too . ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 4]: `` How dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 9]: I wish you would n't talk so . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 6]: `` It is rather dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 6]: But it is my work .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 6]: I must do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 14]: `` I hope you wo n't ask me to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 9]: `` No , I wo n't ask you .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 9]: But you must come for all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 7]: `` I wo n't then . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: `` Wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 24]: And North Wind grew a tall lady , and looked him in the eyes , and Diamond said -- `` Please take me .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 7]: You can not be cruel . ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 12]: `` No ; I could not be cruel if I would .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 26]: I can do nothing cruel , although I often do what looks like cruel to those who do not know what I really am doing .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 45]: The people they say I drown , I only carry away to -- to -- to -- well , the back of the North Wind -- that is what they used to call it long ago , only I never saw the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 14]: `` How can you carry them there if you never saw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 7]: `` I know the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 11]: `` But how is it you never saw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 8]: `` Because it is behind me . ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 8]: `` But you can look round . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 10]: `` Not far enough to see my own back .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 8]: No ; I always look before me .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 17]: In fact , I grow quite blind and deaf when I try to see my back .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 7]: I only mind my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 10]: `` But how does it be your work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: `` Ah , that I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 26]: I only know it is , because when I do it I feel all right , and when I do n't I feel all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 53]: East Wind says -- only one does not exactly know how much to believe of what she says , for she is very naughty sometimes -- she says it is all managed by a baby ; but whether she is good or naughty when she says that , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 7]: I just stick to my work .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 24]: It is all one to me to let a bee out of a tulip , or to sweep the cobwebs from the sky .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 10]: You would like to go with me to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 12]: `` I do n't want to see a ship sunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 10]: `` But suppose I had to take you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 12]: `` Why , then , of course I must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 7]: `` There 's a good Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 11]: -- I think I had better be growing a bit .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: Only you must go to bed first .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 11]: I ca n't take you till you 're in bed .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 8]: That 's the law about the children .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: So I had better go and do something else first . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 11]: `` Very well , North Wind , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 14]: `` What are you going to do first , if you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: `` I think I may tell you .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 12]: Jump up on the top of the wall , there . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 6]: `` I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 18]: and I ca n't help you -- you have n't been to bed yet , you see .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 22]: Come out to the road with me , just in front of the coach-house , and I will show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 31]: North Wind grew very small indeed , so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller , as the Scotch children call a yellow auricula .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 18]: Diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 30]: They left the lawn , went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates , and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 16]: `` You can get up on this wall , Diamond , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 11]: `` Yes ; but my mother has forbidden me . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 10]: `` Then do n't , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 11]: `` But I can see over , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 4]: to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 5]: I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 19]: So saying , North Wind gave a little bound , and stood on the top of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 17]: She was just about the height a dragon-fly would be , if it stood on end .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 5]: `` You darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 12]: said Diamond , seeing what a lovely little toy-woman she was .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 14]: `` Do n't be impertinent , Master Diamond , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 25]: `` If there 's one thing makes me more angry than another , it is the way you humans judge things by their size .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 34]: I am quite as respectable now as I shall be six hours after this , when I take an East Indiaman by the royals , twist her round , and push her under .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 13]: You have no right to address me in such a fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 18]: But as she spoke , the tiny face wore the smile of a great , grand woman .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 20]: She was only having her own beautiful fun out of Diamond , and true woman 's fun never hurts .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 6]: `` But look there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 3]: she resumed .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 19]: `` Do you see a boat with one man in it -- a green and white boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 7]: `` Yes ; quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 7]: `` That 's a poet . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 11]: `` I thought you said it was a bo-at . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 4]: `` Stupid pet !
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: Do n't you know what a poet is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: `` Why , a thing to sail on the water in . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: `` Well , perhaps you 're not so far wrong .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 9]: Some poets do carry people over the sea .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: But I have no business to talk so much .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: The man is a poet . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 11]: `` The boat is a boat , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 7]: `` Ca n't you spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 4]: asked North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: `` Not very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: `` So I see .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 12]: A poet is not a bo-at , as you call it .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 23]: A poet is a man who is glad of something , and tries to make other people glad of it too . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 4]: now I know .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 8]: Like the man in the sweety-shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 4]: `` Not very .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 8]: But I see it is no use .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: I was n't sent to tell you , and so I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 5]: I must be off .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 9]: Only first just look at the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 25]: `` He 's not much of a rower '' said Diamond -- `` paddling first with one fin and then with the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 6]: `` Now look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 19]: And she flashed like a dragon-fly across the water , whose surface rippled and puckered as she passed .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 18]: The next moment the man in the boat glanced about him , and bent to his oars .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 8]: The boat flew over the rippling water .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 8]: Man and boat and river were awake .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 14]: The same instant almost , North Wind perched again upon the river wall .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 8]: `` How did you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 12]: `` I blew in his face , '' answered North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 15]: `` I do n't see how that could do it , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: `` I daresay not .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 13]: And therefore you will say you do n't believe it could . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: `` No , no , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 11]: I know you too well not to believe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 16]: `` Well , I blew in his face , and that woke him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: `` But what was the good of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 3]: `` Why !
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 5]: do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 9]: Look at him -- how he is pulling .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: I blew the mist out of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 6]: `` How was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 12]: `` That is just what I can not tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 7]: `` But you did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 15]: I have to do ten thousand things without being able to tell how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 11]: `` I do n't like that , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 7]: He was staring after the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: Hearing no answer , he looked down to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 5]: North Wind was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 17]: Away across the river went a long ripple -- what sailors call a cat 's paw .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 11]: The man in the boat was putting up a sail .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 22]: The moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud , and the sail began to shine white .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 13]: Diamond rubbed his eyes , and wondered what it was all about .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 22]: Things seemed going on around him , and all to understand each other , but he could make nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 17]: So he put his hands in his pockets , and went in to have his tea .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 13]: The night was very hot , for the wind had fallen again .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 16]: `` You do n't seem very well to-night , Diamond , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: `` I am quite well , mother , '' returned Diamond , who was only puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 14]: `` I think you had better go to bed , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 10]: `` Very well , mother , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 12]: He stopped for one moment to look out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 10]: Above the moon the clouds were going different ways .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 17]: Somehow or other this troubled him , but , notwithstanding , he was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 12]: He woke in the middle of the night and the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 20]: A terrible noise was rumbling overhead , like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 23]: The roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling ; only the tiles were between him and the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 28]: For a while he could not come quite awake , for the noise kept beating him down , so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 17]: A second peal of thunder burst over his head , and almost choked him with fear .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 46]: Nor did he recover until the great blast that followed , having torn some tiles off the roof , sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face , which brought him wide awake , and gave him back his courage .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 13]: The same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 10]: `` Come up , Diamond , '' it said .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: `` It 's all ready .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: I 'm waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 55]: He looked out of the bed , and saw a gigantic , powerful , but most lovely arm -- with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor , or choked a tigress off its prey -- stretched down through a big hole in the roof .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 22]: Without a moment 's hesitation he reached out his tiny one , and laid it in the grand palm before him .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 30]: OUT IN THE STORM THE hand felt its way up his arm , and , grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow , lifted Diamond from the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 30]: The moment he was through the hole in the roof , all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him , and buffet him hither and thither .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 33]: His hair blew one way , his night-gown another , his legs threatened to float from under him , and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 23]: Cowering , he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm , and fear invaded his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 7]: `` Oh , North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 28]: he murmured , but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 10]: The wind caught them , and they were nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 15]: They could n't get out at all , but were torn away and strangled .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 57]: And yet North Wind heard them , and in her answer it seemed to Diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it , and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away , she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 99]: Her voice was like the bass of a deep organ , without the groan in it ; like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it ; like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it ; like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it : it was like all of them and neither of them -- all of them without their faults , each of them without its peculiarity : after all , it was more like his mother 's voice than anything else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 14]: `` Diamond , dear , '' she said , `` be a man .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 14]: What is fearful to you is not the least fearful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 19]: `` But it ca n't hurt you , '' murmured Diamond , `` for you 're it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 21]: `` Then if I 'm it , and have you in my arms , how can it hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 4]: `` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 7]: I see , '' whispered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: `` But it looks so dreadful , and it pushes me about so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 9]: `` Yes , it does , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 9]: That is what it was sent for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 41]: At the same moment , a peal of thunder which shook Diamond 's heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens : I can not say out of the sky , for there was no sky .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 20]: Diamond had not seen the lightning , for he had been intent on finding the face of North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 45]: Every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him , but between , he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman 's eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 33]: He trembled so at the thunder , that his knees failed him , and he sunk down at North Wind 's feet , and clasped her round the column of her ankle .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 42]: She instantly stooped , lifted him from the roof -- up -- up into her bosom , and held him there , saying , as if to an inconsolable child -- `` Diamond , dear , this will never do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , it will , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 18]: `` I am all right now -- quite comfortable , I assure you , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 17]: If you will only let me stay here , I shall be all right indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: `` But you will feel the wind here , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 30]: `` I do n't mind that a bit , so long as I feel your arms through it , '' answered Diamond , nestling closer to her grand bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 5]: `` Brave boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 8]: returned North Wind , pressing him closer .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 14]: `` No , '' said Diamond , `` I do n't see that .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 16]: It 's not courage at all , so long as I feel you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: `` But had n't you better get into my hair ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 13]: Then you would not feel the wind ; you will here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 24]: `` Ah , but , dear North Wind , you do n't know how nice it is to feel your arms about me .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 33]: It is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together , than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: `` But it is surely more comfortable there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 19]: `` Well , perhaps ; but I begin to think there are better things than being comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: `` Yes , indeed there are .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 11]: Well , I will keep you in front of me .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 11]: You will feel the wind , but not too much .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 24]: I shall only want one arm to take care of you ; the other will be quite enough to sink the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear North Wind !
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 7]: how can you talk so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 17]: `` My dear boy , I never talk ; I always mean what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 15]: `` Then you do mean to sink the ship with the other hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 8]: `` It 's not like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 4]: `` Quite easily .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 25]: Here you are taking care of a poor little boy with one arm , and there you are sinking a ship with the other .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 8]: It ca n't be like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 5]: but which is me ?
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 11]: I ca n't be two mes , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 7]: Nobody can be two mes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: `` Well , which me is me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: `` Now I must think .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: There looks to be two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 6]: That 's the very point .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 17]: -- You ca n't be knowing the thing you do n't know , can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 8]: `` Which me do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 21]: `` The kindest , goodest , best me in the world , '' answered Diamond , clinging to North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 9]: `` Why am I good to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 10]: `` Have you ever done anything for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 18]: `` Then I must be good to you because I choose to be good to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: `` Why should I choose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: `` Because -- because -- because you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 12]: `` Why should I like to be good to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 20]: `` I do n't know , except it be because it 's good to be good to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 19]: `` That 's just it ; I am good to you because I like to be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 18]: `` Then why should n't you be good to other people as well as to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 10]: `` That 's just what I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 6]: Why should n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 7]: `` I do n't know either .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 7]: Then why should n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: `` Because I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: `` There it is again , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 9]: `` I do n't see that you are .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 8]: It looks quite the other thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 10]: `` Well , but listen to me , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 15]: You know the one me , you say , and that is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 11]: `` Do you know the other me as well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: I should n't like to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 5]: `` There it is .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 8]: You do n't know the other me .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 9]: You are sure of one of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 13]: `` And you are sure there ca n't be two mes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 28]: `` Then the me you do n't know must be the same as the me you do know , -- else there would be two mes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 21]: `` Then the other me you do n't know must be as kind as the me you do know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 19]: `` Besides , I tell you that it is so , only it does n't look like it .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 5]: That I confess freely .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: Have you anything more to object ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 15]: `` No , no , dear North Wind ; I am quite satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: `` Then I will tell you something you might object .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 23]: You might say that the me you know is like the other me , and that I am cruel all through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 15]: `` I know that ca n't be , because you are so kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 19]: `` But that kindness might be only a pretence for the sake of being more cruel afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 25]: Diamond clung to her tighter than ever , crying -- `` No , no , dear North Wind ; I ca n't believe that .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 6]: I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: I wo n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 5]: That would kill me .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 19]: I love you , and you must love me , else how did I come to love you ?
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 22]: How could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: You may sink as many ships as you like , and I wo n't say another word .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 15]: I ca n't say I shall like to see it , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 45]: `` That 's quite another thing , '' said North Wind ; and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft , and rushed up into the clouds , with Diamond on her left arm close to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 20]: And as if the clouds knew she had come , they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 36]: For a few moments , Diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame ; the next , the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 69]: For they were in the midst of the clouds and mists , and they of course took the shapes of the wind , eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water , so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape , and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 79]: Now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes ; now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears ; for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning ; now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 7]: But he did not mind it .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 26]: He only gasped first and then laughed , for the arm of North Wind was about him , and he was leaning against her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 12]: It is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 15]: Did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 42]: If you ever did , you would see that the water rushed every way at once , some of it even turning back and opposing the rest ; greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 46]: Well , the wind was like that , except that it went much faster , and therefore was much wilder , and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 13]: Diamond saw the threads of the lady 's hair streaking it all .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 18]: In parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 30]: It seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of North Wind 's infinite hair , sweeping in endless intertwistings .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 39]: And Diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair , which his mother kept rather long , as if he too was a part of the storm , and some of its life went out from him .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 52]: But so sheltered was he by North Wind 's arm and bosom that only at times , in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy , did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried , nestling in its very core and formative centre .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 25]: It seemed to Diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre , and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 51]: Flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos , revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention ; peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste ; but it seemed to Diamond that North Wind and he were motionless , all but the hair .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 5]: It was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 14]: They were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 20]: THE CATHEDRAL I MUST not go on describing what can not be described , for nothing is more wearisome .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 19]: Before they reached the sea , Diamond felt North Wind 's hair just beginning to fall about him .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 10]: `` Is the storm over , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 4]: he called out .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 5]: `` No , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 11]: I am only waiting a moment to set you down .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 30]: You would not like to see the ship sunk , and I am going to give you a place to stop in till I come back for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 7]: thank you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 23]: `` I shall be sorry to leave you , North Wind , but I would rather not see the ship go down .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 16]: And I 'm afraid the poor people will cry , and I should hear them .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 5]: Oh , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 31]: `` There are a good many passengers on board ; and to tell the truth , Diamond , I do n't care about your hearing the cry you speak of .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 20]: I am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 12]: `` But how can you bear it then , North Wind ?
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: For I am sure you are kind .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 8]: I shall never doubt that again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 41]: `` I will tell you how I am able to bear it , Diamond : I am always hearing , through every noise , through all the noise I am making myself even , the sound of a far-off song .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 74]: I do not exactly know where it is , or what it means ; and I do n't hear much of it , only the odour of its music , as it were , flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which I make such a storm ; but what I do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 11]: So it would you if you could hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 13]: `` No , it would n't , '' returned Diamond , stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 26]: `` For they would n't hear the music of the far-away song ; and if they did , it would n't do them any good .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 20]: You see you and I are not going to be drowned , and so we might enjoy it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 19]: `` But you have never heard the psalm , and you do n't know what it is like .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 27]: Somehow , I ca n't say how , it tells me that all is right ; that it is coming to swallow up all cries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 20]: `` But that wo n't do them any good -- the people , I mean , '' persisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 4]: `` It must .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 10]: It must , '' said North Wind , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 34]: `` It would n't be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too , and set them singing it themselves with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: I am sure it will .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 35]: And do you know , ever since I knew I had hair , that is , ever since it began to go out and away , that song has been coming nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 15]: Only I must say it was some thousand years before I heard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 18]: `` But how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 5]: asked doubting little Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 31]: `` Since I began to hear it , I know it is growing louder , therefore I judge it was coming nearer and nearer until I did hear it first .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 50]: I 'm not so very old , you know -- a few thousand years only -- and I was quite a baby when I heard the noise first , but I knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than I was .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 37]: I ca n't sing at all , except now and then , and I can never tell what my song is going to be ; I only know what it is after I have sung it .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 7]: -- But this will never do .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 6]: Will you stop here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 13]: `` I ca n't see anywhere to stop , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 29]: `` Your hair is all down like a darkness , and I ca n't see through it if I knock my eyes into it ever so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 39]: `` Look , then , '' said North Wind ; and , with one sweep of her great white arm , she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 11]: it was a blue night , lit up with stars .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 43]: Where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars , except where , just opposite to Diamond 's face , the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 5]: what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 40]: cried Diamond , struck with a kind of terror , for he had never seen a cathedral , and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces , conquering emptiness with grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 16]: `` A very good place for you to wait in , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 15]: `` But we shall go in , and you shall judge for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 26]: There was an open door in the middle of one of the towers , leading out upon the roof , and through it they passed .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 40]: Then North Wind set Diamond on his feet , and he found himself at the top of a stone stair , which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 18]: It was enough , however , to allow Diamond to see that North Wind stood beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 30]: He looked up to find her face , and saw that she was no longer a beautiful giantess , but the tall gracious lady he liked best to see .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 79]: She took his hand , and , giving him the broad part of the spiral stair to walk on , led him down a good way ; then , opening another little door , led him out upon a narrow gallery that ran all round the central part of the church , on the ledges of the windows of the clerestory , and through openings in the parts of the wall that divided the windows from each other .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 27]: It was very narrow , and except when they were passing through the wall , Diamond saw nothing to keep him from falling into the church .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 25]: It lay below him like a great silent gulf hollowed in stone , and he held his breath for fear as he looked down .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 11]: `` What are you trembling for , little Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 34]: said the lady , as she walked gently along , with her hand held out behind her leading him , for there was not breadth enough for them to walk side by side .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 13]: `` I am afraid of falling down there , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 8]: `` It is so deep down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 24]: `` Yes , rather , '' answered North Wind ; `` but you were a hundred times higher a few minutes ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 34]: `` Ah , yes , but somebody 's arm was about me then , '' said Diamond , putting his little mouth to the beautiful cold hand that had a hold of his .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 12]: `` What a dear little warm mouth you 've got ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 4]: said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: `` It is a pity you should talk nonsense with it .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 12]: Do n't you know I have a hold of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 17]: `` Yes ; but I 'm walking on my own legs , and they might slip .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: I ca n't trust myself so well as your arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 17]: `` But I have a hold of you , I tell you , foolish child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 12]: `` Yes , but somehow I ca n't feel comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 47]: `` If you were to fall , and my hold of you were to give way , I should be down after you in a less moment than a lady 's watch can tick , and catch you long before you had reached the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 12]: `` I do n't like it though , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 37]: he screamed the next moment , bent double with terror , for North Wind had let go her hold of his hand , and had vanished , leaving him standing as if rooted to the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 16]: She left the words , `` Come after me , '' sounding in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 6]: But move he dared not .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 56]: In a moment more he would from very terror have fallen into the church , but suddenly there came a gentle breath of cool wind upon his face , and it kept blowing upon him in little puffs , and at every puff Diamond felt his faintness going away , and his fear with it .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 56]: Courage was reviving in his little heart , and still the cool wafts of the soft wind breathed upon him , and the soft wind was so mighty and strong within its gentleness , that in a minute more Diamond was marching along the narrow ledge as fearless for the time as North Wind herself .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 93]: He walked on and on , with the windows all in a row on one side of him , and the great empty nave of the church echoing to every one of his brave strides on the other , until at last he came to a little open door , from which a broader stair led him down and down and down , till at last all at once he found himself in the arms of North Wind , who held him close to her , and kissed him on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 24]: Diamond nestled to her , and murmured into her bosom , -- `` Why did you leave me , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 13]: `` Because I wanted you to walk alone , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: `` But it is so much nicer here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 16]: `` I daresay ; but I could n't hold a little coward to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: It would make me so cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 36]: `` But I was n't brave of myself , '' said Diamond , whom my older readers will have already discovered to be a true child in this , that he was given to metaphysics .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 15]: `` It was the wind that blew in my face that made me brave .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 9]: Was n't it now , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 7]: `` Yes : I know that .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 9]: You had to be taught what courage was .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 18]: And you could n't know what it was without feeling it : therefore it was given you .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 18]: But do n't you feel as if you would try to be brave yourself next time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: But trying is not much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 17]: `` Yes , it is -- a very great deal , for it is a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 10]: And a beginning is the greatest thing of all .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 10]: To try to be brave is to be brave .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 27]: The coward who tries to be brave is before the man who is brave because he is made so , and never had to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 10]: `` How kind you are , North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 6]: `` I am only just .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 6]: All kindness is but justice .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 5]: We owe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 9]: `` I do n't quite understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: `` Never mind ; you will some day .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 10]: There is no hurry about understanding it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: `` Who blew the wind on me that made me brave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 5]: `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 8]: `` I did n't see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 8]: `` Therefore you can believe me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes ; of course .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 15]: But how was it that such a little breath could be so strong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 8]: `` That I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 8]: `` But you made it strong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: `` No : I only blew it .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 21]: I knew it would make you strong , just as it did the man in the boat , you remember .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 12]: But how my breath has that power I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 10]: It was put into it when I was made .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 6]: That is all I know .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 11]: But really I must be going about my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 4]: the poor ship !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 15]: I wish you would stop here , and let the poor ship go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: `` That I dare not do .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 10]: Will you stop here till I come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 7]: You wo n't be long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: `` Not longer than I can help .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 12]: Trust me , you shall get home before the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 27]: In a moment North Wind was gone , and the next Diamond heard a moaning about the church , which grew and grew to a roaring .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 17]: The storm was up again , and he knew that North Wind 's hair was flying .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 5]: The church was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 28]: Only a little light came through the windows , which were almost all of that precious old stained glass which is so much lovelier than the new .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 27]: But Diamond could not see how beautiful they were , for there was not enough of light in the stars to show the colours of them .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 26]: He could only just distinguish them from the walls , He looked up , but could not see the gallery along which he had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 27]: He could only tell where it was far up by the faint glimmer of the windows of the clerestory , whose sills made part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 22]: The church grew very lonely about him , and he began to feel like a child whose mother has forsaken it .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 15]: Only he knew that to be left alone is not always to be forsaken .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 20]: He began to feel his way about the place , and for a while went wandering up and down .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 12]: His little footsteps waked little answering echoes in the great house .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 9]: It was n't too big to mind him .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 19]: It was as if the church knew he was there , and meant to make itself his house .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 34]: So it went on giving back an answer to every step , until at length Diamond thought he should like to say something out loud , and see what the church would answer .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 9]: But he found he was afraid to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: He could not utter a word for fear of the loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 30]: Perhaps it was as well that he did not , for the sound of a spoken word would have made him feel the place yet more deserted and empty .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 7]: But he thought he could sing .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 27]: He was fond of singing , and at home he used to sing , to tunes of his own , all the nursery rhymes he knew .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 17]: So he began to try ` Hey diddle diddle ' , but it would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 15]: Then he tried ` Little Boy Blue ' , but it was no better .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 14]: Neither would ` Sing a Song of Sixpence ' sing itself at all .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 15]: Then he tried ` Poor old Cockytoo ' , but he would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 6]: They all sounded so silly !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 9]: and he had never thought them silly before .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 23]: So he was quiet , and listened to the echoes that came out of the dark corners in answer to his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 18]: At last he gave a great sigh , and said , `` I 'm so tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 45]: But he did not hear the gentle echo that answered from far away over his head , for at the same moment he came against the lowest of a few steps that stretched across the church , and fell down and hurt his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 18]: He cried a little first , and then crawled up the steps on his hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 37]: At the top he came to a little bit of carpet , on which he lay down ; and there he lay staring at the dull window that rose nearly a hundred feet above his head .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 25]: Now this was the eastern window of the church , and the moon was at that moment just on the edge of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: The next , she was peeping over it .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 27]: with the moon , St. John and St. Paul , and the rest of them , began to dawn in the window in their lovely garments .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 69]: Diamond did not know that the wonder-working moon was behind , and he thought all the light was coming out of the window itself , and that the good old men were appearing to help him , growing out of the night and the darkness , because he had hurt his arm , and was very tired and lonely , and North Wind was so long in coming .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 25]: So he lay and looked at them backwards over his head , wondering when they would come down or what they would do next .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 32]: They were very dim , for the moonlight was not strong enough for the colours , and he had enough to do with his eyes trying to make out their shapes .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 28]: So his eyes grew tired , and more and more tired , and his eyelids grew so heavy that they would keep tumbling down over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 18]: He kept lifting them and lifting them , but every time they were heavier than the last .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 12]: It was no use : they were too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 36]: Sometimes before he had got them half up , down they were again ; and at length he gave it up quite , and the moment he gave it up , he was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 23]: THE EAST WINDOW THAT Diamond had fallen fast asleep is very evident from the strange things he now fancied as taking place .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 16]: For he thought he heard a sound as of whispering up in the great window .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 12]: He tried to open his eyes , but he could not .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 21]: And the whispering went on and grew louder and louder , until he could hear every word that was said .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 10]: He thought it was the Apostles talking about him .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 8]: But he could not open his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 14]: `` And how comes he to be lying there , St. Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 3]: said one .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 19]: `` I think I saw him a while ago up in the gallery , under the Nicodemus window .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: Perhaps he has fallen down .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 10]: `` What do you think , St. Matthew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 17]: `` I do n't think he could have crept here after falling from such a height .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: He must have been killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 9]: `` What are we to do with him ?
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 8]: We ca n't leave him lying there .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 19]: And we could not make him comfortable up here in the window : it 's rather crowded already .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: What do you say , St. Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 11]: `` Let 's go down and look at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 38]: There came a rustling , and a chinking , for some time , and then there was a silence , and Diamond felt somehow that all the Apostles were standing round him and looking down on him .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 9]: And still he could not open his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 12]: `` What is the matter with him , St. Luke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 3]: asked one .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 32]: `` There 's nothing the matter with him , '' answered St. Luke , who must have joined the company of the Apostles from the next window , one would think .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: `` He 's in a sound sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 9]: `` I have it , '' cried another .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 10]: `` This is one of North Wind 's tricks .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 21]: She has caught him up and dropped him at our door , like a withered leaf or a foundling baby .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 13]: I do n't understand that woman 's conduct , I must say .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 22]: As if we had n't enough to do with our money , without going taking care of other people 's children !
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: That 's not what our forefathers built cathedrals for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: Now Diamond could not bear to hear such things against North Wind , who , he knew , never played anybody a trick .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 12]: She was far too busy with her own work for that .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 12]: He struggled hard to open his eyes , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 27]: `` She should consider that a church is not a place for pranks , not to mention that we live in it , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: `` It certainly is disrespectful of her .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 6]: But she always is disrespectful .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 20]: What right has she to bang at our windows as she has been doing the whole of this night ?
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 8]: I daresay there is glass broken somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 19]: I know my blue robe is in a dreadful mess with the rain first and the dust after .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: It will cost me shillings to clean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 14]: Then Diamond knew that they could not be Apostles , talking like this .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 57]: They could only be the sextons and vergers and such-like , who got up at night , and put on the robes of deans and bishops , and called each other grand names , as the foolish servants he had heard his father tell of call themselves lords and ladies , after their masters and mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 30]: And he was so angry at their daring to abuse North Wind , that he jumped up , crying -- `` North Wind knows best what she is about .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 21]: She has a good right to blow the cobwebs from your windows , for she was sent to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: She sweeps them away from grander places , I can tell you , for I 've been with her at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 71]: This was what he began to say , but as he spoke his eyes came wide open , and behold , there were neither Apostles nor vergers there -- not even a window with the effigies of holy men in it , but a dark heap of hay all about him , and the little panes in the roof of his loft glimmering blue in the light of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 11]: Old Diamond was coming awake down below in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 23]: In a moment more he was on his feet , and shaking himself so that young Diamond 's bed trembled under him .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 12]: `` He 's grand at shaking himself , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 10]: `` I wish I could shake myself like that .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 12]: But then I can wash myself , and he ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 19]: What fun it would be to see Old Diamond washing his face with his hoofs and iron shoes !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 8]: Would n't it be a picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 10]: So saying , he got up and dressed himself .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: Then he went out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 49]: There must have been a tremendous wind in the night , for although all was quiet now , there lay the little summer-house crushed to the ground , and over it the great elm-tree , which the wind had broken across , being much decayed in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 61]: Diamond almost cried to see the wilderness of green leaves , which used to be so far up in the blue air , tossing about in the breeze , and liking it best when the wind blew it most , now lying so near the ground , and without any hope of ever getting up into the deep air again .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: `` I wonder how old the tree is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 3]: thought Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 20]: `` It must take a long time to get so near the sky as that poor tree was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 21]: `` Yes , indeed , '' said a voice beside him , for Diamond had spoken the last words aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 23]: Diamond started , and looking around saw a clergyman , a brother of Mrs. Coleman , who happened to be visiting her .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 15]: He was a great scholar , and was in the habit of rising early .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: `` Who are you , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 9]: `` Little Diamond , '' answered the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 6]: I have heard of you .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 11]: How do you come to be up so early ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 15]: `` Because the sham Apostles talked such nonsense , they waked me up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 4]: The clergyman stared .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 18]: Diamond saw that he had better have held his tongue , for he could not explain things .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 15]: `` You must have been dreaming , my little man , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 3]: `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 3]: dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 17]: he went on , looking at the tree , `` there has been terrible work here .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 8]: This is the north wind 's doing .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 4]: What a pity !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 15]: I wish we lived at the back of it , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 7]: `` Where is that sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 14]: `` Away in the Hyperborean regions , '' answered the clergyman , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 12]: `` I never heard of the place , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 36]: `` I daresay not , '' answered the clergyman ; `` but if this tree had been there now , it would not have been blown down , for there is no wind there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 30]: `` But , please , sir , if it had been there , '' said Diamond , `` we should not have had to be sorry for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 5]: `` Certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 16]: `` Then we should n't have had to be glad for it , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 36]: `` You 're quite right , my boy , '' said the clergyman , looking at him very kindly , as he turned away to the house , with his eyes bent towards the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 24]: But Diamond thought within himself , `` I will ask North Wind next time I see her to take me to that country .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 11]: I think she did speak about it once before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 29]: HOW DIAMOND GOT TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND WHEN Diamond went home to breakfast , he found his father and mother already seated at the table .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 20]: They were both busy with their bread and butter , and Diamond sat himself down in his usual place .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 32]: His mother looked up at him , and , after watching him for a moment , said : `` I do n't think the boy is looking well , husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 5]: `` Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 7]: Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 7]: I think he looks pretty bobbish .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 12]: How do you feel yourself , Diamond , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 22]: `` Quite well , thank you , father ; at least , I think I 've got a little headache . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 14]: I told you , '' said his father and mother both at once .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 11]: `` The child 's very poorly '' added his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: `` The child 's quite well , '' added his father .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 6]: And then they both laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 22]: `` You see , '' said his mother , `` I 've had a letter from my sister at Sandwich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: `` Sleepy old hole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 19]: `` Do n't abuse the place ; there 's good people in it , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 32]: `` Right , old lady , '' returned his father ; `` only I do n't believe there are more than two pair of carriage-horses in the whole blessed place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 17]: `` Well , people can get to heaven without carriages -- or coachmen either , husband .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 14]: Not that I should like to go without my coachman , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 6]: But about the boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 5]: `` What boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 14]: `` That boy , there , staring at you with his goggle-eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: `` Have I got goggle-eyes , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: asked Diamond , a little dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 29]: `` Not too goggle , '' said his mother , who was quite proud of her boy 's eyes , only did not want to make him vain .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 13]: `` Not too goggle ; only you need not stare so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: `` Well , what about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: `` I told you I had got a letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 12]: `` Yes , from your sister ; not from Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 5]: `` La , husband !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 18]: you 've got out of bed the wrong leg first this morning , I do believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: `` I always get out with both at once , '' said his father , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 6]: `` Well , listen then .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 13]: His aunt wants the boy to go down and see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 18]: `` And that 's why you want to make out that he ai n't looking well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 6]: `` No more he is .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 8]: I think he had better go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 20]: `` Well , I do n't care , if you can find the money , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 23]: `` I 'll manage that , '' said his mother ; and so it was agreed that Diamond should go to Sandwich .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 9]: I will not describe the preparations Diamond made .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 15]: You would have thought he had been going on a three months ' voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: Nor will I describe the journey , for our business is now at the place .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 31]: He was met at the station by his aunt , a cheerful middle-aged woman , and conveyed in safety to the sleepy old town , as his father called it .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 17]: And no wonder that it was sleepy , for it was nearly dead of old age .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 23]: Diamond went about staring with his beautiful goggle-eyes , at the quaint old streets , and the shops , and the houses .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 34]: Everything looked very strange , indeed ; for here was a town abandoned by its nurse , the sea , like an old oyster left on the shore till it gaped for weariness .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 80]: It used to be one of the five chief seaports in England , but it began to hold itself too high , and the consequence was the sea grew less and less intimate with it , gradually drew back , and kept more to itself , till at length it left it high and dry : Sandwich was a seaport no more ; the sea went on with its own tide-business a long way off , and forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 16]: Of course it went to sleep , and had no more to do with ships .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 25]: That 's what comes to cities and nations , and boys and girls , who say , `` I can do without your help .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: I 'm enough for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 45]: Diamond soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toyshop , for his mother had given him twopence for pocket-money before he left , and he had gone into her shop to spend it , and she got talking to him .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 38]: She looked very funny , because she had not got any teeth , but Diamond liked her , and went often to her shop , although he had nothing to spend there after the twopence was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: One afternoon he had been wandering rather wearily about the streets for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 11]: It was a hot day , and he felt tired .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 10]: As he passed the toyshop , he stepped in .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 14]: `` Please may I sit down for a minute on this box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 13]: he said , thinking the old woman was somewhere in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 12]: But he got no answer , and sat down without one .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 18]: Around him were a great many toys of all prices , from a penny up to shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 12]: All at once he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 9]: It made him start and look behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 17]: There were the sails of a windmill going round and round almost close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 49]: He thought at first it must be one of those toys which are wound up and go with clockwork ; but no , it was a common penny toy , with the windmill at the end of a whistle , and when the whistle blows the windmill goes .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 35]: But the wonder was that there was no one at the whistle end blowing , and yet the sails were turning round and round -- now faster , now slower , now faster again .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 7]: `` What can it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 5]: said Diamond , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 15]: `` It means me , '' said the tiniest voice he had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 8]: `` Who are you , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 18]: `` Well , really , I begin to be ashamed of you , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 30]: `` I wonder how long it will be before you know me ; or how often I might take you in before you got sharp enough to suspect me .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 19]: You are as bad as a baby that does n't know his mother in a new bonnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 41]: `` Not quite so bad as that , dear North Wind , '' said Diamond , `` for I did n't see you at all , and indeed I do n't see you yet , although I recognise your voice .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 8]: Do grow a little , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 23]: `` Not a hair 's - breadth , '' said the voice , and it was the smallest voice that ever spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 8]: `` What are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 9]: `` I am come to see my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 22]: But , please , North Wind , why did n't you come back for me in the church that night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 6]: I carried you safe home .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 19]: All the time you were dreaming about the glass Apostles , you were lying in my arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 10]: `` I 'm so glad , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: `` I thought that must be it , only I wanted to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: Did you sink the ship , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 6]: `` And drown everybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 4]: `` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: One boat got away with six or seven men in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 13]: `` How could the boat swim when the ship could n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 10]: `` Of course I had some trouble with it .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 14]: I had to contrive a bit , and manage the waves a little .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 19]: When they 're once thoroughly waked up , I have a good deal of trouble with them sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 14]: They 're apt to get stupid with tumbling over each other 's heads .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 9]: That 's when they 're fairly at it .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 15]: However , the boat got to a desert island before noon next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 10]: `` And what good will come of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 4]: I obeyed orders .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 4]: Good bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 9]: stay , North Wind , do stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 13]: cried Diamond , dismayed to see the windmill get slower and slower .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 10]: `` What is it , my dear child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 19]: said North Wind , and the windmill began turning again so swiftly that Diamond could scarcely see it .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 9]: `` What a big voice you 've got !
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 10]: and what a noise you do make with it ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 6]: What is it you want ?
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 14]: I have little to do , but that little must be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 19]: `` I want you to take me to the country at the back of the north wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 26]: `` That 's not so easy , '' said North Wind , and was silent for so long that Diamond thought she was gone indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 14]: But after he had quite given her up , the voice began again .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 13]: `` I almost wish old Herodotus had held his tongue about it .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 7]: Much he knew of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 11]: `` Why do you wish that , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 19]: `` Because then that clergyman would never have heard of it , and set you wanting to go .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: But we shall see .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 4]: We shall see .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 28]: You must go home now , my dear , for you do n't seem very well , and I 'll see what can be done for you .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: Do n't wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 23]: I 've got to break a few of old Goody 's toys ; she 's thinking too much of her new stock .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 6]: Two or three will do .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 4]: go now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: Diamond rose , quite sorry , and without a word left the shop , and went home .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 32]: It soon appeared that his mother had been right about him , for that same afternoon his head began to ache very much , and he had to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 9]: He awoke in the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 24]: The lattice window of his room had blown open , and the curtains of his little bed were swinging about in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 10]: `` If that should be North Wind now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 3]: thought Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 20]: But the next moment he heard some one closing the window , and his aunt came to his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 20]: She put her hand on his face , and said -- `` How 's your head , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 9]: `` Better , auntie , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: `` Would you like something to drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 6]: I should , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 41]: So his aunt gave him some lemonade , for she had been used to nursing sick people , and Diamond felt very much refreshed , and laid his head down again to go very fast asleep , as he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 26]: And so he did , but only to come awake again , as a fresh burst of wind blew the lattice open a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 31]: The same moment he found himself in a cloud of North Wind 's hair , with her beautiful face , set in it like a moon , bending over him .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 6]: `` Quick , Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 9]: `` I have found such a chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 11]: `` But I 'm not well , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 16]: `` I know that , but you will be better for a little fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 8]: You shall have plenty of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 10]: `` You want me to go , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 7]: It wo n't hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 23]: `` Very well , '' said Diamond ; and getting out of the bed-clothes , he jumped into North Wind 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 27]: `` We must make haste before your aunt comes , '' said she , as she glided out of the open lattice and left it swinging .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 15]: The moment Diamond felt her arms fold around him he began to feel better .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 19]: It was a moonless night , and very dark , with glimpses of stars when the clouds parted .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 32]: `` I used to dash the waves about here , '' said North Wind , `` where cows and sheep are feeding now ; but we shall soon get to them .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 5]: There they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 17]: And Diamond , looking down , saw the white glimmer of breaking water far below him .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 49]: `` You see , Diamond , '' said North Wind , `` it is very difficult for me to get you to the back of the north wind , for that country lies in the very north itself , and of course I ca n't blow northwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 6]: `` You little silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 4]: said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 35]: `` Do n't you see that if I were to blow northwards I should be South Wind , and that is as much as to say that one person could be two persons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 14]: `` But how can you ever get home at all , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 21]: `` You are quite right -- that is my home , though I never get farther than the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: I sit on the doorstep , and hear the voices inside .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 8]: I am nobody there , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 7]: `` I 'm very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 8]: `` That you should be nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 4]: Dear little man !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: you will be very glad some day to be nobody yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 39]: But you ca n't understand that now , and you had better not try ; for if you do , you will be certain to go fancying some egregious nonsense , and making yourself miserable about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 10]: `` Then I wo n't , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 7]: `` There 's a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 9]: It will all come in good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 18]: `` But you have n't told me how you get to the doorstep , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: `` It is easy enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 14]: I have only to consent to be nobody , and there I am .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 12]: I draw into myself and there I am on the doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 43]: But you can easily see , or you have less sense than I think , that to drag you , you heavy thing , along with me , would take centuries , and I could not give the time to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 9]: `` Oh , I 'm so sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 8]: `` What for now , pet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 9]: `` That I 'm so heavy for you .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 16]: I would be lighter if I could , but I do n't know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 5]: `` You silly darling !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 15]: Why , I could toss you a hundred miles from me if I liked .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 16]: It is only when I am going home that I shall find you heavy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 10]: `` Then you are going home with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 12]: Did I not come to fetch you just for that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 12]: `` But all this time you must be going southwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 6]: Of course I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 12]: `` How can you be taking me northwards , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 6]: `` A very sensible question .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 5]: But you shall see .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 19]: I will get rid of a few of these clouds -- only they do come up so fast !
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 10]: It 's like trying to blow a brook dry .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: What do you see now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: `` I think I see a little boat , away there , down below . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: `` A little boat , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 36]: She 's a yacht of two hundred tons ; and the captain of it is a friend of mine ; for he is a man of good sense , and can sail his craft well .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 13]: I 've helped him many a time when he little thought it .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 20]: I 've heard him grumbling at me , when I was doing the very best I could for him .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 19]: Why , I 've carried him eighty miles a day , again and again , right north . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 32]: `` He must have dodged for that , '' said Diamond , who had been watching the vessels , and had seen that they went other ways than the wind blew .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 6]: `` Of course he must .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 14]: But do n't you see , it was the best I could do ?
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 7]: I could n't be South Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 11]: And besides it gave him a share in the business .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 30]: It is not good at all -- mind that , Diamond -- to do everything for those you love , and not give them a share in the doing .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 5]: It 's not kind .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 11]: It 's making too much of yourself , my child .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 23]: If I had been South Wind , he would only have smoked his pipe all day , and made himself stupid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 24]: `` But how could he be a man of sense and grumble at you when you were doing your best for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 20]: you must make allowances , '' said North Wind , `` or you will never do justice to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 29]: -- You do understand , then , that a captain may sail north -- '' `` In spite of a north wind -- yes , '' supplemented Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 18]: `` Now , I do think you must be stupid , my dear '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 15]: `` Suppose the north wind did not blow where would he be then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: `` Why then the south wind would carry him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 15]: `` So you think that when the north wind stops the south wind blows .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 2]: Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 17]: If I did n't blow , the captain could n't sail his eighty miles a day .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 30]: No doubt South Wind would carry him faster , but South Wind is sitting on her doorstep then , and if I stopped there would be a dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 28]: So you are all wrong to say he can sail north in spite of me ; he sails north by my help , and my help alone .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 7]: You see that , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 9]: `` Yes , I do , North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 14]: I am stupid , but I do n't want to be stupid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: `` Good boy !
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 22]: I am going to blow you north in that little craft , one of the finest that ever sailed the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 8]: Here we are , right over it .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 24]: I shall be blowing against you ; you will be sailing against me ; and all will be just as we want it .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 24]: The captain wo n't get on so fast as he would like , but he will get on , and so shall we .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 10]: I 'm just going to put you on board .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 37]: Do you see in front of the tiller -- that thing the man is working , now to one side , now to the other -- a round thing like the top of a drum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 18]: `` Below that is where they keep their spare sails , and some stores of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: I am going to blow that cover off .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 16]: The same moment I will drop you on deck , and you must tumble in .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 18]: Do n't be afraid , it is of no depth , and you will fall on sail-cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 28]: You will find it nice and warm and dry-only dark ; and you will know I am near you by every roll and pitch of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 8]: Coil yourself up and go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 14]: The yacht shall be my cradle and you shall be my baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 8]: `` Thank you , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 11]: I am not a bit afraid , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 29]: In a moment they were on a level with the bulwarks , and North Wind sent the hatch of the after-store rattling away over the deck to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 33]: The next , Diamond found himself in the dark , for he had tumbled through the hole as North Wind had told him , and the cover was replaced over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 18]: Away he went rolling to leeward , for the wind began all at once to blow hard .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 43]: He heard the call of the captain , and the loud trampling of the men over his head , as they hauled at the main sheet to get the boom on board that they might take in a reef in the mainsail .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 22]: Diamond felt about until he had found what seemed the most comfortable place , and there he snuggled down and lay .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 19]: Hours after hours , a great many of them , went by ; and still Diamond lay there .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 18]: He never felt in the least tired or impatient , for a strange pleasure filled his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 136]: The straining of the masts , the creaking of the boom , the singing of the ropes , the banging of the blocks as they put the vessel about , all fell in with the roaring of the wind above , the surge of the waves past her sides , and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her ; while through it all Diamond could hear the gurgling , rippling , talking flow of the water against her planks , as she slipped through it , lying now on this side , now on that -- like a subdued air running through the grand music his North Wind was making about him to keep him from tiring as they sped on towards the country at the back of her doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: How long this lasted Diamond had no idea .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 18]: He seemed to fall asleep sometimes , only through the sleep he heard the sounds going on .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: At length the weather seemed to get worse .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 42]: The confusion and trampling of feet grew more frequent over his head ; the vessel lay over more and more on her side , and went roaring through the waves , which banged and thumped at her as if in anger .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 8]: All at once arose a terrible uproar .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 32]: The hatch was blown off ; a cold fierce wind swept in upon him ; and a long arm came with it which laid hold of him and lifted him out .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 14]: The same moment he saw the little vessel far below him righting herself .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 21]: She had taken in all her sails and lay now tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wings .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 28]: A short distance to the south lay a much larger vessel , with two or three sails set , and towards it North Wind was carrying Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 14]: It was a German ship , on its way to the North Pole .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 30]: `` That vessel down there will give us a lift now , '' said North Wind ; `` and after that I must do the best I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 30]: She managed to hide him amongst the flags of the big ship , which were all snugly stowed away , and on and on they sped towards the north .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 29]: At length one night she whispered in his ear , `` Come on deck , Diamond ; '' and he got up at once and crept on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 5]: Everything looked very strange .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 31]: Here and there on all sides were huge masses of floating ice , looking like cathedrals , and castles , and crags , while away beyond was a blue sea .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 9]: `` Is the sun rising or setting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 9]: `` Neither or both , which you please .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 7]: I can hardly tell which myself .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 15]: If he is setting now , he will be rising the next moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 9]: `` What a strange light it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 19]: `` I have heard that the sun does n't go to bed all the summer in these parts .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 6]: Miss Coleman told me that .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 23]: I suppose he feels very sleepy , and that is why the light he sends out looks so like a dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 18]: `` That will account for it well enough for all practical purposes , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: Some of the icebergs were drifting northwards ; one was passing very near the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 27]: North Wind seized Diamond , and with a single bound lighted on one of them -- a huge thing , with sharp pinnacles and great clefts .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 12]: The same instant a wind began to blow from the south .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 38]: North Wind hurried Diamond down the north side of the iceberg , stepping by its jags and splintering ; for this berg had never got far enough south to be melted and smoothed by the summer sun .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 31]: She brought him to a cave near the water , where she entered , and , letting Diamond go , sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 24]: Diamond seated himself on the other side , and for a while was enraptured with the colour of the air inside the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 19]: It was a deep , dazzling , lovely blue , deeper than the deepest blue of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 25]: The blue seemed to be in constant motion , like the blackness when you press your eyeballs with your fingers , boiling and sparkling .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: But when he looked across to North Wind he was frightened ; her face was worn and livid .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 13]: `` What is the matter with you , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 4]: `` Nothing much .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 5]: I feel very faint .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 15]: But you must n't mind it , for I can bear it quite well .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 7]: South Wind always blows me faint .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 21]: If it were not for the cool of the thick ice between me and her , I should faint altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 13]: Indeed , as it is , I fear I must vanish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: Diamond stared at her in terror , for he saw that her form and face were growing , not small , but transparent , like something dissolving , not in water , but in light .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 14]: He could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 29]: And she melted away till all that was left was a pale face , like the moon in the morning , with two great lucid eyes in it .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 11]: `` I am going , Diamond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 7]: `` Does it hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 28]: `` It 's very uncomfortable , '' she answered ; `` but I do n't mind it , for I shall come all right again before long .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 19]: I thought I should be able to go with you all the way , but I can not .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 7]: You must not be frightened though .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: Just go straight on , and you will come all right .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: You 'll find me on the doorstep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 25]: As she spoke , her face too faded quite away , only Diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 23]: When he went closer , however , he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 21]: North Wind was quite gone ; and Diamond would have cried , if he had not trusted her so thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 40]: So he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg , as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 24]: It was an excellent craft to go with the current , for there was twice as much of it below water as above .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 15]: But a light south wind was blowing too , and so it went fast .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 26]: After a little while Diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island , and looked down into the ocean beneath him .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 25]: The white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water , that he could see far down into the green abyss .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 29]: Sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of North Wind looking up at him from below , but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 21]: And the time passed he did not know how , for he felt as if he were in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 57]: When he got tired of the green water , he went into the blue cave ; and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea , ever sparkling in the sun , which kept wheeling about the sky , never going below the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 14]: But he chiefly gazed northwards , to see whether any land were appearing .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 9]: All this time he never wanted to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 22]: He broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them , and he thought them very nice .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 46]: At length , one time he came out of his cave , he spied far off on the horizon , a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg ; and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 32]: As it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon ; and other peaks rose after it , with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 66]: Diamond thought this must be the place he was going to ; and he was right ; for the mountains rose and rose , till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay , all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops , and streaks of ice down their sides .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 10]: The berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 26]: Diamond stepped on shore , and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 24]: When he reached it , he found himself on a broad table of ice , along which he could walk without much difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 26]: Before him , at a considerable distance , rose a lofty ridge of ice , which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 21]: The air was very cold , and seemed somehow dead , for there was not the slightest breath of wind .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 18]: In the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 63]: But as he walked towards it , gazing , and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take , he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge , leaning forwards with her hands in her lap , and her hair hanging down to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 18]: `` It is North Wind on her doorstep , '' said Diamond joyfully , and hurried on .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 36]: He soon came up to the place , and there the form sat , like one of the great figures at the door of an Egyptian temple , motionless , with drooping arms and head .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 13]: Then Diamond grew frightened , because she did not move nor speak .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 18]: He was sure it was North Wind , but he thought she must be dead at last .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 29]: Her face was white as the snow , her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave , and her hair hung down straight , like icicles .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 21]: She had on a greenish robe , like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 22]: He stood up before her , and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 21]: At length , with a great effort and a trembling voice , he faltered out -- `` North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 6]: `` Well , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 9]: said the form , without lifting its head .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 10]: `` Are you ill , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 5]: I am waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 7]: `` Till I 'm wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 18]: `` You do n't care for me any more , '' said Diamond , almost crying now .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: `` Yes I do .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 7]: Only I ca n't show it .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: All my love is down at the bottom of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 8]: But I feel it bubbling there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 15]: `` What do you want me to do next , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 12]: said Diamond , wishing to show his love by being obedient .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 10]: `` What do you want to do yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 13]: `` I want to go into the country at your back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: `` Then you must go through me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 8]: `` I mean just what I say .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 19]: You must walk on as if I were an open door , and go right through me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: `` But that will hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 8]: It will hurt you , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: `` I do n't mind that , if you tell me to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: `` Do it , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 6]: Diamond walked towards her instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 26]: When he reached her knees , he put out his hand to lay it on her , but nothing was there save an intense cold .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 4]: He walked on .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 15]: Then all grew white about him ; and the cold stung him like fire .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: He walked on still , groping through the whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 5]: It thickened about him .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 15]: At last , it got into his heart , and he lost all sense .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 25]: I would say that he fainted -- only whereas in common faints all grows black about you , he felt swallowed up in whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 15]: It was when he reached North Wind 's heart that he fainted and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 26]: But as he fell , he rolled over the threshold , and it was thus that Diamond got to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I HAVE now come to the most difficult part of my story .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: Because I do not know enough about it .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: And why should I not know as much about this part as about any other part ?
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 43]: For of course I could know nothing about the story except Diamond had told it ; and why should not Diamond tell about the country at the back of the north wind , as well as about his adventures in getting there ?
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 25]: Because , when he came back , he had forgotten a great deal , and what he did remember was very hard to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 9]: Things there are so different from things here !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 13]: The people there do not speak the same language for one thing .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 13]: Indeed , Diamond insisted that there they do not speak at all .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 18]: I do not think he was right , but it may well have appeared so to Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: The fact is , we have different reports of the place from the most trustworthy people .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 15]: Therefore we are bound to believe that it appears somewhat different to different people .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 12]: All , however , agree in a general way about it .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 28]: I will tell you something of what two very different people have reported , both of whom knew more about it , I believe , than Herodotus .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 39]: One of them speaks from his own experience , for he visited the country ; the other from the testimony of a young peasant girl who came back from it for a month 's visit to her friends .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 31]: The former was a great Italian of noble family , who died more than five hundred years ago ; the latter a Scotch shepherd who died not forty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 32]: The Italian , then , informs us that he had to enter that country through a fire so hot that he would have thrown himself into boiling glass to cool himself .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 67]: This was not Diamond 's experience , but then Durante -- that was the name of the Italian , and it means Lasting , for his books will last as long as there are enough men in the world worthy of having them -- Durante was an elderly man , and Diamond was a little boy , and so their experience must be a little different .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 23]: The peasant girl , on the other hand , fell fast asleep in a wood , and woke in the same country .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 71]: In describing it , Durante says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly , and that a gentle , even-tempered wind , which never blew faster or slower , breathed in his face as he went , making all the leaves point one way , not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees , but , on the contrary , sounding a bass to their song .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 36]: He describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves , as it hurried along , bent the grass , full of red and yellow flowers , through which it flowed .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 52]: He says that the purest stream in the world beside this one would look as if it were mixed with something that did not belong to it , even although it was flowing ever in the brown shadow of the trees , and neither sun nor moon could shine upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: He seems to imply that it is always the month of May in that country .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 75]: It would be out of place to describe here the wonderful sights he saw , for the music of them is in another key from that of this story , and I shall therefore only add from the account of this traveller , that the people there are so free and so just and so healthy , that every one of them has a crown like a king and a mitre like a priest .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 74]: The peasant girl -- Kilmeny was her name -- could not report such grand things as Durante , for , as the shepherd says , telling her story as I tell Diamond 's -- `` Kilmeny had been she knew not where , And Kilmeny had seen what she could not declare ; Kilmeny had been where the cock never crew , Where the rain never fell , and the wind never blew .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 93]: But it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung , And the airs of heaven played round her tongue , When she spoke of the lovely forms she had seen , And a land where sin had never been ; A land of love and a land of light , Withouten sun , or moon , or night ; Where the river swayed a living stream , And the light a pure and cloudless beam : The land of vision it would seem , And still an everlasting dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 17]: The last two lines are the shepherd 's own remark , and a matter of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 37]: But it is clear , I think , that Kilmeny must have described the same country as Durante saw , though , not having his experience , she could neither understand nor describe it so well .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 19]: Now I must give you such fragments of recollection as Diamond was able to bring back with him .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 20]: When he came to himself after he fell , he found himself at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 9]: North Wind herself was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 13]: Neither was there a vestige of snow or of ice within sight .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 23]: The sun too had vanished ; but that was no matter , for there was plenty of a certain still rayless light .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 19]: Where it came from he never found out ; but he thought it belonged to the country itself .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 21]: Sometimes he thought it came out of the flowers , which were very bright , but had no strong colour .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 52]: He said the river -- for all agree that there is a river there -- flowed not only through , but over grass : its channel , instead of being rock , stones , pebbles , sand , or anything else , was of pure meadow grass , not over long .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 70]: He insisted that if it did not sing tunes in people 's ears , it sung tunes in their heads , in proof of which I may mention that , in the troubles which followed , Diamond was often heard singing ; and when asked what he was singing , would answer , `` One of the tunes the river at the back of the north wind sung . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 51]: And I may as well say at once that Diamond never told these things to any one but -- no , I had better not say who it was ; but whoever it was told me , and I thought it would be well to write them for my child-readers .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 51]: He could not say he was very happy there , for he had neither his father nor mother with him , but he felt so still and quiet and patient and contented , that , as far as the mere feeling went , it was something better than mere happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: Nothing went wrong at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 9]: Neither was anything quite right , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 10]: Only everything was going to be right some day .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 29]: His account disagreed with that of Durante , and agreed with that of Kilmeny , in this , that he protested there was no wind there at all .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 6]: I fancy he missed it .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 10]: At all events we could not do without wind .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 20]: It all depends on how big our lungs are whether the wind is too strong for us or not .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 69]: When the person he told about it asked him whether he saw anybody he knew there , he answered , `` Only a little girl belonging to the gardener , who thought he had lost her , but was quite mistaken , for there she was safe enough , and was to come back some day , as I came back , if they would only wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 10]: `` Did you talk to her , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 4]: Nobody talks there .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 12]: They only look at each other , and understand everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 7]: `` Is it cold there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 6]: `` Is it hot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 7]: `` What is it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 10]: `` You never think about such things there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: `` What a queer place it must be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: `` It 's a very good place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 10]: `` Do you want to go back again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 20]: `` No ; I do n't think I have left it ; I feel it here , somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 9]: `` Did the people there look pleased ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 12]: `` Yes -- quite pleased , only a little sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 9]: `` Then they did n't look glad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 15]: `` They looked as if they were waiting to be gladder some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 12]: This was how Diamond used to answer questions about that country .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 21]: And now I will take up the story again , and tell you how he got back to this country .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 47]: HOW DIAMOND GOT HOME AGAIN WHEN one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved , he had to go to a certain tree , climb the stem , and sit down in the branches .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 28]: In a few minutes , if he kept very still , he would see something at least of what was going on with the people he loved .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 32]: One day when Diamond was sitting in this tree , he began to long very much to get home again , and no wonder , for he saw his mother crying .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 21]: Durante says that the people there may always follow their wishes , because they never wish but what is good .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 16]: Diamond 's wish was to get home , and he would fain follow his wish .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 9]: But how was he to set about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 8]: If he could only see North Wind !
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 18]: But the moment he had got to her back , she was gone altogether from his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 7]: He had never seen her back .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 26]: She might be sitting on her doorstep still , looking southwards , and waiting , white and thin and blue-eyed , until she was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 29]: Or she might have again become a mighty creature , with power to do that which was demanded of her , and gone far away upon many missions .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 7]: She must be somewhere , however .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 15]: He could not go home without her , and therefore he must find her .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: She could never have intended to leave him always away from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 23]: If there had been any danger of that , she would have told him , and given him his choice about going .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: For North Wind was right honest .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 13]: How to find North Wind , therefore , occupied all his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 22]: In his anxiety about his mother , he used to climb the tree every day , and sit in its branches .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 63]: However many of the dwellers there did so , they never incommoded one another ; for the moment one got into the tree , he became invisible to every one else ; and it was such a wide-spreading tree that there was room for every one of the people of the country in it , without the least interference with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 48]: Sometimes , on getting down , two of them would meet at the root , and then they would smile to each other more sweetly than at any other time , as much as to say , `` Ah , you 've been up there too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 21]: One day he was sitting on one of the outer branches of the tree , looking southwards after his home .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 17]: Far away was a blue shining sea , dotted with gleaming and sparkling specks of white .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 5]: Those were the icebergs .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 35]: Nearer he saw a great range of snow-capped mountains , and down below him the lovely meadow-grass of the country , with the stream flowing and flowing through it , away towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 39]: As he looked he began to wonder , for the whole country lay beneath him like a map , and that which was near him looked just as small as that which he knew to be miles away .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 41]: The ridge of ice which encircled it appeared but a few yards off , and no larger than the row of pebbles with which a child will mark out the boundaries of the kingdom he has appropriated on the sea-shore .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 24]: He thought he could distinguish the vapoury form of North Wind , seated as he had left her , on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 25]: Hastily he descended the tree , and to his amazement found that the map or model of the country still lay at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 5]: He stood in it .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 38]: With one stride he had crossed the river ; with another he had reached the ridge of ice ; with the third he stepped over its peaks , and sank wearily down at North Wind 's knees .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 8]: For there she sat on her doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 29]: The peaks of the great ridge of ice were as lofty as ever behind her , and the country at her back had vanished from Diamond 's view .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 11]: North Wind was as still as Diamond had left her .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 23]: Her pale face was white as the snow , and her motionless eyes were as blue as the caverns in the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 20]: But the instant Diamond touched her , her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 11]: Light began to glimmer from the blue of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 21]: A moment more , and she laid her hand on Diamond 's head , and began playing with his hair .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 14]: Diamond took hold of her hand , and laid his face to it .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: She gave a little start .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 10]: `` How very alive you are , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 7]: `` Come nearer to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 21]: By the help of the stones all around he clambered up beside her , and laid himself against her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 24]: She gave a great sigh , slowly lifted her arms , and slowly folded them about him , until she clasped him close .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 30]: Yet a moment , and she roused herself , and came quite awake ; and the cold of her bosom , which had pierced Diamond 's bones , vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 18]: `` Have you been sitting here ever since I went through you , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 7]: asked Diamond , stroking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' she answered , looking at him with her old kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 8]: `` Ai n't you very tired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 11]: `` No ; I 've often had to sit longer .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: Do you know how long you have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: years and years , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 13]: `` You have just been seven days , '' returned North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 11]: `` I thought I had been a hundred years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 3]: exclaimed Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: `` Yes , I daresay , '' replied North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 24]: `` You 've been away from here seven days ; but how long you may have been in there is quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 12]: Behind my back and before my face things are so different !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 12]: They do n't go at all by the same rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 15]: `` I 'm very glad , '' said Diamond , after thinking a while .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 4]: asked North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 20]: `` Because I 've been such a long time there , and such a little while away from mother .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 14]: Why , she wo n't be expecting me home from Sandwich yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 8]: But we must n't talk any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 18]: I 've got my orders now , and we must be off in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 11]: Next moment Diamond found himself sitting alone on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 5]: North Wind had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 28]: A creature like a great humble-bee or cockchafer flew past his face ; but it could be neither , for there were no insects amongst the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 41]: It passed him again and again , flying in circles around him , and he concluded that it must be North Wind herself , no bigger than Tom Thumb when his mother put him in the nutshell lined with flannel .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 9]: But she was no longer vapoury and thin .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: She was solid , although tiny .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 11]: A moment more , and she perched on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 34]: `` Come along , Diamond , '' she said in his ear , in the smallest and highest of treble voices ; `` it is time we were setting out for Sandwich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 35]: Diamond could just see her , by turning his head towards his shoulder as far as he could , but only with one eye , for his nose came between her and the other .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 14]: `` Wo n't you take me in your arms and carry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 21]: he said in a whisper , for he knew she did not like a loud voice when she was small .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 19]: you ungrateful boy , '' returned North Wind , smiling `` how dare you make game of me ?
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: Yes , I will carry you , but you shall walk a bit for your impertinence first .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 38]: She jumped from his shoulder , but when Diamond looked for her upon the ground , he could see nothing but a little spider with long legs that made its way over the ice towards the south .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 24]: It ran very fast indeed for a spider , but Diamond ran a long way before it , and then waited for it .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: It was up with him sooner than he had expected , however , and it had grown a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 59]: And the spider grew and grew and went faster and faster , till all at once Diamond discovered that it was not a spider , but a weasel ; and away glided the weasel , and away went Diamond after it , and it took all the run there was in him to keep up with the weasel .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 28]: And the weasel grew , and grew , and grew , till all at once Diamond saw that the weasel was not a weasel but a cat .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 11]: And away went the cat , and Diamond after it .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 28]: And when he had run half a mile , he found the cat waiting for him , sitting up and washing her face not to lose time .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 12]: And away went the cat again , and Diamond after it .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 22]: But the next time he came up with the cat , the cat was not a cat , but a hunting-leopard .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 15]: And the hunting-leopard grew to a jaguar , all covered with spots like eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 9]: And the jaguar grew to a Bengal tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 34]: And at none of them was Diamond afraid , for he had been at North Wind 's back , and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 40]: And the tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south , growing less and less to Diamond 's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness ; and then it vanished altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 22]: And now Diamond felt that he would rather not run any farther , and that the ice had got very rough .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 63]: Besides , he was near the precipices that bounded the sea , so he slackened his pace to a walk , saying aloud to himself : `` When North Wind has punished me enough for making game of her , she will come back to me ; I know she will , for I ca n't go much farther without her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 5]: `` You dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 6]: It was only in fun .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 5]: Here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 8]: said North Wind 's voice behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 22]: Diamond turned , and saw her as he liked best to see her , standing beside him , a tall lady .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: `` Where 's the tiger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 20]: he asked , for he knew all the creatures from a picture book that Miss Coleman had given him .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 16]: `` But , of course , '' he added , `` you were the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 6]: I was puzzled and forgot .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 18]: I saw it such a long way off before me , and there you were behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: It 's so odd , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 15]: `` It must look very odd to you , Diamond : I see that .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 18]: But it is no more odd to me than to break an old pine in two . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: `` Well , that 's odd enough , '' remarked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 5]: `` So it is !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 3]: I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 22]: Well , none of these things are odder to me than it is to you to eat bread and butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 18]: `` Well , that 's odd too , when I think of it , '' persisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: `` I should just like a slice of bread and butter !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 28]: I 'm afraid to say how long it is -- how long it seems to me , that is -- since I had anything to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 16]: `` Come then , '' said North Wind , stooping and holding out her arms .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 11]: `` You shall have some bread and butter very soon .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 10]: I am glad to find you want some . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 16]: Diamond held up his arms to meet hers , and was safe upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 7]: North Wind bounded into the air .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 61]: Her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter ; and with a roar from her hair and an answering roar from one of the great glaciers beside them , whose slow torrent tumbled two or three icebergs at once into the waves at their feet , North Wind and Diamond went flying southwards .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 40]: WHO MET DIAMOND AT SANDWICH As THEY flew , so fast they went that the sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk , blue shot with grey , and green shot with purple .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 30]: They went so fast that the stars themselves appeared to sail away past them overhead , `` like golden boats , '' on a blue sea turned upside down .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 27]: And they went so fast that Diamond himself went the other way as fast -- I mean he went fast asleep in North Wind 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 25]: When he woke , a face was bending over him ; but it was not North Wind 's ; it was his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 20]: He put out his arms to her , and she clasped him to her bosom and burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 11]: Diamond kissed her again and again to make her stop .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 17]: Perhaps kissing is the best thing for crying , but it will not always stop it .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 8]: `` Oh , Diamond , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: you have been so ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 6]: `` No , mother dear .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 16]: I 've only been at the back of the north wind , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 12]: `` I thought you were dead , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 8]: But that moment the doctor came in .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 3]: there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 17]: said the doctor with gentle cheerfulness ; `` we 're better to-day , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 34]: Then he drew the mother aside , and told her not to talk to Diamond , or to mind what he might say ; for he must be kept as quiet as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 52]: And indeed Diamond was not much inclined to talk , for he felt very strange and weak , which was little wonder , seeing that all the time he had been away he had only sucked a few lumps of ice , and there could not be much nourishment in them .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 40]: Now while he is lying there , getting strong again with chicken broth and other nice things , I will tell my readers what had been taking place at his home , for they ought to be told it .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 16]: They may have forgotten that Miss Coleman was in a very poor state of health .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 8]: Now there were three reasons for this .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 11]: In the first place , her lungs were not strong .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 19]: In the second place , there was a gentleman somewhere who had not behaved very well to her .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: In the third place , she had not anything particular to do .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 14]: These three nots together are enough to make a lady very ill indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 38]: Of course she could not help the first cause ; but if the other two causes had not existed , that would have been of little consequence ; she would only have to be a little careful .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 38]: The second she could not help quite ; but if she had had anything to do , and had done it well , it would have been very difficult for any man to behave badly to her .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 39]: And for this third cause of her illness , if she had had anything to do that was worth doing , she might have borne his bad behaviour so that even that would not have made her ill .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 40]: It is not always easy , I confess , to find something to do that is worth doing , but the most difficult things are constantly being done , and she might have found something if she had tried .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 12]: Her fault lay in this , that she had not tried .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 21]: But , to be sure , her father and mother were to blame that they had never set her going .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 22]: Only then again , nobody had told her father and mother that they ought to set her going in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 19]: So as none of them would find it out of themselves , North Wind had to teach them .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 19]: We know that North Wind was very busy that night on which she left Diamond in the cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 20]: She had in a sense been blowing through and through the Colemans ' house the whole of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 39]: First , Miss Coleman 's maid had left a chink of her mistress 's window open , thinking she had shut it , and North Wind had wound a few of her hairs round the lady 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 8]: She was considerably worse the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 17]: Again , the ship which North Wind had sunk that very night belonged to Mr. Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 30]: Nor will my readers understand what a heavy loss this was to him until I have informed them that he had been getting poorer and poorer for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 34]: He was not so successful in his speculations as he had been , for he speculated a great deal more than was right , and it was time he should be pulled up .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 44]: It is a hard thing for a rich man to grow poor ; but it is an awful thing for him to grow dishonest , and some kinds of speculation lead a man deep into dishonesty before he thinks what he is about .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 68]: Poverty will not make a man worthless -- he may be worth a great deal more when he is poor than he was when he was rich ; but dishonesty goes very far indeed to make a man of no value -- a thing to be thrown out in the dust-hole of the creation , like a bit of a broken basin , or a dirty rag .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 20]: So North Wind had to look after Mr. Coleman , and try to make an honest man of him .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 25]: So she sank the ship which was his last venture , and he was what himself and his wife and the world called ruined .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 6]: Nor was this all yet .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 58]: For on board that vessel Miss Coleman 's lover was a passenger ; and when the news came that the vessel had gone down , and that all on board had perished , we may be sure she did not think the loss of their fine house and garden and furniture the greatest misfortune in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 15]: Of course , the trouble did not end with Mr. Coleman and his family .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: Nobody can suffer alone .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 67]: When the cause of suffering is most deeply hidden in the heart , and nobody knows anything about it but the man himself , he must be a great and a good man indeed , such as few of us have known , if the pain inside him does not make him behave so as to cause all about him to be more or less uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 34]: But when a man brings money-troubles on himself by making haste to be rich , then most of the people he has to do with must suffer in the same way with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 51]: The elm-tree which North Wind blew down that very night , as if small and great trials were to be gathered in one heap , crushed Miss Coleman 's pretty summer-house : just so the fall of Mr. Coleman crushed the little family that lived over his coach-house and stable .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 20]: Before Diamond was well enough to be taken home , there was no home for him to go to .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 28]: Mr. Coleman -- or his creditors , for I do not know the particulars -- had sold house , carriage , horses , furniture , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 40]: He and his wife and daughter and Mrs. Crump had gone to live in a small house in Hoxton , where he would be unknown , and whence he could walk to his place of business in the City .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 16]: For he was not an old man , and hoped yet to retrieve his fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 31]: Let us hope that he lived to retrieve his honesty , the tail of which had slipped through his fingers to the very last joint , if not beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 34]: Of course , Diamond 's father had nothing to do for a time , but it was not so hard for him to have nothing to do as it was for Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 36]: He wrote to his wife that , if her sister would keep her there till he got a place , it would be better for them , and he would be greatly obliged to her .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 23]: Meantime , the gentleman who had bought the house had allowed his furniture to remain where it was for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 15]: Diamond 's aunt was quite willing to keep them as long as she could .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 14]: And indeed Diamond was not yet well enough to be moved with safety .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 47]: When he had recovered so far as to be able to go out , one day his mother got her sister 's husband , who had a little pony-cart , to carry them down to the sea-shore , and leave them there for a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 20]: He had some business to do further on at Ramsgate , and would pick them up as he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 34]: A whiff of the sea-air would do them both good , she said , and she thought besides she could best tell Diamond what had happened if she had him quite to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: THE SEASIDE DIAMOND and his mother sat down upon the edge of the rough grass that bordered the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 20]: The sun was just far enough past its highest not to shine in their eyes when they looked eastward .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 25]: A sweet little wind blew on their left side , and comforted the mother without letting her know what it was that comforted her .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 48]: Away before them stretched the sparkling waters of the ocean , every wave of which flashed out its own delight back in the face of the great sun , which looked down from the stillness of its blue house with glorious silent face upon its flashing children .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 13]: On each hand the shore rounded outwards , forming a little bay .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 31]: There were no white cliffs here , as further north and south , and the place was rather dreary , but the sky got at them so much the better .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 11]: Not a house , not a creature was within sight .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 25]: Dry sand was about their feet , and under them thin wiry grass , that just managed to grow out of the poverty-stricken shore .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 18]: said Diamond 's mother , with a deep sigh , `` it 's a sad world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 7]: `` I did n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 8]: `` How should you know , child ?
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 13]: You 've been too well taken care of , I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , I have , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 9]: I thought you were taken care of too .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 9]: I thought my father took care of you .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 7]: I will ask him about it .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 8]: I think he must have forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 5]: `` Dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 16]: said his mother , `` your father 's the best man in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 6]: `` So I thought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 5]: returned Diamond with triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 7]: `` I was sure of it !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 14]: -- Well , does n't he take very good care of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 17]: `` Yes , yes , he does , '' answered his mother , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 10]: `` But who 's to take care of him ?
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 19]: And how is he to take care of us if he 's got nothing to eat himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: said Diamond with a gasp ; `` has n't he got anything to eat ?
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: I must go home to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: `` No , no , child .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 8]: He 's not come to that yet .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 14]: But what 's to become of us , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 8]: `` Are you very hungry , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 5]: There 's the basket .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 11]: I thought you put something to eat in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 6]: `` O you darling stupid !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 18]: I did n't say I was hungry , '' returned his mother , smiling through her tears .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 14]: `` Then I do n't understand you at all , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 10]: `` Do tell me what 's the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 16]: `` There are people in the world who have nothing to eat , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 13]: `` Then I suppose they do n't stop in it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 15]: They -- they -- what you call -- die -- do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 6]: `` Yes , they do .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 7]: How would you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 4]: I never tried .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 13]: But I suppose they go where they get something to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 16]: `` Like enough they do n't want it , '' said his mother , petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 23]: `` That 's all right then , '' said Diamond , thinking I daresay more than he chose to put in words .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 5]: `` Is it though ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 3]: Poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: how little you know about things !
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 28]: Mr. Coleman 's lost all his money , and your father has nothing to do , and we shall have nothing to eat by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 8]: `` Are you sure , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 6]: `` Sure of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 11]: `` Sure that we shall have nothing to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 6]: `` No , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: I 'm not sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 5]: I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 10]: `` Then I ca n't understand it , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 14]: There 's a piece of gingerbread in the basket , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 6]: `` O you little bird !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 29]: You have no more sense than a sparrow that picks what it wants , and never thinks of the winter and the frost and , the snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: `` Ah -- yes -- I see .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 13]: But the birds get through the winter , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: `` Some of them fall dead on the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 7]: `` They must die some time .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 9]: They would n't like to be birds always .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: Would you , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 8]: `` What a child it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 9]: thought his mother , but she said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: now I remember , '' Diamond went on .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 52]: `` Father told me that day I went to Epping Forest with him , that the rose-bushes , and the may-bushes , and the holly-bushes were the bird 's barns , for there were the hips , and the haws , and the holly-berries , all ready for the winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 9]: `` Yes ; that 's all very true .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 9]: So you see the birds are provided for .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 14]: But there are no such barns for you and me , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 6]: `` Ai n't there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 10]: We 've got to work for our bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 15]: `` Then let 's go and work , '' said Diamond , getting up .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 6]: `` It 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 9]: We 've not got anything to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 7]: `` Then let 's wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 7]: `` Then we shall starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 5]: There 's the basket .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 17]: Do you know , mother , I think I shall call that basket the barn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 9]: `` It 's not a very big one .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 12]: And when it 's empty -- where are we then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 11]: `` At auntie 's cupboard , '' returned Diamond promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 18]: `` But we ca n't eat auntie 's things all up and leave her to starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 9]: We 'll go back to father before that .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 12]: He 'll have found a cupboard somewhere by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: `` I do n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 18]: But I have n't got even a cupboard , and I 've always had plenty to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 13]: I 've heard you say I had too much , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 19]: `` But I tell you that 's because I 've had a cupboard for you , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 12]: `` And when yours was empty , auntie opened hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 9]: `` But that ca n't go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 6]: `` How do you know ?
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 25]: I think there must be a big cupboard somewhere , out of which the little cupboards are filled , you know , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 19]: `` Well , I wish I could find the door of that cupboard , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 15]: But the same moment she stopped , and was silent for a good while .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: I can not tell whether Diamond knew what she was thinking , but I think I know .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 45]: She had heard something at church the day before , which came back upon her -- something like this , that she had n't to eat for tomorrow as well as for to-day ; and that what was not wanted could n't be missed .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 25]: So , instead of saying anything more , she stretched out her hand for the basket , and she and Diamond had their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: And Diamond did enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 34]: For the drive and the fresh air had made him quite hungry ; and he did not , like his mother , trouble himself about what they should dine off that day week .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 50]: The fact was he had lived so long without any food at all at the back of the north wind , that he knew quite well that food was not essential to existence ; that in fact , under certain circumstances , people could live without it well enough .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 10]: His mother did not speak much during their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 25]: After it was over she helped him to walk about a little , but he was not able for much and soon got tired .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 8]: He did not get fretful , though .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 22]: He was too glad of having the sun and the wind again , to fret because he could not run about .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 17]: He lay down on the dry sand , and his mother covered him with a shawl .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 17]: She then sat by his side , and took a bit of work from her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 18]: But Diamond felt rather sleepy , and turned on his side and gazed sleepily over the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: A few yards off he saw something fluttering .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 8]: `` What is that , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 11]: `` Only a bit of paper , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 18]: `` It flutters more than a bit of paper would , I think , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 15]: `` I 'll go and see if you like , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 10]: `` My eyes are none of the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 26]: So she rose and went and found that they were both right , for it was a little book , partly buried in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 24]: But several of its leaves were clear of the sand , and these the wind kept blowing about in a very flutterful manner .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 10]: She took it up and brought it to Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 8]: `` What is it , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 12]: `` Some nursery rhymes , I think , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 10]: `` I 'm too sleepy , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 10]: `` Do read some of them to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 14]: `` Yes , I will , '' she said , and began one .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 9]: -- `` But this is such nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 4]: she said again .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 11]: `` I will try to find a better one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 26]: She turned the leaves searching , but three times , with sudden puffs , the wind blew the leaves rustling back to the same verses .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 22]: `` Do read that one , '' said Diamond , who seemed to be of the same mind as the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 6]: `` It sounded very nice .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: I am sure it is a good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 19]: So his mother thought it might amuse him , though she could n't find any sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 13]: She never thought he might understand it , although she could not .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 26]: Now I do not exactly know what the mother read , but this is what Diamond heard , or thought afterwards that he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 13]: He was , however , as I have said , very sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 17]: And when he thought he understood the verses he may have been only dreaming better ones .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 887]: This is how they went -- I know a river whose waters run asleep run run ever singing in the shallows dumb in the hollows sleeping so deep and all the swallows that dip their feathers in the hollows or in the shallows are the merriest swallows of all for the nests they bake with the clay they cake with the water they shake from their wings that rake the water out of the shallows or the hollows will hold together in any weather and so the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the merriest children and are built so narrow like the head of an arrow to cut the air and go just where the nicest water is flowing and the nicest dust is blowing for each so narrow like head of an arrow is only a barrow to carry the mud he makes from the nicest water flowing and the nicest dust that is blowing to build his nest for her he loves best with the nicest cakes which the sunshine bakes all for their merry children all so callow with beaks that follow gaping and hollow wider and wider after their father or after their mother the food-provider who brings them a spider or a worm the poor hider down in the earth so there 's no dearth for their beaks as yellow as the buttercups growing beside the flowing of the singing river always and ever growing and blowing for fast as the sheep awake or asleep crop them and crop them they can not stop them but up they creep and on they go blowing and so with the daisies the little white praises they grow and they blow and they spread out their crown and they praise the sun and when he goes down their praising is done and they fold up their crown and they sleep every one till over the plain he 's shining amain and they 're at it again praising and praising such low songs raising that no one hears them but the sun who rears them and the sheep that bite them are the quietest sheep awake or asleep with the merriest bleat and the little lambs are the merriest lambs they forget to eat for the frolic in their feet and the lambs and their dams are the whitest sheep with the woolliest wool and the longest wool and the trailingest tails and they shine like snow in the grasses that grow by the singing river that sings for ever and the sheep and the lambs are merry for ever because the river sings and they drink it and the lambs and their dams are quiet and white because of their diet for what they bite is buttercups yellow and daisies white and grass as green as the river can make it with wind as mellow to kiss it and shake it as never was seen but here in the hollows beside the river where all the swallows are merriest of fellows for the nests they make with the clay they cake in the sunshine bake till they are like bone as dry in the wind as a marble stone so firm they bind the grass in the clay that dries in the wind the sweetest wind that blows by the river flowing for ever but never you find whence comes the wind that blows on the hollows and over the shallows where dip the swallows alive it blows the life as it goes awake or asleep into the river that sings as it flows and the life it blows into the sheep awake or asleep with the woolliest wool and the trailingest tails and it never fails gentle and cool to wave the wool and to toss the grass as the lambs and the sheep over it pass and tug and bite with their teeth so white and then with the sweep of their trailing tails smooth it again and it grows amain and amain it grows and the wind as it blows tosses the swallows over the hollows and down on the shallows till every feather doth shake and quiver and all their feathers go all together blowing the life and the joy so rife into the swallows that skim the shallows and have the yellowest children for the wind that blows is the life of the river flowing for ever that washes the grasses still as it passes and feeds the daisies the little white praises and buttercups bonny so golden and sunny with butter and honey that whiten the sheep awake or asleep that nibble and bite and grow whiter than white and merry and quiet on the sweet diet fed by the river and tossed for ever by the wind that tosses the swallow that crosses over the shallows dipping his wings to gather the water and bake the cake that the wind shall make as hard as a bone as dry as a stone it 's all in the wind that blows from behind and all in the river that flows for ever and all in the grasses and the white daisies and the merry sheep awake or asleep and the happy swallows skimming the shallows and it 's all in the wind that blows from behind .
