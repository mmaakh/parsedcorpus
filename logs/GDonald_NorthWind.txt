Parsing [sent. 1 len. 28]: AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND By George Mac Donald Author of `` Dealings with Fairies , '' `` Ranald Bannerman , '' etc. , etc. .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 3]: CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 17]: THE HAY-LOFT I HAVE been asked to tell you about the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 28]: An old Greek writer mentions a people who lived there , and were so comfortable that they could not bear it any longer , and drowned themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 9]: My story is not the same as his .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 14]: I do not think Herodotus had got the right account of the place .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 16]: I am going to tell you how it fared with a boy who went there .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 32]: He lived in a low room over a coach-house ; and that was not by any means at the back of the north wind , as his mother very well knew .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 30]: For one side of the room was built only of boards , and the boards were so old that you might run a penknife through into the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 12]: And then let them settle between them which was the sharper !
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 39]: I know that when you pulled it out again the wind would be after it like a cat after a mouse , and you would know soon enough you were not at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 46]: Still , this room was not very cold , except when the north wind blew stronger than usual : the room I have to do with now was always cold , except in summer , when the sun took the matter into his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 35]: Indeed , I am not sure whether I ought to call it a room at all ; for it was just a loft where they kept hay and straw and oats for the horses .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 69]: And when little Diamond -- but stop : I must tell you that his father , who was a coachman , had named him after a favourite horse , and his mother had had no objection : -- when little Diamond , then , lay there in bed , he could hear the horses under him munching away in the dark , or moving sleepily in their dreams .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 69]: For Diamond 's father had built him a bed in the loft with boards all round it , because they had so little room in their own end over the coach-house ; and Diamond 's father put old Diamond in the stall under the bed , because he was a quiet horse , and did not go to sleep standing , but lay down like a reasonable creature .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 77]: But , although he was a surprisingly reasonable creature , yet , when young Diamond woke in the middle of the night , and felt the bed shaking in the blasts of the north wind , he could not help wondering whether , if the wind should blow the house down , and he were to fall through into the manger , old Diamond might n't eat him up before he knew him in his night-gown .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 56]: And although old Diamond was very quiet all night long , yet when he woke he got up like an earthquake , and then young Diamond knew what o'clock it was , or at least what was to be done next , which was -- to go to sleep again as fast as he could .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 22]: There was hay at his feet and hay at his head , piled up in great trusses to the very roof .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 34]: Indeed it was sometimes only through a little lane with several turnings , which looked as if it had been sawn out for him , that he could reach his bed at all .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 23]: For the stock of hay was , of course , always in a state either of slow ebb or of sudden flow .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 54]: Sometimes the whole space of the loft , with the little panes in the roof for the stars to look in , would lie open before his open eyes as he lay in bed ; sometimes a yellow wall of sweet-smelling fibres closed up his view at the distance of half a yard .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 82]: Sometimes , when his mother had undressed him in her room , and told him to trot to bed by himself , he would creep into the heart of the hay , and lie there thinking how cold it was outside in the wind , and how warm it was inside there in his bed , and how he could go to it when he pleased , only he would n't just yet ; he would get a little colder first .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 48]: And ever as he grew colder , his bed would grow warmer , till at last he would scramble out of the hay , shoot like an arrow into his bed , cover himself up , and snuggle down , thinking what a happy boy he was .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 25]: He had not the least idea that the wind got in at a chink in the wall , and blew about him all night .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 26]: For the back of his bed was only of boards an inch thick , and on the other side of them was the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 15]: Now , as I have already said , these boards were soft and crumbly .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 23]: To be sure , they were tarred on the outside , yet in many places they were more like tinder than timber .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 53]: Hence it happened that the soft part having worn away from about it , little Diamond found one night , after he lay down , that a knot had come out of one of them , and that the wind was blowing in upon him in a cold and rather imperious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 59]: Now he had no fancy for leaving things wrong that might be set right ; so he jumped out of bed again , got a little strike of hay , twisted it up , folded it in the middle , and , having thus made it into a cork , stuck it into the hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 50]: But the wind began to blow loud and angrily , and , as Diamond was falling asleep , out blew his cork and hit him on the nose , just hard enough to wake him up quite , and let him hear the wind whistling shrill in the hole .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 26]: He searched for his hay-cork , found it , stuck it in harder , and was just dropping off once more , when , pop !
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 19]: with an angry whistle behind it , the cork struck him again , this time on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 19]: Up he rose once more , made a fresh stopple of hay , and corked the hole severely .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 10]: But he was hardly down again before -- pop !
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: it came on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 18]: He gave it up , drew the clothes above his head , and was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 49]: Although the next day was very stormy , Diamond forgot all about the hole , for he was busy making a cave by the side of his mother 's fire with a broken chair , a three-legged stool , and a blanket , and then sitting in it .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 39]: His mother , however , discovered it , and pasted a bit of brown paper over it , so that , when Diamond had snuggled down the next night , he had no occasion to think of it .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 11]: Presently , however , he lifted his head and listened .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 8]: Who could that be talking to him ?
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 18]: The wind was rising again , and getting very loud , and full of rushes and whistles .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 18]: He was sure some one was talking -- and very near him , too , it was .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 23]: But he was not frightened , for he had not yet learned how to be ; so he sat up and hearkened .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 26]: At last the voice , which , though quite gentle , sounded a little angry , appeared to come from the back of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 14]: He crept nearer to it , and laid his ear against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 14]: Then he heard nothing but the wind , which sounded very loud indeed .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 25]: The moment , however , that he moved his head from the wall , he heard the voice again , close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: He felt about with his hand , and came upon the piece of paper his mother had pasted over the hole .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 16]: Against this he laid his ear , and then he heard the voice quite distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 30]: There was , in fact , a little corner of the paper loose , and through that , as from a mouth in the wall , the voice came .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 15]: `` What do you mean , little boy -- closing up my window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 5]: `` What window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 11]: `` You stuffed hay into it three times last night .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 11]: I had to blow it out again three times . ''
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 9]: `` You ca n't mean this little hole !
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 15]: It is n't a window ; it 's a hole in my bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 18]: `` I did not say it was a window : I said it was my window . ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 19]: `` But it ca n't be a window , because windows are holes to see out of . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: `` Well , that 's just what I made this window for . ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 14]: `` But you are outside : you ca n't want a window . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 6]: `` You are quite mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 10]: Windows are to see out of , you say .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 19]: Well , I 'm in my house , and I want windows to see out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 12]: `` But you 've made a window into my bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 23]: `` Well , your mother has got three windows into my dancing room , and you have three into my garret . ''
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 38]: `` But I heard father say , when my mother wanted him to make a window through the wall , that it was against the law , for it would look into Mr. Dyves 's garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 4]: The voice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 12]: `` The law would have some trouble to catch me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 3]: it said .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 21]: `` But if it 's not right , you know , '' said Diamond , `` that 's no matter .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 7]: You should n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 16]: `` I am so tall I am above that law , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 14]: `` You must have a tall house , then , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 14]: `` Yes ; a tall house : the clouds are inside it . ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 8]: said Diamond , and thought a minute .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 21]: `` I think , then , you can hardly expect me to keep a window in my bed for you .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 14]: Why do n't you make a window into Mr. Dyves 's bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 17]: `` Nobody makes a window into an ash-pit , '' said the voice , rather sadly .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 13]: `` I like to see nice things out of my windows . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 29]: `` But he must have a nicer bed than I have , though mine is very nice -- so nice that I could n't wish a better . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 17]: `` It 's not the bed I care about : it 's what is in it .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 9]: -- But you just open that window . ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 17]: `` Well , mother says I should n't be disobliging ; but it 's rather hard .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 16]: You see the north wind will blow right in my face if I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 8]: `` I am the North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 4]: `` O-o-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 5]: said Diamond , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 18]: `` Then will you promise not to blow on my face if I open your window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 8]: `` I ca n't promise that . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 9]: `` But you 'll give me the toothache .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 7]: Mother 's got it already . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 13]: `` But what 's to become of me without a window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 9]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 16]: All I say is , it will be worse for me than for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 7]: `` No ; it will not .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 14]: You shall not be the worse for it -- I promise you that .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 9]: You will be much the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 15]: Just you believe what I say , and do as I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 41]: `` Well , I can pull the clothes over my head , '' said Diamond , and feeling with his little sharp nails , he got hold of the open edge of the paper and tore it off at once .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 16]: In came a long whistling spear of cold , and struck his little naked chest .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 85]: He scrambled and tumbled in under the bedclothes , and covered himself up : there was no paper now between him and the voice , and he felt a little -- not frightened exactly -- I told you he had not learned that yet -- but rather queer ; for what a strange person this North Wind must be that lived in the great house -- `` called Out-of-Doors , I suppose , '' thought Diamond -- and made windows into people 's beds !
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 22]: But the voice began again ; and he could hear it quite plainly , even with his head under the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 33]: It was a still more gentle voice now , although six times as large and loud as it had been , and he thought it sounded a little like his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 10]: `` What is your name , little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 3]: it asked .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 11]: `` Diamond , '' answered Diamond , under the bed-clothes .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 7]: `` What a funny name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 13]: `` It 's a very nice name , '' returned its owner .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 12]: `` I do n't know that , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 14]: `` Well , I do , '' retorted Diamond , a little rudely .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 11]: `` Do you know to whom you are speaking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: And indeed he did not .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 17]: For to know a person 's name is not always to know the person 's self .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 10]: `` Then I must not be angry with you .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 11]: -- You had better look and see , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 21]: `` Diamond is a very pretty name , '' persisted the boy , vexed that it should not give satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 13]: `` Diamond is a useless thing rather , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: `` That 's not true .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 16]: Diamond is very nice -- as big as two -- and so quiet all night !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 19]: And does n't he make a jolly row in the morning , getting upon his four great legs !
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 6]: It 's like thunder . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 13]: `` You do n't seem to know what a diamond is . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 8]: `` Oh , do n't I just !
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 15]: Diamond is a great and good horse ; and he sleeps right under me .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 54]: He is old Diamond , and I am young Diamond ; or , if you like it better , for you 're very particular , Mr. North Wind , he 's big Diamond , and I 'm little Diamond ; and I do n't know which of us my father likes best . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 25]: A beautiful laugh , large but very soft and musical , sounded somewhere beside him , but Diamond kept his head under the clothes .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 13]: `` I 'm not Mr. North Wind , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 15]: `` You told me that you were the North Wind , '' insisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 14]: `` I did not say Mister North Wind , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 19]: `` Well , then , I do ; for mother tells me I ought to be polite . ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 23]: `` Then let me tell you I do n't think it at all polite of you to say Mister to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 9]: `` Well , I did n't know better .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 6]: I 'm very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 9]: `` But you ought to know better . ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 8]: `` I do n't know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 34]: You ca n't say it 's polite to lie there talking -- with your head under the bed-clothes , and never look up to see what kind of person you are talking to .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 11]: -- I want you to come out with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 31]: `` I want to go to sleep , '' said Diamond , very nearly crying , for he did not like to be scolded , even when he deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 11]: `` You shall sleep all the better to-morrow night . ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 24]: `` Besides , '' said Diamond , `` you are out in Mr. Dyves 's garden , and I ca n't get there .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 10]: I can only get into our own yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 12]: `` Will you take your head out of the bed-clothes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 9]: said the voice , just a little angrily .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 9]: answered Diamond , half peevish , half frightened .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 27]: The instant he said the word , a tremendous blast of wind crashed in a board of the wall , and swept the clothes off Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 6]: He started up in terror .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 15]: Leaning over him was the large , beautiful , pale face of a woman .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 35]: Her dark eyes looked a little angry , for they had just begun to flash ; but a quivering in her sweet upper lip made her look as if she were going to cry .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 98]: What was the most strange was that away from her head streamed out her black hair in every direction , so that the darkness in the hay-loft looked as if it were made of her , hair but as Diamond gazed at her in speechless amazement , mingled with confidence -- for the boy was entranced with her mighty beauty -- her hair began to gather itself out of the darkness , and fell down all about her again , till her face looked out of the midst of it like a moon out of a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 29]: From her eyes came all the light by which Diamond saw her face and her , hair ; and that was all he did see of her yet .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 7]: The wind was over and gone .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 12]: `` Will you go with me now , you little Diamond ?
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 18]: I am sorry I was forced to be so rough with you , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 19]: `` I will ; yes , I will , '' answered Diamond , holding out both his arms .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 18]: `` But , '' he added , dropping them , `` how shall I get my clothes ?
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 14]: They are in mother 's room , and the door is locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 8]: `` Oh , never mind your clothes .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 6]: You will not be cold .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 7]: I shall take care of that .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 9]: Nobody is cold with the north wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 10]: `` I thought everybody was , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 7]: `` That is a great mistake .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 7]: Most people make it , however .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 17]: They are cold because they are not with the north wind , but without it . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 26]: If Diamond had been a little older , and had supposed himself a good deal wiser , he would have thought the lady was joking .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 20]: But he was not older , and did not fancy himself wiser , and therefore understood her well enough .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 7]: Again he stretched out his arms .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 9]: The lady 's face drew back a little .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 10]: `` Follow me , Diamond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said Diamond , only a little ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 7]: `` You 're not afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: said the North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 33]: `` No , ma'am ; but mother never would let me go without shoes : she never said anything about clothes , so I dare say she would n't mind that . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 13]: `` I know your mother very well , '' said the lady .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: `` She is a good woman .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 6]: I have visited her often .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 9]: I was with her when you were born .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 10]: I saw her laugh and cry both at once .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: I love your mother , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 15]: `` How was it you did not know my name , then , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 12]: Please am I to say ma'am to you , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 10]: `` One question at a time , dear boy .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 19]: I knew your name quite well , but I wanted to hear what you would say for it .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 24]: Do n't you remember that day when the man was finding fault with your name -- how I blew the window in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes , '' answered Diamond , eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 14]: `` Our window opens like a door , right over the coach-house door .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 71]: And the wind -- you , ma'am -- came in , and blew the Bible out of the man 's hands , and the leaves went all flutter , flutter on the floor , and my mother picked it up and gave it back to him open , and there -- '' `` Was your name in the Bible -- the sixth stone in the high priest 's breastplate . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 8]: -- a stone , was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 13]: `` I thought it had been a horse -- I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 10]: A horse is better than a stone any day .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 15]: Well , you see , I know all about you and your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 7]: I will go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 15]: `` Now for the next question : you 're not to call me ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 19]: You must call me just my own name -- respectfully , you know -- just North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 23]: `` Well , please , North Wind , you are so beautiful , I am quite ready to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 18]: `` You must not be ready to go with everything beautiful all at once , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 10]: `` But what 's beautiful ca n't be bad .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 9]: You 're not bad , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 8]: `` No ; I 'm not bad .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 23]: But sometimes beautiful things grow bad by doing bad , and it takes some time for their badness to spoil their beauty .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 17]: So little boys may be mistaken if they go after things because they are beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 18]: `` Well , I will go with you because you are beautiful and good , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 33]: `` Ah , but there 's another thing , Diamond : -- What if I should look ugly without being bad -- look ugly myself because I am making ugly things beautiful ?
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 5]: -- What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 11]: `` I do n't quite understand you , North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 7]: You tell me what then . ''
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 8]: `` Well , I will tell you .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 15]: If you see me with my face all black , do n't be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 23]: If you see me flapping wings like a bat 's , as big as the whole sky , do n't be frightened .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 48]: If you hear me raging ten times worse than Mrs. Bill , the blacksmith 's wife -- even if you see me looking in at people 's windows like Mrs. Eve Dropper , the gardener 's wife -- you must believe that I am doing my work .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 39]: Nay , Diamond , if I change into a serpent or a tiger , you must not let go your hold of me , for my hand will never change in yours if you keep a good hold .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 34]: If you keep a hold , you will know who I am all the time , even when you look at me and ca n't see me the least like the North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 7]: I may look something very awful .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 5]: Do you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 9]: `` Quite well , '' said little Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 19]: `` Come along , then , '' said North Wind , and disappeared behind the mountain of hay .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 9]: Diamond crept out of bed and followed her .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 18]: THE LAWN WHEN Diamond got round the corner of the hay , for a moment he hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 44]: The stair by which he would naturally have gone down to the door was at the other side of the loft , and looked very black indeed ; for it was full of North Wind 's hair , as she descended before him .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 29]: And just beside him was the ladder going straight down into the stable , up which his father always came to fetch the hay for Diamond 's dinner .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 25]: Through the opening in the floor the faint gleam of the-stable lantern was enticing , and Diamond thought he would run down that way .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 14]: The stair went close past the loose-box in which Diamond the horse lived .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 27]: When Diamond the boy was half-way down , he remembered that it was of no use to go this way , for the stable-door was locked .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 44]: But at the same moment there was horse Diamond 's great head poked out of his box on to the ladder , for he knew boy Diamond although he was in his night-gown , and wanted him to pull his ears for him .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 60]: This Diamond did very gently for a minute or so , and patted and stroked his neck too , and kissed the big horse , and had begun to take the bits of straw and hay out of his mane , when all at once he recollected that the Lady North Wind was waiting for him in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 28]: `` Good night , Diamond , '' he said , and darted up the ladder , across the loft , and down the stair to the door .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 14]: But when he got out into the yard , there was no lady .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 16]: Now it is always a dreadful thing to think there is somebody and find nobody .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 26]: Children in particular have not made up their minds to it ; they generally cry at nobody , especially when they wake up at night .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 29]: But it was an especial disappointment to Diamond , for his little heart had been beating with joy : the face of the North Wind was so grand !
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 17]: To have a lady like that for a friend -- with such long hair , too !
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 11]: Why , it was longer than twenty Diamonds ' tails !
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 4]: She was gone .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 17]: And there he stood , with his bare feet on the stones of the paved yard .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 13]: It was a clear night overhead , and the stars were shining .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 15]: Orion in particular was making the most of his bright belt and golden sword .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 10]: But the moon was only a poor thin crescent .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 57]: There was just one great , jagged , black and gray cloud in the sky , with a steep side to it like a precipice ; and the moon was against this side , and looked as if she had tumbled off the top of the cloud-hill , and broken herself in rolling down the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 19]: She did not seem comfortable , for she was looking down into the deep pit waiting for her .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 17]: At least that was what Diamond thought as he stood for a moment staring at her .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 46]: But he was quite wrong , for the moon was not afraid , and there was no pit she was going down into , for there were no sides to it , and a pit without sides to it is not a pit at all .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 24]: Diamond , however , had not been out so late before in all his life , and things looked so strange about him !
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 37]: -- just as if he had got into Fairyland , of which he knew quite as much as anybody ; for his mother had no money to buy books to set him wrong on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 26]: I have seen this world -- only sometimes , just now and then , you know -- look as strange as ever I saw Fairyland .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 14]: But I confess that I have not yet seen Fairyland at its best .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 11]: I am always going to see it so some time .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 44]: But if you had been out in the face and not at the back of the North Wind , on a cold rather frosty night , and in your night-gown , you would have felt it all quite as strange as Diamond did .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 32]: He cried a little , just a little , he was so disappointed to lose the lady : of course , you , little man , would n't have done that !
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 71]: But for my part , I do n't mind people crying so much as I mind what they cry about , and how they cry -- whether they cry quietly like ladies and gentlemen , or go shrieking like vulgar emperors , or ill-natured cooks ; for all emperors are not gentlemen , and all cooks are not ladies -- nor all queens and princesses for that matter , either .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 15]: But it ca n't be denied that a little gentle crying does one good .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 19]: It did Diamond good ; for as soon as it was over he was a brave boy again .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 13]: `` She sha n't say it was my fault , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 14]: `` I daresay she is hiding somewhere to see what I will do .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: I will look for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 13]: So he went round the end of the stable towards the kitchen-garden .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 29]: But the moment he was clear of the shelter of the stable , sharp as a knife came the wind against his little chest and his bare legs .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 12]: Still he would look in the kitchen-garden , and went on .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 33]: But when he got round the weeping-ash that stood in the corner , the wind blew much stronger , and it grew stronger and stronger till he could hardly fight against it .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 6]: And it was so cold !
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 16]: All the flashy spikes of the stars seemed to have got somehow into the wind .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 22]: Then he thought of what the lady had said about people being cold because they were not with the North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 40]: How it was that he should have guessed what she meant at that very moment I can not tell , but I have observed that the most wonderful thing in the world is how people come to understand anything .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 47]: He turned his back to the wind , and trotted again towards the yard ; whereupon , strange to say , it blew so much more gently against his calves than it had blown against his shins that he began to feel almost warm by contrast .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 37]: You must not think it was cowardly of Diamond to turn his back to the wind : he did so only because he thought Lady North Wind had said something like telling him to do so .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 24]: If she had said to him that he must hold his face to it , Diamond would have held his face to it .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 17]: But the most foolish thing is to fight for no good , and to please nobody .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 14]: Well , it was just as if the wind was pushing Diamond along .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 46]: If he turned round , it grew very sharp on his legs especially , and so he thought the wind might really be Lady North Wind , though he could not see her , and he had better let her blow him wherever she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 43]: So she blew and blew , and he went and went , until he found himself standing at a door in a wall , which door led from the yard into a little belt of shrubbery , flanking Mr. Coleman 's house .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 14]: Mr. Coleman was his father 's master , and the owner of Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 27]: He opened the door , and went through the shrubbery , and out into the middle of the lawn , still hoping to find North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 30]: The soft grass was very pleasant to his bare feet , and felt warm after the stones of the yard ; but the lady was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 43]: Then he began to think that after all he must have done wrong , and she was offended with him for not following close after her , but staying to talk to the horse , which certainly was neither wise nor polite .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 23]: There he stood in the middle of the lawn , the wind blowing his night-gown till it flapped like a loose sail .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 41]: The stars were very shiny over his head ; but they did not give light enough to show that the grass was green ; and Diamond stood alone in the strange night , which looked half solid all about him .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 13]: He began to wonder whether he was in a dream or not .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 35]: It was important to determine this ; `` for , '' thought Diamond , `` if I am in a dream , I am safe in my bed , and I need n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 37]: But if I 'm not in a dream , I 'm out here , and perhaps I had better cry , or , at least , I 'm not sure whether I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 40]: He came to the conclusion , however , that , whether he was in a dream or not , there could be no harm in not crying for a little while longer : he could begin whenever he liked .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 23]: The back of Mr. Coleman 's house was to the lawn , and one of the drawing-room windows looked out upon it .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 18]: The ladies had not gone to bed ; for the light was still shining in that window .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 28]: But they had no idea that a little boy was standing on the lawn in his night-gown , or they would have run out in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 16]: And as long as he saw that light , Diamond could not feel quite lonely .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 42]: He stood staring , not at the great warrior Orion in the sky , nor yet at the disconsolate , neglected moon going down in the west , but at the drawing-room window with the light shining through its green curtains .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 33]: He had been in that room once or twice that he could remember at Christmas times ; for the Colemans were kind people , though they did not care much about children .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 22]: All at once the light went nearly out : he could only see a glimmer of the shape of the window .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 12]: Then , indeed , he felt that he was left alone .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 17]: It was so dreadful to be out in the night after everybody was gone to bed !
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 8]: That was more than he could bear .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 23]: He burst out crying in good earnest , beginning with a wail like that of the wind when it is waking up .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 23]: Perhaps you think this was very foolish ; for could he not go home to his own bed again when he liked ?
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 46]: Yes ; but it looked dreadful to him to creep up that stair again and lie down in his bed again , and know that North Wind 's window was open beside him , and she gone , and he might never see her again .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 10]: He would be just as lonely there as here .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 24]: Nay , it would be much worse if he had to think that the window was nothing but a hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 55]: At the very moment when he burst out crying , the old nurse who had grown to be one of the family , for she had not gone away when Miss Coleman did not want any more nursing , came to the back door , which was of glass , to close the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 33]: She thought she heard a cry , and , peering out with a hand on each side of her eyes like Diamond 's blinkers , she saw something white on the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 27]: Too old and too wise to be frightened , she opened the door , and went straight towards the white thing to see what it was .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 48]: And when Diamond saw her coming he was not frightened either , though Mrs. Crump was a little cross sometimes ; for there is a good kind of crossness that is only disagreeable , and there is a bad kind of crossness that is very nasty indeed .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 49]: So she came up with her neck stretched out , and her head at the end of it , and her eyes foremost of all , like a snail 's , peering into the night to see what it could be that went on glimmering white before her .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: When she did see , she made a great exclamation , and threw up her hands .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 28]: Then without a word , for she thought Diamond was walking in his sleep , she caught hold of him , and led him towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 31]: He made no objection , for he was just in the mood to be grateful for notice of any sort , and Mrs. Crump led him straight into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 47]: Now , from the neglect of the new housemaid , the fire in Miss Coleman 's bedroom had gone out , and her mother had told her to brush her hair by the drawing-room fire -- a disorderly proceeding which a mother 's wish could justify .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 43]: The young lady was very lovely , though not nearly so beautiful as North Wind ; and her hair was extremely long , for it came down to her knees -- though that was nothing at all to North Wind 's hair .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 49]: Yet when she looked round , with her hair all about her , as Diamond entered , he thought for one moment that it was North Wind , and , pulling his hand from Mrs. Crump 's , he stretched out his arms and ran towards Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 24]: She was so pleased that she threw down her brush , and almost knelt on the floor to receive him in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 33]: He saw the next moment that she was not Lady North Wind , but she looked so like her he could not help running into her arms and bursting into tears afresh .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 37]: Mrs. Crump said the poor child had walked out in his sleep , and Diamond thought she ought to know , and did not contradict her for anything he knew , it might be so indeed .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 48]: He let them talk on about him , and said nothing ; and when , after their astonishment was over , and Miss Coleman had given him a sponge-cake , it was decreed that Mrs. Crump should take him to his mother , he was quite satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 17]: His mother had to get out of bed to open the door when Mrs. Crump knocked .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 52]: She was indeed surprised to see her , boy ; and having taken him in her arms and carried him to his bed , returned and had a long confabulation with Mrs. Crump , for they were still talking when Diamond fell fast asleep , and could hear them no longer .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 20]: OLD DIAMOND DIAMOND woke very early in the morning , and thought what a curious dream he had had .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 39]: But the memory grew brighter and brighter in his head , until it did not look altogether like a dream , and he began to doubt whether he had not really been abroad in the wind last night .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 37]: He came to the conclusion that , if he had really been brought home to his mother by Mrs. Crump , she would say something to him about it , and that would settle the matter .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 30]: Then he got up and dressed himself , but , finding that his father and mother were not yet stirring , he went down the ladder to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 49]: There he found that even old Diamond was not awake yet , for he , as well as young Diamond , always got up the moment he woke , and now he was lying as flat as a horse could lie upon his nice trim bed of straw .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 32]: `` I 'll give old Diamond a surprise , '' thought the boy ; and creeping up very softly , before the horse knew , he was astride of his back .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 65]: Then it was young Diamond 's turn to have more of a surprise than he had expected ; for as with an earthquake , with a rumbling and a rocking hither and thither , a sprawling of legs and heaving as of many backs , young Diamond found himself hoisted up in the air , with both hands twisted in the horse 's mane .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 40]: The next instant old Diamond lashed out with both his hind legs , and giving one cry of terror young Diamond found himself lying on his neck , with his arms as far round it as they would go .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 29]: But then the horse stood as still as a stone , except that he lifted his head gently up to let the boy slip down to his back .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 47]: For when he heard young Diamond 's cry he knew that there was nothing to kick about ; for young Diamond was a good boy , and old Diamond was a good horse , and the one was all right on the back of the other .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 27]: As soon as Diamond had got himself comfortable on the saddle place , the horse began pulling at the hay , and the boy began thinking .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 20]: He had never mounted Diamond himself before , and he had never got off him without being lifted down .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 18]: So he sat , while the horse ate , wondering how he was to reach the ground .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 19]: But while he meditated , his mother woke , and her first thought was to see her boy .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 15]: She had visited him twice during the night , and found him sleeping quietly .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 11]: Now his bed was empty , and she was frightened .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 3]: `` Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 2]: Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 7]: Where are you , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 4]: she called out .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 28]: Diamond turned his head where he sat like a knight on his steed in enchanted stall , and cried aloud , -- `` Here , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 6]: `` Where , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 11]: `` Here , mother , on Diamond 's back . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 19]: She came running to the ladder , and peeping down , saw him aloft on the great horse .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 10]: `` Come down , Diamond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 9]: `` I ca n't , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 8]: `` How did you get up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 28]: `` Quite easily , '' answered he ; `` but when I got up , Diamond would get up too , and so here I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 18]: His mother thought he had been walking in his sleep again , and hurried down the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 44]: She did not much like going up to the horse , for she had not been used to horses ; but she would have gone into a lion 's den , not to say a horse 's stall , to help her boy .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 19]: So she went and lifted him off Diamond 's back , and felt braver all her life after .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 33]: She carried him in her arms up to her room ; but , afraid of frightening him at his own sleep-walking , as she supposed it , said nothing about last night .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 17]: Before the next day was over , Diamond had almost concluded the whole adventure a dream .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 29]: For a week his mother watched him very carefully -- going into the loft several times a night -- as often , in fact , as she woke .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 8]: Every time she found him fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: All that week it was hard weather .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 19]: The grass showed white in the morning with the hoar-frost which clung like tiny comfits to every blade .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 40]: And as Diamond 's shoes were not good , and his mother had not quite saved up enough money to get him the new pair she so much wanted for him , she would not let him run out .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 65]: He played all his games over and over indoors , especially that of driving two chairs harnessed to the baby 's cradle ; and if they did not go very fast , they went as fast as could be expected of the best chairs in the world , although one of them had only three legs , and the other only half a back .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 37]: At length his mother brought home his new shoes , and no sooner did she find they fitted him than she told him he might run out in the yard and amuse himself for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 18]: The sun was going down when he flew from the door like a bird from its cage .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 8]: All the world was new to him .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 51]: A great fire of sunset burned on the top of the gate that led from the stables to the house ; above the fire in the sky lay a large lake of green light , above that a golden cloud , and over that the blue of the wintry heavens .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 29]: And Diamond thought that , next to his own home , he had never seen any place he would like so much to live in as that sky .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 20]: For it is not fine things that make home a nice place , but your mother and your father .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 39]: As he was looking at the lovely colours , the gates were thrown open , and there was old Diamond and his friend in the carriage , dancing with impatience to get at their stalls and their oats .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 5]: And in they came .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 58]: Diamond was not in the least afraid of his father driving over him , but , careful not to spoil the grand show he made with his fine horses and his multitudinous cape , with a red edge to every fold , he slipped out of the way and let him dash right on to the stables .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 23]: To be quite safe he had to step into the recess of the door that led from the yard to the shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 23]: As he stood there he remembered how the wind had driven him to this same spot on the night of his dream .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 13]: And once more he was almost sure that it was no dream .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 21]: At all events , he would go in and see whether things looked at all now as they did then .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 14]: He opened the door , and passed through the little belt of shrubbery .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 14]: Not a flower was to be seen in the beds on the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 15]: Even the brave old chrysanthemums and Christmas roses had passed away before the frost .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 4]: There was one !
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: He ran and knelt down to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 17]: It was a primrose -- a dwarfish thing , but perfect in shape -- a baby-wonder .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 64]: As he stooped his face to see it close , a little wind began to blow , and two or three long leaves that stood up behind the flower shook and waved and quivered , but the primrose lay still in the green hollow , looking up at the sky , and not seeming to know that the wind was blowing at all .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 21]: It was just a one eye that the dull black wintry earth had opened to look at the sky with .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 22]: All at once Diamond thought it was saying its prayers , and he ought not to be staring at it so .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 14]: He ran to the stable to see his father make Diamond 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 31]: Then his father took him in his arms , carried him up the ladder , and set him down at the table where they were going to have their tea .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 12]: `` Miss is very poorly , '' said Diamond 's father .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 24]: `` Mis ` ess has been to the doctor with her to-day , and she looked very glum when she came out again .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 13]: I was a-watching of them to see what doctor had said . ''
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 10]: `` And did n't Miss look glum too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 4]: asked his mother .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 15]: `` Not half as glum as Mis ` ess , '' returned the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 25]: `` You see -- '' But he lowered his voice , and Diamond could not make out more than a word here and there .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 36]: For Diamond 's father was not only one of the finest of coachmen to look at , and one of the best of drivers , but one of the most discreet of servants as well .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 44]: Therefore he did not talk about family affairs to any one but his wife , whom he had proved better than himself long ago , and was careful that even Diamond should hear nothing he could repeat again concerning master and his family .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 15]: It was bed-time soon , and Diamond went to bed and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 10]: He awoke all at once , in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 12]: `` Open the window , Diamond , '' said a voice .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 14]: Now Diamond 's mother had once more pasted up North Wind 's window .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 7]: `` Are you North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 12]: said Diamond : `` I do n't hear you blowing . ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 9]: `` No ; but you hear me talking .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 12]: Open the window , for I have n't overmuch time . ''
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 13]: `` But , please , North Wind , where 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 9]: You left me all alone last time . ''
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 26]: He had got up on his knees , and was busy with his nails once more at the paper over the hole in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 27]: For now that North Wind spoke again , he remembered all that had taken place before as distinctly as if it had happened only last night .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 14]: `` Yes , but that was your fault , '' returned North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 21]: `` I had work to do ; and , besides , a gentleman should never keep a lady waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 18]: `` But I 'm not a gentleman , '' said Diamond , scratching away at the paper .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 14]: `` I hope you wo n't say so ten years after this . ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 21]: `` I 'm going to be a coachman , and a coachman is not a gentleman , '' persisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 16]: `` We call your father a gentleman in our house , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 12]: `` He does n't call himself one , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 22]: `` That 's of no consequence : every man ought to be a gentleman , and your father is one . ''
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 30]: Diamond was so pleased to hear this that he scratched at the paper like ten mice , and getting hold of the edge of it , tore it off .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 17]: The next instant a young girl glided across the bed , and stood upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 19]: said Diamond , quite dismayed ; `` I did n't know -- who are you , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 7]: `` I 'm North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: `` Are you really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 4]: Make haste . ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 10]: `` But you 're no bigger than me . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: `` Do you think I care about how big or how little I am ?
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 8]: Did n't you see me this evening ?
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 6]: I was less then . ''
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 5]: Where was you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 8]: `` Behind the leaves of the primrose .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 8]: Did n't you see them blowing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 15]: `` Make haste , then , if you want to go with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 13]: `` But you are not big enough to take care of me .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 10]: I think you are only Miss North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 13]: `` I am big enough to show you the way , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 14]: But if you wo n't come , why , you must stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 6]: `` I must dress myself .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 23]: I did n't mind with a grown lady , but I could n't go with a little girl in my night-gown . ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 14]: I 'm not in such a hurry as I was the other night .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 21]: Dress as fast as you can , and I 'll go and shake the primrose leaves till you come . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 10]: `` Do n't hurt it , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 22]: North Wind broke out in a little laugh like the breaking of silver bubbles , and was gone in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 47]: Diamond saw -- for it was a starlit night , and the mass of hay was at a low ebb now -- the gleam of something vanishing down the stair , and , springing out of bed , dressed himself as fast as ever he could .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 21]: Then he crept out into the yard , through the door in the wall , and away to the primrose .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 23]: Behind it stood North Wind , leaning over it , and looking at the flower as if she had been its mother .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 16]: `` Come along , '' she said , jumping up and holding out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 5]: Diamond took her hand .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 18]: It was cold , but so pleasant and full of life , it was better than warm .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: She led him across the garden .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 12]: With one bound she was on the top of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 7]: Diamond was left at the foot .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 6]: `` Stop , stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 11]: `` Please , I ca n't jump like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 22]: `` You do n't try '' said North Wind , who from the top looked down a foot taller than before .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 16]: `` Give me your hand again , and I will , try '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 21]: She reached down , Diamond laid hold of her hand , gave a great spring , and stood beside her .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 6]: `` This is nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 13]: Another bound , and they stood in the road by the river .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 32]: It was full tide , and the stars were shining clear in its depths , for it lay still , waiting for the turn to run down again to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 6]: They walked along its side .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 23]: But they had not walked far before its surface was covered with ripples , and the stars had vanished from its bosom .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 11]: And North Wind was now tall as a full-grown girl .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 19]: Her hair was flying about her head , and the wind was blowing a breeze down the river .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 22]: But she turned aside and went up a narrow lane , and as she went her hair fell down around her .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 32]: `` I have some rather disagreeable work to do to-night , '' she said , `` before I get out to sea , and I must set about it at once .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 10]: The disagreeable work must be looked after first . ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 19]: So saying , she laid hold of Diamond and began to run , gliding along faster and faster .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 11]: Diamond kept up with her as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 22]: She made many turnings and windings , apparently because it was not quite easy to get him over walls and houses .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 15]: Once they ran through a hall where they found back and front doors open .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 39]: At the foot of the stair North Wind stood still , and Diamond , hearing a great growl , started in terror , and there , instead of North Wind , was a huge wolf by his side .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 16]: He let go his hold in dismay , and the wolf bounded up the stair .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 25]: The windows of the house rattled and shook as if guns were firing , and the sound of a great fall came from above .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 11]: Diamond stood with white face staring up at the landing .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 20]: `` Surely , '' he thought , `` North Wind ca n't be eating one of the children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 17]: Coming to himself all at once , he rushed after her with his little fist clenched .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 44]: There were ladies in long trains going up and down the stairs , and gentlemen in white neckties attending on them , who stared at him , but none of them were of the people of the house , and they said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 31]: Before he reached the head of the stair , however , North Wind met him , took him by the hand , and hurried down and out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 14]: `` I hope you have n't eaten a baby , North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: said Diamond , very solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 11]: North Wind laughed merrily , and went tripping on faster .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 39]: Her grassy robe swept and swirled about her steps , and wherever it passed over withered leaves , they went fleeing and whirling in spirals , and running on their edges like wheels , all about her feet .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 17]: `` No , '' she said at last , `` I did not eat a baby .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 21]: You would not have had to ask that foolish question if you had not let go your hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 24]: You would have seen how I served a nurse that was calling a child bad names , and telling her she was wicked .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 5]: She had been drinking .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 11]: I saw an ugly gin bottle in a cupboard . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 7]: `` And you frightened her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 6]: `` I believe so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 6]: answered North Wind laughing merrily .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 23]: `` I flew at her throat , and she tumbled over on the floor with such a crash that they ran in .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 21]: She 'll be turned away to-morrow -- and quite time , if they knew as much as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 11]: `` But did n't you frighten the little one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 6]: `` She never saw me .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 16]: The woman would not have seen me either if she had not been wicked . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 5]: said Diamond , dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 25]: `` Why should you see things , '' returned North Wind , `` that you would n't understand or know what to do with ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 13]: Good people see good things ; bad people , bad things . ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 9]: `` Then are you a bad thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 40]: For you see me , Diamond , dear , '' said the girl , and she looked down at him , and Diamond saw the loving eyes of the great lady beaming from the depths of her falling hair .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 17]: `` I had to make myself look like a bad thing before she could see me .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 35]: If I had put on any other shape than a wolf 's she would not have seen me , for that is what is growing to be her own shape inside of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 23]: `` I do n't know what you mean , '' said Diamond , `` but I suppose it 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 11]: They were now climbing the slope of a grassy ascent .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 16]: It was Primrose Hill , in fact , although Diamond had never heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 26]: The moment they reached the top , North Wind stood and turned her face towards London The stars were still shining clear and cold overhead .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 9]: There was not a cloud to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 13]: The air was sharp , but Diamond did not find it cold .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 20]: `` Now , '' said the lady , `` whatever you do , do not let my hand go .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 26]: I might have lost you the last time , only I was not in a hurry then : now I am in a hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 8]: Yet she stood still for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 17]: NORTH WIND AND as she stood looking towards London , Diamond saw that she was trembling .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 9]: `` Are you cold , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 30]: `` No , Diamond , '' she answered , looking down upon him with a smile ; `` I am only getting ready to sweep one of my rooms .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 15]: Those careless , greedy , untidy children make it in such a mess . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 28]: As she spoke he could have told by her voice , if he had not seen with his eyes , that she was growing larger and larger .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 45]: Her head went up and up towards the stars ; and as she grew , still trembling through all her body , her hair also grew -- longer and longer , and lifted itself from her head , and went out in black waves .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 26]: The next moment , however , it fell back around her , and she grew less and less till she was only a tall woman .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 24]: Then she put her hands behind her head , and gathered some of her hair , and began weaving and knotting it together .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 61]: When she had done , she bent down her beautiful face close to his , and said -- `` Diamond , I am afraid you would not keep hold of me , and if I were to drop you , I do n't know what might happen ; so I have been making a place for you in my hair .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 3]: Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 21]: Diamond held out his arms , for with that grand face looking at him , he believed like a baby .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 23]: She took him in her hands , threw him over her shoulder , and said , `` Get in , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 21]: And Diamond parted her hair with his hands , crept between , and feeling about soon found the woven nest .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 19]: It was just like a pocket , or like the shawl in which gipsy women carry their children .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 30]: North Wind put her hands to her back , felt all about the nest , and finding it safe , said -- `` Are you comfortable , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 9]: `` Yes , indeed , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 10]: The next moment he was rising in the air .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 12]: North Wind grew towering up to the place of the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 18]: Her hair went streaming out from her , till it spread like a mist over the stars .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 7]: She flung herself abroad in space .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 29]: Diamond held on by two of the twisted ropes which , parted and interwoven , formed his shelter , for he could not help being a little afraid .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 30]: As soon as he had come to himself , he peeped through the woven meshes , for he did not dare to look over the top of the nest .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 14]: The earth was rushing past like a river or a sea below him .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 10]: Trees and water and green grass hurried away beneath .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 37]: A great roar of wild animals rose as they rushed over the Zoological Gardens , mixed with a chattering of monkeys and a screaming of birds ; but it died away in a moment behind them .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 22]: And now there was nothing but the roofs of houses , sweeping along like a great torrent of stones and rocks .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 32]: Chimney-pots fell , and tiles flew from the roofs ; but it looked to him as if they were left behind by the roofs and the chimneys as they scudded away .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 34]: There was a great roaring , for the wind was dashing against London like a sea ; but at North Wind 's back Diamond , of course , felt nothing of it all .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 7]: He was in a perfect calm .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 12]: He could hear the sound of it , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 15]: By and by he raised himself and looked over the edge of his nest .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 22]: There were the houses rushing up and shooting away below him , like a fierce torrent of rocks instead of water .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 30]: Then he looked up to the sky , but could see no stars ; they were hidden by the blinding masses of the lady 's hair which swept between .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 13]: He began to wonder whether she would hear him if he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 4]: He would try .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 17]: `` Please , North Wind , '' he said , `` what is that noise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 24]: From high over his head came the voice of North Wind , answering him , gently -- `` The noise of my besom .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 23]: I am the old woman that sweeps the cobwebs from the sky ; only I 'm busy with the floor now . ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 14]: `` What makes the houses look as if they were running away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 10]: `` I am sweeping so fast over them . ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 27]: `` But , please , North Wind , I knew London was very big , but I did n't know it was so big as this .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 13]: It seems as if we should never get away from it . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 18]: `` We are going round and round , else we should have left it long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 12]: `` Is this the way you sweep , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 14]: `` Yes ; I go round and round with my great besom . ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 20]: `` Please , would you mind going a little slower , for I want to see the streets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 9]: `` You wo n't see much now . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 12]: `` Because I have nearly swept all the people home . ''
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 22]: I forgot , '' said Diamond , and was quiet after that , for he did not want to be troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 21]: But she dropped a little towards the roofs of the houses , and Diamond could see down into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 9]: There were very few people about , though .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 14]: The lamps flickered and flared again , but nobody seemed to want them .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 11]: Suddenly Diamond espied a little girl coming along a street .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 20]: She was dreadfully blown by the wind , and a broom she was trailing behind her was very troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 27]: It seemed as if the wind had a spite at her -- it kept worrying her like a wild beast , and tearing at her rags .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 6]: She was so lonely there !
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 19]: please , North Wind , '' he cried , `` wo n't you help that little girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 13]: `` No , Diamond ; I must n't leave my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 12]: `` But why should n't you be kind to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 7]: `` I am kind to her .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 9]: I am sweeping the wicked smells away . ''
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 12]: `` But you 're kinder to me , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: Why should n't you be as kind to her as you are to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 7]: `` There are reasons , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 10]: Everybody ca n't be done to all the same .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 10]: Everybody is not ready for the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 16]: `` But I do n't see why I should be kinder used than she . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 20]: `` Do you think nothing 's to be done but what you can see , Diamond , you silly !
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 5]: It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 10]: Of course you can help her if you like .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 15]: You 've got nothing particular to do at this moment ; I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 8]: do let me help her , then .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 12]: But you wo n't be able to wait , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 14]: `` No , I ca n't wait ; you must do it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 16]: And , mind , the wind will get a hold of you , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 14]: `` Do n't you want me to help her , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 10]: `` Not without having some idea what will happen .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 29]: If you break down and cry , that wo n't be much of a help to her , and it will make a goose of little Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 10]: `` I want to go , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 16]: `` Only there 's just one thing -- how am I to get home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 16]: `` If you 're anxious about that , perhaps you had better go with me .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: I am bound to take you home again , if you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 12]: cried Diamond , who was still looking after the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 16]: `` I 'm sure the wind will blow her over , and perhaps kill her .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 6]: Do let me go . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 13]: They had been sweeping more slowly along the line of the street .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 8]: There was a lull in the roaring .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 45]: `` Well , though I can not promise to take you home , '' said North Wind , as she sank nearer and nearer to the tops of the houses , `` I can promise you it will be all right in the end .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 6]: You will get home somehow .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 11]: Have you made up your mind what to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 14]: `` Yes ; to help the little girl , '' said Diamond firmly .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 27]: The same moment North Wind dropt into the street and stood , only a tall lady , but with her hair flying up over the housetops .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 19]: She put her hands to her back , took Diamond , and set him down in the street .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 20]: The same moment he was caught in the fierce coils of the blast , and all but blown away .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 20]: North Wind stepped back a step , and at once towered in stature to the height of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 8]: A chimney-pot clashed at Diamond 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 45]: He turned in terror , but it was to look for the little girl , and when he turned again the lady had vanished , and the wind was roaring along the street as if it had been the bed of an invisible torrent .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 22]: The little girl was scudding before the blast , her hair flying too , and behind her she dragged her broom .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 17]: Her little legs were going as fast as ever they could to keep her from falling .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 27]: Diamond crept into the shelter of a doorway , thinking to stop her ; but she passed him like a bird , crying gently and pitifully .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 3]: `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 2]: stop !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: little girl , '' shouted Diamond , starting in pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 21]: `` I ca n't , '' wailed the girl , `` the wind wo n't leave go of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 13]: Diamond could run faster than she , and he had no broom .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 26]: In a few moments he had caught her by the frock , but it tore in his hand , and away went the little girl .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 49]: So he had to run again , and this time he ran so fast that he got before her , and turning round caught her in his arms , when down they went both together , which made the little girl laugh in the midst of her crying .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 12]: asked Diamond , rubbing the elbow that had stuck farthest out .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 21]: The arm it belonged to was twined round a lamp-post as he stood between the little girl and the wind .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 11]: `` Home , '' she said , gasping for breath .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 12]: `` Then I will go with you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 28]: And then they were silent for a while , for the wind blew worse than ever , and they had both to hold on to the lamp-post .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 7]: `` Where is your crossing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 6]: asked the girl at length .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 10]: `` I do n't sweep , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 9]: `` What do you do , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 3]: asked she .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 11]: `` You ai n't big enough for most things . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 18]: `` I do n't know what I do do , '' answered he , feeling rather ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 6]: `` Nothing , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 9]: My father 's Mr. Coleman 's coachman . ''
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 7]: `` Have you a father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 18]: she said , staring at him as if a boy with a father was a natural curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 5]: Have n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 3]: returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 7]: `` No ; nor mother neither .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 9]: Old Sal 's all I 've got . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 7]: And she began to cry again .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 19]: `` I would n't go to her if she was n't good to me , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 8]: `` But you must go somewheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 14]: `` Move on , '' said the voice of a policeman behind them .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 11]: `` I told you so , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 6]: `` You must go somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 7]: They 're always at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: `` But old Sal does n't beat you , does she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 7]: `` I wish she would . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: asked Diamond , quite bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: `` She would if she was my mother .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 25]: But she would n't lie abed a-cuddlin ' of her ugly old bones , and laugh to hear me crying at the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 14]: `` You do n't mean she wo n't let you in to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 12]: `` It 'll be a good chance if she does . ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 11]: `` Why are you out so late , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 25]: `` My crossing 's a long way off at the West End , and I had been indulgin ' in door-steps and mewses . ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 13]: `` We 'd better have a try anyhow , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 5]: `` Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 42]: As he spoke Diamond thought he caught a glimpse of North Wind turning a corner in front of them ; and when they turned the corner too , they found it quiet there , but he saw nothing of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 24]: `` Now you lead me , '' he said , taking her hand , `` and I 'll take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 27]: The girl withdrew her hand , but only to dry her eyes with her frock , for the other had enough to do with her broom .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 27]: She put it in his again , and led him , turning after turning , until they stopped at a cellar-door in a very dirty lane .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 4]: There she knocked .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 13]: `` I should n't like to live here , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 22]: `` Oh , yes , you would , if you had nowhere else to go to , '' answered the girl .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 10]: `` I only wish we may get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 13]: `` I do n't want to go in , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 11]: `` Where do you mean to go , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 7]: `` Home to my home . ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 6]: `` Where 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 8]: `` I do n't exactly know . ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 11]: `` Then you 're worse off than I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 20]: `` Oh no , for North Wind -- '' began Diamond , and stopped , he hardly knew why .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 14]: said the girl , as she held her ear to the door listening .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 6]: But Diamond did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 5]: Neither did old Sal .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 11]: `` I told you so , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 7]: `` She is wide awake hearkening .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 8]: But we do n't get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 9]: `` What will you do , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 8]: `` Move on , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 5]: `` Oh , anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 10]: Bless you , I 'm used to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 13]: `` Had n't you better come home with me , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 16]: `` That 's a good joke , when you do n't know where it is .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 4]: Come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 5]: `` But where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 7]: `` Oh , nowheres in particular .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 4]: Come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 3]: Diamond obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 7]: The wind had now fallen considerably .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 41]: They wandered on and on , turning in this direction and that , without any reason for one way more than another , until they had got out of the thick of the houses into a waste kind of place .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 9]: By this time they were both very tired .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 54]: Diamond felt a good deal inclined to cry , and thought he had been very silly to get down from the back of North Wind ; not that he would have minded it if he had done the girl any good ; but he thought he had been of no use to her .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 24]: He was mistaken there , for she was far happier for having Diamond with her than if she had been wandering about alone .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 10]: She did not seem so tired as he was .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 12]: `` Do let us rest a bit , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 9]: `` Let 's see , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 9]: `` There 's something like a railway there .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 8]: Perhaps there 's an open arch . ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 23]: They went towards it and found one , and , better still , there was an empty barrel lying under the arch .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 3]: `` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: here we are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 4]: said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 16]: `` A barrel 's the jolliest bed going -- on the tramp , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 13]: We 'll have forty winks , and then go on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 11]: She crept in , and Diamond crept in beside her .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 24]: They put their arms round each other , and when he began to grow warm , Diamond 's courage began to come back .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 6]: `` This is jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: `` I 'm so glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 15]: `` I do n't think so much of it , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 10]: `` I 'm used to it , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 23]: But I ca n't think how a kid like you comes to be out all alone this time o ' night . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 36]: She called him a kid , but she was not really a month older than he was ; only she had had to work for her bread , and that so soon makes people older .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 24]: `` But I should n't have been out so late if I had n't got down to help you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 10]: `` North Wind is gone home long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 23]: `` I think you must ha ' got out o ' one o ' them Hidget Asylms , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 19]: `` You said something about the north wind afore that I could n't get the rights of . ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: So now , for the sake of his character , Diamond had to tell her the whole story .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 9]: She did not believe a word of it .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 15]: She said he was n't such a flat as to believe all that bosh .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 21]: But as she spoke there came a great blast of wind through the arch , and set the barrel rolling .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 39]: So they made haste to get out of it , for they had no notion of being rolled over and over as if they had been packed tight and would n't hurt , like a barrel of herrings .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 27]: `` I thought we should have had a sleep , '' said Diamond ; `` but I ca n't say I 'm very sleepy after all .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 9]: Come , let 's go on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 25]: They wandered on and on , sometimes sitting on a door-step , but always turning into lanes or fields when they had a chance .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 18]: They found themselves at last on a rising ground that sloped rather steeply on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 22]: It was a waste kind of spot below , bounded by an irregular wall , with a few doors in it .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 15]: Outside lay broken things in general , from garden rollers to flower-pots and wine-bottles .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 30]: But the moment they reached the brow of the rising ground , a gust of wind seized them and blew them down hill as fast as they could run .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 17]: Nor could Diamond stop before he went bang against one of the doors in the wall .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 7]: To his dismay it burst open .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 9]: When they came to themselves they peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 9]: It was the back door of a garden .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 6]: `` Ah , ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 15]: cried Diamond , after staring for a few moments , `` I thought so !
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 6]: North Wind takes nobody in !
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 8]: Here I am in master 's garden !
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 44]: I tell you what , little girl , you just bore a hole in old Sal 's wall , and put your mouth to it , and say , ` Please , North Wind , may n't I go out with you ? '
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 10]: and then you 'll see what 'll come . ''
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 6]: `` I daresay I shall .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 17]: But I 'm out in the wind too often already to want more of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 13]: `` I said with the North Wind , not in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 7]: `` It 's all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 8]: `` It 's not all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 7]: `` It is all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 7]: `` But I know best . ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 6]: `` And I know better .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: I 'll box your ears , '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: Diamond got very angry .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 45]: But he remembered that even if she did box his ears , he mus n't box hers again , for she was a girl , and all that boys must do , if girls are rude , is to go away and leave them .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 8]: So he went in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 9]: `` Good-bye , mister '' said the girl .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 7]: This brought Diamond to his senses .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 12]: `` I 'm sorry I was cross , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 14]: `` Come in , and my mother will give you some breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: I must be off to my crossing .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 6]: It 's morning now . ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 12]: `` I 'm very sorry for you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 26]: `` Well , it is a life to be tired of -- what with old Sal , and so many holes in my shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 8]: `` I wonder you 're so good .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 6]: I should kill myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , you would n't !
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 26]: When I think of it , I always want to see what 's coming next , and so I always wait till next is over .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 8]: I suppose there 's somebody happy somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 8]: But it ai n't in them carriages .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 3]: Oh my !
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 13]: how they do look sometimes -- fit to bite your head off !
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 10]: She ran up the hill and disappeared behind it .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 19]: Then Diamond shut the door as he best could , and ran through the kitchen-garden to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 14]: And was n't he glad to get into his own blessed bed again !
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 12]: THE SUMMER-HOUSE DIAMOND said nothing to his mother about his adventures .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 43]: He had half a notion that North Wind was a friend of his mother , and that , if she did not know all about it , at least she did not mind his going anywhere with the lady of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 71]: At the same time he doubted whether he might not appear to be telling stories if he told all , especially as he could hardly believe it himself when he thought about it in the middle of the day , although when the twilight was once half-way on to night he had no doubt about it , at least for the first few days after he had been with her .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 13]: The girl that swept the crossing had certainly refused to believe him .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 17]: Besides , he felt sure that North Wind would tell him if he ought to speak .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 14]: It was some time before he saw the lady of the wind again .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 14]: Indeed nothing remarkable took place in Diamond 's history until the following week .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 6]: This was what happened then .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 49]: Diamond the horse wanted new shoes , and Diamond 's father took him out of the stable , and was just getting on his back to ride him to the forge , when he saw his little boy standing by the pump , and looking at him wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 48]: Then the coachman took his foot out of the stirrup , left his hold of the mane and bridle , came across to his boy , lifted him up , and setting him on the horse 's back , told him to sit up like a man .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 8]: He then led away both Diamonds together .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 105]: The boy atop felt not a little tremulous as the great muscles that lifted the legs of the horse knotted and relaxed against his legs , and he cowered towards the withers , grasping with his hands the bit of mane worn short by the collar ; but when his father looked back at him , saying once more , `` Sit up , Diamond , '' he let the mane go and sat up , notwithstanding that the horse , thinking , I suppose , that his master had said to him , `` Come up , Diamond , '' stepped out faster .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 9]: For both the Diamonds were just grandly obedient .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 22]: And Diamond soon found that , as he was obedient to his father , so the horse was obedient to him .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 74]: For he had not ridden far before he found courage to reach forward and catch hold of the bridle , and when his father , whose hand was upon it , felt the boy pull it towards him , he looked up and smiled , and , well pleased , let go his hold , and left Diamond to guide Diamond ; and the boy soon found that he could do so perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 16]: It was a grand thing to be able to guide a great beast like that .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 26]: And another discovery he made was that , in order to guide the horse , he had in a measure to obey the horse first .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 27]: If he did not yield his body to the motions of the horse 's body , he could not guide him ; he must fall off .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 11]: The blacksmith lived at some distance , deeper into London .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 45]: As they crossed the angle of a square , Diamond , who was now quite comfortable on his living throne , was glancing this way and that in a gentle pride , when he saw a girl sweeping a crossing scuddingly before a lady .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 29]: The lady was his father 's mistress , Mrs. Coleman , and the little girl was she for whose sake he had got off North Wind 's back .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: He drew Diamond 's bridle in eager anxiety to see whether her outstretched hand would gather a penny from Mrs. Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 20]: But she had given one at the last crossing , and the hand returned only to grasp its broom .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 6]: Diamond could not bear it .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 31]: He had a penny in his pocket , a gift of the same lady the day before , and he tumbled off his horse to give it to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 17]: He tumbled off , I say , for he did tumble when he reached the ground .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 18]: But he got up in an instant , and ran , searching his pocket as he ran .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 18]: She made him a pretty courtesy when he offered his treasure , but with a bewildered stare .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 19]: She thought first : `` Then he was on the back of the North Wind after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 35]: but , looking up at the sound of the horse 's feet on the paved crossing , she changed her idea , saying to herself , `` North Wind is his father 's horse !
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 7]: That 's the secret of it !
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 8]: Why could n't he say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 10]: And she had a mind to refuse the penny .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 29]: But his smile put it all right , and she not only took his penny but put it in her mouth with a `` Thank you , mister .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 7]: Did they wollop you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 5]: `` Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 3]: answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: `` They never wollops me . ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 4]: `` Lor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 9]: said the little girl , and was speechless .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 50]: Meantime his father , looking up , and seeing the horse 's back bare , suffered a pang of awful dread , but the next moment catching sight of him , took him up and put him on , saying -- `` Do n't get off again , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 11]: The horse might have put his foot on you . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 17]: `` No , father , '' answered the boy , and rode on in majestic safety .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 9]: The summer drew near , warm and splendid .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 18]: Miss Coleman was a little better in health , and sat a good deal in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 14]: One day she saw Diamond peeping through the shrubbery , and called him .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 34]: He talked to her so frankly that she often sent for him after that , and by degrees it came about that he had leave to run in the garden as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 40]: He never touched any of the flowers or blossoms , for he was not like some boys who can not enjoy a thing without pulling it to pieces , and so preventing every one from enjoying it after them .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 34]: A week even makes such a long time in a child 's life , that Diamond had begun once more to feel as if North Wind were a dream of some far-off year .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 54]: One hot evening , he had been sitting with the young mistress , as they called her , in a little summer-house at the bottom of the lawn -- a wonderful thing for beauty , the boy thought , for a little window in the side of it was made of coloured glass .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 23]: It grew dusky , and the lady began to feel chill , and went in , leaving the boy in the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 35]: He sat there gazing out at a bed of tulips , which , although they had closed for the night , could not go quite asleep for the wind that kept waving them about .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 16]: All at once he saw a great bumble-bee fly out of one of the tulips .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 22]: that is something done , '' said a voice -- a gentle , merry , childish voice , but so tiny .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 6]: `` At last it was .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 15]: I thought he would have had to stay there all night , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 4]: I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 22]: Diamond could not tell whether the voice was near or far away , it was so small and yet so clear .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 24]: He had never seen a fairy , but he had heard of such , and he began to look all about for one .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 14]: And there was the tiniest creature sliding down the stem of the tulip !
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 11]: `` Are you the fairy that herds the bees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 22]: he asked , going out of the summer-house , and down on his knees on the green shore of the tulip-bed .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 13]: `` I 'm not a fairy , '' answered the little creature .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 16]: `` It would become you better to ask how you are to know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: `` You 've just told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 17]: But what 's the use of knowing a thing only because you 're told it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 14]: `` Well , how am I to know you are not a fairy ?
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 8]: You do look very like one . ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 16]: `` In the first place , fairies are much bigger than you see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 13]: said Diamond reflectively ; `` I thought they were very little . ''
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 17]: `` But they might be tremendously bigger than I am , and yet not very big .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 18]: Why , I could be six times the size I am , and not be very huge .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 26]: Besides , a fairy ca n't grow big and little at will , though the nursery-tales do say so : they do n't know better .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 4]: You stupid Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 8]: have you never seen me before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 29]: And , as she spoke , a moan of wind bent the tulips almost to the ground , and the creature laid her hand on Diamond 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 11]: In a moment he knew that it was North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 30]: `` I am very stupid , '' he said ; `` but I never saw you so small before , not even when you were nursing the primrose . ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 19]: `` Must you see me every size that can be measured before you know me , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 18]: `` But how could I think it was you taking care of a great stupid bumble-bee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 17]: `` The more stupid he was the more need he had to be taken care of .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 53]: What with sucking honey and trying to open the door , he was nearly dated ; and when it opened in the morning to let the sun see the tulip 's heart , what would the sun have thought to find such a stupid thing lying there -- with wings too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 13]: `` But how do you have time to look after bees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 8]: `` I do n't look after bees .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 8]: I had this one to look after .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 8]: It was hard work , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 4]: `` Hard work !
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 22]: Why , you could blow a chimney down , or -- or a boy 's cap off , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 11]: `` Both are easier than to blow a tulip open .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 11]: But I scarcely know the difference between hard and easy .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 11]: I am always able for what I have to do .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 17]: When I see my work , I just rush at it -- and it is done .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 6]: But I must n't chatter .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 10]: I have got to sink a ship to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: `` Sink a ship !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 2]: What !
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 6]: with men in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 8]: `` Yes , and women too . ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 4]: `` How dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 9]: I wish you would n't talk so . ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 6]: `` It is rather dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 6]: But it is my work .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 6]: I must do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 14]: `` I hope you wo n't ask me to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 9]: `` No , I wo n't ask you .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 9]: But you must come for all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 7]: `` I wo n't then . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: `` Wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 24]: And North Wind grew a tall lady , and looked him in the eyes , and Diamond said -- `` Please take me .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 7]: You can not be cruel . ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 12]: `` No ; I could not be cruel if I would .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 26]: I can do nothing cruel , although I often do what looks like cruel to those who do not know what I really am doing .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 45]: The people they say I drown , I only carry away to -- to -- to -- well , the back of the North Wind -- that is what they used to call it long ago , only I never saw the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 14]: `` How can you carry them there if you never saw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 7]: `` I know the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 11]: `` But how is it you never saw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 8]: `` Because it is behind me . ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 8]: `` But you can look round . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 10]: `` Not far enough to see my own back .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 8]: No ; I always look before me .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 17]: In fact , I grow quite blind and deaf when I try to see my back .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 7]: I only mind my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 10]: `` But how does it be your work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 10]: `` Ah , that I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 26]: I only know it is , because when I do it I feel all right , and when I do n't I feel all wrong .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 53]: East Wind says -- only one does not exactly know how much to believe of what she says , for she is very naughty sometimes -- she says it is all managed by a baby ; but whether she is good or naughty when she says that , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 7]: I just stick to my work .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 24]: It is all one to me to let a bee out of a tulip , or to sweep the cobwebs from the sky .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 10]: You would like to go with me to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 12]: `` I do n't want to see a ship sunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 10]: `` But suppose I had to take you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 12]: `` Why , then , of course I must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 7]: `` There 's a good Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 11]: -- I think I had better be growing a bit .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 8]: Only you must go to bed first .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 11]: I ca n't take you till you 're in bed .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 8]: That 's the law about the children .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 12]: So I had better go and do something else first . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 11]: `` Very well , North Wind , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 14]: `` What are you going to do first , if you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 8]: `` I think I may tell you .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 12]: Jump up on the top of the wall , there . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 6]: `` I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 18]: and I ca n't help you -- you have n't been to bed yet , you see .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 22]: Come out to the road with me , just in front of the coach-house , and I will show you . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 31]: North Wind grew very small indeed , so small that she could not have blown the dust off a dusty miller , as the Scotch children call a yellow auricula .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 18]: Diamond could not even see the blades of grass move as she flitted along by his foot .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 30]: They left the lawn , went out by the wicket in the-coach-house gates , and then crossed the road to the low wall that separated it from the river .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 16]: `` You can get up on this wall , Diamond , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 11]: `` Yes ; but my mother has forbidden me . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 10]: `` Then do n't , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 11]: `` But I can see over , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 4]: to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 5]: I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 19]: So saying , North Wind gave a little bound , and stood on the top of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 17]: She was just about the height a dragon-fly would be , if it stood on end .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 5]: `` You darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 12]: said Diamond , seeing what a lovely little toy-woman she was .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 14]: `` Do n't be impertinent , Master Diamond , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 25]: `` If there 's one thing makes me more angry than another , it is the way you humans judge things by their size .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 34]: I am quite as respectable now as I shall be six hours after this , when I take an East Indiaman by the royals , twist her round , and push her under .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 13]: You have no right to address me in such a fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 18]: But as she spoke , the tiny face wore the smile of a great , grand woman .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 20]: She was only having her own beautiful fun out of Diamond , and true woman 's fun never hurts .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 6]: `` But look there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 3]: she resumed .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 19]: `` Do you see a boat with one man in it -- a green and white boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 7]: `` Yes ; quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 7]: `` That 's a poet . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 11]: `` I thought you said it was a bo-at . ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 4]: `` Stupid pet !
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 10]: Do n't you know what a poet is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 13]: `` Why , a thing to sail on the water in . ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: `` Well , perhaps you 're not so far wrong .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 9]: Some poets do carry people over the sea .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 10]: But I have no business to talk so much .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: The man is a poet . ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 11]: `` The boat is a boat , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 7]: `` Ca n't you spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 4]: asked North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 6]: `` Not very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: `` So I see .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 12]: A poet is not a bo-at , as you call it .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 23]: A poet is a man who is glad of something , and tries to make other people glad of it too . ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 4]: now I know .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 8]: Like the man in the sweety-shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 4]: `` Not very .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 8]: But I see it is no use .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 16]: I was n't sent to tell you , and so I ca n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 5]: I must be off .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 9]: Only first just look at the man . ''
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 25]: `` He 's not much of a rower '' said Diamond -- `` paddling first with one fin and then with the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 6]: `` Now look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 4]: said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 19]: And she flashed like a dragon-fly across the water , whose surface rippled and puckered as she passed .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 18]: The next moment the man in the boat glanced about him , and bent to his oars .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 8]: The boat flew over the rippling water .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 8]: Man and boat and river were awake .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 14]: The same instant almost , North Wind perched again upon the river wall .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 8]: `` How did you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 12]: `` I blew in his face , '' answered North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 15]: `` I do n't see how that could do it , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 5]: `` I daresay not .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 13]: And therefore you will say you do n't believe it could . ''
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 9]: `` No , no , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 11]: I know you too well not to believe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 16]: `` Well , I blew in his face , and that woke him up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: `` But what was the good of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 3]: `` Why !
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 5]: do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 9]: Look at him -- how he is pulling .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: I blew the mist out of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 6]: `` How was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 12]: `` That is just what I can not tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 7]: `` But you did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 15]: I have to do ten thousand things without being able to tell how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 11]: `` I do n't like that , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 7]: He was staring after the boat .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 11]: Hearing no answer , he looked down to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 5]: North Wind was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 17]: Away across the river went a long ripple -- what sailors call a cat 's paw .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 11]: The man in the boat was putting up a sail .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 22]: The moon was coming to herself on the edge of a great cloud , and the sail began to shine white .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 13]: Diamond rubbed his eyes , and wondered what it was all about .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 22]: Things seemed going on around him , and all to understand each other , but he could make nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 17]: So he put his hands in his pockets , and went in to have his tea .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 13]: The night was very hot , for the wind had fallen again .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 16]: `` You do n't seem very well to-night , Diamond , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 17]: `` I am quite well , mother , '' returned Diamond , who was only puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 14]: `` I think you had better go to bed , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 10]: `` Very well , mother , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 12]: He stopped for one moment to look out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 10]: Above the moon the clouds were going different ways .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 17]: Somehow or other this troubled him , but , notwithstanding , he was soon fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 12]: He woke in the middle of the night and the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 20]: A terrible noise was rumbling overhead , like the rolling beat of great drums echoing through a brazen vault .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 23]: The roof of the loft in which he lay had no ceiling ; only the tiles were between him and the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 28]: For a while he could not come quite awake , for the noise kept beating him down , so that his heart was troubled and fluttered painfully .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 17]: A second peal of thunder burst over his head , and almost choked him with fear .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 46]: Nor did he recover until the great blast that followed , having torn some tiles off the roof , sent a spout of wind down into his bed and over his face , which brought him wide awake , and gave him back his courage .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 13]: The same moment he heard a mighty yet musical voice calling him .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 10]: `` Come up , Diamond , '' it said .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 6]: `` It 's all ready .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 7]: I 'm waiting for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 55]: He looked out of the bed , and saw a gigantic , powerful , but most lovely arm -- with a hand whose fingers were nothing the less ladylike that they could have strangled a boa-constrictor , or choked a tigress off its prey -- stretched down through a big hole in the roof .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 22]: Without a moment 's hesitation he reached out his tiny one , and laid it in the grand palm before him .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 30]: OUT IN THE STORM THE hand felt its way up his arm , and , grasping it gently and strongly above the elbow , lifted Diamond from the bed .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 30]: The moment he was through the hole in the roof , all the winds of heaven seemed to lay hold upon him , and buffet him hither and thither .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 33]: His hair blew one way , his night-gown another , his legs threatened to float from under him , and his head to grow dizzy with the swiftness of the invisible assailant .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 23]: Cowering , he clung with the other hand to the huge hand which held his arm , and fear invaded his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 7]: `` Oh , North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 28]: he murmured , but the words vanished from his lips as he had seen the soap-bubbles that burst too soon vanish from the mouth of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 10]: The wind caught them , and they were nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 15]: They could n't get out at all , but were torn away and strangled .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 57]: And yet North Wind heard them , and in her answer it seemed to Diamond that just because she was so big and could not help it , and just because her ear and her mouth must seem to him so dreadfully far away , she spoke to him more tenderly and graciously than ever before .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 99]: Her voice was like the bass of a deep organ , without the groan in it ; like the most delicate of violin tones without the wail in it ; like the most glorious of trumpet-ejaculations without the defiance in it ; like the sound of falling water without the clatter and clash in it : it was like all of them and neither of them -- all of them without their faults , each of them without its peculiarity : after all , it was more like his mother 's voice than anything else in the world .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 14]: `` Diamond , dear , '' she said , `` be a man .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 14]: What is fearful to you is not the least fearful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 19]: `` But it ca n't hurt you , '' murmured Diamond , `` for you 're it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 21]: `` Then if I 'm it , and have you in my arms , how can it hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 4]: `` Oh yes !
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 7]: I see , '' whispered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: `` But it looks so dreadful , and it pushes me about so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 9]: `` Yes , it does , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 9]: That is what it was sent for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 41]: At the same moment , a peal of thunder which shook Diamond 's heart against the sides of his bosom hurtled out of the heavens : I can not say out of the sky , for there was no sky .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 20]: Diamond had not seen the lightning , for he had been intent on finding the face of North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 45]: Every moment the folds of her garment would sweep across his eyes and blind him , but between , he could just persuade himself that he saw great glories of woman 's eyes looking down through rifts in the mountainous clouds over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 33]: He trembled so at the thunder , that his knees failed him , and he sunk down at North Wind 's feet , and clasped her round the column of her ankle .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 42]: She instantly stooped , lifted him from the roof -- up -- up into her bosom , and held him there , saying , as if to an inconsolable child -- `` Diamond , dear , this will never do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , it will , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 18]: `` I am all right now -- quite comfortable , I assure you , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 17]: If you will only let me stay here , I shall be all right indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 12]: `` But you will feel the wind here , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 30]: `` I do n't mind that a bit , so long as I feel your arms through it , '' answered Diamond , nestling closer to her grand bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 5]: `` Brave boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 8]: returned North Wind , pressing him closer .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 14]: `` No , '' said Diamond , `` I do n't see that .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 16]: It 's not courage at all , so long as I feel you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: `` But had n't you better get into my hair ?
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 13]: Then you would not feel the wind ; you will here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 24]: `` Ah , but , dear North Wind , you do n't know how nice it is to feel your arms about me .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 33]: It is a thousand times better to have them and the wind together , than to have only your hair and the back of your neck and no wind at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 10]: `` But it is surely more comfortable there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 19]: `` Well , perhaps ; but I begin to think there are better things than being comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 7]: `` Yes , indeed there are .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 11]: Well , I will keep you in front of me .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 11]: You will feel the wind , but not too much .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 24]: I shall only want one arm to take care of you ; the other will be quite enough to sink the ship . ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear North Wind !
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 7]: how can you talk so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 17]: `` My dear boy , I never talk ; I always mean what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 15]: `` Then you do mean to sink the ship with the other hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 8]: `` It 's not like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 4]: `` Quite easily .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 25]: Here you are taking care of a poor little boy with one arm , and there you are sinking a ship with the other .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 8]: It ca n't be like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 5]: but which is me ?
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 11]: I ca n't be two mes , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 7]: Nobody can be two mes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 9]: `` Well , which me is me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 6]: `` Now I must think .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: There looks to be two . ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 6]: That 's the very point .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 17]: -- You ca n't be knowing the thing you do n't know , can you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 8]: `` Which me do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 21]: `` The kindest , goodest , best me in the world , '' answered Diamond , clinging to North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 9]: `` Why am I good to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 10]: `` Have you ever done anything for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 18]: `` Then I must be good to you because I choose to be good to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 7]: `` Why should I choose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 10]: `` Because -- because -- because you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 12]: `` Why should I like to be good to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 20]: `` I do n't know , except it be because it 's good to be good to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 19]: `` That 's just it ; I am good to you because I like to be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 18]: `` Then why should n't you be good to other people as well as to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 10]: `` That 's just what I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 6]: Why should n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 7]: `` I do n't know either .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 7]: Then why should n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 6]: `` Because I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 10]: `` There it is again , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 9]: `` I do n't see that you are .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 8]: It looks quite the other thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 10]: `` Well , but listen to me , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 15]: You know the one me , you say , and that is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 11]: `` Do you know the other me as well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 4]: I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 7]: I should n't like to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 5]: `` There it is .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 8]: You do n't know the other me .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 9]: You are sure of one of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 13]: `` And you are sure there ca n't be two mes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 28]: `` Then the me you do n't know must be the same as the me you do know , -- else there would be two mes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 21]: `` Then the other me you do n't know must be as kind as the me you do know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 19]: `` Besides , I tell you that it is so , only it does n't look like it .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 5]: That I confess freely .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: Have you anything more to object ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 15]: `` No , no , dear North Wind ; I am quite satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 11]: `` Then I will tell you something you might object .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 23]: You might say that the me you know is like the other me , and that I am cruel all through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 15]: `` I know that ca n't be , because you are so kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 19]: `` But that kindness might be only a pretence for the sake of being more cruel afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 25]: Diamond clung to her tighter than ever , crying -- `` No , no , dear North Wind ; I ca n't believe that .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 6]: I do n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 6]: I wo n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 5]: That would kill me .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 19]: I love you , and you must love me , else how did I come to love you ?
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 22]: How could you know how to put on such a beautiful face if you did not love me and the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 18]: You may sink as many ships as you like , and I wo n't say another word .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 15]: I ca n't say I shall like to see it , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 45]: `` That 's quite another thing , '' said North Wind ; and as she spoke she gave one spring from the roof of the hay-loft , and rushed up into the clouds , with Diamond on her left arm close to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 20]: And as if the clouds knew she had come , they burst into a fresh jubilation of thunderous light .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 36]: For a few moments , Diamond seemed to be borne up through the depths of an ocean of dazzling flame ; the next , the winds were writhing around him like a storm of serpents .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 69]: For they were in the midst of the clouds and mists , and they of course took the shapes of the wind , eddying and wreathing and whirling and shooting and dashing about like grey and black water , so that it was as if the wind itself had taken shape , and he saw the grey and black wind tossing and raving most madly all about him .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 79]: Now it blinded him by smiting him upon the eyes ; now it deafened him by bellowing in his ears ; for even when the thunder came he knew now that it was the billows of the great ocean of the air dashing against each other in their haste to fill the hollow scooped out by the lightning ; now it took his breath quite away by sucking it from his body with the speed of its rush .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 7]: But he did not mind it .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 26]: He only gasped first and then laughed , for the arm of North Wind was about him , and he was leaning against her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 12]: It is quite impossible for me to describe what he saw .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 15]: Did you ever watch a great wave shoot into a winding passage amongst rocks ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 42]: If you ever did , you would see that the water rushed every way at once , some of it even turning back and opposing the rest ; greater confusion you might see nowhere except in a crowd of frightened people .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 46]: Well , the wind was like that , except that it went much faster , and therefore was much wilder , and twisted and shot and curled and dodged and clashed and raved ten times more madly than anything else in creation except human passions .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 13]: Diamond saw the threads of the lady 's hair streaking it all .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 18]: In parts indeed he could not tell which was hair and which was black storm and vapour .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 30]: It seemed sometimes that all the great billows of mist-muddy wind were woven out of the crossing lines of North Wind 's infinite hair , sweeping in endless intertwistings .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 39]: And Diamond felt as the wind seized on his hair , which his mother kept rather long , as if he too was a part of the storm , and some of its life went out from him .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 52]: But so sheltered was he by North Wind 's arm and bosom that only at times , in the fiercer onslaught of some curl-billowed eddy , did he recognise for a moment how wild was the storm in which he was carried , nestling in its very core and formative centre .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 25]: It seemed to Diamond likewise that they were motionless in this centre , and that all the confusion and fighting went on around them .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 51]: Flash after flash illuminated the fierce chaos , revealing in varied yellow and blue and grey and dusky red the vapourous contention ; peal after peal of thunder tore the infinite waste ; but it seemed to Diamond that North Wind and he were motionless , all but the hair .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 5]: It was not so .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 14]: They were sweeping with the speed of the wind itself towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 20]: THE CATHEDRAL I MUST not go on describing what can not be described , for nothing is more wearisome .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 19]: Before they reached the sea , Diamond felt North Wind 's hair just beginning to fall about him .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 10]: `` Is the storm over , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 4]: he called out .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 5]: `` No , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 11]: I am only waiting a moment to set you down .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 30]: You would not like to see the ship sunk , and I am going to give you a place to stop in till I come back for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 7]: thank you , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 23]: `` I shall be sorry to leave you , North Wind , but I would rather not see the ship go down .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 16]: And I 'm afraid the poor people will cry , and I should hear them .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 5]: Oh , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 31]: `` There are a good many passengers on board ; and to tell the truth , Diamond , I do n't care about your hearing the cry you speak of .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 20]: I am afraid you would not get it out of your little head again for a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 12]: `` But how can you bear it then , North Wind ?
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: For I am sure you are kind .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 8]: I shall never doubt that again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 41]: `` I will tell you how I am able to bear it , Diamond : I am always hearing , through every noise , through all the noise I am making myself even , the sound of a far-off song .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 74]: I do not exactly know where it is , or what it means ; and I do n't hear much of it , only the odour of its music , as it were , flitting across the great billows of the ocean outside this air in which I make such a storm ; but what I do hear is quite enough to make me able to bear the cry from the drowning ship .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 11]: So it would you if you could hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 13]: `` No , it would n't , '' returned Diamond , stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 26]: `` For they would n't hear the music of the far-away song ; and if they did , it would n't do them any good .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 20]: You see you and I are not going to be drowned , and so we might enjoy it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 19]: `` But you have never heard the psalm , and you do n't know what it is like .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 27]: Somehow , I ca n't say how , it tells me that all is right ; that it is coming to swallow up all cries . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 20]: `` But that wo n't do them any good -- the people , I mean , '' persisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 4]: `` It must .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 10]: It must , '' said North Wind , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 34]: `` It would n't be the song it seems to be if it did not swallow up all their fear and pain too , and set them singing it themselves with the rest .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: I am sure it will .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 35]: And do you know , ever since I knew I had hair , that is , ever since it began to go out and away , that song has been coming nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 15]: Only I must say it was some thousand years before I heard it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 18]: `` But how can you say it was coming nearer when you did not hear it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 5]: asked doubting little Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 31]: `` Since I began to hear it , I know it is growing louder , therefore I judge it was coming nearer and nearer until I did hear it first .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 50]: I 'm not so very old , you know -- a few thousand years only -- and I was quite a baby when I heard the noise first , but I knew it must come from the voices of people ever so much older and wiser than I was .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 37]: I ca n't sing at all , except now and then , and I can never tell what my song is going to be ; I only know what it is after I have sung it .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 7]: -- But this will never do .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 6]: Will you stop here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 13]: `` I ca n't see anywhere to stop , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 29]: `` Your hair is all down like a darkness , and I ca n't see through it if I knock my eyes into it ever so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 39]: `` Look , then , '' said North Wind ; and , with one sweep of her great white arm , she swept yards deep of darkness like a great curtain from before the face of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 11]: it was a blue night , lit up with stars .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 43]: Where it did not shine with stars it shimmered with the milk of the stars , except where , just opposite to Diamond 's face , the grey towers of a cathedral blotted out each its own shape of sky and stars .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 5]: what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 40]: cried Diamond , struck with a kind of terror , for he had never seen a cathedral , and it rose before him with an awful reality in the midst of the wide spaces , conquering emptiness with grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 16]: `` A very good place for you to wait in , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 15]: `` But we shall go in , and you shall judge for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 26]: There was an open door in the middle of one of the towers , leading out upon the roof , and through it they passed .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 40]: Then North Wind set Diamond on his feet , and he found himself at the top of a stone stair , which went twisting away down into the darkness for only a little light came in at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 18]: It was enough , however , to allow Diamond to see that North Wind stood beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 30]: He looked up to find her face , and saw that she was no longer a beautiful giantess , but the tall gracious lady he liked best to see .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 79]: She took his hand , and , giving him the broad part of the spiral stair to walk on , led him down a good way ; then , opening another little door , led him out upon a narrow gallery that ran all round the central part of the church , on the ledges of the windows of the clerestory , and through openings in the parts of the wall that divided the windows from each other .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 27]: It was very narrow , and except when they were passing through the wall , Diamond saw nothing to keep him from falling into the church .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 25]: It lay below him like a great silent gulf hollowed in stone , and he held his breath for fear as he looked down .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 11]: `` What are you trembling for , little Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 34]: said the lady , as she walked gently along , with her hand held out behind her leading him , for there was not breadth enough for them to walk side by side .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 13]: `` I am afraid of falling down there , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 8]: `` It is so deep down . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 24]: `` Yes , rather , '' answered North Wind ; `` but you were a hundred times higher a few minutes ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 34]: `` Ah , yes , but somebody 's arm was about me then , '' said Diamond , putting his little mouth to the beautiful cold hand that had a hold of his .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 12]: `` What a dear little warm mouth you 've got ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 4]: said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 12]: `` It is a pity you should talk nonsense with it .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 12]: Do n't you know I have a hold of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 17]: `` Yes ; but I 'm walking on my own legs , and they might slip .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: I ca n't trust myself so well as your arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 17]: `` But I have a hold of you , I tell you , foolish child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 12]: `` Yes , but somehow I ca n't feel comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 47]: `` If you were to fall , and my hold of you were to give way , I should be down after you in a less moment than a lady 's watch can tick , and catch you long before you had reached the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 12]: `` I do n't like it though , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 2]: oh !
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 3]: oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 37]: he screamed the next moment , bent double with terror , for North Wind had let go her hold of his hand , and had vanished , leaving him standing as if rooted to the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 16]: She left the words , `` Come after me , '' sounding in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 6]: But move he dared not .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 56]: In a moment more he would from very terror have fallen into the church , but suddenly there came a gentle breath of cool wind upon his face , and it kept blowing upon him in little puffs , and at every puff Diamond felt his faintness going away , and his fear with it .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 56]: Courage was reviving in his little heart , and still the cool wafts of the soft wind breathed upon him , and the soft wind was so mighty and strong within its gentleness , that in a minute more Diamond was marching along the narrow ledge as fearless for the time as North Wind herself .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 93]: He walked on and on , with the windows all in a row on one side of him , and the great empty nave of the church echoing to every one of his brave strides on the other , until at last he came to a little open door , from which a broader stair led him down and down and down , till at last all at once he found himself in the arms of North Wind , who held him close to her , and kissed him on the forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 24]: Diamond nestled to her , and murmured into her bosom , -- `` Why did you leave me , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 13]: `` Because I wanted you to walk alone , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 10]: `` But it is so much nicer here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 16]: `` I daresay ; but I could n't hold a little coward to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 8]: It would make me so cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 36]: `` But I was n't brave of myself , '' said Diamond , whom my older readers will have already discovered to be a true child in this , that he was given to metaphysics .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 15]: `` It was the wind that blew in my face that made me brave .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 9]: Was n't it now , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 7]: `` Yes : I know that .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 9]: You had to be taught what courage was .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 18]: And you could n't know what it was without feeling it : therefore it was given you .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 18]: But do n't you feel as if you would try to be brave yourself next time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: But trying is not much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 17]: `` Yes , it is -- a very great deal , for it is a beginning .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 10]: And a beginning is the greatest thing of all .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 10]: To try to be brave is to be brave .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 27]: The coward who tries to be brave is before the man who is brave because he is made so , and never had to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 10]: `` How kind you are , North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 6]: `` I am only just .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 6]: All kindness is but justice .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 5]: We owe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 9]: `` I do n't quite understand that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: `` Never mind ; you will some day .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 10]: There is no hurry about understanding it now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 13]: `` Who blew the wind on me that made me brave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 5]: `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 8]: `` I did n't see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 8]: `` Therefore you can believe me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes ; of course .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 15]: But how was it that such a little breath could be so strong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 8]: `` That I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 8]: `` But you made it strong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 8]: `` No : I only blew it .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 21]: I knew it would make you strong , just as it did the man in the boat , you remember .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 12]: But how my breath has that power I can not tell .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 10]: It was put into it when I was made .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 6]: That is all I know .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 11]: But really I must be going about my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 4]: the poor ship !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 15]: I wish you would stop here , and let the poor ship go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: `` That I dare not do .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 10]: Will you stop here till I come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 7]: You wo n't be long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 8]: `` Not longer than I can help .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 12]: Trust me , you shall get home before the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 27]: In a moment North Wind was gone , and the next Diamond heard a moaning about the church , which grew and grew to a roaring .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 17]: The storm was up again , and he knew that North Wind 's hair was flying .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 5]: The church was dark .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 28]: Only a little light came through the windows , which were almost all of that precious old stained glass which is so much lovelier than the new .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 27]: But Diamond could not see how beautiful they were , for there was not enough of light in the stars to show the colours of them .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 26]: He could only just distinguish them from the walls , He looked up , but could not see the gallery along which he had passed .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 27]: He could only tell where it was far up by the faint glimmer of the windows of the clerestory , whose sills made part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 22]: The church grew very lonely about him , and he began to feel like a child whose mother has forsaken it .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 15]: Only he knew that to be left alone is not always to be forsaken .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 20]: He began to feel his way about the place , and for a while went wandering up and down .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 12]: His little footsteps waked little answering echoes in the great house .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 9]: It was n't too big to mind him .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 19]: It was as if the church knew he was there , and meant to make itself his house .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 34]: So it went on giving back an answer to every step , until at length Diamond thought he should like to say something out loud , and see what the church would answer .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 9]: But he found he was afraid to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: He could not utter a word for fear of the loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 30]: Perhaps it was as well that he did not , for the sound of a spoken word would have made him feel the place yet more deserted and empty .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 7]: But he thought he could sing .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 27]: He was fond of singing , and at home he used to sing , to tunes of his own , all the nursery rhymes he knew .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 17]: So he began to try ` Hey diddle diddle ' , but it would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 15]: Then he tried ` Little Boy Blue ' , but it was no better .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 14]: Neither would ` Sing a Song of Sixpence ' sing itself at all .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 15]: Then he tried ` Poor old Cockytoo ' , but he would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 6]: They all sounded so silly !
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 9]: and he had never thought them silly before .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 23]: So he was quiet , and listened to the echoes that came out of the dark corners in answer to his footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 18]: At last he gave a great sigh , and said , `` I 'm so tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 45]: But he did not hear the gentle echo that answered from far away over his head , for at the same moment he came against the lowest of a few steps that stretched across the church , and fell down and hurt his arm .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 18]: He cried a little first , and then crawled up the steps on his hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 37]: At the top he came to a little bit of carpet , on which he lay down ; and there he lay staring at the dull window that rose nearly a hundred feet above his head .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 25]: Now this was the eastern window of the church , and the moon was at that moment just on the edge of the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: The next , she was peeping over it .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 3]: And lo !
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 27]: with the moon , St. John and St. Paul , and the rest of them , began to dawn in the window in their lovely garments .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 69]: Diamond did not know that the wonder-working moon was behind , and he thought all the light was coming out of the window itself , and that the good old men were appearing to help him , growing out of the night and the darkness , because he had hurt his arm , and was very tired and lonely , and North Wind was so long in coming .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 25]: So he lay and looked at them backwards over his head , wondering when they would come down or what they would do next .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 32]: They were very dim , for the moonlight was not strong enough for the colours , and he had enough to do with his eyes trying to make out their shapes .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 28]: So his eyes grew tired , and more and more tired , and his eyelids grew so heavy that they would keep tumbling down over his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 18]: He kept lifting them and lifting them , but every time they were heavier than the last .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 12]: It was no use : they were too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 36]: Sometimes before he had got them half up , down they were again ; and at length he gave it up quite , and the moment he gave it up , he was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 23]: THE EAST WINDOW THAT Diamond had fallen fast asleep is very evident from the strange things he now fancied as taking place .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 16]: For he thought he heard a sound as of whispering up in the great window .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 12]: He tried to open his eyes , but he could not .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 21]: And the whispering went on and grew louder and louder , until he could hear every word that was said .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 10]: He thought it was the Apostles talking about him .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 8]: But he could not open his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 14]: `` And how comes he to be lying there , St. Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 3]: said one .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 19]: `` I think I saw him a while ago up in the gallery , under the Nicodemus window .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: Perhaps he has fallen down .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 10]: `` What do you think , St. Matthew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 17]: `` I do n't think he could have crept here after falling from such a height .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 7]: He must have been killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 9]: `` What are we to do with him ?
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 8]: We ca n't leave him lying there .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 19]: And we could not make him comfortable up here in the window : it 's rather crowded already .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 9]: What do you say , St. Thomas ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 11]: `` Let 's go down and look at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 38]: There came a rustling , and a chinking , for some time , and then there was a silence , and Diamond felt somehow that all the Apostles were standing round him and looking down on him .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 9]: And still he could not open his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 12]: `` What is the matter with him , St. Luke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 3]: asked one .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 32]: `` There 's nothing the matter with him , '' answered St. Luke , who must have joined the company of the Apostles from the next window , one would think .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: `` He 's in a sound sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 9]: `` I have it , '' cried another .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 10]: `` This is one of North Wind 's tricks .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 21]: She has caught him up and dropped him at our door , like a withered leaf or a foundling baby .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 13]: I do n't understand that woman 's conduct , I must say .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 22]: As if we had n't enough to do with our money , without going taking care of other people 's children !
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: That 's not what our forefathers built cathedrals for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 24]: Now Diamond could not bear to hear such things against North Wind , who , he knew , never played anybody a trick .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 12]: She was far too busy with her own work for that .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 12]: He struggled hard to open his eyes , but without success .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 27]: `` She should consider that a church is not a place for pranks , not to mention that we live in it , '' said another .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 8]: `` It certainly is disrespectful of her .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 6]: But she always is disrespectful .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 20]: What right has she to bang at our windows as she has been doing the whole of this night ?
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 8]: I daresay there is glass broken somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 19]: I know my blue robe is in a dreadful mess with the rain first and the dust after .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: It will cost me shillings to clean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 14]: Then Diamond knew that they could not be Apostles , talking like this .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 57]: They could only be the sextons and vergers and such-like , who got up at night , and put on the robes of deans and bishops , and called each other grand names , as the foolish servants he had heard his father tell of call themselves lords and ladies , after their masters and mistresses .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 30]: And he was so angry at their daring to abuse North Wind , that he jumped up , crying -- `` North Wind knows best what she is about .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 21]: She has a good right to blow the cobwebs from your windows , for she was sent to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 23]: She sweeps them away from grander places , I can tell you , for I 've been with her at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 71]: This was what he began to say , but as he spoke his eyes came wide open , and behold , there were neither Apostles nor vergers there -- not even a window with the effigies of holy men in it , but a dark heap of hay all about him , and the little panes in the roof of his loft glimmering blue in the light of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 11]: Old Diamond was coming awake down below in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 23]: In a moment more he was on his feet , and shaking himself so that young Diamond 's bed trembled under him .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 12]: `` He 's grand at shaking himself , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 10]: `` I wish I could shake myself like that .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 12]: But then I can wash myself , and he ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 19]: What fun it would be to see Old Diamond washing his face with his hoofs and iron shoes !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 8]: Would n't it be a picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 10]: So saying , he got up and dressed himself .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 8]: Then he went out into the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 49]: There must have been a tremendous wind in the night , for although all was quiet now , there lay the little summer-house crushed to the ground , and over it the great elm-tree , which the wind had broken across , being much decayed in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 61]: Diamond almost cried to see the wilderness of green leaves , which used to be so far up in the blue air , tossing about in the breeze , and liking it best when the wind blew it most , now lying so near the ground , and without any hope of ever getting up into the deep air again .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 10]: `` I wonder how old the tree is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 3]: thought Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 20]: `` It must take a long time to get so near the sky as that poor tree was . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 21]: `` Yes , indeed , '' said a voice beside him , for Diamond had spoken the last words aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 23]: Diamond started , and looking around saw a clergyman , a brother of Mrs. Coleman , who happened to be visiting her .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 15]: He was a great scholar , and was in the habit of rising early .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 9]: `` Who are you , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 3]: he added .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 9]: `` Little Diamond , '' answered the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 6]: I have heard of you .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 11]: How do you come to be up so early ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 15]: `` Because the sham Apostles talked such nonsense , they waked me up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 4]: The clergyman stared .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 18]: Diamond saw that he had better have held his tongue , for he could not explain things .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 15]: `` You must have been dreaming , my little man , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 3]: `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 3]: dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 17]: he went on , looking at the tree , `` there has been terrible work here .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 8]: This is the north wind 's doing .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 4]: What a pity !
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 15]: I wish we lived at the back of it , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 7]: `` Where is that sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 14]: `` Away in the Hyperborean regions , '' answered the clergyman , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 12]: `` I never heard of the place , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 36]: `` I daresay not , '' answered the clergyman ; `` but if this tree had been there now , it would not have been blown down , for there is no wind there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 30]: `` But , please , sir , if it had been there , '' said Diamond , `` we should not have had to be sorry for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 5]: `` Certainly not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 16]: `` Then we should n't have had to be glad for it , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 36]: `` You 're quite right , my boy , '' said the clergyman , looking at him very kindly , as he turned away to the house , with his eyes bent towards the earth .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 24]: But Diamond thought within himself , `` I will ask North Wind next time I see her to take me to that country .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 11]: I think she did speak about it once before . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 29]: HOW DIAMOND GOT TO THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND WHEN Diamond went home to breakfast , he found his father and mother already seated at the table .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 20]: They were both busy with their bread and butter , and Diamond sat himself down in his usual place .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 32]: His mother looked up at him , and , after watching him for a moment , said : `` I do n't think the boy is looking well , husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 5]: `` Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 7]: Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 7]: I think he looks pretty bobbish .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 12]: How do you feel yourself , Diamond , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 22]: `` Quite well , thank you , father ; at least , I think I 've got a little headache . ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 14]: I told you , '' said his father and mother both at once .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 11]: `` The child 's very poorly '' added his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 12]: `` The child 's quite well , '' added his father .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 6]: And then they both laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 22]: `` You see , '' said his mother , `` I 've had a letter from my sister at Sandwich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: `` Sleepy old hole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 19]: `` Do n't abuse the place ; there 's good people in it , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 32]: `` Right , old lady , '' returned his father ; `` only I do n't believe there are more than two pair of carriage-horses in the whole blessed place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 17]: `` Well , people can get to heaven without carriages -- or coachmen either , husband .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 14]: Not that I should like to go without my coachman , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 6]: But about the boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 5]: `` What boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 14]: `` That boy , there , staring at you with his goggle-eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: `` Have I got goggle-eyes , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: asked Diamond , a little dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 29]: `` Not too goggle , '' said his mother , who was quite proud of her boy 's eyes , only did not want to make him vain .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 13]: `` Not too goggle ; only you need not stare so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 8]: `` Well , what about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 11]: `` I told you I had got a letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 12]: `` Yes , from your sister ; not from Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 5]: `` La , husband !
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 18]: you 've got out of bed the wrong leg first this morning , I do believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 17]: `` I always get out with both at once , '' said his father , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 6]: `` Well , listen then .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 13]: His aunt wants the boy to go down and see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 18]: `` And that 's why you want to make out that he ai n't looking well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 6]: `` No more he is .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 8]: I think he had better go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 20]: `` Well , I do n't care , if you can find the money , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 23]: `` I 'll manage that , '' said his mother ; and so it was agreed that Diamond should go to Sandwich .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 9]: I will not describe the preparations Diamond made .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 15]: You would have thought he had been going on a three months ' voyage .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 16]: Nor will I describe the journey , for our business is now at the place .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 31]: He was met at the station by his aunt , a cheerful middle-aged woman , and conveyed in safety to the sleepy old town , as his father called it .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 17]: And no wonder that it was sleepy , for it was nearly dead of old age .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 23]: Diamond went about staring with his beautiful goggle-eyes , at the quaint old streets , and the shops , and the houses .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 34]: Everything looked very strange , indeed ; for here was a town abandoned by its nurse , the sea , like an old oyster left on the shore till it gaped for weariness .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 80]: It used to be one of the five chief seaports in England , but it began to hold itself too high , and the consequence was the sea grew less and less intimate with it , gradually drew back , and kept more to itself , till at length it left it high and dry : Sandwich was a seaport no more ; the sea went on with its own tide-business a long way off , and forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 16]: Of course it went to sleep , and had no more to do with ships .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 25]: That 's what comes to cities and nations , and boys and girls , who say , `` I can do without your help .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 7]: I 'm enough for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 45]: Diamond soon made great friends with an old woman who kept a toyshop , for his mother had given him twopence for pocket-money before he left , and he had gone into her shop to spend it , and she got talking to him .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 38]: She looked very funny , because she had not got any teeth , but Diamond liked her , and went often to her shop , although he had nothing to spend there after the twopence was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 15]: One afternoon he had been wandering rather wearily about the streets for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 11]: It was a hot day , and he felt tired .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 10]: As he passed the toyshop , he stepped in .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 14]: `` Please may I sit down for a minute on this box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 13]: he said , thinking the old woman was somewhere in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 12]: But he got no answer , and sat down without one .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 18]: Around him were a great many toys of all prices , from a penny up to shillings .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 12]: All at once he heard a gentle whirring somewhere amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 9]: It made him start and look behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 17]: There were the sails of a windmill going round and round almost close to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 49]: He thought at first it must be one of those toys which are wound up and go with clockwork ; but no , it was a common penny toy , with the windmill at the end of a whistle , and when the whistle blows the windmill goes .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 35]: But the wonder was that there was no one at the whistle end blowing , and yet the sails were turning round and round -- now faster , now slower , now faster again .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 7]: `` What can it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 5]: said Diamond , aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 15]: `` It means me , '' said the tiniest voice he had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 8]: `` Who are you , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 18]: `` Well , really , I begin to be ashamed of you , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 30]: `` I wonder how long it will be before you know me ; or how often I might take you in before you got sharp enough to suspect me .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 19]: You are as bad as a baby that does n't know his mother in a new bonnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 41]: `` Not quite so bad as that , dear North Wind , '' said Diamond , `` for I did n't see you at all , and indeed I do n't see you yet , although I recognise your voice .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 8]: Do grow a little , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 23]: `` Not a hair 's - breadth , '' said the voice , and it was the smallest voice that ever spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 8]: `` What are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 9]: `` I am come to see my aunt .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 22]: But , please , North Wind , why did n't you come back for me in the church that night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 4]: `` I did .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 6]: I carried you safe home .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 19]: All the time you were dreaming about the glass Apostles , you were lying in my arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 10]: `` I 'm so glad , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 17]: `` I thought that must be it , only I wanted to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: Did you sink the ship , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 6]: `` And drown everybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 4]: `` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 13]: One boat got away with six or seven men in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 13]: `` How could the boat swim when the ship could n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 10]: `` Of course I had some trouble with it .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 14]: I had to contrive a bit , and manage the waves a little .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 19]: When they 're once thoroughly waked up , I have a good deal of trouble with them sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 14]: They 're apt to get stupid with tumbling over each other 's heads .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 9]: That 's when they 're fairly at it .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 15]: However , the boat got to a desert island before noon next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 10]: `` And what good will come of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 4]: I obeyed orders .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 4]: Good bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 9]: stay , North Wind , do stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 13]: cried Diamond , dismayed to see the windmill get slower and slower .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 10]: `` What is it , my dear child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 19]: said North Wind , and the windmill began turning again so swiftly that Diamond could scarcely see it .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 9]: `` What a big voice you 've got !
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 10]: and what a noise you do make with it ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 6]: What is it you want ?
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 14]: I have little to do , but that little must be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 19]: `` I want you to take me to the country at the back of the north wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 26]: `` That 's not so easy , '' said North Wind , and was silent for so long that Diamond thought she was gone indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 14]: But after he had quite given her up , the voice began again .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 13]: `` I almost wish old Herodotus had held his tongue about it .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 7]: Much he knew of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 11]: `` Why do you wish that , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 19]: `` Because then that clergyman would never have heard of it , and set you wanting to go .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 5]: But we shall see .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 4]: We shall see .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 28]: You must go home now , my dear , for you do n't seem very well , and I 'll see what can be done for you .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 6]: Do n't wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 23]: I 've got to break a few of old Goody 's toys ; she 's thinking too much of her new stock .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 6]: Two or three will do .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 4]: go now . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 18]: Diamond rose , quite sorry , and without a word left the shop , and went home .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 32]: It soon appeared that his mother had been right about him , for that same afternoon his head began to ache very much , and he had to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 9]: He awoke in the middle of the night .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 24]: The lattice window of his room had blown open , and the curtains of his little bed were swinging about in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 10]: `` If that should be North Wind now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 3]: thought Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 20]: But the next moment he heard some one closing the window , and his aunt came to his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 20]: She put her hand on his face , and said -- `` How 's your head , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 9]: `` Better , auntie , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: `` Would you like something to drink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 6]: I should , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 41]: So his aunt gave him some lemonade , for she had been used to nursing sick people , and Diamond felt very much refreshed , and laid his head down again to go very fast asleep , as he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 26]: And so he did , but only to come awake again , as a fresh burst of wind blew the lattice open a second time .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 31]: The same moment he found himself in a cloud of North Wind 's hair , with her beautiful face , set in it like a moon , bending over him .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 6]: `` Quick , Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 9]: `` I have found such a chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 11]: `` But I 'm not well , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 16]: `` I know that , but you will be better for a little fresh air .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 8]: You shall have plenty of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 10]: `` You want me to go , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 7]: It wo n't hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 23]: `` Very well , '' said Diamond ; and getting out of the bed-clothes , he jumped into North Wind 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 27]: `` We must make haste before your aunt comes , '' said she , as she glided out of the open lattice and left it swinging .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 15]: The moment Diamond felt her arms fold around him he began to feel better .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 19]: It was a moonless night , and very dark , with glimpses of stars when the clouds parted .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 32]: `` I used to dash the waves about here , '' said North Wind , `` where cows and sheep are feeding now ; but we shall soon get to them .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 5]: There they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 17]: And Diamond , looking down , saw the white glimmer of breaking water far below him .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 49]: `` You see , Diamond , '' said North Wind , `` it is very difficult for me to get you to the back of the north wind , for that country lies in the very north itself , and of course I ca n't blow northwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 6]: `` You little silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 4]: said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 35]: `` Do n't you see that if I were to blow northwards I should be South Wind , and that is as much as to say that one person could be two persons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 14]: `` But how can you ever get home at all , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 21]: `` You are quite right -- that is my home , though I never get farther than the outer door .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 12]: I sit on the doorstep , and hear the voices inside .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 8]: I am nobody there , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 7]: `` I 'm very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 8]: `` That you should be nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 4]: Dear little man !
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: you will be very glad some day to be nobody yourself .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 39]: But you ca n't understand that now , and you had better not try ; for if you do , you will be certain to go fancying some egregious nonsense , and making yourself miserable about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 10]: `` Then I wo n't , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 7]: `` There 's a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 9]: It will all come in good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 18]: `` But you have n't told me how you get to the doorstep , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 8]: `` It is easy enough for me .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 14]: I have only to consent to be nobody , and there I am .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 12]: I draw into myself and there I am on the doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 43]: But you can easily see , or you have less sense than I think , that to drag you , you heavy thing , along with me , would take centuries , and I could not give the time to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 9]: `` Oh , I 'm so sorry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 8]: `` What for now , pet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 9]: `` That I 'm so heavy for you .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 16]: I would be lighter if I could , but I do n't know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 5]: `` You silly darling !
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 15]: Why , I could toss you a hundred miles from me if I liked .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 16]: It is only when I am going home that I shall find you heavy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 10]: `` Then you are going home with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 12]: Did I not come to fetch you just for that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 12]: `` But all this time you must be going southwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 6]: Of course I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 12]: `` How can you be taking me northwards , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 6]: `` A very sensible question .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 5]: But you shall see .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 19]: I will get rid of a few of these clouds -- only they do come up so fast !
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 10]: It 's like trying to blow a brook dry .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 7]: What do you see now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 16]: `` I think I see a little boat , away there , down below . ''
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 7]: `` A little boat , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 36]: She 's a yacht of two hundred tons ; and the captain of it is a friend of mine ; for he is a man of good sense , and can sail his craft well .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 13]: I 've helped him many a time when he little thought it .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 20]: I 've heard him grumbling at me , when I was doing the very best I could for him .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 19]: Why , I 've carried him eighty miles a day , again and again , right north . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 32]: `` He must have dodged for that , '' said Diamond , who had been watching the vessels , and had seen that they went other ways than the wind blew .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 6]: `` Of course he must .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 14]: But do n't you see , it was the best I could do ?
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 7]: I could n't be South Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 11]: And besides it gave him a share in the business .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 30]: It is not good at all -- mind that , Diamond -- to do everything for those you love , and not give them a share in the doing .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 5]: It 's not kind .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 11]: It 's making too much of yourself , my child .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 23]: If I had been South Wind , he would only have smoked his pipe all day , and made himself stupid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 24]: `` But how could he be a man of sense and grumble at you when you were doing your best for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 20]: you must make allowances , '' said North Wind , `` or you will never do justice to anybody .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 29]: -- You do understand , then , that a captain may sail north -- '' `` In spite of a north wind -- yes , '' supplemented Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 18]: `` Now , I do think you must be stupid , my dear '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 15]: `` Suppose the north wind did not blow where would he be then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 11]: `` Why then the south wind would carry him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 15]: `` So you think that when the north wind stops the south wind blows .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 2]: Nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 17]: If I did n't blow , the captain could n't sail his eighty miles a day .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 30]: No doubt South Wind would carry him faster , but South Wind is sitting on her doorstep then , and if I stopped there would be a dead calm .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 28]: So you are all wrong to say he can sail north in spite of me ; he sails north by my help , and my help alone .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 7]: You see that , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 9]: `` Yes , I do , North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 14]: I am stupid , but I do n't want to be stupid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 4]: `` Good boy !
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 22]: I am going to blow you north in that little craft , one of the finest that ever sailed the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 8]: Here we are , right over it .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 24]: I shall be blowing against you ; you will be sailing against me ; and all will be just as we want it .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 24]: The captain wo n't get on so fast as he would like , but he will get on , and so shall we .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 10]: I 'm just going to put you on board .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 37]: Do you see in front of the tiller -- that thing the man is working , now to one side , now to the other -- a round thing like the top of a drum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 18]: `` Below that is where they keep their spare sails , and some stores of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: I am going to blow that cover off .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 16]: The same moment I will drop you on deck , and you must tumble in .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 18]: Do n't be afraid , it is of no depth , and you will fall on sail-cloth .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 28]: You will find it nice and warm and dry-only dark ; and you will know I am near you by every roll and pitch of the vessel .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 8]: Coil yourself up and go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 14]: The yacht shall be my cradle and you shall be my baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 8]: `` Thank you , dear North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 11]: I am not a bit afraid , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 29]: In a moment they were on a level with the bulwarks , and North Wind sent the hatch of the after-store rattling away over the deck to leeward .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 33]: The next , Diamond found himself in the dark , for he had tumbled through the hole as North Wind had told him , and the cover was replaced over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 18]: Away he went rolling to leeward , for the wind began all at once to blow hard .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 43]: He heard the call of the captain , and the loud trampling of the men over his head , as they hauled at the main sheet to get the boom on board that they might take in a reef in the mainsail .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 22]: Diamond felt about until he had found what seemed the most comfortable place , and there he snuggled down and lay .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 19]: Hours after hours , a great many of them , went by ; and still Diamond lay there .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 18]: He never felt in the least tired or impatient , for a strange pleasure filled his heart .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 136]: The straining of the masts , the creaking of the boom , the singing of the ropes , the banging of the blocks as they put the vessel about , all fell in with the roaring of the wind above , the surge of the waves past her sides , and the thud with which every now and then one would strike her ; while through it all Diamond could hear the gurgling , rippling , talking flow of the water against her planks , as she slipped through it , lying now on this side , now on that -- like a subdued air running through the grand music his North Wind was making about him to keep him from tiring as they sped on towards the country at the back of her doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 9]: How long this lasted Diamond had no idea .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 18]: He seemed to fall asleep sometimes , only through the sleep he heard the sounds going on .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: At length the weather seemed to get worse .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 42]: The confusion and trampling of feet grew more frequent over his head ; the vessel lay over more and more on her side , and went roaring through the waves , which banged and thumped at her as if in anger .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 8]: All at once arose a terrible uproar .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 32]: The hatch was blown off ; a cold fierce wind swept in upon him ; and a long arm came with it which laid hold of him and lifted him out .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 14]: The same moment he saw the little vessel far below him righting herself .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 21]: She had taken in all her sails and lay now tossing on the waves like a sea-bird with folded wings .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 28]: A short distance to the south lay a much larger vessel , with two or three sails set , and towards it North Wind was carrying Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 14]: It was a German ship , on its way to the North Pole .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 30]: `` That vessel down there will give us a lift now , '' said North Wind ; `` and after that I must do the best I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 30]: She managed to hide him amongst the flags of the big ship , which were all snugly stowed away , and on and on they sped towards the north .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 29]: At length one night she whispered in his ear , `` Come on deck , Diamond ; '' and he got up at once and crept on deck .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 5]: Everything looked very strange .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 31]: Here and there on all sides were huge masses of floating ice , looking like cathedrals , and castles , and crags , while away beyond was a blue sea .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 9]: `` Is the sun rising or setting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 9]: `` Neither or both , which you please .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 7]: I can hardly tell which myself .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 15]: If he is setting now , he will be rising the next moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 9]: `` What a strange light it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 19]: `` I have heard that the sun does n't go to bed all the summer in these parts .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 6]: Miss Coleman told me that .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 23]: I suppose he feels very sleepy , and that is why the light he sends out looks so like a dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 18]: `` That will account for it well enough for all practical purposes , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 16]: Some of the icebergs were drifting northwards ; one was passing very near the ship .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 27]: North Wind seized Diamond , and with a single bound lighted on one of them -- a huge thing , with sharp pinnacles and great clefts .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 12]: The same instant a wind began to blow from the south .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 38]: North Wind hurried Diamond down the north side of the iceberg , stepping by its jags and splintering ; for this berg had never got far enough south to be melted and smoothed by the summer sun .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 31]: She brought him to a cave near the water , where she entered , and , letting Diamond go , sat down as if weary on a ledge of ice .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 24]: Diamond seated himself on the other side , and for a while was enraptured with the colour of the air inside the cave .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 19]: It was a deep , dazzling , lovely blue , deeper than the deepest blue of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 25]: The blue seemed to be in constant motion , like the blackness when you press your eyeballs with your fingers , boiling and sparkling .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: But when he looked across to North Wind he was frightened ; her face was worn and livid .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 13]: `` What is the matter with you , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 4]: `` Nothing much .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 5]: I feel very faint .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 15]: But you must n't mind it , for I can bear it quite well .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 7]: South Wind always blows me faint .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 21]: If it were not for the cool of the thick ice between me and her , I should faint altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 13]: Indeed , as it is , I fear I must vanish . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 36]: Diamond stared at her in terror , for he saw that her form and face were growing , not small , but transparent , like something dissolving , not in water , but in light .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 14]: He could see the side of the blue cave through her very heart .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 29]: And she melted away till all that was left was a pale face , like the moon in the morning , with two great lucid eyes in it .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 11]: `` I am going , Diamond , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 7]: `` Does it hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 28]: `` It 's very uncomfortable , '' she answered ; `` but I do n't mind it , for I shall come all right again before long .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 19]: I thought I should be able to go with you all the way , but I can not .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 7]: You must not be frightened though .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 12]: Just go straight on , and you will come all right .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 9]: You 'll find me on the doorstep . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 25]: As she spoke , her face too faded quite away , only Diamond thought he could still see her eyes shining through the blue .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 23]: When he went closer , however , he found that what he thought her eyes were only two hollows in the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 21]: North Wind was quite gone ; and Diamond would have cried , if he had not trusted her so thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 40]: So he sat still in the blue air of the cavern listening to the wash and ripple of the water all about the base of the iceberg , as it sped on and on into the open sea northwards .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 24]: It was an excellent craft to go with the current , for there was twice as much of it below water as above .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 15]: But a light south wind was blowing too , and so it went fast .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 26]: After a little while Diamond went out and sat on the edge of his floating island , and looked down into the ocean beneath him .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 25]: The white sides of the berg reflected so much light below the water , that he could see far down into the green abyss .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 29]: Sometimes he fancied he saw the eyes of North Wind looking up at him from below , but the fancy never lasted beyond the moment of its birth .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 21]: And the time passed he did not know how , for he felt as if he were in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 57]: When he got tired of the green water , he went into the blue cave ; and when he got tired of the blue cave he went out and gazed all about him on the blue sea , ever sparkling in the sun , which kept wheeling about the sky , never going below the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 14]: But he chiefly gazed northwards , to see whether any land were appearing .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 9]: All this time he never wanted to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 22]: He broke off little bits of the berg now and then and sucked them , and he thought them very nice .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 46]: At length , one time he came out of his cave , he spied far off on the horizon , a shining peak that rose into the sky like the top of some tremendous iceberg ; and his vessel was bearing him straight towards it .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 32]: As it went on the peak rose and rose higher and higher above the horizon ; and other peaks rose after it , with sharp edges and jagged ridges connecting them .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 66]: Diamond thought this must be the place he was going to ; and he was right ; for the mountains rose and rose , till he saw the line of the coast at their feet and at length the iceberg drove into a little bay , all around which were lofty precipices with snow on their tops , and streaks of ice down their sides .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 10]: The berg floated slowly up to a projecting rock .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 26]: Diamond stepped on shore , and without looking behind him began to follow a natural path which led windingly towards the top of the precipice .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 24]: When he reached it , he found himself on a broad table of ice , along which he could walk without much difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 26]: Before him , at a considerable distance , rose a lofty ridge of ice , which shot up into fantastic pinnacles and towers and battlements .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 21]: The air was very cold , and seemed somehow dead , for there was not the slightest breath of wind .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 18]: In the centre of the ridge before him appeared a gap like the opening of a valley .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 63]: But as he walked towards it , gazing , and wondering whether that could be the way he had to take , he saw that what had appeared a gap was the form of a woman seated against the ice front of the ridge , leaning forwards with her hands in her lap , and her hair hanging down to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 18]: `` It is North Wind on her doorstep , '' said Diamond joyfully , and hurried on .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 36]: He soon came up to the place , and there the form sat , like one of the great figures at the door of an Egyptian temple , motionless , with drooping arms and head .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 13]: Then Diamond grew frightened , because she did not move nor speak .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 18]: He was sure it was North Wind , but he thought she must be dead at last .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 29]: Her face was white as the snow , her eyes were blue as the air in the ice-cave , and her hair hung down straight , like icicles .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 21]: She had on a greenish robe , like the colour in the hollows of a glacier seen from far off .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 22]: He stood up before her , and gazed fearfully into her face for a few minutes before he ventured to speak .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 21]: At length , with a great effort and a trembling voice , he faltered out -- `` North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 6]: `` Well , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 9]: said the form , without lifting its head .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 10]: `` Are you ill , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 5]: I am waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 7]: `` Till I 'm wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 18]: `` You do n't care for me any more , '' said Diamond , almost crying now .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: `` Yes I do .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 7]: Only I ca n't show it .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 12]: All my love is down at the bottom of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 8]: But I feel it bubbling there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 15]: `` What do you want me to do next , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 12]: said Diamond , wishing to show his love by being obedient .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 10]: `` What do you want to do yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 13]: `` I want to go into the country at your back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 9]: `` Then you must go through me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 10]: `` I do n't know what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 8]: `` I mean just what I say .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 19]: You must walk on as if I were an open door , and go right through me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 8]: `` But that will hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 8]: It will hurt you , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 16]: `` I do n't mind that , if you tell me to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 9]: `` Do it , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 6]: Diamond walked towards her instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 26]: When he reached her knees , he put out his hand to lay it on her , but nothing was there save an intense cold .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 4]: He walked on .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 15]: Then all grew white about him ; and the cold stung him like fire .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: He walked on still , groping through the whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 5]: It thickened about him .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 15]: At last , it got into his heart , and he lost all sense .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 25]: I would say that he fainted -- only whereas in common faints all grows black about you , he felt swallowed up in whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 15]: It was when he reached North Wind 's heart that he fainted and fell .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 26]: But as he fell , he rolled over the threshold , and it was thus that Diamond got to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 20]: AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I HAVE now come to the most difficult part of my story .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 9]: Because I do not know enough about it .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: And why should I not know as much about this part as about any other part ?
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 43]: For of course I could know nothing about the story except Diamond had told it ; and why should not Diamond tell about the country at the back of the north wind , as well as about his adventures in getting there ?
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 25]: Because , when he came back , he had forgotten a great deal , and what he did remember was very hard to tell .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 9]: Things there are so different from things here !
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 13]: The people there do not speak the same language for one thing .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 13]: Indeed , Diamond insisted that there they do not speak at all .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 18]: I do not think he was right , but it may well have appeared so to Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 17]: The fact is , we have different reports of the place from the most trustworthy people .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 15]: Therefore we are bound to believe that it appears somewhat different to different people .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 12]: All , however , agree in a general way about it .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 28]: I will tell you something of what two very different people have reported , both of whom knew more about it , I believe , than Herodotus .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 39]: One of them speaks from his own experience , for he visited the country ; the other from the testimony of a young peasant girl who came back from it for a month 's visit to her friends .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 31]: The former was a great Italian of noble family , who died more than five hundred years ago ; the latter a Scotch shepherd who died not forty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 32]: The Italian , then , informs us that he had to enter that country through a fire so hot that he would have thrown himself into boiling glass to cool himself .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 67]: This was not Diamond 's experience , but then Durante -- that was the name of the Italian , and it means Lasting , for his books will last as long as there are enough men in the world worthy of having them -- Durante was an elderly man , and Diamond was a little boy , and so their experience must be a little different .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 23]: The peasant girl , on the other hand , fell fast asleep in a wood , and woke in the same country .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 71]: In describing it , Durante says that the ground everywhere smelt sweetly , and that a gentle , even-tempered wind , which never blew faster or slower , breathed in his face as he went , making all the leaves point one way , not so as to disturb the birds in the tops of the trees , but , on the contrary , sounding a bass to their song .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 36]: He describes also a little river which was so full that its little waves , as it hurried along , bent the grass , full of red and yellow flowers , through which it flowed .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 52]: He says that the purest stream in the world beside this one would look as if it were mixed with something that did not belong to it , even although it was flowing ever in the brown shadow of the trees , and neither sun nor moon could shine upon it .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 16]: He seems to imply that it is always the month of May in that country .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 75]: It would be out of place to describe here the wonderful sights he saw , for the music of them is in another key from that of this story , and I shall therefore only add from the account of this traveller , that the people there are so free and so just and so healthy , that every one of them has a crown like a king and a mitre like a priest .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 74]: The peasant girl -- Kilmeny was her name -- could not report such grand things as Durante , for , as the shepherd says , telling her story as I tell Diamond 's -- `` Kilmeny had been she knew not where , And Kilmeny had seen what she could not declare ; Kilmeny had been where the cock never crew , Where the rain never fell , and the wind never blew .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 93]: But it seemed as the harp of the sky had rung , And the airs of heaven played round her tongue , When she spoke of the lovely forms she had seen , And a land where sin had never been ; A land of love and a land of light , Withouten sun , or moon , or night ; Where the river swayed a living stream , And the light a pure and cloudless beam : The land of vision it would seem , And still an everlasting dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 17]: The last two lines are the shepherd 's own remark , and a matter of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 37]: But it is clear , I think , that Kilmeny must have described the same country as Durante saw , though , not having his experience , she could neither understand nor describe it so well .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 19]: Now I must give you such fragments of recollection as Diamond was able to bring back with him .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 20]: When he came to himself after he fell , he found himself at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 9]: North Wind herself was nowhere to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 13]: Neither was there a vestige of snow or of ice within sight .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 23]: The sun too had vanished ; but that was no matter , for there was plenty of a certain still rayless light .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 19]: Where it came from he never found out ; but he thought it belonged to the country itself .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 21]: Sometimes he thought it came out of the flowers , which were very bright , but had no strong colour .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 52]: He said the river -- for all agree that there is a river there -- flowed not only through , but over grass : its channel , instead of being rock , stones , pebbles , sand , or anything else , was of pure meadow grass , not over long .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 70]: He insisted that if it did not sing tunes in people 's ears , it sung tunes in their heads , in proof of which I may mention that , in the troubles which followed , Diamond was often heard singing ; and when asked what he was singing , would answer , `` One of the tunes the river at the back of the north wind sung . ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 51]: And I may as well say at once that Diamond never told these things to any one but -- no , I had better not say who it was ; but whoever it was told me , and I thought it would be well to write them for my child-readers .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 51]: He could not say he was very happy there , for he had neither his father nor mother with him , but he felt so still and quiet and patient and contented , that , as far as the mere feeling went , it was something better than mere happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: Nothing went wrong at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 9]: Neither was anything quite right , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 10]: Only everything was going to be right some day .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 29]: His account disagreed with that of Durante , and agreed with that of Kilmeny , in this , that he protested there was no wind there at all .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 6]: I fancy he missed it .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 10]: At all events we could not do without wind .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 20]: It all depends on how big our lungs are whether the wind is too strong for us or not .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 69]: When the person he told about it asked him whether he saw anybody he knew there , he answered , `` Only a little girl belonging to the gardener , who thought he had lost her , but was quite mistaken , for there she was safe enough , and was to come back some day , as I came back , if they would only wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 10]: `` Did you talk to her , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 4]: Nobody talks there .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 12]: They only look at each other , and understand everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 7]: `` Is it cold there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 6]: `` Is it hot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 7]: `` What is it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 10]: `` You never think about such things there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: `` What a queer place it must be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: `` It 's a very good place . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 10]: `` Do you want to go back again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 20]: `` No ; I do n't think I have left it ; I feel it here , somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 9]: `` Did the people there look pleased ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 12]: `` Yes -- quite pleased , only a little sad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 9]: `` Then they did n't look glad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 15]: `` They looked as if they were waiting to be gladder some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 12]: This was how Diamond used to answer questions about that country .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 21]: And now I will take up the story again , and tell you how he got back to this country .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 47]: HOW DIAMOND GOT HOME AGAIN WHEN one at the back of the north wind wanted to know how things were going with any one he loved , he had to go to a certain tree , climb the stem , and sit down in the branches .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 28]: In a few minutes , if he kept very still , he would see something at least of what was going on with the people he loved .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 32]: One day when Diamond was sitting in this tree , he began to long very much to get home again , and no wonder , for he saw his mother crying .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 21]: Durante says that the people there may always follow their wishes , because they never wish but what is good .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 16]: Diamond 's wish was to get home , and he would fain follow his wish .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 9]: But how was he to set about it ?
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 8]: If he could only see North Wind !
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 18]: But the moment he had got to her back , she was gone altogether from his sight .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 7]: He had never seen her back .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 26]: She might be sitting on her doorstep still , looking southwards , and waiting , white and thin and blue-eyed , until she was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 29]: Or she might have again become a mighty creature , with power to do that which was demanded of her , and gone far away upon many missions .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 7]: She must be somewhere , however .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 15]: He could not go home without her , and therefore he must find her .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 14]: She could never have intended to leave him always away from his mother .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 23]: If there had been any danger of that , she would have told him , and given him his choice about going .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 7]: For North Wind was right honest .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 13]: How to find North Wind , therefore , occupied all his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 22]: In his anxiety about his mother , he used to climb the tree every day , and sit in its branches .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 63]: However many of the dwellers there did so , they never incommoded one another ; for the moment one got into the tree , he became invisible to every one else ; and it was such a wide-spreading tree that there was room for every one of the people of the country in it , without the least interference with each other .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 48]: Sometimes , on getting down , two of them would meet at the root , and then they would smile to each other more sweetly than at any other time , as much as to say , `` Ah , you 've been up there too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 21]: One day he was sitting on one of the outer branches of the tree , looking southwards after his home .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 17]: Far away was a blue shining sea , dotted with gleaming and sparkling specks of white .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 5]: Those were the icebergs .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 35]: Nearer he saw a great range of snow-capped mountains , and down below him the lovely meadow-grass of the country , with the stream flowing and flowing through it , away towards the sea .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 39]: As he looked he began to wonder , for the whole country lay beneath him like a map , and that which was near him looked just as small as that which he knew to be miles away .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 41]: The ridge of ice which encircled it appeared but a few yards off , and no larger than the row of pebbles with which a child will mark out the boundaries of the kingdom he has appropriated on the sea-shore .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 24]: He thought he could distinguish the vapoury form of North Wind , seated as he had left her , on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 25]: Hastily he descended the tree , and to his amazement found that the map or model of the country still lay at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 5]: He stood in it .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 38]: With one stride he had crossed the river ; with another he had reached the ridge of ice ; with the third he stepped over its peaks , and sank wearily down at North Wind 's knees .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 8]: For there she sat on her doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 29]: The peaks of the great ridge of ice were as lofty as ever behind her , and the country at her back had vanished from Diamond 's view .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 11]: North Wind was as still as Diamond had left her .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 23]: Her pale face was white as the snow , and her motionless eyes were as blue as the caverns in the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 20]: But the instant Diamond touched her , her face began to change like that of one waking from sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 11]: Light began to glimmer from the blue of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 21]: A moment more , and she laid her hand on Diamond 's head , and began playing with his hair .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 14]: Diamond took hold of her hand , and laid his face to it .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: She gave a little start .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 10]: `` How very alive you are , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 7]: `` Come nearer to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 21]: By the help of the stones all around he clambered up beside her , and laid himself against her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 24]: She gave a great sigh , slowly lifted her arms , and slowly folded them about him , until she clasped him close .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 30]: Yet a moment , and she roused herself , and came quite awake ; and the cold of her bosom , which had pierced Diamond 's bones , vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 18]: `` Have you been sitting here ever since I went through you , dear North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 7]: asked Diamond , stroking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' she answered , looking at him with her old kindness .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 8]: `` Ai n't you very tired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 11]: `` No ; I 've often had to sit longer .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 10]: Do you know how long you have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: years and years , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 13]: `` You have just been seven days , '' returned North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 11]: `` I thought I had been a hundred years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 3]: exclaimed Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 11]: `` Yes , I daresay , '' replied North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 24]: `` You 've been away from here seven days ; but how long you may have been in there is quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 12]: Behind my back and before my face things are so different !
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 12]: They do n't go at all by the same rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 15]: `` I 'm very glad , '' said Diamond , after thinking a while .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 4]: asked North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 20]: `` Because I 've been such a long time there , and such a little while away from mother .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 14]: Why , she wo n't be expecting me home from Sandwich yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 8]: But we must n't talk any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 18]: I 've got my orders now , and we must be off in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 11]: Next moment Diamond found himself sitting alone on the rock .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 5]: North Wind had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 28]: A creature like a great humble-bee or cockchafer flew past his face ; but it could be neither , for there were no insects amongst the ice .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 41]: It passed him again and again , flying in circles around him , and he concluded that it must be North Wind herself , no bigger than Tom Thumb when his mother put him in the nutshell lined with flannel .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 9]: But she was no longer vapoury and thin .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 7]: She was solid , although tiny .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 11]: A moment more , and she perched on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 34]: `` Come along , Diamond , '' she said in his ear , in the smallest and highest of treble voices ; `` it is time we were setting out for Sandwich . ''
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 35]: Diamond could just see her , by turning his head towards his shoulder as far as he could , but only with one eye , for his nose came between her and the other .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 14]: `` Wo n't you take me in your arms and carry me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 21]: he said in a whisper , for he knew she did not like a loud voice when she was small .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 19]: you ungrateful boy , '' returned North Wind , smiling `` how dare you make game of me ?
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: Yes , I will carry you , but you shall walk a bit for your impertinence first .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 38]: She jumped from his shoulder , but when Diamond looked for her upon the ground , he could see nothing but a little spider with long legs that made its way over the ice towards the south .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 24]: It ran very fast indeed for a spider , but Diamond ran a long way before it , and then waited for it .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: It was up with him sooner than he had expected , however , and it had grown a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 59]: And the spider grew and grew and went faster and faster , till all at once Diamond discovered that it was not a spider , but a weasel ; and away glided the weasel , and away went Diamond after it , and it took all the run there was in him to keep up with the weasel .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 28]: And the weasel grew , and grew , and grew , till all at once Diamond saw that the weasel was not a weasel but a cat .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 11]: And away went the cat , and Diamond after it .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 28]: And when he had run half a mile , he found the cat waiting for him , sitting up and washing her face not to lose time .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 12]: And away went the cat again , and Diamond after it .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 22]: But the next time he came up with the cat , the cat was not a cat , but a hunting-leopard .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 15]: And the hunting-leopard grew to a jaguar , all covered with spots like eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 9]: And the jaguar grew to a Bengal tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 34]: And at none of them was Diamond afraid , for he had been at North Wind 's back , and he could be afraid of her no longer whatever she did or grew .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 40]: And the tiger flew over the snow in a straight line for the south , growing less and less to Diamond 's eyes till it was only a black speck upon the whiteness ; and then it vanished altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 22]: And now Diamond felt that he would rather not run any farther , and that the ice had got very rough .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 63]: Besides , he was near the precipices that bounded the sea , so he slackened his pace to a walk , saying aloud to himself : `` When North Wind has punished me enough for making game of her , she will come back to me ; I know she will , for I ca n't go much farther without her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 5]: `` You dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 6]: It was only in fun .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 5]: Here I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 8]: said North Wind 's voice behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 22]: Diamond turned , and saw her as he liked best to see her , standing beside him , a tall lady .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: `` Where 's the tiger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 20]: he asked , for he knew all the creatures from a picture book that Miss Coleman had given him .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 16]: `` But , of course , '' he added , `` you were the tiger .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 6]: I was puzzled and forgot .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 18]: I saw it such a long way off before me , and there you were behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 9]: It 's so odd , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 15]: `` It must look very odd to you , Diamond : I see that .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 18]: But it is no more odd to me than to break an old pine in two . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: `` Well , that 's odd enough , '' remarked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 5]: `` So it is !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 3]: I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 22]: Well , none of these things are odder to me than it is to you to eat bread and butter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 18]: `` Well , that 's odd too , when I think of it , '' persisted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: `` I should just like a slice of bread and butter !
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 28]: I 'm afraid to say how long it is -- how long it seems to me , that is -- since I had anything to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 16]: `` Come then , '' said North Wind , stooping and holding out her arms .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 11]: `` You shall have some bread and butter very soon .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 10]: I am glad to find you want some . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 16]: Diamond held up his arms to meet hers , and was safe upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 7]: North Wind bounded into the air .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 61]: Her tresses began to lift and rise and spread and stream and flow and flutter ; and with a roar from her hair and an answering roar from one of the great glaciers beside them , whose slow torrent tumbled two or three icebergs at once into the waves at their feet , North Wind and Diamond went flying southwards .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 40]: WHO MET DIAMOND AT SANDWICH As THEY flew , so fast they went that the sea slid away from under them like a great web of shot silk , blue shot with grey , and green shot with purple .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 30]: They went so fast that the stars themselves appeared to sail away past them overhead , `` like golden boats , '' on a blue sea turned upside down .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 27]: And they went so fast that Diamond himself went the other way as fast -- I mean he went fast asleep in North Wind 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 25]: When he woke , a face was bending over him ; but it was not North Wind 's ; it was his mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 20]: He put out his arms to her , and she clasped him to her bosom and burst out crying .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 11]: Diamond kissed her again and again to make her stop .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 17]: Perhaps kissing is the best thing for crying , but it will not always stop it .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 8]: `` Oh , Diamond , my darling !
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: you have been so ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 6]: `` No , mother dear .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 16]: I 've only been at the back of the north wind , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 12]: `` I thought you were dead , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 8]: But that moment the doctor came in .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 3]: there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 17]: said the doctor with gentle cheerfulness ; `` we 're better to-day , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 34]: Then he drew the mother aside , and told her not to talk to Diamond , or to mind what he might say ; for he must be kept as quiet as possible .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 52]: And indeed Diamond was not much inclined to talk , for he felt very strange and weak , which was little wonder , seeing that all the time he had been away he had only sucked a few lumps of ice , and there could not be much nourishment in them .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 40]: Now while he is lying there , getting strong again with chicken broth and other nice things , I will tell my readers what had been taking place at his home , for they ought to be told it .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 16]: They may have forgotten that Miss Coleman was in a very poor state of health .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 8]: Now there were three reasons for this .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 11]: In the first place , her lungs were not strong .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 19]: In the second place , there was a gentleman somewhere who had not behaved very well to her .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 13]: In the third place , she had not anything particular to do .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 14]: These three nots together are enough to make a lady very ill indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 38]: Of course she could not help the first cause ; but if the other two causes had not existed , that would have been of little consequence ; she would only have to be a little careful .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 38]: The second she could not help quite ; but if she had had anything to do , and had done it well , it would have been very difficult for any man to behave badly to her .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 39]: And for this third cause of her illness , if she had had anything to do that was worth doing , she might have borne his bad behaviour so that even that would not have made her ill .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 40]: It is not always easy , I confess , to find something to do that is worth doing , but the most difficult things are constantly being done , and she might have found something if she had tried .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 12]: Her fault lay in this , that she had not tried .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 21]: But , to be sure , her father and mother were to blame that they had never set her going .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 22]: Only then again , nobody had told her father and mother that they ought to set her going in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 19]: So as none of them would find it out of themselves , North Wind had to teach them .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 19]: We know that North Wind was very busy that night on which she left Diamond in the cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 20]: She had in a sense been blowing through and through the Colemans ' house the whole of the night .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 39]: First , Miss Coleman 's maid had left a chink of her mistress 's window open , thinking she had shut it , and North Wind had wound a few of her hairs round the lady 's throat .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 8]: She was considerably worse the next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 17]: Again , the ship which North Wind had sunk that very night belonged to Mr. Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 30]: Nor will my readers understand what a heavy loss this was to him until I have informed them that he had been getting poorer and poorer for some time .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 34]: He was not so successful in his speculations as he had been , for he speculated a great deal more than was right , and it was time he should be pulled up .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 44]: It is a hard thing for a rich man to grow poor ; but it is an awful thing for him to grow dishonest , and some kinds of speculation lead a man deep into dishonesty before he thinks what he is about .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 68]: Poverty will not make a man worthless -- he may be worth a great deal more when he is poor than he was when he was rich ; but dishonesty goes very far indeed to make a man of no value -- a thing to be thrown out in the dust-hole of the creation , like a bit of a broken basin , or a dirty rag .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 20]: So North Wind had to look after Mr. Coleman , and try to make an honest man of him .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 25]: So she sank the ship which was his last venture , and he was what himself and his wife and the world called ruined .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 6]: Nor was this all yet .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 58]: For on board that vessel Miss Coleman 's lover was a passenger ; and when the news came that the vessel had gone down , and that all on board had perished , we may be sure she did not think the loss of their fine house and garden and furniture the greatest misfortune in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 15]: Of course , the trouble did not end with Mr. Coleman and his family .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 5]: Nobody can suffer alone .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 67]: When the cause of suffering is most deeply hidden in the heart , and nobody knows anything about it but the man himself , he must be a great and a good man indeed , such as few of us have known , if the pain inside him does not make him behave so as to cause all about him to be more or less uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 34]: But when a man brings money-troubles on himself by making haste to be rich , then most of the people he has to do with must suffer in the same way with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 51]: The elm-tree which North Wind blew down that very night , as if small and great trials were to be gathered in one heap , crushed Miss Coleman 's pretty summer-house : just so the fall of Mr. Coleman crushed the little family that lived over his coach-house and stable .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 20]: Before Diamond was well enough to be taken home , there was no home for him to go to .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 28]: Mr. Coleman -- or his creditors , for I do not know the particulars -- had sold house , carriage , horses , furniture , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 40]: He and his wife and daughter and Mrs. Crump had gone to live in a small house in Hoxton , where he would be unknown , and whence he could walk to his place of business in the City .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 16]: For he was not an old man , and hoped yet to retrieve his fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 31]: Let us hope that he lived to retrieve his honesty , the tail of which had slipped through his fingers to the very last joint , if not beyond it .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 34]: Of course , Diamond 's father had nothing to do for a time , but it was not so hard for him to have nothing to do as it was for Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 36]: He wrote to his wife that , if her sister would keep her there till he got a place , it would be better for them , and he would be greatly obliged to her .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 23]: Meantime , the gentleman who had bought the house had allowed his furniture to remain where it was for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 15]: Diamond 's aunt was quite willing to keep them as long as she could .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 14]: And indeed Diamond was not yet well enough to be moved with safety .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 47]: When he had recovered so far as to be able to go out , one day his mother got her sister 's husband , who had a little pony-cart , to carry them down to the sea-shore , and leave them there for a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 20]: He had some business to do further on at Ramsgate , and would pick them up as he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 34]: A whiff of the sea-air would do them both good , she said , and she thought besides she could best tell Diamond what had happened if she had him quite to herself .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 20]: THE SEASIDE DIAMOND and his mother sat down upon the edge of the rough grass that bordered the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 20]: The sun was just far enough past its highest not to shine in their eyes when they looked eastward .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 25]: A sweet little wind blew on their left side , and comforted the mother without letting her know what it was that comforted her .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 48]: Away before them stretched the sparkling waters of the ocean , every wave of which flashed out its own delight back in the face of the great sun , which looked down from the stillness of its blue house with glorious silent face upon its flashing children .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 13]: On each hand the shore rounded outwards , forming a little bay .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 31]: There were no white cliffs here , as further north and south , and the place was rather dreary , but the sky got at them so much the better .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 11]: Not a house , not a creature was within sight .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 25]: Dry sand was about their feet , and under them thin wiry grass , that just managed to grow out of the poverty-stricken shore .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 18]: said Diamond 's mother , with a deep sigh , `` it 's a sad world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 7]: `` I did n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 8]: `` How should you know , child ?
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 13]: You 've been too well taken care of , I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 11]: `` Oh yes , I have , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 5]: `` I 'm sorry !
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 9]: I thought you were taken care of too .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 9]: I thought my father took care of you .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 7]: I will ask him about it .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 8]: I think he must have forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 5]: `` Dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 16]: said his mother , `` your father 's the best man in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 6]: `` So I thought ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 5]: returned Diamond with triumph .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 7]: `` I was sure of it !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 14]: -- Well , does n't he take very good care of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 17]: `` Yes , yes , he does , '' answered his mother , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 10]: `` But who 's to take care of him ?
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 19]: And how is he to take care of us if he 's got nothing to eat himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 15]: said Diamond with a gasp ; `` has n't he got anything to eat ?
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: I must go home to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: `` No , no , child .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 8]: He 's not come to that yet .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 14]: But what 's to become of us , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 8]: `` Are you very hungry , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 5]: There 's the basket .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 11]: I thought you put something to eat in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 6]: `` O you darling stupid !
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 18]: I did n't say I was hungry , '' returned his mother , smiling through her tears .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 14]: `` Then I do n't understand you at all , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 10]: `` Do tell me what 's the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 16]: `` There are people in the world who have nothing to eat , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 13]: `` Then I suppose they do n't stop in it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 15]: They -- they -- what you call -- die -- do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 6]: `` Yes , they do .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 7]: How would you like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 4]: I never tried .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 13]: But I suppose they go where they get something to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 16]: `` Like enough they do n't want it , '' said his mother , petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 23]: `` That 's all right then , '' said Diamond , thinking I daresay more than he chose to put in words .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 5]: `` Is it though ?
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 3]: Poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 7]: how little you know about things !
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 28]: Mr. Coleman 's lost all his money , and your father has nothing to do , and we shall have nothing to eat by and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 8]: `` Are you sure , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 6]: `` Sure of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 11]: `` Sure that we shall have nothing to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 6]: `` No , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 7]: I 'm not sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 5]: I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 10]: `` Then I ca n't understand it , mother .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 14]: There 's a piece of gingerbread in the basket , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 6]: `` O you little bird !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 29]: You have no more sense than a sparrow that picks what it wants , and never thinks of the winter and the frost and , the snow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: `` Ah -- yes -- I see .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 13]: But the birds get through the winter , do n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 11]: `` Some of them fall dead on the ground . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 7]: `` They must die some time .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 9]: They would n't like to be birds always .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: Would you , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 8]: `` What a child it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 9]: thought his mother , but she said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 9]: now I remember , '' Diamond went on .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 52]: `` Father told me that day I went to Epping Forest with him , that the rose-bushes , and the may-bushes , and the holly-bushes were the bird 's barns , for there were the hips , and the haws , and the holly-berries , all ready for the winter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 9]: `` Yes ; that 's all very true .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 9]: So you see the birds are provided for .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 14]: But there are no such barns for you and me , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 6]: `` Ai n't there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 10]: We 've got to work for our bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 15]: `` Then let 's go and work , '' said Diamond , getting up .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 6]: `` It 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 9]: We 've not got anything to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 7]: `` Then let 's wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 7]: `` Then we shall starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 5]: There 's the basket .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 17]: Do you know , mother , I think I shall call that basket the barn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 9]: `` It 's not a very big one .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 12]: And when it 's empty -- where are we then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 11]: `` At auntie 's cupboard , '' returned Diamond promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 18]: `` But we ca n't eat auntie 's things all up and leave her to starve . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 9]: We 'll go back to father before that .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 12]: He 'll have found a cupboard somewhere by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: `` I do n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 18]: But I have n't got even a cupboard , and I 've always had plenty to eat .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 13]: I 've heard you say I had too much , sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 19]: `` But I tell you that 's because I 've had a cupboard for you , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 12]: `` And when yours was empty , auntie opened hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 9]: `` But that ca n't go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 6]: `` How do you know ?
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 25]: I think there must be a big cupboard somewhere , out of which the little cupboards are filled , you know , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 19]: `` Well , I wish I could find the door of that cupboard , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 15]: But the same moment she stopped , and was silent for a good while .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: I can not tell whether Diamond knew what she was thinking , but I think I know .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 45]: She had heard something at church the day before , which came back upon her -- something like this , that she had n't to eat for tomorrow as well as for to-day ; and that what was not wanted could n't be missed .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 25]: So , instead of saying anything more , she stretched out her hand for the basket , and she and Diamond had their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 6]: And Diamond did enjoy it .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 34]: For the drive and the fresh air had made him quite hungry ; and he did not , like his mother , trouble himself about what they should dine off that day week .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 50]: The fact was he had lived so long without any food at all at the back of the north wind , that he knew quite well that food was not essential to existence ; that in fact , under certain circumstances , people could live without it well enough .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 10]: His mother did not speak much during their dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 25]: After it was over she helped him to walk about a little , but he was not able for much and soon got tired .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 8]: He did not get fretful , though .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 22]: He was too glad of having the sun and the wind again , to fret because he could not run about .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 17]: He lay down on the dry sand , and his mother covered him with a shawl .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 17]: She then sat by his side , and took a bit of work from her pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 18]: But Diamond felt rather sleepy , and turned on his side and gazed sleepily over the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 9]: A few yards off he saw something fluttering .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 8]: `` What is that , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 11]: `` Only a bit of paper , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 18]: `` It flutters more than a bit of paper would , I think , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 15]: `` I 'll go and see if you like , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 10]: `` My eyes are none of the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 26]: So she rose and went and found that they were both right , for it was a little book , partly buried in the sand .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 24]: But several of its leaves were clear of the sand , and these the wind kept blowing about in a very flutterful manner .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 10]: She took it up and brought it to Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 8]: `` What is it , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 12]: `` Some nursery rhymes , I think , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 10]: `` I 'm too sleepy , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 10]: `` Do read some of them to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 14]: `` Yes , I will , '' she said , and began one .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 9]: -- `` But this is such nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 4]: she said again .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 11]: `` I will try to find a better one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 26]: She turned the leaves searching , but three times , with sudden puffs , the wind blew the leaves rustling back to the same verses .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 22]: `` Do read that one , '' said Diamond , who seemed to be of the same mind as the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 6]: `` It sounded very nice .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 10]: I am sure it is a good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 19]: So his mother thought it might amuse him , though she could n't find any sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 13]: She never thought he might understand it , although she could not .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 26]: Now I do not exactly know what the mother read , but this is what Diamond heard , or thought afterwards that he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 13]: He was , however , as I have said , very sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 17]: And when he thought he understood the verses he may have been only dreaming better ones .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 17]: This is how they went -- Here Diamond became aware that his mother had stopped reading .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 12]: `` Why do n't you go on , mother dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 7]: `` It 's such nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 11]: `` I believe it would go on for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 12]: `` That 's just what it did , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 5]: `` What did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 6]: `` Why , the river .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 12]: That 's almost the very tune it used to sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 15]: His mother was frightened , for she thought the fever was coming on again .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 7]: So she did not contradict him .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 7]: `` Who made that poem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 21]: `` Some silly woman for her children , I suppose -- and then thought it good enough to print . ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 23]: `` She must have been at the back of the north wind some time or other , anyhow , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 13]: `` She could n't have got a hold of it anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 8]: That 's just how it went . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 43]: And he began to chant bits of it here and there ; but his mother said nothing for fear of making him , worse ; and she was very glad indeed when she saw her brother-in-law jogging along in his little cart .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 30]: They lifted Diamond in , and got up themselves , and away they went , `` home again , home again , home again , '' as Diamond sang .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 28]: But he soon grew quiet , and before they reached Sandwich he was fast asleep and dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 34]: OLD DIAMOND AFTER this Diamond recovered so fast , that in a few days he was quite able to go home as soon as his father had a place for them to go .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 25]: Now his father having saved a little money , and finding that no situation offered itself , had been thinking over a new plan .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 13]: A strange occurrence it was which turned his thoughts in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 21]: He had a friend in the Bloomsbury region , who lived by letting out cabs and horses to the cabmen .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 42]: This man , happening to meet him one day as he was returning from an unsuccessful application , said to him : `` Why do n't you set up for yourself now -- in the cab line , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 14]: `` I have n't enough for that , '' answered Diamond 's father .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 13]: `` You must have saved a goodish bit , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 18]: Just come home with me now and look at a horse I can let you have cheap .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 22]: I bought him only a few weeks ago , thinking he 'd do for a Hansom , but I was wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 17]: He 's got bone enough for a waggon , but a waggon ai n't a Hansom .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 10]: He ai n't got go enough for a Hansom .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 32]: You see parties as takes Hansoms wants to go like the wind , and he ai n't got wind enough , for he ai n't so young as he once was .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 17]: But for a four-wheeler as takes families and their luggages , he 's the very horse .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 9]: He 'd carry a small house any day .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 13]: I bought him cheap , and I 'll sell him cheap . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 15]: `` Oh , I do n't want him , '' said Diamond 's father .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 16]: `` A body must have time to think over an affair of so much importance .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 7]: And there 's the cab too .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 10]: That would come to a deal of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 15]: `` I could fit you there , I daresay , '' said his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 12]: `` But come and look at the animal , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 43]: `` Since I lost my own old pair , as was Mr. Coleman 's , '' said Diamond 's father , turning to accompany the cab-master , `` I ai n't almost got the heart to look a horse in the face .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 12]: It 's a thousand pities to part man and horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 11]: `` So it is , '' returned his friend sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 64]: But what was the ex-coachman 's delight , when , on going into the stable where his friend led him , he found the horse he wanted him to buy was no other than his own old Diamond , grown very thin and bony and long-legged , as if they , had been doing what they could to fit him for Hansom work !
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 15]: `` He ai n't a Hansom horse , '' said Diamond 's father indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 7]: `` Well , you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 16]: He ai n't handsome , but he 's a good un '' said his owner .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 8]: `` Who says he ai n't handsome ?
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 59]: He 's one of the handsomest horses a gentleman 's coachman ever druv , '' said Diamond 's father ; remarking to himself under his breath -- `` though I says it as should n't '' -- for he did not feel inclined all at once to confess that his own old horse could have sunk so low .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 45]: `` Well , '' said his friend , `` all I say is -- There 's a animal for you , as strong as a church ; an 'll go like a train , leastways a parly , '' he added , correcting himself .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 15]: But the coachman had a lump in his throat and tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 48]: For the old horse , hearing his voice , had turned his long neck , and when his old friend went up to him and laid his hand on his side , he whinnied for joy , and laid his big head on his master 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 5]: This settled the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 22]: The coachman 's arms were round the horse 's neck in a moment , and he fairly broke down and cried .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 28]: The cab-master had never been so fond of a horse himself as to hug him like that , but he saw in a moment how it was .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 76]: And he must have been a good-hearted fellow , for I never heard of such an idea coming into the head of any other man with a horse to sell : instead of putting something on to the price because he was now pretty sure of selling him , he actually took a pound off what he had meant to ask for him , saying to himself it was a shame to part old friends .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 23]: Diamond 's father , as soon as he came to himself , turned and asked how much he wanted for the horse .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 13]: `` I see you 're old friends , '' said the owner .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 8]: `` It 's my own old Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 16]: I liked him far the best of the pair , though the other was good .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 11]: You ai n't got him too , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: `` No ; nothing in the stable to match him there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 10]: `` I believe you , '' said the coachman .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 16]: `` But you 'll be wanting a long price for him , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 7]: `` No , not so much .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 18]: I bought him cheap , and as I say , he ai n't for my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 20]: The end of it was that Diamond 's father bought old Diamond again , along with a four-wheeled cab .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 32]: And as there were some rooms to be had over the stable , he took them , wrote to his wife to come home , and set up as a cabman .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 19]: THE MEWS IT WAS late in the afternoon when Diamond and his mother and the baby reached London .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 20]: I was so full of Diamond that I forgot to tell you a baby had arrived in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 39]: His father was waiting for them with his own cab , but they had not told Diamond who the horse was ; for his father wanted to enjoy the pleasure of his surprise when he found it out .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 52]: He got in with his mother without looking at the horse , and his father having put up Diamond 's carpet-bag and his mother 's little trunk , got upon the box himself and drove off ; and Diamond was quite proud of riding home in his father 's own carriage .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 43]: But when he got to the mews , he could not help being a little dismayed at first ; and if he had never been to the back of the north wind , I am afraid he would have cried a little .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 21]: But instead of that , he said to himself it was a fine thing all the old furniture was there .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 43]: And instead of helping his mother to be miserable at the change , he began to find out all the advantages of the place ; for every place has some advantages , and they are always better worth knowing than the disadvantages .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 23]: Certainly the weather was depressing , for a thick , dull , persistent rain was falling by the time they reached home .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 50]: But happily the weather is very changeable ; and besides , there was a good fire burning in the room , which their neighbour with the drunken husband had attended to for them ; and the tea-things were put out , and the kettle was boiling on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 22]: And with a good fire , and tea and bread and butter , things can not be said to be miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 29]: Diamond 's father and mother were , notwithstanding , rather miserable , and Diamond began to feel a kind of darkness beginning to spread over his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 15]: But the same moment he said to himself , `` This will never do .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 8]: I ca n't give in to this .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 11]: I 've been to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 18]: Things go right there , and so I must try to get things to go right here .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 9]: I 've got to fight the miserable things .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 13]: They sha n't make me miserable if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 11]: I do not mean that he thought these very words .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 27]: They are perhaps too grown-up for him to have thought , but they represent the kind of thing that was in his heart and his head .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 14]: And when heart and head go together , nothing can stand before them .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 10]: `` What nice bread and butter this is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 15]: `` I 'm glad you like it , my dear '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 15]: `` I bought the butter myself at the little shop round the corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 11]: `` It 's very nice , thank you , father .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 7]: Oh , there 's baby waking !
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: I 'll take him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 11]: `` Sit still , Diamond , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 9]: `` Go on with your bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 11]: You 're not strong enough to lift him yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 14]: So she took the baby herself , and set him on her knee .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 19]: Then Diamond began to amuse him , and went on till the little fellow was shrieking with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 33]: For the baby 's world was his mother 's arms ; and the drizzling rain , and the dreary mews , and even his father 's troubled face could not touch him .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 11]: What cared baby for the loss of a hundred situations ?
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 20]: Yet neither father nor mother thought him hard-hearted because he crowed and laughed in the middle of their troubles .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 11]: On the contrary , his crowing and laughing were infectious .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 23]: His little heart was so full of merriment that it could not hold it all , and it ran over into theirs .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 29]: Father and mother began to laugh too , and Diamond laughed till he had a fit of coughing which frightened his mother , and made them all stop .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 14]: His father took the baby , and his mother put him to bed .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 73]: But it was indeed a change to them all , not only from Sandwich , but from their old place , instead of the great river where the huge barges with their mighty brown and yellow sails went tacking from side to side like little pleasure-skiffs , and where the long thin boats shot past with eight and sometimes twelve rowers , their windows now looked out upon a dirty paved yard .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 30]: And there was no garden more for Diamond to run into when he pleased , with gay flowers about his feet , and solemn sun-filled trees over his head .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 28]: Neither was there a wooden wall at the back of his bed with a hole in it for North Wind to come in at when she liked .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 89]: Indeed , there was such a high wall , and there were so many houses about the mews , that North Wind seldom got into the place at all , except when something must be done , and she had a grand cleaning out like other housewives ; while the partition at the head of Diamond 's new bed only divided it from the room occupied by a cabman who drank too much beer , and came home chiefly to quarrel with his wife and pinch his children .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 13]: It was dreadful to Diamond to hear the scolding and the crying .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 20]: But it could not make him miserable , because he had been at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 30]: If my reader find it hard to believe that Diamond should be so good , he must remember that he had been to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 26]: If he never knew a boy so good , did he ever know a boy that had been to the back of the north wind ?
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 26]: It was not in the least strange of Diamond to behave as he did ; on the contrary , it was thoroughly sensible of him .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 8]: We shall see how he got on .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 21]: DIAMOND MAKES A BEGINNING THE wind blew loud , but Diamond slept a deep sleep , and never heard it .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 34]: My own impression is that every time when Diamond slept well and remembered nothing about it in the morning , he had been all that night at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 22]: I am almost sure that was how he woke so refreshed , and felt so quiet and hopeful all the day .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 72]: Indeed he said this much , though not to me -- that always when he woke from such a sleep there was a something in his mind , he could not tell what -- could not tell whether it was the last far-off sounds of the river dying away in the distance , or some of the words of the endless song his mother had read to him on the sea-shore .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 45]: Sometimes he thought it must have been the twittering of the swallows -- over the shallows , you , know ; but it may have been the chirping of the dingy sparrows picking up their breakfast in the yard -- how can I tell ?
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 31]: I do n't know what I know , I only know what I think ; and to tell the truth , I am more for the swallows than the sparrows .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 141]: When he knew he was coming awake , he would sometimes try hard to keep hold of the words of what seemed a new song , one he had not heard before -- a song in which the words and the music somehow appeared to be all one ; but even when he thought he had got them well fixed in his mind , ever as he came awaker -- as he would say -- one line faded away out of it , and then another , and then another , till at last there was nothing left but some lovely picture of water or grass or daisies , or something else very common , but with all the commonness polished off it , and the lovely soul of it , which people so seldom see , and , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 8]: yet seldomer believe in , shining out .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 53]: But after that he would sing the oddest , loveliest little songs to the baby -- of his own making , his mother said ; but Diamond said he did not make them ; they were made somewhere inside him , and he knew nothing about them till they were coming out .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 48]: When he woke that first morning he got up at once , saying to himself , `` I 've been ill long enough , and have given a great deal of trouble ; I must try and be of use now , and help my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 22]: When he went into her room he found her lighting the fire , and his father just getting out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 24]: They had only the one room , besides the little one , not much more than a closet , in which Diamond slept .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 32]: He began at once to set things to rights , but the baby waking up , he took him , and nursed him till his mother had got the breakfast ready .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 54]: She was looking gloomy , and his father was silent ; and indeed except Diamond had done all he possibly could to keep out the misery that was trying to get in at doors and windows , he too would have grown miserable , and then they would have been all miserable together .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 38]: But to try to make others comfortable is the only way to get right comfortable ourselves , and that comes partly of not being able to think so much about ourselves when we are helping other people .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 18]: For our Selves will always do pretty well if we do n't pay them too much attention .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 56]: Our Selves are like some little children who will be happy enough so long as they are left to their own games , but when we begin to interfere with them , and make them presents of too nice playthings , or too many sweet things , they begin at once to fret and spoil .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 8]: `` Why , Diamond , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 36]: said his mother at last , `` you 're as good to your mother as if you were a girl -- nursing the baby , and toasting the bread , and sweeping up the hearth !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 14]: I declare a body would think you had been among the fairies . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 10]: Could Diamond have had greater praise or greater pleasure ?
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 22]: You see when he forgot his Self his mother took care of his Self , and loved and praised his Self .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 28]: Our own praises poison our Selves , and puff and swell them up , till they lose all shape and beauty , and become like great toadstools .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 20]: But the praises of father or mother do our Selves good , and comfort them and make them beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 7]: They never do them any harm .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 29]: If they do any harm , it comes of our mixing some of our own praises with them , and that turns them nasty and slimy and poisonous .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 37]: When his father had finished his breakfast , which he did rather in a hurry , he got up and went down into the yard to get out his horse and put him to the cab .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 13]: `` Wo n't you come and see the cab , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 19]: `` Yes , please , father -- if mother can spare me a minute , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 5]: `` Bless the child !
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: I do n't want him , '' said his mother cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 17]: But as he was following his father out of the door , she called him back .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 10]: `` Diamond , just hold the baby one minute .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 10]: I have something to say to your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 40]: So Diamond sat down again , took the baby in his lap , and began poking his face into its little body , laughing and singing all the while , so that the baby crowed like a little bantam .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 19]: And what he sang was something like this -- such nonsense to those that could n't understand it !
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 232]: but not to the baby , who got all the good in the world out of it : -- baby 's a-sleeping wake up baby for all the swallows are the merriest fellows and have the yellowest children who would go sleeping and snore like a gaby disturbing his mother and father and brother and all a-boring their ears with his snoring snoring snoring for himself and no other for himself in particular wake up baby sit up perpendicular hark to the gushing hark to the rushing where the sheep are the woolliest and the lambs the unruliest and their tails the whitest and their eyes the brightest and baby 's the bonniest and baby 's the funniest and baby 's the shiniest and baby 's the tiniest and baby 's the merriest and baby 's the worriest of all the lambs that plague their dams and mother 's the whitest of all the dams that feed the lambs that go crop-cropping without stop-stopping and father 's the best of all the swallows that build their nest out of the shining shallows and he has the merriest children that 's baby and Diamond and Diamond and baby and baby and Diamond and Diamond and baby -- Here Diamond 's knees went off in a wild dance which tossed the baby about and shook the laughter out of him in immoderate peals .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 27]: His mother had been listening at the door to the last few lines of his song , and came in with the tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 21]: She took the baby from him , gave him a kiss , and told him to run to his father .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 25]: By the time Diamond got into the yard , the horse was between the shafts , and his father was looping the traces on .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 9]: Diamond went round to look at the horse .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 10]: The sight of him made him feel very queer .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 24]: He did not know much about different horses , and all other horses than their own were very much the same to him .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 8]: But he could not make it out .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 9]: This was Diamond and it was n't Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 28]: Diamond did n't hang his head like that ; yet the head that was hanging was very like the one that Diamond used to hold so high .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 47]: Diamond 's bones did n't show through his skin like that ; but the skin they pushed out of shape so was very like Diamond 's skin ; and the bones might be Diamond 's bones , for he had never seen the shape of them .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 72]: But when he came round in front of the old horse , and he put out his long neck , and began sniffing at him and rubbing his upper lip and his nose on him , then Diamond saw it could be no other than old Diamond , and he did just as his father had done before -- put his arms round his neck and cried -- but not much .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 9]: `` Ai n't it jolly , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 10]: `` Was there ever anybody so lucky as me ?
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 5]: Dear old Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 15]: And he hugged the horse again , and kissed both his big hairy cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 27]: He could only manage one at a time , however -- the other cheek was so far off on the other side of his big head .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 42]: His father mounted the box with just the same air , as Diamond thought , with which he had used to get upon the coach-box , and Diamond said to himself , `` Father 's as grand as ever anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 49]: He had kept his brown livery-coat , only his wife had taken the silver buttons off and put brass ones instead , because they did not think it polite to Mr. Coleman in his fallen fortunes to let his crest be seen upon the box of a cab .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 74]: Old Diamond had kept just his collar ; and that had the silver crest upon it still , for his master thought nobody would notice that , and so let it remain for a memorial of the better days of which it reminded him -- not unpleasantly , seeing it had been by no fault either of his or of the old horse 's that they had come down in the world together .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 24]: `` Oh , father , do let me drive a bit , '' said Diamond , jumping up on the box beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 16]: His father changed places with him at once , putting the reins into his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 6]: Diamond gathered them up eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 32]: `` Do n't pull at his mouth , '' said his father , `` just feel , at it gently to let him know you 're there and attending to him .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 13]: That 's what I call talking to him through the reins . ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 12]: `` Yes , father , I understand , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 13]: Then to the horse he said , `` Go on Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 19]: And old Diamond 's ponderous bulk began at once to move to the voice of the little boy .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 37]: But before they had reached the entrance of the mews , another voice called after young Diamond , which , in his turn , he had to obey , for it was that of his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 3]: `` Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 3]: Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 18]: it cried ; and Diamond pulled the reins , and the horse stood still as a stone .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 29]: `` Husband , '' said his mother , coming up , `` you 're never going to trust him with the reins -- a baby like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 15]: `` He must learn some day , and he ca n't begin too soon .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 15]: I see already he 's a born coachman , '' said his father proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 46]: `` And I do n't see well how he could escape it , for my father and my grandfather , that 's his great-grandfather , was all coachmen , I 'm told ; so it must come natural to him , any one would think .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 21]: Besides , you see , old Diamond 's as proud of him as we are our own selves , wife .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 29]: Do n't you see how he 's turning round his ears , with the mouths of them open , for the first word he speaks to tumble in ?
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 14]: He 's too well bred to turn his head , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 15]: `` Well , but , husband , I ca n't do without him to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 10]: Everything 's got to be done , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 7]: It 's my first day here .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 7]: And there 's that baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 6]: `` Bless you , wife !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 16]: I never meant to take him away -- only to the bottom of Endell Street .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 8]: He can watch his way back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 14]: `` No thank you , father ; not to-day , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 5]: `` Mother wants me .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 10]: Perhaps she 'll let me go another day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 24]: `` Very well , my man , '' said his father , and took the reins which Diamond was holding out to him .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 23]: Diamond got down , a little disappointed of course , and went with his mother , who was too pleased to speak .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 29]: She only took hold of his hand as tight as if she had been afraid of his running away instead of glad that he would not leave her .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 68]: Now , although they did not know it , the owner of the stables , the same man who had sold the horse to his father , had been standing just inside one of the stable-doors , with his hands in his pockets , and had heard and seen all that passed ; and from that day John Stonecrop took a great fancy to the little boy .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 11]: And this was the beginning of what came of it .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 31]: The same evening , just as Diamond was feeling tired of the day 's work , and wishing his father would come home , Mr. Stonecrop knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 7]: His mother went and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 10]: `` Good evening , ma'am , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 8]: `` Is the little master in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 25]: `` Yes , to be sure he is -- at your service , I 'm sure , Mr. Stonecrop , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 15]: `` No , no , ma'am ; it 's I 'm at his service .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 31]: I 'm just a-going out with my own cab , and if he likes to come with me , he shall drive my old horse till he 's tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 15]: `` It 's getting rather late for him , '' said his mother thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 10]: `` You see he 's been an invalid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 8]: Diamond thought , what a funny thing !
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 18]: How could he have been an invalid when he did not even know what the word meant ?
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 10]: But , of course , his mother was right .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 30]: `` Oh , well , '' said Mr. Stonecrop , `` I can just let him drive through Bloomsbury Square , and then he shall run home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 6]: `` Very good , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 13]: And I 'm much obliged to you , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 32]: And Diamond , dancing with delight , got his cap , put his hand in Mr. Stonecrop 's , and went with him to the yard where the cab was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 32]: He did not think the horse looked nearly so nice as Diamond , nor Mr. Stonecrop nearly so grand as his father ; but he was none , the less pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 16]: He got up on the box , and his new friend got up beside him .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 9]: `` What 's the horse 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 12]: whispered Diamond , as he took the reins from the man .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 13]: `` It 's not a nice name , '' said Mr. Stonecrop .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 9]: `` You need n't call him by it .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 7]: I did n't give it him .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: He 'll go well enough without it .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 8]: Give the boy a whip , Jack .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 17]: I never carries one when I drive old -- '' He did n't finish the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 33]: Jack handed Diamond a whip , with which , by holding it half down the stick , he managed just to flack the haunches of the horse ; and away he went .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 38]: `` Mind the gate , '' said Mr. Stonecrop ; and Diamond did mind the gate , and guided the nameless horse through it in safety , pulling him this way and that according as was necessary .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 29]: Diamond learned to drive all the sooner that he had been accustomed to do what he was told , and could obey the smallest hint in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 9]: Nothing helps one to get on like that .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 39]: Some people do n't know how to do what they are told ; they have not been used to it , and they neither understand quickly nor are able to turn what they do understand into action quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 29]: With an obedient mind one learns the rights of things fast enough ; for it is the law of the universe , and to obey is to understand .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 5]: `` Look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 14]: cried Mr. Stonecrop , as they were turning the corner into Bloomsbury Square .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 6]: It was getting dusky now .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 30]: A cab was approaching rather rapidly from the opposite direction , and Diamond pulling aside , and the other driver pulling up , they only just escaped a collision .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 6]: Then they knew each other .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 22]: `` Why , Diamond , it 's a bad beginning to run into your own father , '' cried the driver .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 21]: `` But , father , would n't it have been a bad ending to run into your own son ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 12]: said Diamond in return ; and the two men laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 19]: `` This is very kind of you , I 'm sure , Stonecrop , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 5]: `` Not a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 22]: He 's a brave fellow , and 'll be fit to drive on his own hook in a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 41]: But I think you 'd better let him drive you home now , for his mother do n't like his having over much of the night air , and I promised not to take him farther than the square . ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 33]: `` Come along then , Diamond , '' said his father , as he brought his cab up to the other , and moved off the box to the seat beside it .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 46]: Diamond jumped across , caught at the reins , said `` Good-night , and thank you , Mr. Stonecrop , '' and drove away home , feeling more of a man than he had ever yet had a chance of feeling in all his life .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 18]: Nor did his father find it necessary to give him a single hint as to his driving .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 33]: Only I suspect the fact that it was old Diamond , and old Diamond on his way to his stable , may have had something to do with young Diamond 's success .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 25]: `` Well , child , '' said his mother , when he entered the room , `` you 've not been long gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 9]: `` No , mother ; here I am .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 6]: Give me the baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 11]: `` The baby 's asleep , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 15]: `` Then give him to me , and I 'll lay him down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 14]: But as Diamond took him , he woke up and began to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: For he was indeed one of the merriest children .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 32]: And no wonder , for he was as plump as a plum-pudding , and had never had an ache or a pain that lasted more than five minutes at a time .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 12]: Diamond sat down with him and began to sing to him .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 171]: baby baby babbing your father 's gone a-cabbing to catch a shilling for its pence to make the baby babbing dance for old Diamond 's a duck they say he can swim but the duck of diamonds is baby that 's him and of all the swallows the merriest fellows that bake their cake with the water they shake out of the river flowing for ever and make dust into clay on the shiniest day to build their nest father 's the best and mother 's the whitest and her eyes are the brightest of all the dams that watch their lambs cropping the grass where the waters pass singing for ever and of all the lambs with the shakingest tails and the jumpingest feet baby 's the funniest baby 's the bonniest and he never wails and he 's always sweet and Diamond 's his nurse and Diamond 's his nurse and Diamond 's his nurse When Diamond 's rhymes grew scarce , he always began dancing the baby .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 43]: Some people wondered that such a child could rhyme as he did , but his rhymes were not very good , for he was only trying to remember what he had heard the river sing at the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 16]: DIAMOND GOES ON DIAMOND became a great favourite with all the men about the mews .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 31]: Some may think it was not the best place in the world for him to be brought up in ; but it must have been , for there he was .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 28]: At first , he heard a good many rough and bad words ; but he did not like them , and so they did him little harm .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 41]: He did not know in the least what they meant , but there was something in the very sound of them , and in the tone of voice in which they were said , which Diamond felt to be ugly .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 16]: So they did not even stick to him , not to say get inside him .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 28]: He never took any notice of them , and his face shone pure and good in the middle of them , like a primrose in a hailstorm .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 68]: At first , because his face was so quiet and sweet , with a smile always either awake or asleep in his eyes , and because he never heeded their ugly words and rough jokes , they said he was n't all there , meaning that he was half an idiot , whereas he was a great deal more there than they had the sense to see .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 22]: And before long the bad words found themselves ashamed to come out of the men 's mouths when Diamond was near .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 27]: The one would nudge the other to remind him that the boy was within hearing , and the words choked themselves before they got any farther .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 33]: When they talked to him nicely he had always a good answer , sometimes a smart one , ready , and that helped much to make them change their minds about him .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 20]: One day Jack gave him a curry-comb and a brush to try his hand upon old Diamond 's coat .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 30]: He used them so deftly , so gently , and yet so thoroughly , as far as he could reach , that the man could not help admiring him .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 12]: `` You must make haste and , grow '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 21]: `` It wo n't do to have a horse 's belly clean and his back dirty , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 28]: `` Give me a leg , '' said Diamond , and in a moment he was on the old horse 's back with the comb and brush .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 35]: He sat on his withers , and reaching forward as he ate his hay , he curried and he brushed , first at one side of his neck , and then at the other .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 16]: When that was done he asked for a dressing-comb , and combed his mane thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 21]: Then he pushed himself on to his back , and did his shoulders as far down as he could reach .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 32]: Then he sat on his croup , and did his back and sides ; then he turned around like a monkey , and attacked his hind-quarters , and combed his tail .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 53]: This last was not so easy to manage , for he had to lift it up , and every now and then old Diamond would whisk it out of his hands , and once he sent the comb flying out of the stable door , to the great amusement of the men .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 36]: But Jack fetched it again , and Diamond began once more , and did not leave off until he had done the whole business fairly well , if not in a first-rate , experienced fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 36]: All the time the old horse went on eating his hay , and , but with an occasional whisk of his tail when Diamond tickled or scratched him , took no notice of the proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 34]: But that was all a pretence , for he knew very well who it was that was perched on his back , and rubbing away at him with the comb and the brush .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 50]: So he was quite pleased and proud , and perhaps said to himself something like this -- `` I 'm a stupid old horse , who ca n't brush his own coat ; but there 's my young godson on my back , cleaning me like an angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 27]: I wo n't vouch for what the old horse was thinking , for it is very difficult to find out what any old horse is thinking .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 5]: `` Oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 14]: said Diamond when he had done , `` I 'm so tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 14]: And he laid himself down at full length on old Diamond 's back .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 21]: By this time all the men in the stable were gathered about the two Diamonds , and all much amused .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 19]: One of them lifted him down , and from that time he was a greater favourite than before .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 40]: And if ever there was a boy who had a chance of being a prodigy at cab-driving , Diamond was that boy , for the strife came to be who should have him out with him on the box .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 24]: His mother , however , was a little shy of the company for him , and besides she could not always spare him .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 24]: Also his father liked to have him himself when he could ; so that he was more desired than enjoyed among the cabmen .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 32]: But one way and another he did learn to drive all sorts of horses , and to drive them well , and that through the most crowded streets in London City .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 32]: Of course there was the man always on the box-seat beside him , but before long there was seldom the least occasion to take the reins from out of his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 18]: For one thing he never got frightened , and consequently was never in too great a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 17]: Yet when the moment came for doing something sharp , he was always ready for it .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 19]: I must once more remind my readers that he had been to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 39]: One day , which was neither washing-day , nor cleaning-day nor marketing-day , nor Saturday , nor Monday -- upon which consequently Diamond could be spared from the baby -- his father took him on his own cab .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 26]: After a stray job or two by the way , they drew up in the row upon the stand between Cockspur Street and Pall Mall .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 16]: They waited a long time , but nobody seemed to want to be carried anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 24]: By and by ladies would be going home from the Academy exhibition , and then there would be a chance of a job .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 62]: `` Though , to be sure , '' said Diamond 's father -- with what truth I can not say , but he believed what he said -- `` some ladies is very hard , and keeps you to the bare sixpence a mile , when every one knows that ai n't enough to keep a family and a cab upon .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 23]: To be sure it 's the law ; but mayhap they may get more law than they like some day themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 27]: As it was very hot , Diamond 's father got down to have a glass of beer himself , and give another to the old waterman .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 7]: He left Diamond on the box .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 17]: A sudden noise got up , and Diamond looked round to see what was the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 14]: There was a crossing near the cab-stand , where a girl was sweeping .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 25]: Some rough young imps had picked a quarrel with her , and were now hauling at her broom to get it away from her .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 21]: But as they did not pull all together , she was holding it against them , scolding and entreating alternately .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 18]: Diamond was off his box in a moment , and running to the help of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 15]: He got hold of the broom at her end and pulled along with her .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 44]: But the boys proceeded to rougher measures , and one of them hit Diamond on the nose , and made it bleed ; and as he could not let go the broom to mind his nose , he was soon a dreadful figure .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 14]: But presently his father came back , and missing Diamond , looked about .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 25]: He had to look twice , however , before he could be sure that that was his boy in the middle of the tumult .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: He rushed in , and sent the assailants flying in all directions .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 21]: The girl thanked Diamond , and began sweeping as if nothing had happened , while his father led him away .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 44]: With the help of old Tom , the waterman , he was soon washed into decency , and his father set him on the box again , perfectly satisfied with the account he gave of the cause of his being in a fray .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 19]: `` I could n't let them behave so to a poor girl -- could I , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 22]: `` Certainly not , Diamond , '' said his father , quite pleased , for Diamond 's father was a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 26]: A moment after , up came the girl , running , with her broom over her shoulder , and calling , `` Cab , there !
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 3]: cab ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 20]: Diamond 's father turned instantly , for he was the foremost in the rank , and followed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 38]: One or two other passing cabs heard the cry , and made for the place , but the girl had taken care not to call till she was near enough to give her friends the first chance .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 20]: When they reached the curbstone -- who should it be waiting for the cab but Mrs. and Miss Coleman !
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 10]: They did not look at the cabman , however .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 28]: The girl opened the door for them ; they gave her the address , and a penny ; she told the cabman , and away they drove .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 16]: When they reached the house , Diamond 's father got down and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 21]: As he opened the door of the cab , he touched his hat as he had been wont to do .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 18]: The ladies both stared for a moment , and then exclaimed together : `` Why , Joseph !
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 6]: can it be you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 30]: `` Yes , ma'am ; yes , miss , '' answered he , again touching his hat , with all the respect he could possibly put into the action .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 16]: `` It 's a lucky day which I see you once more upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 8]: `` Who would have thought it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 4]: said Mrs. Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 46]: `` It 's changed times for both of us , Joseph , and it 's not very often we can have a cab even ; but you see my daughter is still very poorly , and she ca n't bear the motion of the omnibuses .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 47]: Indeed we meant to walk a bit first before we took a cab , but just at the corner , for as hot as the sun was , a cold wind came down the street , and I saw that Miss Coleman must not face it .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 17]: But to think we should have fallen upon you , of all the cabmen in London !
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 11]: I did n't know you had got a cab . ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 25]: `` Well , you see , ma'am , I had a chance of buying the old horse , and I could n't resist him .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 10]: There he is , looking at you , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 11]: Nobody knows the sense in that head of his . ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 19]: The two ladies went near to pat the horse , and then they noticed Diamond on the box .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 16]: `` Why , you 've got both Diamonds with you , '' said Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 9]: Diamond lifted his cap , and answered politely .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 18]: `` He 'll be fit to drive himself before long , '' said his father , proudly .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 10]: `` The old horse is a-teaching of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 17]: `` Well , he must come and see us , now you 've found us out .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 6]: Where do you live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 38]: Diamond 's father gave the ladies a ticket with his name and address printed on it ; and then Mrs. Coleman took out her purse , saying : `` And what 's your fare , Joseph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 12]: `` No , thank you , ma'am , '' said Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 19]: `` It was your own old horse as took you ; and me you paid long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 35]: He jumped on his box before she could say another word , and with a parting salute drove off , leaving them on the pavement , with the maid holding the door for them .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 20]: It was a long time now since Diamond had seen North Wind , or even thought much about her .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 43]: And as his father drove along , he was thinking not about her , but about the crossing-sweeper , and was wondering what made him feel as if he knew her quite well , when he could not remember anything of her .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 51]: But a picture arose in his mind of a little girl running before the wind and dragging her broom after her ; and from that , by degrees , he recalled the whole adventure of the night when he got down from North Wind 's back in a London street .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 27]: But he could not quite satisfy himself whether the whole affair was not a dream which he had dreamed when he was a very little boy .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 38]: Only he had been to the back of the north wind since -- there could be no doubt of that ; for when he woke every morning , he always knew that he had been there again .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 37]: And as he thought and thought , he recalled another thing that had happened that morning , which , although it seemed a mere accident , might have something to do with what had happened since .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 60]: His father had intended going on the stand at King 's Cross that morning , and had turned into Gray 's Inn Lane to drive there , when they found the way blocked up , and upon inquiry were informed that a stack of chimneys had been blown down in the night , and had fallen across the road .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 8]: They were just clearing the rubbish away .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 11]: Diamond 's father turned , and made for Charing Cross .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 14]: That night the father and mother had a great deal to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 5]: `` Poor things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 4]: said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 12]: `` it 's worse for them than it is for us .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 35]: You see they 've been used to such grand things , and for them to come down to a little poky house like that -- it breaks my heart to think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 21]: `` I do n't know '' said Diamond thoughtfully , `` whether Mrs. Coleman had bells on her toes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 4]: said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 14]: `` She had rings on her fingers , anyhow , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 11]: `` Of course she had , as any lady would .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: What has that to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 32]: `` When we were down at Sandwich , '' said Diamond , `` you said you would have to part with your mother 's ring , now we were poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 14]: `` Bless the child ; he forgets nothing , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 18]: `` Really , Diamond , a body would need to mind what they say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 8]: `` I only think about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 11]: `` That 's just why , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 7]: `` Why is that why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 31]: persisted Diamond , for he had not yet learned that grown-up people are not often so much grown up that they never talk like children -- and spoilt ones too .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 12]: `` Mrs. Coleman is none so poor as all that yet .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: No , thank Heaven !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 8]: she 's not come to that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 11]: `` Is it a great disgrace to be poor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 14]: asked Diamond , because of the tone in which his mother had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 57]: But his mother , whether conscience-stricken I do not know hurried him away to bed , where after various attempts to understand her , resumed and resumed again in spite of invading sleep , he was conquered at last , and gave in , murmuring over and over to himself , `` Why is why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 8]: but getting no answer to the question .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 22]: THE DRUNKEN CABMAN A FEW nights after this , Diamond woke up suddenly , believing he heard North Wind thundering along .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 7]: But it was something quite different .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 32]: South Wind was moaning round the chimneys , to be sure , for she was not very happy that night , but it was not her voice that had wakened Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 11]: Her voice would only have lulled him the deeper asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 58]: It was a loud , angry voice , now growling like that of a beast , now raving like that of a madman ; and when Diamond came a little wider awake , he knew that it was the voice of the drunken cabman , the wall of whose room was at the head of his bed .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 16]: It was anything but pleasant to hear , but he could not help hearing it .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 18]: At length there came a cry from the woman , and then a scream from the baby .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 32]: Thereupon Diamond thought it time that somebody did something , and as himself was the only somebody at hand , he must go and see whether he could not do something .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 47]: So he got up and put on part of his clothes , and went down the stair , for the cabman 's room did not open upon their stair , and he had to go out into the yard , and in at the next door .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 14]: This , fortunately , the cabman , being drunk , had left open .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 27]: By the time he reached their stair , all was still except the voice of the crying baby , which guided him to the right door .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 9]: He opened it softly , and peeped in .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 35]: There , leaning back in a chair , with his arms hanging down by his sides , and his legs stretched out before him and supported on his heels , sat the drunken cabman .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 21]: His wife lay in her clothes upon the bed , sobbing , and the baby was wailing in the cradle .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 6]: It was very miserable altogether .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 26]: Now the way most people do when they see anything very miserable is to turn away from the sight , and try to forget it .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 12]: But Diamond began as usual to try to destroy the misery .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 31]: The little boy was just as much one of God 's messengers as if he had been an angel with a flaming sword , going out to fight the devil .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 11]: The devil he had to fight just then was Misery .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 11]: And the way he fought him was the very best .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 36]: Like a wise soldier , he attacked him first in his weakest point -- that was the baby ; for Misery can never get such a hold of a baby as of a grown person .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 77]: Diamond was knowing in babies , and he knew he could do something to make the baby , happy ; for although he had only known one baby as yet , and although not one baby is the same as another , yet they are so very much alike in some things , and he knew that one baby so thoroughly , that he had good reason to believe he could do something for any other .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 22]: I have known people who would have begun to fight the devil in a very different and a very stupid way .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 72]: They would have begun by scolding the idiotic cabman ; and next they would make his wife angry by saying it must be her fault as well as his , and by leaving ill-bred though well-meant shabby little books for them to read , which they were sure to hate the sight of ; while all the time they would not have put out a finger to touch the wailing baby .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 28]: But Diamond had him out of the cradle in a moment , set him up on his knee , and told him to look at the light .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 100]: Now all the light there was came only from a lamp in the yard , and it was a very dingy and yellow light , for the glass of the lamp was dirty , and the gas was bad ; but the light that came from it was , notwithstanding , as certainly light as if it had come from the sun itself , and the baby knew that , and smiled to it ; and although it was indeed a wretched room which that lamp lighted -- so dreary , and dirty , and empty , and hopeless !
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 29]: -- there in the middle of it sat Diamond on a stool , smiling to the baby , and the baby on his knees smiling to the lamp .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 38]: The father of him sat staring at nothing , neither asleep nor awake , not quite lost in stupidity either , for through it all he was dimly angry with himself , he did not know why .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 9]: It was that he had struck his wife .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 13]: He had forgotten it , but was miserable about it , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 35]: And this misery was the voice of the great Love that had made him and his wife and the baby and Diamond , speaking in his heart , and telling him to be good .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 31]: For that great Love speaks in the most wretched and dirty hearts ; only the tone of its voice depends on the echoes of the place in which it sounds .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 28]: On Mount Sinai , it was thunder ; in the cabman 's heart it was misery ; in the soul of St. John it was perfect blessedness .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 17]: By and by he became aware that there was a voice of singing in the room .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 74]: This , of course , was the voice of Diamond singing to the baby -- song after song , every one as foolish as another to the cabman , for he was too tipsy to part one word from another : all the words mixed up in his ear in a gurgle without division or stop ; for such was the way he spoke himself , when he was in this horrid condition .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 44]: But the baby was more than content with Diamond 's songs , and Diamond himself was so contented with what the songs were all about , that he did not care a bit about the songs themselves , if only baby liked them .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 40]: But they did the cabman good as well as the baby and Diamond , for they put him to sleep , and the sleep was busy all the time it lasted , smoothing the wrinkles out of his temper .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 17]: At length Diamond grew tired of singing , and began to talk to the baby instead .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 15]: And as soon as he stopped singing , the cabman began to wake up .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 22]: His brain was a little clearer now , his temper a little smoother , and his heart not quite so dirty .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 33]: He began to listen and he went on listening , and heard Diamond saying to the baby something like this , for he thought the cabman was asleep : `` Poor daddy !
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 25]: Baby 's daddy takes too much beer and gin , and that makes him somebody else , and not his own self at all .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 18]: Baby 's daddy would never hit baby 's mammy if he did n't take too much beer .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 38]: He 's very fond of baby 's mammy , and works from morning to night to get her breakfast and dinner and supper , only at night he forgets , and pays the money away for beer .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 29]: And they put nasty stuff in beer , I 've heard my daddy say , that drives all the good out , and lets all the bad in .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 29]: Daddy says when a man takes a drink , there 's a thirsty devil creeps into his inside , because he knows he will always get enough there .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 33]: And the devil is always crying out for more drink , and that makes the man thirsty , and so he drinks more and more , till he kills himself with it .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 35]: And then the ugly devil creeps out of him , and crawls about on his belly , looking for some other cabman to get into , that he may drink , drink , drink .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 9]: That 's what my daddy says , baby .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 63]: And he says , too , the only way to make the devil come out is to give him plenty of cold water and tea and coffee , and nothing at all that comes from the public-house ; for the devil ca n't abide that kind of stuff , and creeps out pretty soon , for fear of being drowned in it .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 12]: But your daddy will drink the nasty stuff , poor man !
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 18]: I wish he would n't , for it makes mammy cross with him , and no wonder !
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 42]: and then when mammy 's cross , he 's crosser , and there 's nobody in the house to take care of them but baby ; and you do take care of them , baby -- do n't you , baby ?
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 5]: I know you do .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 16]: Babies always take care of their fathers and mothers -- do n't they , baby ?
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 13]: That 's what they come for -- is n't it , baby ?
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 29]: And when daddy stops drinking beer and nasty gin with turpentine in it , father says , then mammy will be so happy , and look so pretty !
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 9]: and daddy will be so good to baby !
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 16]: and baby will be as happy as a swallow , which is the merriest fellow !
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 8]: And Diamond will be so happy too !
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 27]: And when Diamond 's a man , he 'll take baby out with him on the box , and teach him to drive a cab . ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 62]: He went on with chatter like this till baby was asleep , by which time he was tired , and father and mother were both wide awake -- only rather confused -- the one from the beer , the other from the blow -- and staring , the one from his chair , the other from her bed , at Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 51]: But he was quite unaware of their notice , for he sat half-asleep , with his eyes wide open , staring in his turn , though without knowing it , at the cabman , while the cabman could not withdraw his gaze from Diamond 's white face and big eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 28]: For Diamond 's face was always rather pale , and now it was paler than usual with sleeplessness , and the light of the street-lamp upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 27]: At length he found himself nodding , and he knew then it was time to put the baby down , lest he should let him fall .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 58]: So he rose from the little three-legged stool , and laid the baby in the cradle , and covered him up -- it was well it was a warm night , and he did not want much covering -- and then he all but staggered out of the door , he was so tipsy himself with sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 25]: `` Wife , '' said the cabman , turning towards the bed , `` I do somehow believe that wur a angel just gone .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: Did you see him , wife ?
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 20]: He war n't wery big , and he had n't got none o ' them wingses , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 17]: It wur one o ' them baby-angels you sees on the gravestones , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 6]: `` Nonsense , hubby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 12]: said his wife ; `` but it 's just as good .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 16]: I might say better , for you can ketch hold of him when you like .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 17]: That 's little Diamond as everybody knows , and a duck o ' diamonds he is !
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 13]: No woman could wish for a better child than he be . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 19]: `` I ha ' heerd on him in the stable , but I never see the brat afore .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 24]: Come , old girl , let bygones be bygones , and gie us a kiss , and we 'll go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 17]: The cabman kept his cab in another yard , although he had his room in this .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 30]: He was often late in coming home , and was not one to take notice of children , especially when he was tipsy , which was oftener than not .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 15]: Hence , if he had ever seen Diamond , he did not know him .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 21]: But his wife knew him well enough , as did every one else who lived all day in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 6]: She was a good-natured woman .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 25]: It was she who had got the fire lighted and the tea ready for them when Diamond and his mother came home from Sandwich .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 55]: And her husband was not an ill-natured man either , and when in the morning he recalled not only Diamond 's visit , but how he himself had behaved to his wife , he was very vexed with himself , and gladdened his poor wife 's heart by telling her how sorry he was .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 55]: And for a whole week after , he did not go near the public-house , hard as it was to avoid it , seeing a certain rich brewer had built one , like a trap to catch souls and bodies in , at almost every corner he had to pass on his way home .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 23]: Indeed , he was never quite so bad after that , though it was some time before he began really to reform .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 66]: DIAMOND 'S FRIENDS ONE day when old Diamond was standing with his nose in his bag between Pall Mall and Cockspur Street , and his master was reading the newspaper on the box of his cab , which was the last of a good many in the row , little Diamond got down for a run , for his legs were getting cramped with sitting .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 31]: And first of all he strolled with his hands in his pockets up to the crossing , where the girl and her broom were to be found in all weathers .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 18]: Just as he was going to speak to her , a tall gentleman stepped upon the crossing .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 38]: He was pleased to find it so clean , for the streets were muddy , and he had nice boots on ; so he put his hand in his pocket , and gave the girl a penny .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 37]: But when she gave him a sweet smile in return , and made him a pretty courtesy , he looked at her again , and said : `` Where do you live , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 22]: `` Paradise Row , '' she answered ; `` next door to the Adam and Eve -- down the area . ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 8]: `` Whom do you live with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 10]: `` My wicked old grannie , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 14]: `` You should n't call your grannie wicked , '' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 17]: `` But she is , '' said the girl , looking up confidently in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 19]: `` If you do n't believe me , you can come and take a look at her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 33]: The words sounded rude , but the girl 's face looked so simple that the gentleman saw she did not mean to be rude , and became still more interested in her .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 12]: `` Still you should n't say so , '' he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 5]: `` Should n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 16]: Everybody calls her wicked old grannie -- even them that 's as wicked as her .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 6]: You should hear her swear .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 9]: There 's nothing like it in the Row .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 28]: Indeed , I assure you , sir , there 's ne'er a one of them can shut my grannie up once she begins and gets right a-going .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 12]: You must put her in a passion first , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 15]: It 's no good till you do that -- she 's so old now .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 12]: How she do make them laugh , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 23]: Although she called her wicked , the child spoke so as plainly to indicate pride in her grannie 's pre-eminence in swearing .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 26]: The gentleman looked very grave to hear her , for he was sorry that such a nice little girl should be in such bad keeping .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 22]: But he did not know what to say next , and stood for a moment with his eyes on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 16]: When he lifted them , he saw the face of Diamond looking up in his .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 37]: `` Please , sir , '' said Diamond , `` her grannie 's very cruel to her sometimes , and shuts her out in the streets at night , if she happens to be late . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 7]: `` Is this your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 7]: asked the gentleman of the girl .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 10]: `` How does he know your grandmother , then ?
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 11]: He does not look like one of her sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 6]: `` Oh no , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: He 's a good boy -- quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 13]: Here she tapped her forehead with her finger in a significant manner .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 10]: asked the gentleman , while Diamond looked on smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 13]: `` The cabbies call him God 's baby , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 12]: `` He 's not right in the head , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 5]: A tile loose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 18]: Still Diamond , though he heard every word , and understood it too , kept on smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 21]: What could it matter what people called him , so long as he did nothing he ought not to do ?
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 14]: And , besides , God 's baby was surely the best of names !
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 14]: `` Well , my little man , and what can you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 16]: asked the gentleman , turning towards him -- just for the sake of saying something .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 9]: `` Drive a cab , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 8]: `` Good ; and what else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 38]: he continued ; for , accepting what the girl had said , he regarded the still sweetness of Diamond 's face as a sign of silliness , and wished to be kind to the poor little fellow .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 9]: `` Nurse a baby , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 8]: `` Well -- and what else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 18]: `` Clean father 's boots , and make him a bit of toast for his tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 13]: `` You 're a useful little man , '' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 8]: `` What else can you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 12]: `` Not much that I know of , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 16]: `` I ca n't curry a horse , except somebody puts me on his back .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 8]: So I do n't count that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 6]: `` Can you read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 19]: But mother can and father can , and they 're going to teach me some day soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 11]: `` Well , here 's a penny for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 7]: `` Thank you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 29]: `` And when you have learned to read , come to me , and I 'll give you sixpence and a book with fine pictures in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 12]: `` Please , sir , where am I to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 31]: asked Diamond , who was too much a man of the world not to know that he must have the gentleman 's address before he could go and see him .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: `` You 're no such silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 18]: thought he , as he put his hand in his pocket , and brought out a card .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 25]: `` There , '' he said , `` your father will be able to read that , and tell you where to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 17]: Thank you , sir , '' said Diamond , and put the card in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 55]: The gentleman walked away , but turning round a few paces off , saw Diamond give his penny to the girl , and , walking slower heard him say : `` I 've got a father , and mother , and little brother , and you 've got nothing but a wicked old grannie .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 7]: You may have my penny . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 20]: The girl put it beside the other in her pocket , the only trustworthy article of dress she wore .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 12]: Her grandmother always took care that she had a stout pocket .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 9]: `` Is she as cruel as ever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 5]: `` Much the same .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 31]: But I gets more coppers now than I used to , and I can get summats to eat , and take browns enough home besides to keep her from grumbling .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 13]: It 's a good thing she 's so blind , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 4]: asked Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 39]: 'Cause if she was as sharp in the eyes as she used to be , she would find out I never eats her broken wittles , and then she 'd know as I must get something somewheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 10]: `` Does n't she watch you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 7]: `` O ' course she do .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 5]: Do n't she just !
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 20]: But I make believe and drop it in my lap , and then hitch it into my pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 12]: `` What would she do if she found you out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 9]: `` She never give me no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 9]: `` But you do n't want it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 9]: `` Yes , I do want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 11]: `` What do you do with it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 8]: `` Give it to cripple Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 7]: `` Who 's cripple Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 7]: `` A boy in the Row .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 35]: His mother broke his leg when he wur a kid , so he 's never come to much ; but he 's a good boy , is Jim , and I love Jim dearly .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 16]: I always keeps off a penny for Jim -- leastways as often as I can .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 19]: -- But there I must sweep again , for them busses makes no end o ' dirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 3]: `` Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 3]: Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 30]: cried his father , who was afraid he might get no good by talking to the girl ; and Diamond obeyed , and got up again upon the box .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 29]: He told his father about the gentleman , and what he had promised him if he would learn to read , and showed him the gentleman 's card .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 13]: `` Why , it 's not many doors from the Mews ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 10]: said his father , giving him back the card .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 16]: `` Take care of it , my boy , for it may lead to something .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 22]: God knows , in these hard times a man wants as many friends as he 's ever likely to get . ''
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: `` Have n't you got friends enough , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 20]: `` Well , I have no right to complain ; but the more the better , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: `` Just let me count , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 28]: And he took his hands from his pockets , and spreading out the fingers of his left hand , began to count , beginning at the thumb .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 15]: `` There 's mother , first , and then baby , and then me .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 39]: Next there 's old Diamond -- and the cab -- no , I wo n't count the cab , for it never looks at you , and when Diamond 's out of the shafts , it 's nobody .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 19]: Then there 's the man that drinks next door , and his wife , and his baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 13]: `` They 're no friends of mine , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 13]: `` Well , they 're friends of mine , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 4]: His father laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 9]: `` Much good they 'll do you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 10]: `` How do you know they wo n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 3]: returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 11]: `` Well , go on , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 14]: `` Then there 's Jack and Mr. Stonecrop , and , deary me !
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 18]: not to have mentioned Mr. Coleman and Mrs. Coleman , and Miss Coleman , and Mrs. Crump .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 22]: And then there 's the clergyman that spoke to me in the garden that day the tree was blown down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 7]: `` What 's his name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 9]: `` I do n't know his name . ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 7]: `` Where does he live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 10]: `` How can you count him , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 13]: `` He did talk to me , and very kindlike too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 5]: His father laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 13]: `` Why , child , you 're just counting everybody you know .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 8]: That do n't make 'em friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 5]: `` Do n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 5]: I thought it did .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 9]: Well , but they shall be my friends .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 6]: I shall make 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 8]: `` How will you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 12]: `` They ca n't help themselves then , if they would .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 17]: If I choose to be their friend , you know , they ca n't prevent me .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 10]: Then there 's that girl at the crossing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 17]: `` A fine set of friends you do have , to be sure , Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 10]: `` Surely she 's a friend anyhow , father .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 23]: If it had n't been for her , you would never have got Mrs. Coleman and Miss Coleman to carry home . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 26]: His father was silent , for he saw that Diamond was right , and was ashamed to find himself more ungrateful than he had thought .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: `` Then there 's the new gentleman , '' Diamond went on .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 13]: `` If he do as he say , '' interposed his father .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 7]: `` And why should n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 12]: I daresay sixpence ai n't too much for him to spare .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 23]: But I do n't quite understand , father : is nobody your friend but the one that does something for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 12]: `` No , I wo n't say that , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 10]: You would have to leave out baby then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 8]: `` Oh no , I should n't .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 20]: Baby can laugh in your face , and crow in your ears , and make you feel so happy .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 8]: Call you that nothing , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 9]: The father 's heart was fairly touched now .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 43]: He made no answer to this last appeal , and Diamond ended off with saying : `` And there 's the best of mine to come yet -- and that 's you , daddy -- except it be mother , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 11]: You 're my friend , daddy , ai n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 11]: And I 'm your friend , ai n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 24]: `` And God for us all , '' said his father , and then they were both silent for that was very solemn .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 48]: DIAMOND LEARNS TO READ THE question of the tall gentleman as to whether Diamond could read or not set his father thinking it was high time he could ; and as soon as old Diamond was suppered and bedded , he began the task that very night .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 45]: But it was not much of a task to Diamond , for his father took for his lesson-book those very rhymes his mother had picked up on the sea-shore ; and as Diamond was not beginning too soon , he learned very fast indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 16]: Within a month he was able to spell out most of the verses for himself .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 21]: But he had never come upon the poem he thought he had heard his mother read from it that day .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 42]: He had looked through and through the book several times after he knew the letters and a few words , fancying he could tell the look of it , but had always failed to find one more like it than another .
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 13]: So he wisely gave up the search till he could really read .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 16]: Then he resolved to begin at the beginning , and read them all straight through .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 7]: This took him nearly a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 35]: When he had almost reached the end , he came upon the following verses , which took his fancy much , although they were certainly not very like those he was in search of .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 13]: LITTLE BOY BLUE Little Boy Blue lost his way in a wood .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 31]: Sing apples and cherries , roses and honey ; He said , `` I would not go back if I could , It 's all so jolly and funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 39]: He sang , `` This wood is all my own , Apples and cherries , roses and honey ; So here I 'll sit , like a king on my throne , All so jolly and funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 37]: A little snake crept out of the tree , Apples and cherries , roses and honey ; `` Lie down at my feet , little snake , '' said he , All so jolly and funny .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 35]: A little bird sang in the tree overhead , Apples and cherries , roses and honey ; `` Come and sing your song on my finger instead , All so jolly and funny . ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 20]: The snake coiled up ; and the bird flew down , And sang him the song of Birdie Brown .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 20]: Little Boy Blue found it tiresome to sit , And he thought he had better walk on a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 24]: So up he got , his way to take , And he said , `` Come along , little bird and snake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 41]: And waves of snake o'er the damp leaves passed , And the snake went first and Birdie Brown last ; By Boy Blue 's head , with flutter and dart , Flew Birdie Brown with its song in its heart .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 23]: He came where the apples grew red and sweet : `` Tree , drop me an apple down at my feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 23]: He came where the cherries hung plump and red : `` Come to my mouth , sweet kisses , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 21]: And the boughs bow down , and the apples they dapple The grass , too many for him to grapple .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 20]: And the cheeriest cherries , with never a miss , Fall to his mouth , each a full-grown kiss .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 9]: He met a little brook singing a song .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 12]: He said , `` Little brook , you are going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 25]: `` You must follow me , follow me , follow , I say Do as I tell you , and come this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 21]: And the song-singing , sing-songing forest brook Leaped from its bed and after him took , Followed him , followed .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 14]: And pale and wan , The dead leaves rustled as the water ran .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 143]: And every bird high up on the bough , And every creature low down below , He called , and the creatures obeyed the call , Took their legs and their wings and followed him all ; Squirrels that carried their tails like a sack , Each on his own little humpy brown back ; Householder snails , and slugs all tails , And butterflies , flutterbies , ships all sails ; And weasels , and ousels , and mice , and larks , And owls , and rere-mice , and harkydarks , All went running , and creeping , and flowing , After the merry boy fluttering and going ; The dappled fawns fawning , the fallow-deer following , The swallows and flies , flying and swallowing ; Cockchafers , henchafers , cockioli-birds , Cockroaches , henroaches , cuckoos in herds .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 18]: The spider forgot and followed him spinning , And lost all his thread from end to beginning .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 18]: The gay wasp forgot his rings and his waist , He never had made such undignified haste .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 9]: The dragon-flies melted to mist with their hurrying .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 10]: The mole in his moleskins left his barrowing burrowing .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 20]: The bees went buzzing , so busy and beesy , And the midges in columns so upright and easy .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 38]: But Little Boy Blue was not content , Calling for followers still as he went , Blowing his horn , and beating his drum , And crying aloud , `` Come all of you , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 40]: He said to the shadows , `` Come after me ; '' And the shadows began to flicker and flee , And they flew through the wood all flattering and fluttering , Over the dead leaves flickering and muttering .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 27]: And he said to the wind , `` Come , follow ; come , follow , With whistle and pipe , and rustle and hollo . ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 21]: And the wind wound round at his desire , As if he had been the gold cock on the spire .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 19]: And the cock itself flew down from the church , And left the farmers all in the lurch .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 20]: They run and they fly , they creep and they come , Everything , everything , all and some .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 59]: The very trees they tugged at their roots , Only their feet were too fast in their boots , After him leaning and straining and bending , As on through their boles he kept walking and wending , Till out of the wood he burst on a lea , Shouting and calling , `` Come after me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 19]: And then they rose up with a leafy hiss , And stood as if nothing had been amiss .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 18]: Little Boy Blue sat down on a stone , And the creatures came round him every one .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 14]: And he said to the clouds , `` I want you there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 10]: And down they sank through the thin blue air .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 24]: And he said to the sunset far in the West , `` Come here ; I want you ; I know best . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 20]: And the sunset came and stood up on the wold , And burned and glowed in purple and gold .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 22]: Then Little Boy Blue began to ponder : `` What 's to be done with them all , I wonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 27]: Then Little Boy Blue , he said , quite low , `` What to do with you all I am sure I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 79]: Then the clouds clodded down till dismal it grew ; The snake sneaked close ; round Birdie Brown flew ; The brook sat up like a snake on its tail ; And the wind came up with a what-will-you wail ; And all the creatures sat and stared ; The mole opened his very eyes and glared ; And for rats and bats and the world and his wife , Little Boy Blue was afraid of his life .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 39]: Then Birdie Brown began to sing , And what he sang was the very thing : `` You have brought us all hither , Little Boy Blue , Pray what do you want us all to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 4]: `` Go away !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 21]: said Little Boy Blue ; `` I 'm sure I do n't want you -- get away -- do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 30]: `` No , no ; no , no ; no , yes , and no , no , '' Sang Birdie Brown , `` it must n't be so .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 12]: `` We can not for nothing come here , and away .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 11]: Give us some work , or else we stay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 5]: and oh dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 16]: with sob and with sigh , Said Little Boy Blue , and began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 23]: But before he got far , he thought of a thing ; And up he stood , and spoke like a king .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 10]: `` Why do you hustle and jostle and bother ?
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 5]: Off with you all !
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: Take me back to my mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 10]: The sunset stood at the gates of the west .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 14]: `` Follow me , follow me '' came from Birdie Brown 's breast .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 25]: `` I am going that way as fast as I can , '' Said the brook , as it sank and turned and ran .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 25]: Back to the woods fled the shadows like ghosts : `` If we stay , we shall all be missed from our posts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 26]: Said the wind with a voice that had changed its cheer , `` I was just going there , when you brought me here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 25]: `` That 's where I live , '' said the sack-backed squirrel , And he turned his sack with a swing and a swirl .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 14]: Said the cock of the spire , `` His father 's churchwarden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 14]: Said the brook running faster , `` I run through his garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 25]: Said the mole , `` Two hundred worms -- there I caught 'em Last year , and I 'm going again next autumn . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 30]: Said they all , `` If that 's where you want us to steer for , What in earth or in water did you bring us here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 19]: `` Never you mind , '' said Little Boy Blue ; `` That 's what I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 21]: If that you wo n't do , `` I 'll get up at once , and go home without you .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 12]: I think I will ; I begin to doubt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 25]: He rose ; and up rose the snake on its tail , And hissed three times , half a hiss , half a wail .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 22]: Little Boy Blue he tried to go past him ; But wherever he turned , sat the snake and faced him .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 29]: `` If you do n't get out of my way , '' he said , `` I tell you , snake , I will break your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 21]: The snake he neither would go nor come ; So he hit him hard with the stick of his drum .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 21]: The snake fell down as if he were dead , And Little Boy Blue set his foot on his head .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 18]: And all the creatures they marched before him , And marshalled him home with a high cockolorum .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 31]: And Birdie Brown sang Twirrrr twitter twirrrr twee -- Apples and cherries , roses and honey ; Little Boy Blue has listened to me -- All so jolly and funny .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 16]: SAL 'S NANNY DIAMOND managed with many blunders to read this rhyme to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 9]: `` Is n't it nice , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 11]: `` Yes , it 's pretty , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 11]: `` I think it means something , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 14]: `` I 'm sure I do n't know what , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 25]: `` I wonder if it 's the same boy -- yes , it must be the same -- Little Boy Blue , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 10]: Let me see -- how does that rhyme go ?
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 31]: Little Boy Blue , come blow me your horn -- Yes , of course it is -- for this one went ` blowing his horn and beating his drum . '
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: He had a drum too .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 34]: Little Boy Blue , come blow me your horn ; The sheep 's in the meadow , the cow 's in the corn , He had to keep them out , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 8]: But he was n't minding his work .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 14]: It goes -- Where 's the little boy that looks after the sheep ?
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 9]: He 's under the haystack , fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 7]: There , you see , mother !
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 14]: And then , let me see -- Who 'll go and wake him ?
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 17]: No , not I ; For if I do , he 'll be sure to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 8]: So I suppose nobody did wake him .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 15]: He was a rather cross little boy , I daresay , when woke up .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 38]: And when he did wake of himself , and saw the mischief the cow had done to the corn , instead of running home to his mother , he ran away into the wood and lost himself .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 12]: Do n't you think that 's very likely , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 10]: `` I should n't wonder , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 22]: `` So you see he was naughty ; for even when he lost himself he did not want to go home .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 21]: Any of the creatures would have shown him the way if he had asked it -- all but the snake .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 15]: He followed the snake , you know , and he took him farther away .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 17]: I suppose it was a young one of the same serpent that tempted Adam and Eve .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 13]: Father was telling us about it last Sunday , you remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 6]: `` Bless the child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 26]: said his mother to herself ; and then added aloud , finding that Diamond did not go on , `` Well , what next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , mother .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 19]: I 'm sure there 's a great deal more , but what it is I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 9]: I only know that he killed the snake .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 11]: I suppose that 's what he had a drumstick for .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 10]: He could n't do it with his horn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 20]: `` But surely you 're not such a silly as to take it all for true , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 7]: `` I think it must be .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 4]: It looks true .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 8]: That killing of the snake looks true .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 12]: It 's what I 've got to do so often . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 5]: His mother looked uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 34]: Diamond smiled full in her face , and added -- `` When baby cries and wo n't be happy , and when father and you talk about your troubles , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 39]: This did little to reassure his mother ; and lest my reader should have his qualms about it too , I venture to remind him once more that Diamond had been to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 34]: Finding she made no reply , Diamond went on -- `` In a week or so , I shall be able to go to the tall gentleman and tell him I can read .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 16]: And I 'll ask him if he can help me to understand the rhyme . ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 17]: But before the week was out , he had another reason for going to Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 50]: For three days , on each of which , at one time or other , Diamond 's father was on the same stand near the National Gallery , the girl was not at her crossing , and Diamond got quite anxious about her , fearing she must be ill .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 50]: On the fourth day , not seeing her yet , he said to his father , who had that moment shut the door of his cab upon a fare -- `` Father , I want to go and look after the girl , She ca n't be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 9]: `` All right , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 10]: `` Only take care of yourself , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 11]: So saying he climbed on his box and drove off .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 17]: He had great confidence in his boy , you see , and would trust him anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 29]: But if he had known the kind of place in which the girl lived , he would perhaps have thought twice before he allowed him to go alone .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 17]: Diamond , who did know something of it , had not , however , any fear .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 46]: From talking to the girl he had a good notion of where about it was , and he remembered the address well enough ; so by asking his way some twenty times , mostly of policemen , he came at length pretty near the place .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 38]: The last policeman he questioned looked down upon him from the summit of six feet two inches , and replied with another question , but kindly : `` What do you want there , my small kid ?
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 12]: It ai n't where you was bred , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 7]: `` No sir '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 7]: `` I live in Bloomsbury . ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 13]: `` That 's a long way off , '' said the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 23]: `` Yes , it 's a good distance , '' answered Diamond ; `` but I find my way about pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 8]: Policemen are always kind to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 11]: `` But what on earth do you want here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 23]: Diamond told him plainly what he was about , and of course the man believed him , for nobody ever disbelieved Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 17]: People might think he was mistaken , but they never thought he was telling a story .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 12]: `` It 's an ugly place , '' said the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 7]: `` Is it far off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 6]: It 's next door almost .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 7]: But it 's not safe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 9]: `` Nobody hurts me , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 11]: `` I must go with you , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 7]: please not , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 21]: `` They might think I was going to meddle with them , and I ai n't , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 19]: `` Well , do as you please , '' said the man , and gave him full directions .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 34]: Diamond set off , never suspecting that the policeman , who was a kind-hearted man , with children of his own , was following him close , and watching him round every corner .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 48]: As he went on , all at once he thought he remembered the place , and whether it really was so , or only that he had laid up the policeman 's instructions well in his mind , he went straight for the cellar of old Sal .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 24]: `` He 's a sharp little kid , anyhow , for as simple as he looks , '' said the man to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 9]: `` Not a wrong turn does he take !
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 18]: But old Sal 's a rum un for such a child to pay a morning visit to .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 14]: She 's worse when she 's sober than when she 's half drunk .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 14]: I 've seen her when she 'd have torn him in pieces . ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 15]: Happily then for Diamond , old Sal had gone out to get some gin .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 20]: When he came to her door at the bottom of the area-stair and knocked , he received no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 16]: He laid his ear to the door , and thought he heard a moaning within .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 13]: So he tried the door , and found it was not locked !
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 64]: It was a dreary place indeed , -- and very dark , for the window was below the level of the street , and covered with mud , while over the grating which kept people from falling into the area , stood a chest of drawers , placed there by a dealer in second-hand furniture , which shut out almost all the light .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 9]: And the smell in the place was dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 60]: Diamond stood still for a while , for he could see next to nothing , but he heard the moaning plainly enough now , When he got used to the darkness , he discovered his friend lying with closed eyes and a white suffering face on a heap of little better than rags in a corner of the den .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 15]: He went up to her and spoke ; but she made him no answer .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 26]: Indeed , she was not in the least aware of his presence , and Diamond saw that he could do nothing for her without help .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 66]: So taking a lump of barley-sugar from his pocket , which he had bought for her as he came along , and laying it beside her , he left the place , having already made up his mind to go and see the tall gentleman , Mr. Raymond , and ask him to do something for Sal 's Nanny , as the girl was called .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 29]: By the time he got up the area-steps , three or four women who had seen him go down were standing together at the top waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 22]: They wanted his clothes for their children ; but they did not follow him down lest Sal should find them there .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 30]: The moment he appeared , they laid their hands on him , and all began talking at once , for each wanted to get some advantage over her neighbours .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 25]: He told them quite quietly , for he was not frightened , that he had come to see what was the matter with Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 9]: `` What do you know about Nanny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 6]: said one of them fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 25]: `` Wait till old Sal comes home , and you 'll catch it , for going prying into her house when she 's out .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 18]: If you do n't give me your jacket directly , I 'll go and fetch her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 13]: `` I ca n't give you my jacket , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 12]: `` It belongs to my father and mother , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 7]: It 's not mine to give .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 4]: Is it now ?
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 19]: You would not think it right to give away what was n't yours -- would you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 5]: `` Give it away !
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 21]: No , that I would n't ; I 'd keep it , '' she said , with a rough laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 17]: `` But if the jacket ai n't yours , what right have you to keep it ?
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 7]: Here , Cherry , make haste .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 8]: It 'll be one go apiece . ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 21]: They all began to tug at the jacket , while Diamond stooped and kept his arms bent to resist them .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 36]: Before they had done him or the jacket any harm , however , suddenly they all scampered away ; and Diamond , looking in the opposite direction , saw the tall policeman coming towards him .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 32]: `` You had better have let me come with you , little man , '' he said , looking down in Diamond 's face , which was flushed with his resistance .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 16]: `` You came just in the right time , thank you , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 9]: `` They 've done me no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 15]: `` They would have if I had n't been at hand , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 18]: `` Yes ; but you were at hand , you know , so they could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 15]: Perhaps the answer was deeper in purport than either Diamond or the policeman knew .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 28]: They walked away together , Diamond telling his new friend how ill poor Nanny was , and that he was going to let the tall gentleman know .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 30]: The policeman put him in the nearest way for Bloomsbury , and stepping out in good earnest , Diamond reached Mr. Raymond 's door in less than an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 20]: When he asked if he was at home , the servant , in return , asked what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 9]: `` I want to tell him something . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 17]: `` But I ca n't go and trouble him with such a message as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 22]: `` He told me to come to him -- that is , when I could read -- and I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 9]: `` How am I to know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 20]: Diamond stared with astonishment for one moment , then answered : `` Why , I 've just told you .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 8]: That 's how you know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 51]: But this man was made of coarser grain than the policeman , and , instead of seeing that Diamond could not tell a lie , he put his answer down as impudence , and saying , `` Do you think I 'm going to take your word for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 7]: shut the door in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 37]: Diamond turned and sat down on the doorstep , thinking with himself that the tall gentleman must either come in or come out , and he was therefore in the best possible position for finding him .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 25]: He had not waited long before the door opened again ; but when he looked round , it was only the servant once more .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 8]: `` Get , away '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 10]: `` What are you doing on the doorstep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 13]: `` Waiting for Mr. Raymond , '' answered Diamond , getting up .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 8]: `` He 's not at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 20]: `` Then I 'll wait till he comes , '' returned Diamond , sitting down again with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 34]: What the man would have done next I do not know , but a step sounded from the hall , and when Diamond looked round yet again , there was the tall gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 8]: `` Who 's this , John ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 12]: An imperent little boy as will sit on the doorstep . ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 27]: `` Please sir '' said Diamond , `` he told me you were n't at home , and I sat down to wait for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 6]: `` Eh , what ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 4]: said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 3]: `` John !
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 2]: John !
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 5]: This wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 12]: Is it a habit of yours to turn away my visitors ?
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 25]: There 'll be some one else to turn away , I 'm afraid , if I find any more of this kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 7]: Come in , my little man .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 11]: I suppose you 've come to claim your sixpence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 9]: `` No , sir , not that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 7]: ca n't you read yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 10]: `` Yes , I can now , a little .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 9]: But I 'll come for that next time .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 11]: I came to tell you about Sal 's Nanny . ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 8]: `` Who 's Sal 's Nanny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 14]: `` The girl at the crossing you talked to the same day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes ; I remember .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 5]: What 's the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 7]: Has she got run over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 6]: Then Diamond told him all .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 12]: Now Mr. Raymond was one of the kindest men in London .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 26]: He sent at once to have the horse put to the brougham , took Diamond with him , and drove to the Children 's Hospital .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 31]: There he was well known to everybody , for he was not only a large subscriber , but he used to go and tell the children stories of an afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 28]: One of the doctors promised to go and find Nanny , and do what could be done -- have her brought to the hospital , if possible .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 35]: That same night they sent a litter for her , and as she could be of no use to old Sal until she was better , she did not object to having her removed .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 23]: So she was soon lying in the fever ward -- for the first time in her life in a nice clean bed .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 9]: But she knew nothing of the whole affair .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 8]: She was too ill to know anything .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 28]: MR. RAYMOND 'S RIDDLE MR. RAYMOND took Diamond home with him , stopping at the Mews to tell his mother that he would send him back soon .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 29]: Diamond ran in with the message himself , and when he reappeared he had in his hand the torn and crumpled book which North Wind had given him .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 19]: I see , '' said Mr. Raymond : `` you are going to claim your sixpence now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 18]: `` I was n't thinking of that so much as of another thing , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 14]: `` There 's a rhyme in this book I ca n't quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 15]: I want you to tell me what it means , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 12]: `` I will if I can , '' answered Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 19]: `` You shall read it to me when we get home , and then I shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 15]: Still with a good many blunders , Diamond did read it after a fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 12]: Mr. Raymond took the little book and read it over again .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 34]: Now Mr. Raymond was a poet himself , and so , although he had never been at the back of the north wind , he was able to understand the poem pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 23]: But before saying anything about it , he read it over aloud , and Diamond thought he understood it much better already .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 16]: `` I 'll tell you what I think it means , '' he then said .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 35]: `` It means that people may have their way for a while , if they like , but it will get them into such troubles they 'll wish they had n't had it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 8]: `` I know , I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 8]: `` Like the poor cabman next door .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 6]: He drinks too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 9]: `` Just so , '' returned Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 18]: `` But when people want to do right , things about them will try to help them .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 11]: Only they must kill the snake , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 18]: `` I was sure the snake had something to do with it , '' cried Diamond triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 15]: A good deal more talk followed , and Mr. Raymond gave Diamond his sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 9]: `` What will you do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 12]: `` Take it home to my mother , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 11]: `` She has a teapot -- such a black one !
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 15]: -- with a broken spout , and she keeps all her money in it .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 16]: It ai n't much ; but she saves it up to buy shoes for me .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 15]: And there 's baby coming on famously , and he 'll want shoes soon .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 13]: And every sixpence is something -- ai n't it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 8]: `` To be sure , my man .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 15]: I hope you 'll always make as good a use of your money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: `` I hope so , sir , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 17]: `` And here 's a book for you , full of pictures and stories and poems .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 19]: I wrote it myself , chiefly for the children of the hospital where I hope Nanny is going .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 11]: I do n't mean I printed it , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 22]: I made it , '' added Mr. Raymond , wishing Diamond to understand that he was the author of the book .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 7]: `` I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 5]: I make songs myself .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 20]: They 're awfully silly , but they please baby , and that 's all they 're meant for . ''
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 13]: `` Could n't you let me hear one of them now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 4]: said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: `` No , sir , I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 12]: I forget them as soon as I 've done with them .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: Besides , I could n't make a line without baby on my knee .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 8]: We make them together , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 10]: They 're just as much baby 's as mine .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 11]: It 's he that pulls them out of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 28]: `` I suspect the child 's a genius , '' said the poet to himself , `` and that 's what makes people think him silly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 27]: Now if any of my child readers want to know what a genius is -- shall I try to tell them , or shall I not ?
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 25]: I will give them one very short answer : it means one who understands things without any other body telling him what they mean .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 15]: God makes a few such now and then to teach the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 7]: `` Do you like riddles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 13]: asked Mr. Raymond , turning over the leaves of his own book .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 14]: `` I do n't know what a riddle is , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 23]: `` It 's something that means something else , and you 've got to find out what the something else is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 21]: Mr. Raymond liked the old-fashioned riddle best , and had written a few -- one of which he now read .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 20]: I have only one foot , but thousands of toes ; My one foot stands , but never goes .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 20]: I have many arms , and they 're mighty all ; And hundreds of fingers , large and small .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 10]: From the ends of my fingers my beauty grows .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 13]: I breathe with my hair , and I drink with my toes .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 18]: I grow bigger and bigger about the waist , And yet I am always very tight laced .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 23]: None e'er saw me eat -- I 've no mouth to bite ; Yet I eat all day in the full sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 20]: In the summer with song I shave and quiver , But in winter I fast and groan and shiver .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 11]: `` Do you know what that means , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 8]: he asked , when he had finished .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 13]: `` No , indeed , I do n't , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 32]: `` Then you can read it for yourself , and think over it , and see if you can find out , '' said Mr. Raymond , giving him the book .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 12]: `` And now you had better go home to your mother .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 13]: When you 've found the riddle , you can come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 27]: If Diamond had had to find out the riddle in order to see Mr. Raymond again , I doubt if he would ever have seen him .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 34]: `` Oh then , '' I think I hear some little reader say , `` he could not have been a genius , for a genius finds out things without being told . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 13]: I answer , `` Genius finds out truths , not tricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 25]: And if you do not understand that , I am afraid you must be content to wait till you grow older and know more .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 33]: THE EARLY BIRD WHEN Diamond got home he found his father at home already , sitting by the fire and looking rather miserable , for his head ached and he felt sick .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 38]: He had been doing night work of late , and it had not agreed with him , so he had given it up , but not in time , for he had taken some kind of fever .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 24]: The next day he was forced to keep his bed , and his wife nursed him , and Diamond attended to the baby .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 40]: If he had not been ill , it would have been delightful to have him at home ; and the first day Diamond sang more songs than ever to the baby , and his father listened with some pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 40]: But the next he could not bear even Diamond 's sweet voice , and was very ill indeed ; so Diamond took the baby into his own room , and had no end of quiet games with him there .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 46]: If he did pull all his bedding on the floor , it did not matter , for he kept baby very quiet , and made the bed himself again , and slept in it with baby all the next night , and many nights after .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 17]: But long before his father got well , his mother 's savings were all but gone .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 46]: She did not say a word about it in the hearing of her husband , lest she should distress him ; and one night , when she could not help crying , she came into Diamond 's room that his father might not hear her .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 11]: She thought Diamond was asleep , but he was not .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 21]: When he heard her sobbing , he was frightened , and said -- `` Is father worse , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 24]: `` No , Diamond , '' she answered , as well as she could ; `` he 's a good bit better . ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 11]: `` Then what are you crying for , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 13]: `` Because my money is almost all gone , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 24]: `` O mammy , you make me think of a little poem baby and I learned out of North Wind 's book to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 15]: Do n't you remember how I bothered you about some of the words ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 21]: `` Yes , child , '' said his mother heedlessly , thinking only of what she should do after to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 14]: Diamond began and repeated the poem , for he had a wonderful memory .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 38]: A little bird sat on the edge of her nest ; Her yellow-beaks slept as sound as tops ; That day she had done her very best , And had filled every one of their little crops .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 17]: She had filled her own just over-full , And hence she was feeling a little dull .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 6]: `` Oh , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 48]: she sighed , as she sat with her head Sunk in her chest , and no neck at all , While her crop stuck out like a feather bed Turned inside out , and rather small ; `` What shall I do if things do n't reform ?
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 11]: I do n't know where there 's a single worm .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 51]: `` I 've had twenty to-day , and the children five each , Besides a few flies , and some very fat spiders : No one will say I do n't do as I preach -- I 'm one of the best of bird-providers ; But where 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 17]: We want a storm -- I do n't know where there 's a single worm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 36]: `` There 's five in my crop , '' said a wee , wee bird , Which woke at the voice of his mother 's pain ; `` I know where there 's five . ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 15]: And with the word He tucked in his head , and went off again .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 20]: `` The folly of childhood , '' sighed his mother , `` Has always been my especial bother . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 40]: The yellow-beaks they slept on and on -- They never had heard of the bogy To-morrow ; But the mother sat outside , making her moan -- She 'll soon have to beg , or steal , or borrow .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 18]: For she never can tell the night before , Where she shall find one red worm more .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 65]: The fact , as I say , was , she 'd had too many ; She could n't sleep , and she called it virtue , Motherly foresight , affection , any Name you may call it that will not hurt you , So it was late ere she tucked her head in , And she slept so late it was almost a sin .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 52]: But the little fellow who knew of five Nor troubled his head about any more , Woke very early , felt quite alive , And wanted a sixth to add to his store : He pushed his mother , the greedy elf , Then thought he had better try for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 40]: When his mother awoke and had rubbed her eyes , Feeling less like a bird , and more like a mole , She saw him -- fancy with what surprise -- Dragging a huge worm out of a hole !
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 21]: 'T was of this same hero the proverb took form : 'T is the early bird that catches the worm .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 6]: `` There , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 14]: said Diamond , as he finished ; `` ai n't it funny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 35]: `` I wish you were like that little bird , Diamond , and could catch worms for yourself , '' said his mother , as she rose to go and look after her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 17]: Diamond lay awake for a few minutes , thinking what he could do to catch worms .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 23]: It was very little trouble to make up his mind , however , and still less to go to sleep after it .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 21]: ANOTHER EARLY BIRD HE GOT up in the morning as soon as he heard the men moving in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 40]: He tucked in his little brother so that he could not tumble out of bed , and then went out , leaving the door open , so that if he should cry his mother might hear him at once .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 13]: When he got into the yard he found the stable-door just opened .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 16]: `` I 'm the early bird , I think , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 10]: `` I hope I shall catch the worm . ''
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 20]: He would not ask any one to help him , fearing his project might meet with disapproval and opposition .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 28]: With great difficulty , but with the help of a broken chair he brought down from his bedroom , he managed to put the harness on Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 54]: If the old horse had had the least objection to the proceeding , of course he could not have done it ; but even when it came to the bridle , he opened his mouth for the bit , just as if he had been taking the apple which Diamond sometimes gave him .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 30]: He fastened the cheek-strap very carefully , just in the usual hole , for fear of choking his friend , or else letting the bit get amongst his teeth .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 18]: It was a job to get the saddle on ; but with the chair he managed it .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 57]: If old Diamond had had an education in physics to equal that of the camel , he would have knelt down to let him put it on his back , but that was more than could be expected of him , and then Diamond had to creep quite under him to get hold of the girth .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: The collar was almost the worst part of the business ; but there Diamond could help Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 34]: He held his head very low till his little master had got it over and turned it round , and then he lifted his head , and shook it on to his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 28]: The yoke was rather difficult ; but when he had laid the traces over the horse 's neck , the weight was not too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 15]: He got him right at last , and led him out of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 33]: By this time there were several of the men watching him , but they would not interfere , they were so anxious to see how he would get over the various difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 49]: They followed him as far as the stable-door , and there stood watching him again as he put the horse between the shafts , got them up one after the other into the loops , fastened the traces , the belly-band , the breeching , and the reins .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 6]: Then he got his whip .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 20]: The moment he mounted the box , the men broke into a hearty cheer of delight at his success .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 49]: But they would not let him go without a general inspection of the harness ; and although they found it right , for not a buckle had to be shifted , they never allowed him to do it for himself again all the time his father was ill .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 28]: The cheer brought his mother to the window , and there she saw her little boy setting out alone with the cab in the gray of morning .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 40]: She tugged at the window , but it was stiff ; and before she could open it , Diamond , who was in a great hurry , was out of the mews , and almost out of the street .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 5]: She called `` Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 3]: Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 9]: but there was no answer except from Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 12]: `` Never fear for him , ma'am , '' said Jack .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 31]: `` It ` ud be only a devil as would hurt him , and there ai n't so many o ' them as some folk ` ud have you believe .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 47]: A boy o ' Diamond 's size as can ` arness a ` oss t ` other Diamond 's size , and put him to , right as a trivet -- if he do upset the keb -- 'll fall on his feet , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 15]: `` But he wo n't upset the cab , will he , Jack ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 6]: `` Not he , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 11]: Leastways he wo n't go for to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 9]: `` I know as much as that myself .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 19]: `` I mean he 's a little likely to do it as the oldest man in the stable .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 11]: How 's the gov ` nor to-day , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 35]: `` A good deal better , thank you , '' she answered , closing the window in some fear lest her husband should have been made anxious by the news of Diamond 's expedition .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 26]: He knew pretty well , however , what his boy was capable of , and although not quite easy was less anxious than his mother .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 38]: But as the evening drew on , the anxiety of both of them increased , and every sound of wheels made his father raise himself in his bed , and his mother peep out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 27]: Diamond had resolved to go straight to the cab-stand where he was best known , and never to crawl for fear of getting annoyed by idlers .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 35]: Before he got across Oxford Street , however , he was hailed by a man who wanted to catch a train , and was in too great a hurry to think about the driver .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 34]: Having carried him to King 's Cross in good time , and got a good fare in return , he set off again in great spirits , and reached the stand in safety .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 8]: He was the first there after all .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 16]: As the men arrived they all greeted him kindly , and inquired after his father .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 16]: `` Ai n't you afraid of the old ` oss running away with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 3]: asked one .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 15]: `` No , he would n't run away with me , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 11]: `` He knows I 'm getting the shillings for father .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 11]: Or if he did he would only run home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 17]: `` Well , you 're a plucky one , for all your girl 's looks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 12]: said the man ; `` and I wish ye luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 10]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 8]: `` I 'll do what I can .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 23]: I came to the old place , you see , because I knew you would let me have my turn here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 51]: In the course of the day one man did try to cut him out , but he was a stranger ; and the shout the rest of them raised let him see it would not do , and made him so far ashamed besides , that he went away crawling .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 20]: Once , in a block , a policeman came up to him , and asked him for his number .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 29]: Diamond showed him his father 's badge , saying with a smile : `` Father 's ill at home , and so I came out with the cab .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 7]: There 's no fear of me .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 4]: I can drive .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 10]: Besides , the old horse could go alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 8]: `` Just as well , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 7]: You 're a pair of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 17]: But you are a rum ` un for a cabby -- ai n't you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 4]: said the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 14]: `` I do n't know as I ought to let you go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 11]: `` I ai n't done nothing , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 11]: `` It 's not my fault I 'm no bigger .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 9]: I 'm big enough for my age . ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 12]: `` That 's where it is , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 7]: `` You ai n't fit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 8]: `` How do you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 17]: asked Diamond , with his usual smile , and turning his head like a little bird .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 21]: `` Why , how are you to get out of this ruck now , when it begins to move ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 20]: `` Just you get up on the box , '' said Diamond , `` and I 'll show you .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 8]: There , that van 's a-moving now .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 4]: Jump up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 19]: The policeman did as Diamond told him , and was soon satisfied that the little fellow could drive .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 26]: `` Well , '' he said , as he got down again , `` I do n't know as I should be right to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 10]: Good luck to you , my little man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 14]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said Diamond , and drove away .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 9]: In a few minutes a gentleman hailed him .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 10]: `` Are you the driver of this cab ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 19]: `` Yes , sir '' said Diamond , showing his badge , of which , he was proud .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 10]: `` You 're the youngest cabman I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 14]: How am I to know you wo n't break all my bones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 13]: `` I would rather break all my own , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 19]: `` But if you 're afraid , never mind me ; I shall soon get another fare . ''
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 22]: `` I 'll risk it , '' said the gentleman ; and , opening the door himself , he jumped in .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 19]: He was going a good distance , and soon found that Diamond got him over the ground well .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 54]: Now when Diamond had only to go straight ahead , and had not to mind so much what he was about , his thoughts always turned to the riddle Mr. Raymond had set him ; and this gentleman looked so clever that he fancied he must be able to read it for him .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 27]: He had given up all hope of finding it out for himself , and he could not plague his father about it when he was ill .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 31]: He had thought of the answer himself , but fancied it could not be the right one , for to see how it all fitted required some knowledge of physiology .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 55]: So , when he reached the end of his journey , he got down very quickly , and with his head just looking in at the window , said , as the gentleman gathered his gloves and newspapers : `` Please , sir , can you tell me the meaning of a riddle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 16]: `` You must tell me the riddle first , '' answered the gentleman , amused .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 5]: Diamond repeated the riddle .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 9]: that 's easy enough , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 7]: `` It 's a tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 24]: `` Well , it ai n't got no mouth , sure enough ; but how then does it eat all day long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 18]: `` It sucks in its food through the tiniest holes in its leaves , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 7]: `` Its breath is its food .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 12]: And it ca n't do it except in the daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 13]: `` Thank you , sir , thank you , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 23]: `` I 'm sorry I could n't find it out myself ; Mr. Raymond would have been better pleased with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 13]: `` But you need n't tell him any one told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 24]: Diamond gave him a stare which came from the very back of the north wind , where that kind of thing is unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 12]: `` That would be cheating , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 10]: `` Ai n't you a cabby , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: `` Cabbies do n't cheat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 5]: `` Do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 8]: I am of a different opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 10]: `` I 'm sure my father do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 10]: `` What 's your fare , young innocent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 20]: `` Well , I think the distance is a good deal over three miles -- that 's two shillings .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 19]: Only father says sixpence a mile is too little , though we ca n't ask for more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 7]: `` You 're a deep one .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: But I think you 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 14]: It 's over four miles -- not much , but it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 10]: `` Then that 's half-a-crown , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 8]: `` Well , here 's three shillings .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 5]: Will that do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 7]: `` Thank you kindly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 36]: I 'll tell my father how good you were to me -- first to tell me my riddle , then to put me right about the distance , and then to give me sixpence over .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 13]: It 'll help father to get well again , it will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 9]: `` I hope it may , my man .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 17]: I should n't wonder if you 're as good as you look , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 31]: As Diamond returned , he drew up at a stand he had never been on before : it was time to give Diamond his bag of chopped beans and oats .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 12]: The men got about him , and began to chaff him .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 37]: He took it all good-humouredly , until one of them , who was an ill-conditioned fellow , began to tease old Diamond by poking him roughly in the ribs , and making general game of him .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 14]: That he could not bear , and the tears came in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 34]: He undid the nose-bag , put it in the boot , and was just going to mount and drive away , when the fellow interfered , and would not let him get up .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 25]: Diamond endeavoured to persuade him , and was very civil , but he would have his fun out of him , as he said .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 22]: In a few minutes a group of idle boys had assembled , and Diamond found himself in a very uncomfortable position .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 18]: Another cab drew up at the stand , and the driver got off and approached the assemblage .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 7]: `` What 's up here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 9]: he asked , and Diamond knew the voice .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 8]: It was that of the drunken cabman .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 8]: `` Do you see this young oyster ?
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 12]: He pretends to drive a cab , '' said his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 8]: `` Yes , I do see him .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 6]: And I sees you too .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 7]: You 'd better leave him alone .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 6]: He ai n't no oyster .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 11]: He 's a angel come down on his own business .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 15]: You be off , or I 'll be nearer you than quite agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 20]: The drunken cabman was a tall , stout man , who did not look one to take liberties with .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 16]: if he 's a friend of yours , '' said the other , drawing back .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 7]: Diamond got out the nose-bag again .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 9]: Old Diamond should have his feed out now .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 11]: `` Yes , he is a friend o ' mine .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 9]: One o ' the best I ever had .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 13]: It 's a pity he ai n't a friend o ' yourn .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 18]: You 'd be the better for it , but it ai n't no fault of hisn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 32]: When Diamond went home at night , he carried with him one pound one shilling and sixpence , besides a few coppers extra , which had followed some of the fares .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 48]: His mother had got very anxious indeed -- so much so that she was almost afraid , when she did hear the sound of his cab , to go and look , lest she should be yet again disappointed , and should break down before her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 36]: But there was the old horse , and there was the cab all right , and there was Diamond in the box , his pale face looking triumphant as a full moon in the twilight .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 34]: When he drew up at the stable-door , Jack came out , and after a good many friendly questions and congratulations , said : `` You go in to your mother , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 9]: I 'll put up the old ` oss .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 7]: I 'll take care on him .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 11]: He do deserve some small attention , he do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 35]: `` Thank you , Jack , '' said Diamond , and bounded into the house , and into the arms of his mother , who was waiting him at the top of the stair .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 34]: The poor , anxious woman led him into his own room , sat down on his bed , took him on her lap as if he had been a baby , and cried .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 6]: `` How 's father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 8]: asked Diamond , almost afraid to ask .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 20]: `` Better , my child , '' she answered , `` but uneasy about you , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 19]: `` Did n't you tell him I was the early bird gone out to catch the worm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 17]: `` That was what put it in your head , was it , you monkey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 9]: said his mother , beginning to get better .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 26]: `` That or something else , '' answered Diamond , so very quietly that his mother held his head back and stared in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 6]: of all the children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 8]: she said , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 11]: `` And here 's my worm , '' resumed Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 18]: But to see her face as he poured the shillings and sixpences and pence into her lap !
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 17]: She burst out crying a second time , and ran with the money to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 6]: And how pleased he was !
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 8]: It did him no end of good .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 38]: But while he was counting the coins , Diamond turned to baby , who was lying awake in his cradle , sucking his precious thumb , and took him up , saying : `` Baby , baby !
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 11]: I have n't seen you for a whole year . ''
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 11]: And then he began to sing to him as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 25]: And what he sang was this , for he was too happy either to make a song of his own or to sing sense .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 10]: It was one out of Mr. Raymond 's book .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 15]: THE TRUE STORY OF THE CAT AND THE FIDDLE Hey , diddle , diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 6]: The cat and the fiddle !
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 25]: He played such a merry tune , That the cow went mad With the pleasure she had , And jumped right over the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 8]: But then , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 13]: Before that could be , The moon had come down and listened .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 23]: The little dog hearkened , So loud that he barkened , `` There 's nothing like it , there is n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 6]: Hey , diddle , diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 16]: Went the cat and the fiddle , Hey diddle , diddle , dee , dee !
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 23]: The dog laughed at the sport Till his cough cut him short , It was hey diddle , diddle , oh me !
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 22]: And back came the cow With a merry , merry low , For she 'd humbled the man in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 19]: The dish got excited , The spoon was delighted , And the dish waltzed away with the spoon .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 39]: But the man in the moon , Coming back too soon From the famous town of Norwich , Caught up the dish , Said , `` It 's just what I wish To hold my cold plum-porridge ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 20]: Gave the cow a rat-tat , Flung water on the cat , And sent him away like a rocket .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 10]: Said , `` O Moon there you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 17]: Got into her car , And went off with the spoon in his pocket Hey ho !
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 4]: diddle , diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 42]: The wet cat and wet fiddle , They made such a caterwauling , That the cow in a fright Stood bolt upright Bellowing now , and bawling ; And the dog on his tail , Stretched his neck with a wail .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 4]: But `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 3]: ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 30]: said the man in the moon -- `` No more in the South Shall I burn my mouth , For I 've found a dish and a spoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 9]: DIAMOND 'S DREAM `` THERE , baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 15]: said Diamond ; `` I 'm so happy that I can only sing nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 23]: Oh , father , think if you had been a poor man , and had n't had a cab and old Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 7]: What should I have done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 20]: `` I do n't know indeed what you could have done , '' said his father from the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 31]: `` We should have all starved , my precious Diamond , '' said his mother , whose pride in her boy was even greater than her joy in the shillings .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 19]: Both of them together made her heart ache , for pleasure can do that as well as pain .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: `` Oh no !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 8]: we should n't , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 35]: `` I could have taken Nanny 's crossing till she came back ; and then the money , instead of going for Old Sal 's gin , would have gone for father 's beef-tea .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 12]: I wonder what Nanny will do when she gets well again .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 14]: Somebody else will be sure to have taken the crossing by that time .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 18]: I wonder if she will fight for it , and whether I shall have to help her .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: I wo n't bother my head about that .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 4]: Time enough yet !
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 3]: Hey diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 3]: hey diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 4]: hey diddle diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 12]: I wonder whether Mr. Raymond would take me to see Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 3]: Hey diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 3]: hey diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 4]: hey diddle diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 5]: The baby and fiddle !
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 10]: O , mother , I 'm such a silly !
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 7]: But I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 23]: I wish I could think of something else , but there 's nothing will come into my head but hey diddle diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 6]: the cat and the fiddle !
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 33]: I wonder what the angels do -- when they 're extra happy , you know -- when they 've been driving cabs all day and taking home the money to their mothers .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 11]: Do you think they ever sing nonsense , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 28]: `` I daresay they 've got their own sort of it , '' answered his mother , `` else they would n't be like other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 39]: She was thinking more of her twenty-one shillings and sixpence , and of the nice dinner she would get for her sick husband next day , than of the angels and their nonsense , when she said it .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 8]: But Diamond found her answer all right .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 11]: `` Yes , to be sure , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 16]: `` They would n't be like other people if they had n't their nonsense sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 17]: But it must be very pretty nonsense , and not like that silly hey diddle diddle !
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 6]: the cat and the fiddle !
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 11]: I wish I could get it out of my head .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 10]: I wonder what the angels ' nonsense is like .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 13]: Nonsense is a very good thing , ai n't it , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 28]: -- a little of it now and then ; more of it for baby , and not so much for grown people like cabmen and their mothers ?
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 23]: It 's like the pepper and salt that goes in the soup -- that 's it -- is n't it , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 6]: There 's baby fast asleep !
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 14]: Oh , what a nonsense baby it is -- to sleep so much !
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 9]: Shall I put him down , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 4]: Diamond chattered away .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 21]: What rose in his happy little heart ran out of his mouth , and did his father and mother good .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 46]: When he went to bed , which he did early , being more tired , as you may suppose , than usual , he was still thinking what the nonsense could be like which the angels sang when they were too happy to sing sense .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 11]: But before coming to any conclusion he fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 13]: And no wonder , for it must be acknowledged a difficult question .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 20]: That night he had a very curious dream which I think my readers would like to have told them .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 29]: They would , at least , if they are as fond of nice dreams as I am , and do n't have enough of them of their own .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 15]: He dreamed that he was running about in the twilight in the old garden .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 15]: He thought he was waiting for North Wind , but she did not come .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 17]: So he would run down to the back gate , and see if she were there .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 5]: He ran and ran .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 33]: It was a good long garden out of his dream , but in his dream it had grown so long and spread out so wide that the gate he wanted was nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 30]: He ran and ran , but instead of coming to the gate found himself in a beautiful country , not like any country he had ever been in before .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 21]: There were no trees of any size ; nothing bigger in fact than hawthorns , which were full of may-blossom .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 22]: The place in which they grew was wild and dry , mostly covered with grass , but having patches of heath .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 12]: It extended on every side as far as he could see .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 37]: But although it was so wild , yet wherever in an ordinary heath you might have expected furze bushes , or holly , or broom , there grew roses -- wild and rare -- all kinds .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 12]: On every side , far and near , roses were glowing .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 44]: There too was the gum-cistus , whose flowers fall every night and come again the next morning , lilacs and syringas and laburnums , and many shrubs besides , of which he did not know the names ; but the roses were everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 15]: He wandered on and on , wondering when it would come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 18]: It was of no use going back , for there was no house to be seen anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 22]: But he was not frightened , for you know Diamond was used to things that were rather out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 12]: He threw himself down under a rose-bush , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 28]: He woke , not out of his dream , but into it , thinking he heard a child 's voice , calling `` Diamond , Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 11]: He jumped up , but all was still about him .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 10]: The rose-bushes were pouring out their odours in clouds .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 39]: He could see the scent like mists of the same colour as the rose , issuing like a slow fountain and spreading in the air till it joined the thin rosy vapour which hung over all the wilderness .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 18]: But again came the voice calling him , and it seemed to come from over his head .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 38]: He looked up , but saw only the deep blue sky full of stars -- more brilliant , however , than he had seen them before ; and both sky and stars looked nearer to the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 11]: While he gazed up , again he heard the cry .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 32]: At the same moment he saw one of the biggest stars over his head give a kind of twinkle and jump , as if it went out and came in again .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 14]: He threw himself on his back , and fixed his eyes upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 19]: Nor had he gazed long before it went out , leaving something like a scar in the blue .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 24]: But as he went on gazing he saw a face where the star had been -- a merry face , with bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 28]: The eyes appeared not only to see Diamond , but to know that Diamond had caught sight of them , for the face withdrew the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 21]: Again came the voice , calling `` Diamond , Diamond ; '' and in jumped the star to its place .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 23]: Diamond called as loud as he could , right up into the sky : `` Here 's Diamond , down below you .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 9]: What do you want him to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 30]: The next instant many of the stars round about that one went out , and many voices shouted from the sky , -- `` Come up ; come up .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 5]: We 're so jolly !
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 2]: Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 3]: Diamond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 23]: This was followed by a peal of the merriest , kindliest laughter , and all the stars jumped into their places again .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 9]: `` How am I to come up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 3]: shouted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 6]: `` Go round the rose-bush .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 14]: It 's got its foot in it , '' said the first voice .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 16]: Diamond got up at once , and walked to the other side of the rose-bush .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 20]: There he found what seemed the very opposite of what he wanted -- a stair down into the earth .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 7]: It was of turf and moss .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 25]: It did not seem to promise well for getting into the sky , but Diamond had learned to look through the look of things .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 29]: The voice must have meant that he was to go down this stair ; and down this stair Diamond went , without waiting to think more about it .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 28]: It was such a nice stair , so cool and soft -- all the sides as well as the steps grown with moss and grass and ferns !
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 62]: Down and down Diamond went -- a long way , until at last he heard the gurgling and splashing of a little stream ; nor had he gone much farther before he met it -- yes , met it coming up the stairs to meet him , running up just as naturally as if it had been doing the other thing .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 38]: Neither was Diamond in the least surprised to see it pitching itself from one step to another as it climbed towards him : he never thought it was odd -- and no more it was , there .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 7]: It would have been odd here .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 23]: It made a merry tune as it came , and its voice was like the laughter he had heard from the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 42]: This appeared promising ; and he went on , down and down the stair , and up and up the stream , till at last he came where it hurried out from under a stone , and the stair stopped altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 26]: And as the stream bubbled up , the stone shook and swayed with its force ; and Diamond thought he would try to lift it .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 40]: Lightly it rose to his hand , forced up by the stream from below ; and , by what would have seemed an unaccountable perversion of things had he been awake , threatened to come tumbling upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 14]: But he avoided it , and when it fell , got upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 62]: He now saw that the opening through which the water came pouring in was over his head , and with the help of the stone he scrambled out by it , and found himself on the side of a grassy hill which rounded away from him in every direction , and down which came the brook which vanished in the hole .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 38]: But scarcely had he noticed so much as this before a merry shouting and laughter burst upon him , and a number of naked little boys came running , every one eager to get to him first .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 40]: At the shoulders of each fluttered two little wings , which were of no use for flying , as they were mere buds ; only being made for it they could not help fluttering as if they were flying .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 38]: Just as the foremost of the troop reached him , one or two of them fell , and the rest with shouts of laughter came tumbling over them till they heaped up a mound of struggling merriment .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 22]: One after another they extricated themselves , and each as he got free threw his arms round Diamond and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 13]: Diamond 's heart was ready to melt within him from clear delight .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 41]: When they had all embraced him , -- `` Now let us have some fun , '' cried one , and with a shout they all scampered hither and thither , and played the wildest gambols on the grassy slopes .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 29]: They kept constantly coming back to Diamond , however , as the centre of their enjoyment , rejoicing over him as if they had found a lost playmate .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 17]: There was a wind on the hillside which blew like the very embodiment of living gladness .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 22]: It blew into Diamond 's heart , and made him so happy that he was forced to sit down and cry .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 23]: `` Now let 's go and dig for stars , '' said one who seemed to be the captain of the troop .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 27]: They all scurried away , but soon returned , one after another , each with a pickaxe on his shoulder and a spade in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 22]: As soon as they were gathered , the captain led them in a straight line to another part of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 5]: Diamond rose and followed .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 15]: `` Here is where we begin our lesson for to-night , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 6]: `` Scatter and dig . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 6]: There was no more fun .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 18]: Each went by himself , walking slowly with bent shoulders and his eyes fixed on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 24]: Every now and then one would stop , kneel down , and look intently , feeling with his hands and parting the grass .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 48]: One would get up and walk on again , another spring to his feet , catch eagerly at his pickaxe and strike it into the ground once and again , then throw it aside , snatch up his spade , and commence digging at the loosened earth .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 26]: Now one would sorrowfully shovel the earth into the hole again , trample it down with his little bare white feet , and walk on .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 60]: But another would give a joyful shout , and after much tugging and loosening would draw from the hole a lump as big as his head , or no bigger than his fist ; when the under side of it would pour such a blaze of golden or bluish light into Diamond 's eyes that he was quite dazzled .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 19]: Gold and blue were the commoner colours : the jubilation was greater over red or green or purple .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 28]: And every time a star was dug up all the little angels dropped their tools and crowded about it , shouting and dancing and fluttering their wing-buds .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 33]: When they had examined it well , they would kneel down one after the other and peep through the hole ; but they always stood back to give Diamond the first look .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 48]: All that diamond could report , however , was , that through the star-holes he saw a great many things and places and people he knew quite well , only somehow they were different -- there was something marvellous about them -- he could not tell what .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 43]: Every time he rose from looking through a star-hole , he felt as if his heart would break for , joy ; and he said that if he had not cried , he did not know what would have become of him .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 40]: As soon as all had looked , the star was carefully fitted in again , a little mould was strewn over it , and the rest of the heap left as a sign that the star had been discovered .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 22]: At length one dug up a small star of a most lovely colour -- a colour Diamond had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 43]: The moment the angel saw what it was , instead of showing it about , he handed it to one of his neighbours , and seated himself on the edge of the hole , saying : `` This will do for me .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 2]: Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 5]: I 'm off . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 26]: They crowded about him , hugging and kissing him ; then stood back with a solemn stillness , their wings lying close to their shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 21]: The little fellow looked round on them once with a smile , and then shot himself headlong through the star-hole .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 20]: Diamond , as privileged , threw himself on the ground to peep after him , but he saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 11]: `` It 's no use , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 14]: `` I never saw anything more of one that went that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 27]: `` His wings ca n't be much use , '' said Diamond , concerned and fearful , yet comforted by the calm looks of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 10]: `` That 's true , '' said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 9]: `` He 's lost them by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 8]: They all do that go that way .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 10]: You have n't got any , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 8]: `` I never did have any . ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 5]: did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 4]: said the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 19]: `` Some people say , '' he added , after a pause , `` that they come again .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 11]: I 've never found the colour I care about myself .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 8]: I suppose I shall some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 35]: Then they looked again at the star , put it carefully into its hole , danced around it and over it -- but solemnly , and called it by the name of the finder .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 8]: `` Will you know it again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 14]: We never forget a star that 's been made a door of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 10]: Then they went on with their searching and digging .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 14]: Diamond having neither pickaxe nor spade , had the more time to think .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 15]: `` I do n't see any little girls , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 61]: The captain stopped his shovelling , leaned on his spade , rubbed his forehead thoughtfully with his left hand -- the little angels were all left-handed -- repeated the words `` little girls , '' and then , as if a thought had struck him , resumed his work , saying -- `` I think I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 21]: I 've never seen any of them , of course ; but I suppose that 's the sort you mean .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 54]: I 'm told -- but mind I do n't say it is so , for I do n't know -- that when we fall asleep , a troop of angels very like ourselves , only quite different , goes round to all the stars we have discovered , and discovers them after us .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 30]: I suppose with our shovelling and handling we spoil them a bit ; and I daresay the clouds that come up from below make them smoky and dull sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 78]: They say -- mind , I say they say -- these other angels take them out one by one , and pass each round as we do , and breathe over it , and rub it with their white hands , which are softer than ours , because they do n't do any pick-and-spade work , and smile at it , and put it in again : and that is what keeps them from growing dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 5]: `` How jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 3]: thought Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 12]: `` I should like to see them at their work too .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 9]: -- When do you go to sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 5]: he asked the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 11]: `` When we grow sleepy , '' answered the captain .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 25]: `` They do say -- but mind I say they say -- that it is when those others -- what do you call them ?
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 39]: I do n't know if that is their name ; I am only guessing that may be the sort you mean -- when they are on their rounds and come near any troop of us we fall asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 10]: They live on the west side of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 14]: None of us have ever been to the top of it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 10]: Even as he spoke , he dropped his spade .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 11]: He tumbled down beside it , and lay fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 26]: One after the other each of the troop dropped his pickaxe or shovel from his listless hands , and lay fast asleep by his work .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 39]: thought Diamond to himself , with delight , `` now the girl-angels are coming , and I , not being an angel , shall not fall asleep like the rest , and I shall see the girl-angels . ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 10]: But the same moment he felt himself growing sleepy .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 8]: He struggled hard with the invading power .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 13]: He put up his fingers to his eyelids and pulled them open .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 7]: But it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 21]: He thought he saw a glimmer of pale rosy light far up the green hill , and ceased to know .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 14]: When he awoke , all the angels were starting up wide awake too .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 19]: He expected to see them lift their tools , but no , the time for play had come .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 15]: They looked happier than ever , and each began to sing where he stood .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 8]: He had not heard them sing before .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 23]: `` Now , '' he thought , `` I shall know what kind of nonsense the angels sing when they are merry .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 27]: They do n't drive cabs , I see , but they dig for stars , and they work hard enough to be merry after it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 36]: And he did hear some of the angels ' nonsense ; for if it was all sense to them , it had only just as much sense to Diamond as made good nonsense of it .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 32]: He tried hard to set it down in his mind , listening as closely as he could , now to one , now to another , and now to all together .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 25]: But while they were yet singing he began , to his dismay , to find that he was coming awake -- faster and faster .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 30]: And as he came awake , he found that , for all the goodness of his memory , verse after verse of the angels ' nonsense vanished from it .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 37]: He always thought he could keep the last , but as the next began he lost the one before it , and at length awoke , struggling to keep hold of the last verse of all .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 21]: He felt as if the effort to keep from forgetting that one verse of the vanishing song nearly killed him .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 18]: And yet by the time he was wide awake he could not be sure of that even .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 31]: It was something like this : White hands of whiteness Wash the stars ' faces , Till glitter , glitter , glit , goes their brightness Down to poor places .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 21]: This , however , was so near sense that he thought it could not be really what they did sing .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 20]: DIAMOND TAKES A FARE THE WRONG WAY RIGHT THE next morning Diamond was up almost as early as before .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 20]: He had nothing to fear from his mother now , and made no secret of what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 15]: By the time he reached the stable , several of the men were there .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 25]: They asked him a good many questions as to his luck the day before , and he told them all they wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 32]: But when he proceeded to harness the old horse , they pushed him aside with rough kindness , called him a baby , and began to do it all for him .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 37]: So Diamond ran in and had another mouthful of tea and bread and butter ; and although he had never been so tired as he was the night before , he started quite fresh this morning .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 53]: It was a cloudy day , and the wind blew hard from the north -- so hard sometimes that , perched on the box with just his toes touching the ground , Diamond wished that he had some kind of strap to fasten himself down with lest he should be blown away .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 8]: But he did not really mind it .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 39]: His head was full of the dream he had dreamed ; but it did not make him neglect his work , for his work was not to dig stars but to drive old Diamond and pick up fares .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 20]: There are not many people who can think about beautiful things and do common work at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 18]: But then there are not many people who have been to the back of the north wind .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 7]: There was not much business doing .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 22]: And Diamond felt rather cold , notwithstanding his mother had herself put on his comforter and helped him with his greatcoat .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 18]: But he was too well aware of his dignity to get inside his cab as some do .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 16]: A cabman ought to be above minding the weather -- at least so Diamond thought .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 28]: At length he was called to a neighbouring house , where a young woman with a heavy box had to be taken to Wapping for a coast-steamer .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 26]: He did not find it at all pleasant , so far east and so near the river ; for the roughs were in great force .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 29]: However , there being no block , not even in Nightingale Lane , he reached the entrance of the wharf , and set down his passenger without annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 30]: But as he turned to go back , some idlers , not content with chaffing him , showed a mind to the fare the young woman had given him .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 53]: They were just pulling him off the box , and Diamond was shouting for the police , when a pale-faced man , in very shabby clothes , but with the look of a gentleman somewhere about him , came up , and making good use of his stick , drove them off .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 18]: `` Now , my little man , '' he said , `` get on while you can .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 6]: Do n't lose any time .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 9]: This is not a place for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 13]: But Diamond was not in the habit of thinking only of himself .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 17]: He saw that his new friend looked weary , if not ill , and very poor .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you jump in , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 10]: `` I will take you wherever you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 19]: `` Thank you , my man ; but I have no money ; so I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 7]: I do n't want any money .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 11]: I shall be much happier if you will get in .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 8]: You have saved me all I had .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 9]: I owe you a lift , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 8]: `` Which way are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 15]: `` To Charing Cross ; but I do n't mind where I go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 8]: `` Well , I am very tired .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 17]: If you will take me to Charing Cross , I shall be greatly obliged to you .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 19]: I have walked from Gravesend , and had hardly a penny left to get through the tunnel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 16]: So saying , he opened the door and got in , and Diamond drove away .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 26]: But as he drove , he could not help fancying he had seen the gentleman -- for Diamond knew he was a gentleman -- before .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 15]: Do all he could , however , he could not recall where or when .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 68]: Meantime his fare , if we may call him such , seeing he was to pay nothing , whom the relief of being carried had made less and less inclined to carry himself , had been turning over things in his mind , and , as they passed the Mint , called to Diamond , who stopped the horse , got down and went to the window .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 23]: `` If you did n't mind taking me to Chiswick , I should be able to pay you when we got there .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 22]: It 's a long way , but you shall have the whole fare from the Docks -- and something over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 9]: `` Very well , sir '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 8]: `` I shall be most happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 44]: He was just clambering up again , when the gentleman put his head out of the window and said -- `` It 's The Wilderness -- Mr. Coleman 's place ; but I 'll direct you when we come into the neighbourhood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 8]: It flashed upon Diamond who he was .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 15]: But he got upon his box to arrange his thoughts before making any reply .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 29]: The gentleman was Mr. Evans , to whom Miss Coleman was to have been married , and Diamond had seen him several times with her in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 14]: I have said that he had not behaved very well to Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 33]: He had put off their marriage more than once in a cowardly fashion , merely because he was ashamed to marry upon a small income , and live in a humble way .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 27]: When a man thinks of what people will say in such a case , he may love , but his love is but a poor affair .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 31]: Mr. Coleman took him into the firm as a junior partner , and it was in a measure through his influence that he entered upon those speculations which ruined him .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 9]: So his love had not been a blessing .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 32]: The ship which North Wind had sunk was their last venture , and Mr. Evans had gone out with it in the hope of turning its cargo to the best advantage .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 29]: He was one of the single boat-load which managed to reach a desert island , and he had gone through a great many hardships and sufferings since then .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 49]: But he was not past being taught , and his troubles had done him no end of good , for they had made him doubt himself , and begin to think , so that he had come to see that he had been foolish as well as wicked .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 62]: For , if he had had Miss Coleman with him in the desert island , to build her a hut , and hunt for her food , and make clothes for her , he would have thought himself the most fortunate of men ; and when he was at home , he would not marry till he could afford a man-servant .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 42]: Before he got home again , he had even begun to understand that no man can make haste to be rich without going against the will of God , in which case it is the one frightful thing to be successful .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 20]: So he had come back a more humble man , and longing to ask Miss Coleman to forgive him .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 26]: But he had no idea what ruin had fallen upon them , for he had never made himself thoroughly acquainted with the firm 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 9]: Few speculative people do know their own affairs .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 26]: Hence he never doubted he should find matters much as he left them , and expected to see them all at The Wilderness as before .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 20]: But if he had not fallen in with Diamond , he would not have thought of going there first .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 6]: What was Diamond to do ?
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 20]: He had heard his father and mother drop some remarks concerning Mr. Evans which made him doubtful of him .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 15]: He understood that he had not been so considerate as he might have been .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 13]: So he went rather slowly till he should make up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 16]: It was , of course , of no use to drive Mr. Evans to Chiswick .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 46]: But if he should tell him what had befallen them , and where they lived now , he might put off going to see them , and he was certain that Miss Coleman , at least , must want very much to see Mr. Evans .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 27]: He was pretty sure also that the best thing in any case was to bring them together , and let them set matters right for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 30]: The moment he came to this conclusion , he changed his course from westward to northward , and went straight for Mr. Coleman 's poor little house in Hoxton .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 37]: Mr. Evans was too tired and too much occupied with his thoughts to take the least notice of the streets they passed through , and had no suspicion , therefore , of the change of direction .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 31]: By this time the wind had increased almost to a hurricane , and as they had often to head it , it was no joke for either of the Diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 9]: The distance , however , was not great .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 53]: Before they reached the street where Mr. Coleman lived it blew so tremendously , that when Miss Coleman , who was going out a little way , opened the door , it dashed against the wall with such a bang , that she was afraid to venture , and went in again .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 12]: In five minutes after , Diamond drew up at the door .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 42]: As soon as he had entered the street , however , the wind blew right behind them , and when he pulled up , old Diamond had so much ado to stop the cab against it , that the breeching broke .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 45]: Young Diamond jumped off his box , knocked loudly at the door , then turned to the cab and said -- before Mr. Evans had quite begun to think something must be amiss : `` Please , sir , my harness has given away .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 11]: Would you mind stepping in here for a few minutes ?
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 6]: They 're friends of mine .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 14]: I 'll take you where you like after I 've got it mended .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 17]: I sha n't be many minutes , but you ca n't stand in this wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 34]: Half stupid with fatigue and want of food , Mr. Evans yielded to the boy 's suggestion , and walked in at the door which the maid held with difficulty against the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 23]: She took Mr. Evans for a visitor , as indeed he was , and showed him into the room on the ground-floor .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 23]: Diamond , who had followed into the hall , whispered to her as she closed the door -- `` Tell Miss Coleman .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 10]: It 's Miss Coleman he wants to see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 10]: `` I do n't know '' said the maid .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 11]: `` He do n't look much like a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 18]: `` He is , though ; and I know him , and so does Miss Coleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 21]: The maid could not but remember Diamond , having seen him when he and his father brought the ladies home .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 14]: So she believed him , and went to do what he told her .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 24]: What passed in the little parlour when Miss Coleman came down does not belong to my story , which is all about Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 20]: If he had known that Miss Coleman thought Mr. Evans was dead , perhaps he would have managed differently .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 21]: There was a cry and a running to and fro in the house , and then all was quiet again .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 20]: Almost as soon as Mr. Evans went in , the wind began to cease , and was now still .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 59]: Diamond found that by making the breeching just a little tighter than was quite comfortable for the old horse he could do very well for the present ; and , thinking it better to let him have his bag in this quiet place , he sat on the box till the old horse should have eaten his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 16]: In a little while Mr. Evans came out , and asked him to come in .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 25]: Diamond obeyed , and to his delight Miss Coleman put her arms round him and kissed him , and there was payment for him !
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 29]: Not to mention the five precious shillings she gave him , which he could not refuse because his mother wanted them so much at home for his father .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 11]: He left them nearly as happy as they were themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 34]: The rest of the day he did better , and , although he had not so much to take home as the day before , yet on the whole the result was satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 28]: And what a story he had to tell his father and mother about his adventures , and how he had done , and what was the result !
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 9]: They asked him such a multitude of questions !
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 63]: some of which he could answer , and some of which he could not answer ; and his father seemed ever so much better from finding that his boy was already not only useful to his family but useful to other people , and quite taking his place as a man who judged what was wise , and did work worth doing .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 15]: For a fortnight Diamond went on driving his cab , and keeping his family .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 28]: He had begun to be known about some parts of London , and people would prefer taking his cab because they liked what they heard of him .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 68]: One gentleman who lived near the mews engaged him to carry him to the City every morning at a certain hour ; and Diamond was punctual as clockwork -- though to effect that required a good deal of care , for his father 's watch was not much to be depended on , and had to be watched itself by the clock of St. George 's church .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 14]: Between the two , however , he did make a success of it .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 13]: After that fortnight , his father was able to go out again .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 16]: Then Diamond went to make inquiries about Nanny , and this led to something else .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 20]: THE CHILDREN 'S HOSPITAL THE first day his father resumed his work , Diamond went with him as usual .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 31]: In the afternoon , however , his father , having taken a fare to the neighbourhood , went home , and Diamond drove the cab the rest of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 22]: It was hard for old Diamond to do all the work , but they could not afford to have another horse .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 20]: They contrived to save him as much as possible , and fed him well , and he did bravely .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 26]: The next morning his father was so much stronger that Diamond thought he might go and ask Mr. Raymond to take him to see Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 6]: He found him at home .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 17]: His servant had grown friendly by this time , and showed him in without any cross-questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 27]: Mr. Raymond received him with his usual kindness , consented at once , and walked with him to the Hospital , which was close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 49]: It was a comfortable old-fashioned house , built in the reign of Queen Anne , and in her day , no doubt , inhabited by rich and fashionable people : now it was a home for poor sick children , who were carefully tended for love 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 34]: There are regions in London where a hospital in every other street might be full of such children , whose fathers and mothers are dead , or unable to take care of them .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 59]: When Diamond followed Mr. Raymond into the room where those children who had got over the worst of their illness and were growing better lay , he saw a number of little iron bedsteads , with their heads to the walls , and in every one of them a child , whose face was a story in itself .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 41]: In some , health had begun to appear in a tinge upon the cheeks , and a doubtful brightness in the eyes , just as out of the cold dreary winter the spring comes in blushing buds and bright crocuses .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 12]: In others there were more of the signs of winter left .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 50]: Their faces reminded you of snow and keen cutting winds , more than of sunshine and soft breezes and butterflies ; but even in them the signs of suffering told that the suffering was less , and that if the spring-time had but arrived , it had yet arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 11]: Diamond looked all round , but could see no Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 12]: He turned to Mr. Raymond with a question in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 4]: said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: `` Nanny 's not here , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 8]: `` I do n't see her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 6]: `` I do , though .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 5]: There she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 14]: He pointed to a bed right in front of where Diamond was standing .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 10]: `` That 's not Nanny , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 5]: `` It is Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 10]: I have seen her many times since you have .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 7]: Illness makes a great difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 17]: `` Why , that girl must have been to the back of the north wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 32]: thought Diamond , but he said nothing , only stared ; and as he stared , something of the old Nanny began to dawn through the face of the new Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 29]: The old Nanny , though a good girl , and a friendly girl , had been rough , blunt in her speech , and dirty in her person .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 84]: Her face would always have reminded one who had already been to the back of the north wind of something he had seen in the best of company , but it had been coarse notwithstanding , partly from the weather , partly from her living amongst low people , and partly from having to defend herself : now it was so sweet , and gentle , and refined , that she might have had a lady and gentleman for a father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 34]: And Diamond could not help thinking of words which he had heard in the church the day before : `` Surely it is good to be afflicted ; '' or something like that .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 15]: North Wind , somehow or other , must have had to do with her !
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 12]: She had grown from a rough girl into a gentle maiden .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 52]: Mr. Raymond , however , was not surprised , for he was used to see such lovely changes -- something like the change which passes upon the crawling , many-footed creature , when it turns sick and ill , and revives a butterfly , with two wings instead of many feet .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 99]: Instead of her having to take care of herself , kind hands ministered to her , making her comfortable and sweet and clean , soothing her aching head , and giving her cooling drink when she was thirsty ; and kind eyes , the stars of the kingdom of heaven , had shone upon her ; so that , what with the fire of the fever and the dew of tenderness , that which was coarse in her had melted away , and her whole face had grown so refined and sweet that Diamond did not know her .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 71]: But as he gazed , the best of the old face , all the true and good part of it , that which was Nanny herself , dawned upon him , like the moon coming out of a cloud , until at length , instead of only believing Mr. Raymond that this was she , he saw for himself that it was Nanny indeed -- very worn but grown beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 6]: He went up to her .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 3]: She smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 14]: He had heard her laugh , but had never seen her smile before .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 9]: `` Nanny , do you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 12]: She only smiled again , as if the question was amusing .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 40]: She was not likely to forget him ; for although she did not yet know it was he who had got her there , she had dreamed of him often , and had talked much about him when delirious .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 21]: Nor was it much wonder , for he was the only boy except Joe who had ever shown her kindness .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 16]: Meantime Mr. Raymond was going from bed to bed , talking to the little people .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 26]: Every one knew him , and every one was eager to have a look , and a smile , and a kind word from him .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 14]: Diamond sat down on a stool at the head of Nanny 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 7]: She laid her hand in his .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 12]: No one else of her old acquaintance had been near her .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 18]: Suddenly a little voice called aloud -- `` Wo n't Mr. Raymond tell us a story ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , please do !
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 4]: please do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 12]: cried several little voices which also were stronger than the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 39]: For Mr. Raymond was in the habit of telling them a story when he went to see them , and they enjoyed it far more than the other nice things which the doctor permitted him to give them .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 13]: `` Very well , '' said Mr. Raymond , `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 10]: What sort of a story shall it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 11]: `` A true story , '' said one little girl .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 11]: `` A fairy tale , '' said a little boy .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 22]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Raymond , `` I suppose , as there is a difference , I may choose .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 26]: I ca n't think of any true story just at this moment , so I will tell you a sort of a fairy one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 6]: `` Oh , jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 13]: exclaimed the little boy who had called out for a fairy tale .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 55]: `` It came into my head this morning as I got out of bed , '' continued Mr. Raymond ; `` and if it turns out pretty well , I will write it down , and get somebody to print it for me , and then you shall read it when you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 9]: `` Then nobody ever heard it before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 5]: asked one older child .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 6]: `` No , nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 41]: exclaimed several , thinking it very grand to have the first telling ; and I daresay there might be a peculiar freshness about it , because everything would be nearly as new to the story-teller himself as to the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 68]: Some were only sitting up and some were lying down , so there could not be the same busy gathering , bustling , and shifting to and fro with which children generally prepare themselves to hear a story ; but their faces , and the turning of their heads , and many feeble exclamations of expected pleasure , showed that all such preparations were making within them .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 28]: Mr. Raymond stood in the middle of the room , that he might turn from side to side , and give each a share of seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 15]: Diamond kept his place by Nanny 's side , with her hand in his .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 49]: I do not know how much of Mr. Raymond 's story the smaller children understood ; indeed , I do n't quite know how much there was in it to be understood , for in such a story every one has just to take what he can get .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 14]: But they all listened with apparent satisfaction , and certainly with great attention .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 33]: Mr. Raymond wrote it down afterwards , and here it is -- somewhat altered no doubt , for a good story-teller tries to make his stories better every time he tells them .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 23]: I can not myself help thinking that he was somewhat indebted for this one to the old story of The Sleeping Beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 39]: LITTLE DAYLIGHT NO HOUSE of any pretension to be called a palace is in the least worthy of the name , except it has a wood near it -- very near it -- and the nearer the better .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 50]: Not all round it -- I do n't mean that , for a palace ought to be open to the sun and wind , and stand high and brave , with weathercocks glittering and flags flying ; but on one side of every palace there must be a wood .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 41]: And there was a very grand wood indeed beside the palace of the king who was going to be Daylight 's father ; such a grand wood , that nobody yet had ever got to the other end of it .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 55]: Near the house it was kept very trim and nice , and it was free of brushwood for a long way in ; but by degrees it got wild , and it grew wilder , and wilder , and wilder , until some said wild beasts at last did what they liked in it .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 22]: The king and his courtiers often hunted , however , and this kept the wild beasts far away from the palace .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 79]: One glorious summer morning , when the wind and sun were out together , when the vanes were flashing and the flags frolicking against the blue sky , little Daylight made her appearance from somewhere -- nobody could tell where -- a beautiful baby , with such bright eyes that she might have come from the sun , only by and by she showed such lively ways that she might equally well have come out of the wind .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 37]: There was great jubilation in the palace , for this was the first baby the queen had had , and there is as much happiness over a new baby in a palace as in a cottage .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 22]: But there is one disadvantage of living near a wood : you do not know quite who your neighbours may be .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 55]: Everybody knew there were in it several fairies , living within a few miles of the palace , who always had had something to do with each new baby that came ; for fairies live so much longer than we , that they can have business with a good many generations of human mortals .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 54]: The curious houses they lived in were well known also , -- one , a hollow oak ; another , a birch-tree , though nobody could ever find how that fairy made a house of it ; another , a hut of growing trees intertwined , and patched up with turf and moss .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 26]: But there was another fairy who had lately come to the place , and nobody even knew she was a fairy except the other fairies .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 42]: A wicked old thing she was , always concealing her power , and being as disagreeable as she could , in order to tempt people to give her offence , that she might have the pleasure of taking vengeance upon them .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 23]: The people about thought she was a witch , and those who knew her by sight were careful to avoid offending her .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 15]: She lived in a mud house , in a swampy part of the forest .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 31]: In all history we find that fairies give their remarkable gifts to prince or princess , or any child of sufficient importance in their eyes , always at the christening .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 68]: Now this we can understand , because it is an ancient custom amongst human beings as well ; and it is not hard to explain why wicked fairies should choose the same time to do unkind things ; but it is difficult to understand how they should be able to do them , for you would fancy all wicked creatures would be powerless on such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 26]: But I never knew of any interference on the part of the wicked fairy that did not turn out a good thing in the end .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 20]: What a good thing , for instance , it was that one princess should sleep for a hundred years !
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 18]: Was she not saved from all the plague of young men who were not worthy of her ?
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 18]: And did she not come awake exactly at the right moment when the right prince kissed her ?
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 23]: For my part , I can not help wishing a good many girls would sleep till just the same fate overtook them .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 14]: It would be happier for them , and more agreeable to their friends .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 12]: Of course all the known fairies were invited to the christening .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 13]: But the king and queen never thought of inviting an old witch .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 20]: For the power of the fairies they have by nature ; whereas a witch gets her power by wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 24]: The other fairies , however , knowing the danger thus run , provided as well as they could against accidents from her quarter .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 30]: But they could neither render her powerless , nor could they arrange their gifts in reference to hers beforehand , for they could not tell what those might be .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 11]: Of course the old hag was there without being asked .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 26]: Not to be asked was just what she wanted , that she might have a sort of reason for doing what she wished to do .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 16]: For somehow even the wickedest of creatures likes a pretext for doing the wrong thing .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 123]: Five fairies had one after the other given the child such gifts as each counted best , and the fifth had just stepped back to her place in the surrounding splendour of ladies and gentlemen , when , mumbling a laugh between her toothless gums , the wicked fairy hobbled out into the middle of the circle , and at the moment when the archbishop was handing the baby to the lady at the head of the nursery department of state affairs , addressed him thus , giving a bite or two to every word before she could part with it : `` Please your Grace , I 'm very deaf : would your Grace mind repeating the princess 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 30]: `` With pleasure , my good woman , '' said the archbishop , stooping to shout in her ear : `` the infant 's name is little Daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 33]: `` And little daylight it shall be , '' cried the fairy , in the tone of a dry axle , `` and little good shall any of her gifts do her .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 19]: For I bestow upon her the gift of sleeping all day long , whether she will or not .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 4]: He , he !
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 5]: Hi , hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 33]: Then out started the sixth fairy , who , of course , the others had arranged should come after the wicked one , in order to undo as much as she might .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 25]: `` If she sleep all day , '' she said , mournfully , `` she shall , at least , wake all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 11]: `` A nice prospect for her mother and me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 37]: thought the poor king ; for they loved her far too much to give her up to nurses , especially at night , as most kings and queens do -- and are sorry for it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 14]: `` You spoke before I had done , '' said the wicked fairy .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 7]: `` That 's against the law .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 7]: It gives me another chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 15]: `` I beg your pardon , '' said the other fairies , all together .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 4]: `` She did .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 11]: I had n't done laughing , '' said the crone .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 10]: `` I had only got to Hi , hi !
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 10]: and I had to go through Ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 5]: and Hu , hu !
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 21]: So I decree that if she wakes all night she shall wax and wane with its mistress , the moon .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 15]: And what that may mean I hope her royal parents will live to see .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 4]: Ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 5]: Hu , hu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 27]: But out stepped another fairy , for they had been wise enough to keep two in reserve , because every fairy knew the trick of one .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 22]: `` Until , '' said the seventh fairy , `` a prince comes who shall kiss her without knowing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 16]: The wicked fairy made a horrid noise like an angry cat , and hobbled away .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 22]: She could not pretend that she had not finished her speech this time , for she had laughed Ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 5]: and Hu , hu !
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 19]: `` I do n't know what that means , '' said the poor king to the seventh fairy .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 6]: `` Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 13]: The meaning will come with the thing itself , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 52]: The assembly broke up , miserable enough -- the queen , at least , prepared for a good many sleepless nights , and the lady at the head of the nursery department anything but comfortable in the prospect before her , for of course the queen could not do it all .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 52]: As for the king , he made up his mind , with what courage he could summon , to meet the demands of the case , but wondered whether he could with any propriety require the First Lord of the Treasury to take a share in the burden laid upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 16]: I will not attempt to describe what they had to go through for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 19]: But at last the household settled into a regular system -- a very irregular one in some respects .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 56]: For at certain seasons the palace rang all night with bursts of laughter from little Daylight , whose heart the old fairy 's curse could not reach ; she was Daylight still , only a little in the wrong place , for she always dropped asleep at the first hint of dawn in the east .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 8]: But her merriment was of short duration .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 30]: When the moon was at the full , she was in glorious spirits , and as beautiful as it was possible for a child of her age to be .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 42]: But as the moon waned , she faded , until at last she was wan and withered like the poorest , sickliest child you might come upon in the streets of a great city in the arms of a homeless mother .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 39]: Then the night was quiet as the day , for the little creature lay in her gorgeous cradle night and day with hardly a motion , and indeed at last without even a moan , like one dead .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 53]: At first they often thought she was dead , but at last they got used to it , and only consulted the almanac to find the moment when she would begin to revive , which , of course , was with the first appearance of the silver thread of the crescent moon .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 36]: Then she would move her lips , and they would give her a little nourishment ; and she would grow better and better and better , until for a few days she was splendidly well .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 42]: When well , she was always merriest out in the moonlight ; but even when near her worst , she seemed better when , in warm summer nights , they carried her cradle out into the light of the waning moon .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 14]: Then in her sleep she would smile the faintest , most pitiful smile .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 12]: For a long time very few people ever saw her awake .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 36]: As she grew older she became such a favourite , however , that about the palace there were always some who would contrive to keep awake at night , in order to be near her .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 20]: But she soon began to take every chance of getting away from her nurses and enjoying her moonlight alone .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 14]: And thus things went on until she was nearly seventeen years of age .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 26]: Her father and mother had by that time got so used to the odd state of things that they had ceased to wonder at them .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 24]: All their arrangements had reference to the state of the Princess Daylight , and it is amazing how things contrive to accommodate themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 15]: But how any prince was ever to find and deliver her , appeared inconceivable .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 35]: As she grew older she had grown more and more beautiful , with the sunniest hair and the loveliest eyes of heavenly blue , brilliant and profound as the sky of a June day .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 17]: But so much more painful and sad was the change as her bad time came on .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 23]: The more beautiful she was in the full moon , the more withered and worn did she become as the moon waned .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 30]: At the time at which my story has now arrived , she looked , when the moon was small or gone , like an old woman exhausted with suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 20]: This was the more painful that her appearance was unnatural ; for her hair and eyes did not change .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 16]: Her wan face was both drawn and wrinkled , and had an eager hungry look .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 17]: Her skinny hands moved as if wishing , but unable , to lay hold of something .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 22]: Her shoulders were bent forward , her chest went in , and she stooped as if she were eighty years old .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 21]: At last she had to be put to bed , and there await the flow of the tide of life .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 20]: But she grew to dislike being seen , still more being touched by any hands , during this season .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 63]: One lovely summer evening , when the moon lay all but gone upon the verge of the horizon , she vanished from her attendants , and it was only after searching for her a long time in great terror , that they found her fast asleep in the forest , at the foot of a silver birch , and carried her home .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 21]: A little way from the palace there was a great open glade , covered with the greenest and softest grass .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 40]: This was her favourite haunt ; for here the full moon shone free and glorious , while through a vista in the trees she could generally see more or less of the dying moon as it crossed the opening .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 17]: Here she had a little rustic house built for her , and here she mostly resided .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 37]: None of the court might go there without leave , and her own attendants had learned by this time not to be officious in waiting upon her , so that she was very much at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 71]: Whether the good fairies had anything to do with it or not I can not tell , but at last she got into the way of retreating further into the wood every night as the moon waned , so that sometimes they had great trouble in finding her ; but as she was always very angry if she discovered they were watching her , they scarcely dared to do so .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 12]: At length one night they thought they had lost her altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 8]: It was morning before they found her .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 29]: Feeble as she was , she had wandered into a thicket a long way from the glade , and there she lay -- fast asleep , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 38]: Although the fame of her beauty and sweetness had gone abroad , yet as everybody knew she was under a bad spell , no king in the neighbourhood had any desire to have her for a daughter-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 9]: There were serious objections to such a relation .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 55]: About this time in a neighbouring kingdom , in consequence of the wickedness of the nobles , an insurrection took place upon the death of the old king , the greater part of the nobility was massacred , and the young prince was compelled to flee for his life , disguised like a peasant .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 53]: For some time , until he got out of the country , he suffered much from hunger and fatigue ; but when he got into that ruled by the princess 's father , and had no longer any fear of being recognised , he fared better , for the people were kind .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 9]: He did not abandon his disguise , however .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 33]: One tolerable reason was that he had no other clothes to put on , and another that he had very little money , and did not know where to get any more .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 42]: There was no good in telling everybody he met that he was a prince , for he felt that a prince ought to be able to get on like other people , else his rank only made a fool of him .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 29]: He had read of princes setting out upon adventure ; and here he was out in similar case , only without having had a choice in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 13]: He would go on , and see what would come of it .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 43]: For a day or two he had been walking through the palace-wood , and had had next to nothing to eat , when he came upon the strangest little house , inhabited by a very nice , tidy , motherly old woman .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 8]: This was one of the good fairies .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 36]: The moment she saw him she knew quite well who he was and what was going to come of it ; but she was not at liberty to interfere with the orderly march of events .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 48]: She received him with the kindness she would have shown to any other traveller , and gave him bread and milk , which he thought the most delicious food he had ever tasted , wondering that they did not have it for dinner at the palace sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 10]: The old woman pressed him to stay all night .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 15]: When he awoke he was amazed to find how well and strong he felt .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 33]: She would not take any of the money he offered , but begged him , if he found occasion of continuing in the neighbourhood , to return and occupy the same quarters .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 22]: `` Thank you much , good mother , '' answered the prince ; `` but there is little chance of that .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 12]: The sooner I get out of this wood the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 12]: `` I do n't know that , '' said the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 4]: asked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 9]: `` Why , how should I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 3]: returned she .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 11]: `` I ca n't tell , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 9]: `` Very well , '' said the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: `` How strangely you talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 4]: said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 5]: `` Do I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 4]: said the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 11]: `` Yes , you do , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 9]: `` Very well , '' said the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 26]: The prince was not used to be spoken to in this fashion , so he felt a little angry , and turned and walked away .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 8]: But this did not offend the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 19]: She stood at the door of her little house looking after him till the trees hid him quite .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 8]: Then she said `` At last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 4]: and went in .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 10]: The prince wandered and wandered , and got nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 24]: The sun sank and sank and went out of sight , and he seemed no nearer the end of the wood than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 54]: He sat down on a fallen tree , ate a bit of bread the old woman had given him , and waited for the moon ; for , although he was not much of an astronomer , he knew the moon would rise some time , because she had risen the night before .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 40]: Up she came , slow and slow , but of a good size , pretty nearly round indeed ; whereupon , greatly refreshed with his piece of bread , he got up and went -- he knew not whither .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 49]: After walking a considerable distance , he thought he was coming to the outside of the forest ; but when he reached what he thought the last of it , he found himself only upon the edge of a great open space in it , covered with grass .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 18]: The moon shone very bright , and he thought he had never seen a more lovely spot .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 21]: Still it looked dreary because of its loneliness , for he could not see the house at the other side .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 13]: He sat down , weary again , and gazed into the glade .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 11]: He had not seen so much room for several days .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 13]: All at once he spied something in the middle of the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 5]: What could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 7]: It moved ; it came nearer .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 20]: Was it a human creature , gliding across -- a girl dressed in white , gleaming in the moonshine ?
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 6]: She came nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 10]: He crept behind a tree and watched , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 26]: It must be some strange being of the wood -- a nymph whom the moonlight and the warm dusky air had enticed from her tree .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 46]: But when she came close to where he stood , he no longer doubted she was human -- for he had caught sight of her sunny hair , and her clear blue eyes , and the loveliest face and form that he had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 26]: All at once she began singing like a nightingale , and dancing to her own music , with her eyes ever turned towards the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 45]: She passed close to where he stood , dancing on by the edge of the trees and away in a great circle towards the other side , until he could see but a spot of white in the yellowish green of the moonlit grass .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 20]: But when he feared it would vanish quite , the spot grew , and became a figure once more .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 24]: She approached him again , singing and dancing , and waving her arms over her head , until she had completed the circle .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 29]: Just opposite his tree she stood , ceased her song , dropped her arms , and broke out into a long clear laugh , musical as a brook .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 20]: Then , as if tired , she threw herself on the grass , and lay gazing at the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 21]: The prince was almost afraid to breathe lest he should startle her , and she should vanish from his sight .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 13]: As to venturing near her , that never came into his head .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 20]: She had lain for a long hour or longer , when the prince began again to doubt concerning her .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 11]: Perhaps she was but a vision of his own fancy .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 12]: Or was she a spirit of the wood , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 25]: If so , he too would haunt the wood , glad to have lost kingdom and everything for the hope of being near her .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 24]: He would build him a hut in the forest , and there he would live for the pure chance of seeing her again .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 22]: Upon nights like this at least she would come out and bask in the moonlight , and make his soul blessed .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 39]: But while he thus dreamed she sprang to her feet , turned her face full to the moon , and began singing as she would draw her down from the sky by the power of her entrancing voice .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 7]: She looked more beautiful than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 16]: Again she began dancing to her own music , and danced away into the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 37]: Once more she returned in a similar manner ; but although he was watching as eagerly as before , what with fatigue and what with gazing , he fell fast asleep before she came near him .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 14]: When he awoke it was broad daylight , and the princess was nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 7]: He could not leave the place .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 9]: What if she should come the next night !
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 22]: He would gladly endure a day 's hunger to see her yet again : he would buckle his belt quite tight .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 17]: He walked round the glade to see if he could discover any prints of her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 26]: But the grass was so short , and her steps had been so light , that she had not left a single trace behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 15]: He walked half-way round the wood without seeing anything to account for her presence .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 29]: Then he spied a lovely little house , with thatched roof and low eaves , surrounded by an exquisite garden , with doves and peacocks walking in it .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 15]: Of course this must be where the gracious lady who loved the moonlight lived .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 44]: Forgetting his appearance , he walked towards the door , determined to make inquiries , but as he passed a little pond full of gold and silver fishes , he caught sight of himself and turned to find the door to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 12]: There he knocked , and asked for a piece of bread .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 28]: The good-natured cook brought him in , and gave him an excellent breakfast , which the prince found nothing the worse for being served in the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 23]: While he ate , he talked with his entertainer , and learned that this was the favourite retreat of the Princess Daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 40]: But he learned nothing more , both because he was afraid of seeming inquisitive , and because the cook did not choose to be heard talking about her mistress to a peasant lad who had begged for his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 52]: As he rose to take his leave , it occurred to him that he might not be so far from the old woman 's cottage as he had thought , and he asked the cook whether she knew anything of such a place , describing it as well as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 25]: She said she knew it well enough , adding with a smile -- `` It 's there you 're going , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 11]: `` Yes , if it 's not far off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 9]: `` It 's not more than three miles .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 11]: But mind what you are about , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 8]: `` Why do you say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 16]: `` If you 're after any mischief , she 'll make you repent it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 16]: `` The best thing that could happen under the circumstances , '' remarked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 9]: `` What do you mean by that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 4]: asked the cook .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 37]: `` Why , it stands to reason , '' answered the prince `` that if you wish to do anything wrong , the best thing for you is to be made to repent of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 9]: `` I see , '' said the cook .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 9]: `` Well , I think you may venture .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 8]: She 's a good old soul . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 10]: `` Which way does it lie from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 4]: asked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 14]: She gave him full instructions ; and he left her with many thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 48]: Being now refreshed , however , the prince did not go back to the cottage that day : he remained in the forest , amusing himself as best he could , but waiting anxiously for the night , in the hope that the princess would again appear .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 22]: Nor was he disappointed , for , directly the moon rose , he spied a glimmering shape far across the glade .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 32]: As it drew nearer , he saw it was she indeed -- not dressed in white as before : in a pale blue like the sky , she looked lovelier still .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 33]: He thought it was that the blue suited her yet better than the white ; he did not know that she was really more beautiful because the moon was nearer the full .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 22]: In fact the next night was full moon , and the princess would then be at the zenith of her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 59]: The prince feared for some time that she was not coming near his hiding-place that night ; but the circles in her dance ever widened as the moon rose , until at last they embraced the whole glade , and she came still closer to the trees where he was hiding than she had come the night before .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 15]: He was entranced with her loveliness , for it was indeed a marvellous thing .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 14]: All night long he watched her , but dared not go near her .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 26]: He would have been ashamed of watching her too , had he not become almost incapable of thinking of anything but how beautiful she was .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 33]: He watched the whole night long , and saw that as the moon went down she retreated in smaller and smaller circles , until at last he could see her no more .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 31]: Weary as he was , he set out for the old woman 's cottage , where he arrived just in time for her breakfast , which she shared with him .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 12]: He then went to bed , and slept for many hours .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 25]: When he awoke the sun was down , and he departed in great anxiety lest he should lose a glimpse of the lovely vision .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 35]: But , whether it was by the machinations of the swamp-fairy , or merely that it is one thing to go and another to return by the same road , he lost his way .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 24]: I shall not attempt to describe his misery when the moon rose , and he saw nothing but trees , trees , trees .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 12]: She was high in the heavens before he reached the glade .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 35]: Then indeed his troubles vanished , for there was the princess coming dancing towards him , in a dress that shone like gold , and with shoes that glimmered through the grass like fireflies .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 10]: She was of course still more beautiful than before .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 15]: Like an embodied sunbeam she passed him , and danced away into the distance .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 17]: Before she returned in her circle , the clouds had begun to gather about the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 19]: The wind rose , the trees moaned , and their lighter branches leaned all one way before it .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 20]: The prince feared that the princess would go in , and he should see her no more that night .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 46]: But she came dancing on more jubilant than ever , her golden dress and her sunny hair streaming out upon the blast , waving her arms towards the moon , and in the exuberance of her delight ordering the clouds away from off her face .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 17]: The prince could hardly believe she was not a creature of the elements , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 23]: By the time she had completed another circle , the clouds had gathered deep , and there were growlings of distant thunder .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 37]: Just as she passed the tree where he stood , a flash of lightning blinded him for a moment , and when he saw again , to his horror , the princess lay on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 27]: He darted to her , thinking she had been struck ; but when she heard him coming , she was on her feet in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 6]: `` I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 12]: I thought -- the lightning '' said the prince , hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 18]: `` There 's nothing the matter , '' said the princess , waving him off rather haughtily .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 10]: The poor prince turned and walked towards the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 13]: `` Come back , '' said Daylight : `` I like you .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 7]: You do what you are told .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 5]: Are you good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 16]: `` Not so good as I should like to be , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 12]: `` Then go and grow better , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 8]: Again the disappointed prince turned and went .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 9]: `` Come back , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 9]: He obeyed , and stood before her waiting .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 12]: `` Can you tell me what the sun is like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 7]: `` No , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 13]: `` But where 's the good of asking what you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 11]: `` But I do n't know , '' she rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 7]: `` Why , everybody knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 12]: `` That 's the very thing : I 'm not everybody .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 8]: I 've never seen the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 17]: `` Then you ca n't know what it 's like till you do see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 14]: `` I think you must be a prince , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 8]: `` Do I look like one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 4]: said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 9]: `` I ca n't quite say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 9]: `` Then why do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 14]: `` Because you both do what you are told and speak the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: -- Is the sun so very bright ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 8]: `` As bright as the lightning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 14]: `` But it does n't go out like that , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 37]: It shines like the moon , rises and sets like the moon , is much the same shape as the moon , only so bright that you ca n't look at it for a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 13]: `` But I would look at it , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 11]: `` But you could n't , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 10]: `` But I could , '' said the princess .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 7]: `` Because I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 7]: `` Why ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 7]: `` Because I ca n't wake .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 32]: And I never shall wake until -- '' Here she hid her face in her hands , turned away , and walked in the slowest , stateliest manner towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 32]: The prince ventured to follow her at a little distance , but she turned and made a repellent gesture , which , like a true gentleman-prince , he obeyed at once .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 36]: He waited a long time , but as she did not come near him again , and as the night had now cleared , he set off at last for the old woman 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 26]: It was long past midnight when he reached it , but , to his surprise , the old woman was paring potatoes at the door .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 8]: Fairies are fond of doing odd things .
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 14]: Indeed , however they may dissemble , the night is always their day .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 13]: And so it is with all who have fairy blood in them .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 18]: `` Why , what are you doing there , this time of the night , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 29]: said the prince ; for that was the kind way in which any young man in his country would address a woman who was much older than himself .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 13]: `` Getting your supper ready , my son , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 15]: `` Oh , I do n't want any supper , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 9]: you 've seen Daylight , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 16]: `` I 've seen a princess who never saw it , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 7]: `` Do you like her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: asked the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 5]: do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 4]: said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 10]: `` More than you would believe , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 20]: `` A fairy can believe anything that ever was or ever could be , '' said the old woman .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 8]: `` Then are you a fairy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 4]: asked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 13]: `` Then what do you do for things not to believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 4]: asked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 17]: `` There 's plenty of them -- everything that never was nor ever could be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 12]: `` Plenty , I grant you , '' said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 16]: `` But do you believe there could be a princess who never saw the daylight ?
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 7]: Do you believe that now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 23]: This the prince said , not that he doubted the princess , but that he wanted the fairy to tell him more .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 15]: She was too old a fairy , however , to be caught so easily .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 11]: `` Of all people , fairies must not tell secrets .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 8]: Besides , she 's a princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'll tell you a secret .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 6]: I 'm a prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 6]: `` I know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 8]: `` How do you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 14]: `` By the curl of the third eyelash on your left eyelid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 9]: `` Which corner do you count from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 7]: `` That 's a secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 4]: `` Another secret ?
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 24]: Well , at least , if I am a prince , there can be no harm in telling me about a princess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 12]: `` It 's just the princes I ca n't tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 13]: `` There ai n't any more of them -- are there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 4]: said the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 17]: you do n't think you 're the only prince in the world , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 4]: not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 31]: But I know there 's one too many just at present , except the princess -- '' `` Yes , yes , that 's it , '' said the fairy .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 6]: `` What 's it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: asked the prince .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 26]: But he could get nothing more out of the fairy , and had to go to bed unanswered , which was something of a trial .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 44]: Now wicked fairies will not be bound by the law which the good fairies obey , and this always seems to give the bad the advantage over the good , for they use means to gain their ends which the others will not .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 32]: But it is all of no consequence , for what they do never succeeds ; nay , in the end it brings about the very thing they are trying to prevent .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 48]: So you see that somehow , for all their cleverness , wicked fairies are dreadfully stupid , for , although from the beginning of the world they have really helped instead of thwarting the good fairies , not one of them is a bit wiser for it .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 21]: She will try the bad thing just as they all did before her ; and succeeds no better of course .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 32]: The prince had so far stolen a march upon the swamp-fairy that she did not know he was in the neighbourhood until after he had seen the princess those three times .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 42]: When she knew it , she consoled herself by thinking that the princess must be far too proud and too modest for any young man to venture even to speak to her before he had seen her six times at least .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 34]: But there was even less danger than the wicked fairy thought ; for , however much the princess might desire to be set free , she was dreadfully afraid of the wrong prince .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 14]: Now , however , the fairy was going to do all she could .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 27]: She so contrived it by her deceitful spells , that the next night the prince could not by any endeavour find his way to the glade .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 11]: It would take me too long to tell her tricks .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 29]: They would be amusing to us , who know that they could not do any harm , but they were something other than amusing to the poor prince .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 14]: He wandered about the forest till daylight , and then fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 21]: The same thing occurred for seven following days , during which neither could he find the good fairy 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 45]: After the third quarter of the moon , however , the bad fairy thought she might be at ease about the affair for a fortnight at least , for there was no chance of the prince wishing to kiss the princess during that period .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 23]: So the first day of the fourth quarter he did find the cottage , and the next day he found the glade .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 8]: For nearly another week he haunted it .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 6]: But the princess never came .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 42]: I have little doubt she was on the farther edge of it some part of every night , but at this period she always wore black , and , there being little or no light , the prince never saw her .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 12]: Nor would he have known her if he had seen her .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 19]: How could he have taken the worn decrepit creature she was now , for the glorious Princess Daylight ?
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 19]: At last , one night when there was no moon at all , he ventured near the house .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 96]: There he heard voices talking , although it was past midnight ; for her women were in considerable uneasiness , because the one whose turn it was to watch her had fallen asleep , and had not seen which way she went , and this was a night when she would probably wander very far , describing a circle which did not touch the open glade at all , but stretched away from the back of the house , deep into that side of the forest -- a part of which the prince knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 39]: When he understood from what they said that she had disappeared , and that she must have gone somewhere in the said direction , he plunged at once into the wood to see if he could find her .
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 39]: For hours he roamed with nothing to guide him but the vague notion of a circle which on one side bordered on the house , for so much had he picked up from the talk he had overheard .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 38]: It was getting towards the dawn , but as yet there was no streak of light in the sky , when he came to a great birch-tree , and sat down weary at the foot of it .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 58]: While he sat -- very miserable , you may be sure -- full of fear for the princess , and wondering how her attendants could take it so quietly , he bethought himself that it would not be a bad plan to light a fire , which , if she were anywhere near , would attract her .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 15]: This he managed with a tinder-box , which the good fairy had given him .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 26]: It was just beginning to blaze up , when he heard a moan , which seemed to come from the other side of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 27]: He sprung to his feet , but his heart throbbed so that he had to lean for a moment against the tree before he could move .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 19]: When he got round , there lay a human form in a little dark heap on the earth .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 16]: There was light enough from his fire to show that it was not the princess .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 20]: He lifted it in his arms , hardly heavier than a child , and carried it to the flame .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 17]: The countenance was that of an old woman , but it had a fearfully strange look .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 13]: A black hood concealed her hair , and her eyes were closed .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 52]: He laid her down as comfortably as he could , chafed her hands , put a little cordial from a bottle , also the gift of the fairy , into her mouth ; took off his coat and wrapped it about her , and in short did the best he could .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 16]: In a little while she opened her eyes and looked at him -- so pitifully !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 18]: The tears rose and flowed from her grey wrinkled cheeks , but she said never a word .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 29]: She closed her eyes again , but the tears kept on flowing , and her whole appearance was so utterly pitiful that the prince was near crying too .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 28]: He begged her to tell him what was the matter , promising to do all he could to help her ; but still she did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 37]: He thought she was dying , and took her in his arms again to carry her to the princess 's house , where he thought the good-natured cook might be able to do something for her .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 26]: When he lifted her , the tears flowed yet faster , and she gave such a sad moan that it went to his very heart .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 6]: `` Mother , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 5]: `` Poor mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: and kissed her on the withered lips .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 13]: She started ; and what eyes they were that opened upon him !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 31]: But he did not see them , for it was still very dark , and he had enough to do to make his way through the trees towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 54]: Just as he approached the door , feeling more tired than he could have imagined possible -- she was such a little thin old thing -- she began to move , and became so restless that , unable to carry her a moment longer , he thought to lay her on the grass .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 8]: But she stood upright on her feet .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 12]: Her hood had dropped , and her hair fell about her .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 33]: The first gleam of the morning was caught on her face : that face was bright as the never-aging Dawn , and her eyes were lovely as the sky of darkest blue .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 7]: The prince recoiled in overmastering wonder .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 12]: It was Daylight herself whom he had brought from the forest !
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 20]: He fell at her feet , nor dared to look up until she laid her hand upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 4]: He rose then .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 13]: `` You kissed me when I was an old woman : there !
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 14]: I kiss you when I am a young princess , '' murmured Daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 9]: -- `` Is that the sun coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 17]: RUBY THE children were delighted with the story , and made many amusing remarks upon it .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 22]: Mr. Raymond promised to search his brain for another , and when he had found one to bring it to them .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 22]: Diamond having taken leave of Nanny , and promised to go and see her again soon , went away with him .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 21]: Now Mr. Raymond had been turning over in his mind what he could do both for Diamond and for Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 19]: He had therefore made some acquaintance with Diamond 's father , and had been greatly pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 32]: But he had come to the resolution , before he did anything so good as he would like to do for them , to put them all to a certain test .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 28]: So as they walked away together , he began to talk with Diamond as follows : -- `` Nanny must leave the hospital soon , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 10]: `` I 'm glad of that , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 11]: Do n't you think it 's a nice place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 5]: `` Yes , very .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 24]: But it 's better to be well and doing something , you know , even if it 's not quite so comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 14]: `` But they ca n't keep Nanny so long as they would like .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 11]: They ca n't keep her till she 's quite strong .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 16]: There are always so many sick children they want to take in and make better .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 17]: And the question is , What will she do when they send her out again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 23]: `` That 's just what I ca n't tell , though I 've been thinking of it over and over , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 30]: Her crossing was taken long ago , and I could n't bear to see Nanny fighting for it , especially with such a poor fellow as has taken it .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: He 's quite lame , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 17]: `` She does n't look much like fighting , now , does she , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 7]: She looks too like an angel .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 11]: Angels do n't fight -- do they , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 16]: `` Not to get things for themselves , at least , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 31]: `` Besides , '' added Diamond , `` I do n't quite see that she would have any better right to the crossing than the boy who has got it .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 11]: Nobody gave it to her ; she only took it .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 8]: And now he has taken it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 37]: `` If she were to sweep a crossing -- soon at least -- after the illness she has had , she would be laid up again the very first wet day , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 21]: `` And there 's hardly any money to be got except on the wet days , '' remarked Diamond reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 12]: `` Is there nothing else she could do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 11]: `` Not without being taught , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 11]: `` Well , could n't somebody teach her something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 10]: `` Could n't you teach her , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 10]: `` I do n't know anything myself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 26]: I could teach her to dress the baby ; but nobody would give her anything for doing things like that : they are so easy .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 24]: There would n't be much good in teaching her to drive a cab , for where would she get the cab to drive ?
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 9]: There ai n't fathers and old Diamonds everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 15]: At least poor Nanny ca n't find any of them , I doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 19]: `` Perhaps if she were taught to be nice and clean , and only speak gentle words . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 11]: `` Mother could teach her that , '' interrupted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 35]: `` And to dress babies , and feed them , and take care of them , '' Mr. Raymond proceeded , `` she might get a place as a nurse somewhere , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 8]: People do give money for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 11]: `` Then I 'll ask mother , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 29]: `` But you 'll have to give her her food then ; and your father , not being strong , has enough to do already without that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 18]: `` But here 's me , '' said Diamond : `` I help him out with it .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 11]: When he 's tired of driving , up I get .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 10]: It do n't make any difference to old Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 34]: I do n't mean he likes me as well as my father -- of course he ca n't , you know -- nobody could ; but he does his duty all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 26]: It 's got to be done , you know , sir ; and Diamond 's a good horse -- is n't he , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 21]: `` From your description I should say certainly ; but I have not the pleasure of his acquaintance myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 14]: `` Do n't you think he will go to heaven , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 14]: `` That I do n't know anything about , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 18]: `` I confess I should be glad to think so , '' he added , smiling thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 37]: `` I 'm sure he 'll get to the back of the north wind , anyhow , '' said Diamond to himself ; but he had learned to be very careful of saying such things aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 21]: `` Is n't it rather too much for him to go in the cab all day and every day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 4]: resumed Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 14]: `` So father says , when he feels his ribs of a morning .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 51]: But then he says the old horse do eat well , and the moment he 's had his supper , down he goes , and never gets up till he 's called ; and , for the legs of him , father says that makes no end of a differ .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 5]: Some horses , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 25]: they wo n't lie down all night long , but go to sleep on their four pins , like a haystack , father says .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 15]: I think it 's very stupid of them , and so does old Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 18]: But then I suppose they do n't know better , and so they ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 13]: We must n't be too hard upon them , father says . ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 12]: `` Your father must be a good man , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 15]: Diamond looked up in Mr. Raymond 's face , wondering what he could mean .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 14]: `` I said your father must be a good man , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 8]: `` Of course , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 13]: `` How could he drive a cab if he was n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 19]: `` There are some men who drive cabs who are not very good , '' objected Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 14]: Diamond remembered the drunken cabman , and saw that his friend was right .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 26]: `` Ah , but , '' he returned , `` he must be , you know , with such a horse as old Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 12]: `` That does make a difference , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 20]: `` But it is quite enough that he is a good man without our trying to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 20]: Now , if you like , I will give you a proof that I think him a good man .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 39]: I am going away on the Continent for a while -- for three months , I believe -- and I am going to let my house to a gentleman who does not want the use of my brougham .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 58]: My horse is nearly as old , I fancy , as your Diamond , but I do n't want to part with him , and I do n't want him to be idle ; for nobody , as you say , ought to be idle ; but neither do I want him to be worked very hard .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 26]: Now , it has come into my head that perhaps your father would take charge of him , and work him under certain conditions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 13]: `` My father will do what 's right , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 8]: `` I 'm sure of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 7]: `` Well , so I think .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 24]: Will you ask him when he comes home to call and have a little chat with me -- to-day , some time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 12]: `` He must have his dinner first , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 12]: `` No , he 's got his dinner with him to-day .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 11]: It must be after he 's had his tea . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 7]: `` Of course , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 5]: Any time will do .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 9]: I shall be at home all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 6]: `` Very well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 5]: I will tell him .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 8]: You may be sure he will come .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 27]: My father thinks you a very kind gentleman , and I know he is right , for I know your very own self , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 21]: Mr. Raymond smiled , and as they had now reached his door , they parted , and Diamond went home .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 26]: As soon as his father entered the house , Diamond gave him Mr. Raymond 's message , and recounted the conversation that had preceded it .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 39]: His father said little , but took thought-sauce to his bread and butter , and as soon as he had finished his meal , rose , saying : `` I will go to your friend directly , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 13]: It would be a grand thing to get a little more money .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 6]: We do want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 15]: Diamond accompanied his father to Mr. Raymond 's door , and there left him .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 37]: He was shown at once into Mr. Raymond 's study , where he gazed with some wonder at the multitude of books on the walls , and thought what a learned man Mr. Raymond must be .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 123]: Presently Mr. Raymond entered , and after saying much the same about his old horse , made the following distinct proposal -- one not over-advantageous to Diamond 's father , but for which he had reasons -- namely , that Joseph should have the use of Mr. Raymond 's horse while he was away , on condition that he never worked him more than six hours a day , and fed him well , and that , besides , he should take Nanny home as soon as she was able to leave the hospital , and provide for her as one of his own children , neither better nor worse -- so long , that is , as he had the horse .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 13]: Diamond 's father could not help thinking it a pretty close bargain .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 23]: He should have both the girl and the horse to feed , and only six hours ' work out of the horse .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 13]: `` It will save your own horse , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 47]: `` That is true , '' answered Joseph ; `` but all I can get by my own horse is only enough to keep us , and if I save him and feed your horse and the girl -- do n't you see , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 23]: `` Well , you can go home and think about it , and let me know by the end of the week .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 9]: I am in no hurry before then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 29]: So Joseph went home and recounted the proposal to his wife , adding that he did not think there was much advantage to be got out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 30]: `` Not much that way , husband , '' said Diamond 's mother ; `` but there would be an advantage , and what matter who gets it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 12]: `` I do n't see it , '' answered her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 26]: `` Mr. Raymond is a gentleman of property , and I do n't discover any much good in helping him to save a little more .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 22]: He wo n't easily get one to make such a bargain , and I do n't mean he shall get me .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 28]: It would be a loss rather than a gain -- I do think -- at least if I took less work out of our own horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 11]: `` One hour would make a difference to old Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 8]: But that 's not the main point .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 23]: You must think what an advantage it would be to the poor girl that has n't a home to go to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 14]: `` She is one of Diamond 's friends , '' thought his father .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 68]: `` I could be kind to her , you know , '' the mother went on , `` and teach her housework , and how to handle a baby ; and , besides , she would help me , and I should be the stronger for it , and able to do an odd bit of charing now and then , when I got the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 13]: `` I wo n't hear of that , '' said her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 8]: `` Have the girl by all means .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 16]: I 'm ashamed I did not think of both sides of the thing at once .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 10]: I wonder if the horse is a great eater .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 40]: To be sure , if I gave Diamond two hours ' additional rest , it would be all the better for the old bones of him , and there would be four hours extra out of the other horse .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 10]: That would give Diamond something to do every day .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 32]: He could drive old Diamond after dinner , and I could take the other horse out for six hours after tea , or in the morning , as I found best .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 21]: It might pay for the keep of both of them , -- that is , if I had good luck .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 26]: I should like to oblige Mr. Raymond , though he be rather hard , for he has been very kind to our Diamond , wife .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 6]: Has n't he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 18]: `` He has indeed , Joseph , '' said his wife , and there the conversation ended .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 39]: Diamond 's father went the very next day to Mr. Raymond , and accepted his proposal ; so that the week after having got another stall in the same stable , he had two horses instead of one .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 20]: Oddly enough , the name of the new horse was Ruby , for he was a very red chestnut .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 12]: Diamond 's name came from a white lozenge on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 19]: Young Diamond said they were rich now , with such a big diamond and such a big ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 27]: NANNY 'S DREAM NANNY was not fit to be moved for some time yet , and Diamond went to see her as often as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 49]: But being more regularly engaged now , seeing he went out every day for a few hours with old Diamond , and had his baby to mind , and one of the horses to attend to , he could not go so often as he would have liked .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 26]: One evening , as he sat by her bedside , she said to him : `` I 've had such a beautiful dream , Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 9]: I should like to tell it you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 15]: do , '' said Diamond ; `` I am so fond of dreams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 19]: `` She must have been to the back of the north wind , '' he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 11]: `` It was a very foolish dream , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 7]: But somehow it was so pleasant !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 20]: What a good thing it is that you believe the dream all the time you are in it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 24]: My readers must not suppose that poor Nanny was able to say what she meant so well as I put it down here .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 23]: She had never been to school , and had heard very little else than vulgar speech until she came to the hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 37]: But I have been to school , and although that could never make me able to dream so well as Nanny , it has made me able to tell her dream better than she could herself .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 39]: And I am the more desirous of doing this for her that I have already done the best I could for Diamond 's dream , and it would be a shame to give the boy all the advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 15]: `` I will tell you all I know about it , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 23]: `` The day before yesterday , a lady came to see us -- a very beautiful lady , and very beautifully dressed .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 34]: I heard the matron say to her that it was very kind of her to come in blue and gold ; and she answered that she knew we did n't like dull colours .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 26]: She had such a lovely shawl on , just like redness dipped in milk , and all worked over with flowers of the same colour .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 17]: It did n't shine much , it was silk , but it kept in the shine .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 27]: When she came to my bedside , she sat down , just where you are sitting , Diamond , and laid her hand on the counterpane .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 15]: I was sitting up , with my table before me ready for my tea .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 18]: Her hand looked so pretty in its blue glove , that I was tempted to stroke it .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 18]: I thought she would n't be angry , for everybody that comes to the hospital is kind .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 11]: It 's only in the streets they ai n't kind .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 20]: But she drew her hand away , and I almost cried , for I thought I had been rude .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 37]: Instead of that , however , it was only that she did n't like giving me her glove to stroke , for she drew it off , and then laid her hand where it was before .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 16]: I was n't sure , but I ventured to put out my ugly hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 36]: `` Your hand ai n't ugly , Nanny , '' said Diamond ; but Nanny went on -- `` And I stroked it again , and then she stroked mine , -- think of that !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 20]: And there was a ring on her finger , and I looked down to see what it was like .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 15]: And she drew it off , and put it upon one of my fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 17]: It was a red stone , and she told me they called it a ruby . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 8]: `` Oh , that is funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 8]: `` Our new horse is called Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 15]: We 've got another horse -- a red one -- such a beauty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 8]: But Nanny went on with her story .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 22]: `` I looked at the ruby all the time the lady was talking to me , -- it was so beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 14]: And as she talked I kept seeing deeper and deeper into the stone .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 27]: At last she rose to go away , and I began to pull the ring off my finger ; and what do you think she said ?
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 11]: -- ` Wear it all night , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 8]: Only you must take care of it .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 24]: I ca n't give it you , for some one gave it to me ; but you may keep it till to-morrow . '
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 7]: Was n't it kind of her ?
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 56]: I could hardly take my tea , I was so delighted to hear it ; and I do think it was the ring that set me dreaming ; for , after I had taken my tea , I leaned back , half lying and half sitting , and looked at the ring on my finger .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 7]: By degrees I began to dream .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 43]: The ring grew larger and larger , until at last I found that I was not looking at a red stone , but at a red sunset , which shone in at the end of a long street near where Grannie lives .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 31]: I was dressed in rags as I used to be , and I had great holes in my shoes , at which the nasty mud came through to my feet .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 16]: I did n't use to mind it before , but now I thought it horrid .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 21]: And there was the great red sunset , with streaks of green and gold between , standing looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 14]: Why could n't I live in the sunset instead of in that dirt ?
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 8]: Why was it so far away always ?
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 10]: Why did it never come into our wretched street ?
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 17]: It faded away , as the sunsets always do , and at last went out altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 27]: Then a cold wind began to blow , and flutter all my rags about -- '' `` That was North Wind herself , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 4]: `` Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 10]: said Nanny , and went on with her story .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 12]: `` I turned my back to it , and wandered away .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 18]: I did not know where I was going , only it was warmer to go that way .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 21]: I do n't think it was a north wind , for I found myself in the west end at last .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 14]: But it does n't matter in a dream which wind it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 11]: `` I do n't know that , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 18]: `` I believe North Wind can get into our dreams -- yes , and blow in them .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 12]: Sometimes she has blown me out of a dream altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 15]: `` I do n't know what you mean , Diamond , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 10]: `` Two people ca n't always understand each other .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 25]: They 'd both be at the back of the north wind directly , and what would become of the other places without them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 8]: `` You do talk so oddly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 3]: said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 13]: `` I sometimes think they must have been right about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 9]: `` What did they say about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 3]: asked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 9]: `` They called you God 's baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 6]: `` How kind of them !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 6]: But I knew that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 10]: `` Did you know what it meant , though ?
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 12]: It meant that you were not right in the head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 33]: `` I feel all right , '' said Diamond , putting both hands to his head , as if it had been a globe he could take off and set on again .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 17]: `` Well , as long as you are pleased I am pleased , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 6]: `` Thank you , Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 7]: Do go on with your story .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 11]: I think I like dreams even better than fairy tales .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 14]: But they must be nice ones , like yours , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 28]: `` Well , I went on , keeping my back to the wind , until I came to a fine street on the top of a hill .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 52]: How it happened I do n't know , but the front door of one of the houses was open , and not only the front door , but the back door as well , so that I could see right through the house -- and what do you think I saw ?
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 14]: A garden place with green grass , and the moon shining upon it !
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 4]: Think of that !
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 17]: There was no moon in the street , but through the house there was the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 26]: I looked and there was nobody near : I would not do any harm , and the grass was so much nicer than the mud !
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 62]: But I could n't think of going on the grass with such dirty shoes : I kicked them off in the gutter , and ran in on my bare feet , up the steps , and through the house , and on to the grass ; and the moment I came into the moonlight , I began to feel better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 14]: `` That 's why North Wind blew you there , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 16]: `` It came of Mr. Raymond 's story about Princess Daylight , '' returned Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 22]: `` Well , I lay down upon the grass in the moonlight without thinking how I was to get out again .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 7]: Somehow the moon suited me exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 19]: There was not a breath of the north wind you talk about ; it was quite gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 12]: `` You did n't want her any more , just then .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 13]: She never goes where she 's not wanted , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 12]: `` But she blew you into the moonlight , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 26]: `` Well , we wo n't dispute about it , '' said Nanny : `` you 've got a tile loose , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 29]: `` Suppose I have , '' returned Diamond , `` do n't you see it may let in the moonlight , or the sunlight for that matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 11]: `` Perhaps yes , perhaps no , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 13]: `` And you 've got your dreams , too , Nanny . ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 11]: `` Yes , but I know they 're dreams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 5]: `` So do I .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: But I know besides they are something more as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 4]: do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 3]: rejoined Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 6]: `` I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 8]: `` Perhaps you will some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I wo n't , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 11]: Diamond held his peace , and Nanny resumed her story .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 35]: `` I lay a long time , and the moonlight got in at every tear in my clothes , and made me feel so happy -- '' `` There , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 8]: `` What do you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 3]: returned Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 26]: `` North Wind -- '' `` It was the moonlight , I tell you , '' persisted Nanny , and again Diamond held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 15]: `` All at once I felt that the moon was not shining so strong .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 22]: I looked up , and there was a cloud , all crapey and fluffy , trying to drown the beautiful creature .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 22]: But the moon was so round , just like a whole plate , that the cloud could n't stick to her .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 17]: She shook it off , and said there and shone out clearer and brighter than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 46]: But up came a thicker cloud , -- and ` You sha n't , ' said the moon ; and ' I will , ' said the cloud , -- but it could n't : out shone the moon , quite laughing at its impudence .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 15]: I knew her ways , for I 've always been used to watch her .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 15]: She 's the only thing worth looking at in our street at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 12]: `` Do n't call it your street , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 9]: `` You 're not going back to it .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 10]: You 're coming to us , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 13]: `` That 's too good to be true , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 23]: `` There are very few things good enough to be true , '' said Diamond ; `` but I hope this is .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 10]: Too good to be true it ca n't be .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 5]: Is n't true good ?
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 6]: and is n't good good ?
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 14]: And how , then , can anything be too good to be true ?
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 11]: That 's like old Sal -- to say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 8]: `` Do n't abuse Grannie , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 35]: She 's a horrid old thing , she and her gin bottle ; but she 'll repent some day , and then you 'll be glad not to have said anything against her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 10]: `` Because you 'll be sorry for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 9]: `` I am sorry for her now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 4]: That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 6]: She 'll be sorry too .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 10]: And there 'll be an end of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 9]: You come to us , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 6]: `` Where was I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 3]: said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 11]: `` Telling me how the moon served the clouds . ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 10]: But it would n't do , all of it .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 22]: Up came the clouds and the clouds , and they came faster and faster , until the moon was covered up .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 19]: You could n't expect her to throw off a hundred of them at once -- could you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 8]: `` Certainly not , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 17]: `` So it grew very dark ; and a dog began to yelp in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 13]: I looked and saw that the door to the garden was shut .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 22]: Presently it was opened -- not to let me out , but to let the dog in -- yelping and bounding .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 22]: I thought if he caught sight of me , I was in for a biting first , and the police after .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 18]: So I jumped up , and ran for a little summer-house in the corner of the garden .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 15]: The dog came after me , but I shut the door in his face .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 13]: It was well it had a door -- was n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 15]: `` You dreamed of the door because you wanted it , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 12]: `` No , I did n't ; it came of itself .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 10]: It was there , in the true dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 9]: `` There -- I 've caught you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 15]: `` I knew you believed in the dream as much as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 15]: `` Oh , well , if you will lay traps for a body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 3]: said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 10]: `` Anyhow , I was safe inside the summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 6]: And what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 29]: -- There was the moon beginning to shine again -- but only through one of the panes -- and that one was just the colour of the ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 6]: Was n't it funny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 12]: `` No , not a bit funny , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 8]: `` If you will be contrary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 3]: said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 28]: `` No , no , '' said Diamond ; `` I only meant that was the very pane I should have expected her to shine through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 7]: `` Oh , very well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 3]: returned Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 11]: What Diamond meant , I do not pretend to say .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 7]: He had curious notions about things .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 33]: `` And now , '' said Nanny , `` I did n't know what to do , for the dog kept barking at the door , and I could n't get out .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 20]: But the moon was so beautiful that I could n't keep from looking at it through the red pane .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 54]: And as I looked it got larger and larger till it filled the whole pane and outgrew it , so that I could see it through the other panes ; and it grew till it filled them too and the whole window , so that the summer-house was nearly as bright as day .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 27]: `` The dog stopped barking , and I heard a gentle tapping at the door , like the wind blowing a little branch against it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 22]: `` Just like her , '' said Diamond , who thought everything strange and beautiful must be done by North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 21]: `` So I turned from the window and opened the door ; and what do you think I saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 9]: `` A beautiful lady , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 26]: `` No -- the moon itself , as big as a little house , and as round as a ball , shining like yellow silver .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 75]: It stood on the grass -- down on the very grass : I could see nothing else for the brightness of it : And as I stared and wondered , a door opened in the side of it , near the ground , and a curious little old man , with a crooked thing over his shoulder , looked out , and said : ` Come along , Nanny ; my lady wants you .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 8]: We 're come to fetch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 7]: I was n't a bit frightened .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 44]: I went up to the beautiful bright thing , and the old man held down his hand , and I took hold of it , and gave a jump , and he gave me a lift , and I was inside the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 9]: And what do you think it was like ?
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 15]: It was such a pretty little house , with blue windows and white curtains !
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 21]: At one of the windows sat a beautiful lady , with her head leaning on her hand , looking out .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 19]: She seemed rather sad , and I was sorry for her , and stood staring at her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 15]: ` You did n't think I had such a beautiful mistress as that ! '
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 6]: said the queer little man .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 6]: ` No , indeed ! '
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 11]: I answered : ` who would have thought it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 3]: ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 3]: who indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 10]: But you see you do n't know everything . '
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 25]: The little man closed the door , and began to pull at a rope which hung behind it with a weight at the end .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 24]: After he had pulled a while , he said -- ` There , that will do ; we 're all right now . '
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 35]: Then he took me by the hand and opened a little trap in the floor , and led me down two or three steps , and I saw like a great hole below me .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 12]: ` Do n't be frightened , ' said the tittle man .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 7]: ` It 's not a hole .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 6]: It 's only a window .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 9]: Put your face down and look through . '
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 27]: I did as he told me , and there was the garden and the summer-house , far away , lying at the bottom of the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 4]: ` There ! '
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 12]: said the little man ; ` we 've brought you off !
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 16]: Do you see the little dog barking at us down there in the garden ? '
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 11]: I told him I could n't see anything so far .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 13]: ` Can you see anything so small and so far off ? '
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 7]: ` Bless you , child ! '
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 25]: said the little man ; ` I could pick up a needle out of the grass if I had only a long enough arm .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 13]: There 's one lying by the door of the summer-house now . '
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 6]: I looked at his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 22]: They were very small , but so bright that I think he saw by the light that went out of them .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 64]: Then he took me up , and up again by a little stair in a corner of the room , and through another trapdoor , and there was one great round window above us , and I saw the blue sky and the clouds , and such lots of stars , all so big and shining as hard as ever they could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 13]: `` The little girl-angels had been polishing them , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 8]: `` What nonsense you do talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 3]: said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 13]: `` But my nonsense is just as good as yours , Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 12]: When you have done , I 'll tell you my dream .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 12]: The stars are in it -- not the moon , though .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 5]: She was away somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 9]: Perhaps she was gone to fetch you then .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 17]: I do n't think that , though , for my dream was longer ago than yours .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 30]: She might have been to fetch some one else , though ; for we ca n't fancy it 's only us that get such fine things done for them .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 9]: But do tell me what came next . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 26]: Perhaps one of my child-readers may remember whether the moon came down to fetch him or her the same night that Diamond had his dream .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 8]: I can not tell , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 33]: I know she did not come to fetch me , though I did think I could make her follow me when I was a boy -- not a very tiny one either .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 20]: `` The little man took me all round the house , and made me look out of every window .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 6]: Oh , it was beautiful !
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 19]: There we were , all up in the air , in such a nice , clean little house !
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 17]: ` Your work will be to keep the windows bright , ' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 18]: ` You wo n't find it very difficult , for there ai n't much dust up here .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 20]: Only , the frost settles on them sometimes , and the drops of rain leave marks on them . '
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 30]: ` I can easily clean them inside , ' I said ; ` but how am I to get the frost and rain off the outside of them ? '
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 4]: ` Oh ! '
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 9]: he said , ` it 's quite easy .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 6]: There are ladders all about .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 15]: You 've only got to go out at the door , and climb about .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 26]: There are a great many windows you have n't seen yet , and some of them look into places you do n't know anything about .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 17]: I used to clean them myself , but I 'm getting rather old , you see .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 6]: Ai n't I now ? '
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 10]: ` I ca n't tell , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 13]: ` You see I never saw you when you were younger . '
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 10]: ` Never saw the man in the moon ? '
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 21]: ` Not very near , ' I answered , ` not to tell how young or how old he looked .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 12]: I have seen the bundle of sticks on his back . '
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 9]: For Jim had pointed that out to me .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 13]: Jim was very fond of looking at the man in the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 3]: Poor Jim !
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 10]: I wonder he has n't been to see me .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 9]: I 'm afraid he 's ill too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 19]: `` I 'll try to find out , '' said Diamond , `` and let you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 8]: `` Thank you , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 10]: `` You and Jim ought to be friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 29]: `` But what did the man in the moon say , when you told him you had seen him with the bundle of sticks on his back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 4]: `` He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 8]: But I thought he looked offended too .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 26]: His little nose turned up sharper , and he drew the corners of his mouth down from the tips of his ears into his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 11]: But he did n't look cross , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 8]: `` Did n't he say anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 9]: He said : ` That 's all nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 9]: What you saw was my bundle of dusters .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 8]: I was going to clean the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 9]: It takes a good many , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 13]: Really , what they do say of their superiors down there ! '
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 17]: ` It 's only because they do n't know better , ' I ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 13]: ` Of course , of course , ' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 7]: ` Nobody ever does know better .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 17]: Well , I forgive them , and that sets it all right , I hope . '
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 12]: ` It 's very good of you , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 4]: ` No ! '
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 14]: said he , ` it 's not in the least good of me .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 8]: I could n't be comfortable otherwise . '
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 31]: After this he said nothing for a while , and I laid myself on the floor of his garret , and stared up and around at the great blue beautifulness .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 20]: I had forgotten him almost , when at last he said : ` Ai n't you done yet ? '
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 5]: ` Done what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 11]: ` Done saying your prayers , ' says he . '
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 11]: I was n't saying my prayers , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 20]: ` Oh , yes , you were , ' said he , ` though you did n't know it !
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 10]: And now I must show you something else . '
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 29]: `` He took my hand and led me down the stair again , and through a narrow passage , and through another , and another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 19]: I do n't know how there could be room for so many passages in such a little house .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 20]: The heart of it must be ever so much farther from the sides than they are from each other .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 14]: How could it have an inside that was so independent of its outside ?
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 5]: There 's the point .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 11]: It was funny -- was n't it , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 34]: He was going to say that that was very much the sort of thing at the back of the north wind ; but he checked himself and only added , `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 6]: I do n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 13]: I do n't see why the inside should depend on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 8]: It ai n't so with the crabs .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 11]: They creep out of their outsides and make new ones .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 7]: Mr. Raymond told me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 18]: `` I do n't see what that has got to do with it , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 14]: `` Then go on with your story , please , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 22]: `` What did you come to , after going through all those winding passages into the heart of the moon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 10]: `` I did n't say they were winding passages .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 8]: I said they were long and narrow .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 5]: They did n't wind .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 6]: They went by corners . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 10]: `` That 's worth knowing , '' remarked Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 13]: `` For who knows how soon he may have to go there ?
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 15]: But the main thing is , what did you come to at last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 15]: `` We came to a small box against the wall of a tiny room .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 12]: The little man told me to put my ear against it .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 25]: I did so , and heard a noise something like the purring of a cat , only not so loud , and much sweeter .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 6]: ` What is it ? '
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 9]: ` Do n't you know the sound ? '
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 5]: returned the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 7]: ` No , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 11]: ` Do n't you know the sound of bees ? '
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 15]: I had never heard bees , and could not know the sound of them .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 13]: ` Those are my lady 's bees , ' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 11]: I had heard that bees gather honey from the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 10]: ` But where are the flowers for them ? '
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 21]: ` My lady 's bees gather their honey from the sun and the stars , ' said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 11]: ` Do let me see them , ' I said .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 3]: ` No .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 10]: I dare n't do that , ' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 8]: ` I have no business with them .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 6]: I do n't understand them .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 23]: Besides , they are so bright that if one were to fly into your eye , it would blind you altogether . '
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 8]: ` Then you have seen them ? '
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 5]: ` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 7]: Once or twice , I think .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 18]: But I do n't quite know : they are so very bright -- like buttons of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 20]: Now I 've showed you all I can to-night , and we 'll go back to the room . '
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 27]: I followed him , and he made me sit down under a lamp that hung from the roof , and gave me some bread and honey .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 7]: `` The lady had never moved .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 26]: She sat with her forehead leaning on her hand , gazing out of the little window , hung like the rest with white cloudy curtains .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 18]: From where I was sitting I looked out of it too , but I could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 28]: Her face was very beautiful , and very white , and very still , and her hand was as white as the forehead that leaned on it .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 32]: I did not see her whole face -- only the side of it , for she never moved to turn it full upon me , or even to look at me .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 19]: `` How long I sat after I had eaten my bread and honey , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 30]: The little man was busy about the room , pulling a string here , and a string there , but chiefly the string at the back of the door .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 29]: I was thinking with some uneasiness that he would soon be wanting me to go out and clean the windows , and I did n't fancy the job .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 14]: At last he came up to me with a great armful of dusters .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 38]: ` It 's time you set about the windows , ' he said ; ` for there 's rain coming , and if they 're quite clean before , then the rain ca n't spoil them . '
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 6]: I got up at once .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 11]: ` You need n't be afraid , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 7]: ` You wo n't tumble off .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 6]: Only you must be careful .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 14]: Always hold on with one hand while you rub with the other . '
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 9]: As he spoke , he opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 31]: I started back in a terrible fright , for there was nothing but blue air to be seen under me , like a great water without a bottom at all .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 38]: But what must be must , and to live up here was so much nicer than down in the mud with holes in my shoes , that I never thought of not doing as I was told .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 31]: The little man showed me how and where to lay hold while I put my foot round the edge of the door on to the first round of a ladder .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 23]: ` Once you 're up , ' he said , ` you 'll see how you have to go well enough . '
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 13]: I did as he told me , and crept out very carefully .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 34]: Then the little man handed me the bundle of dusters , saying , ` I always carry them on my reaping hook , but I do n't think you could manage it properly .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 9]: You shall have it if you like . '
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 13]: I would n't take it , however , for it looked dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 21]: `` I did the best I could with the dusters , and crawled up to the top of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 8]: But what a grand sight it was !
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 23]: The stars were all over my head , so bright and so near that I could almost have laid hold of them .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 24]: The round ball to which I clung went bobbing and floating away through the dark blue above and below and on every side .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 17]: It was so beautiful that all fear left me , and I set to work diligently .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 6]: I cleaned window after window .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 16]: At length I came to a very little one , in at which I peeped .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 12]: There was the room with the box of bees in it !
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 16]: I laid my ear to the window , and heard the musical hum quite distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 19]: A great longing to see them came upon me , and I opened the window and crept in .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 10]: The little box had a door like a closet .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 48]: I opened it -- the tiniest crack -- when out came the light with such a sting that I closed it again in terror -- not , however , before three bees had shot out into the room , where they darted about like flashes of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 44]: Terribly frightened , I tried to get out of the window again , but I could not : there was no way to the outside of the moon but through the door ; and that was in the room where the lady sat .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 31]: No sooner had I reached the room , than the three bees , which had followed me , flew at once to the lady , and settled upon her hair .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 7]: Then first I saw her move .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 34]: She started , put up her hand , and caught them ; then rose and , having held them into the flame of the lamp one after the other , turned to me .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 10]: Her face was not so sad now as stern .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 5]: It frightened me much .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 14]: ` Nanny , you have got me into trouble , ' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 19]: ` You have been letting out my bees , which it is all I can do to manage .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 8]: You have forced me to burn them .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 14]: It is a great loss , and there will be a storm . '
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 12]: As she spoke , the clouds had gathered all about us .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 12]: I could see them come crowding up white about the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 21]: ` I am sorry to find , ' said the lady , ` that you are not to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 14]: You must go home again -- you wo n't do for us . '
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 15]: Then came a great clap of thunder , and the moon rocked and swayed .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 16]: All grew dark about me , and I fell on the floor and lay half-stunned .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 9]: I could hear everything but could see nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 14]: ` Shall I throw her out of the door , my lady ? '
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 5]: said the little man .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 17]: ` No , ' she answered ; ` she 's not quite bad enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 19]: I do n't think there 's much harm in her ; only she 'll never do for us .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 8]: She would make dreadful mischief up here .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 8]: She 's only fit for the mud .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 6]: It 's a great pity .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 6]: I am sorry for her .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 8]: Just take that ring off her finger .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 10]: I am sadly afraid she has stolen it . '
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 18]: The little man caught hold of my hand , and I felt him tugging at the ring .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 22]: I tried to speak what was true about it , but , after a terrible effort , only gave a groan .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 9]: Other things began to come into my head .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 8]: Somebody else had a hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: The little man was n't there .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 12]: I opened my eyes at last , and saw the nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 16]: I had cried out in my sleep , and she had come and waked me .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 31]: But , Diamond , for all it was only a dream , I can not help being ashamed of myself yet for opening the lady 's box of bees . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 20]: `` You would n't do it again -- would you -- if she were to take you back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 13]: I do n't think anything would ever make me do it again .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 6]: But where 's the good ?
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 8]: I shall never have the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 11]: `` I do n't know that , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 5]: `` You silly baby !
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 10]: It was only a dream , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 9]: `` I know that , Nanny , dear .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 13]: But how can you tell you may n't dream it again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 9]: `` That 's not a bit likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 11]: `` I do n't know that , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 11]: `` You 're always saying that , '' said Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 8]: `` I do n't like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 16]: `` Then I wo n't say it again -- if I do n't forget . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 9]: `` But it was such a beautiful dream !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 7]: -- was n't it , Nanny ?
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 13]: What a pity you opened that door and let the bees out !
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 17]: You might have had such a long dream , and such nice talks with the moon-lady .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 8]: Do try to go again , Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 9]: I do so want to hear more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 39]: But now the nurse came and told him it was time to go ; and Diamond went , saying to himself , `` I ca n't help thinking that North Wind had something to do with that dream .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 17]: It would be tiresome to lie there all day and all night too -- without dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 26]: Perhaps if she had n't done that , the moon might have carried her to the back of the north wind -- who knows ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 30]: THE NORTH WIND DOTH BLOW IT WAS a great delight to Diamond when at length Nanny was well enough to leave the hospital and go home to their house .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 34]: She was not very strong yet , but Diamond 's mother was very considerate of her , and took care that she should have nothing to do she was not quite fit for .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 66]: If Nanny had been taken straight from the street , it is very probable she would not have been so pleasant in a decent household , or so easy to teach ; but after the refining influences of her illness and the kind treatment she had had in the hospital , she moved about the house just like some rather sad pleasure haunting the mind .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 42]: As she got better , and the colour came back to her cheeks , her step grew lighter and quicker , her smile shone out more readily , and it became certain that she would soon be a treasure of help .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 30]: It was great fun to see Diamond teaching her how to hold the baby , and wash and dress him , and often they laughed together over her awkwardness .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 22]: But she had not many such lessons before she was able to perform those duties quite as well as Diamond himself .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 15]: Things however did not go well with Joseph from the very arrival of Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 15]: It almost seemed as if the red beast had brought ill luck with him .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 10]: The fares were fewer , and the pay less .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 30]: Ruby 's services did indeed make the week 's income at first a little beyond what it used to be , but then there were two more to feed .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 23]: After the first month he fell lame , and for the whole of the next Joseph dared not attempt to work him .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 33]: I can not say that he never grumbled , for his own health was far from what it had been ; but I can say that he tried to do his best .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 63]: During all that month , they lived on very short commons indeed , seldom tasting meat except on Sundays , and poor old Diamond , who worked hardest of all , not even then -- so that at the end of it he was as thin as a clothes-horse , while Ruby was as plump and sleek as a bishop 's cob .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 34]: Nor was it much better after Ruby was able to work again , for it was a season of great depression in business , and that is very soon felt amongst the cabmen .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 18]: City men look more after their shillings , and their wives and daughters have less to spend .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 14]: It was besides a wet autumn , and bread rose greatly in price .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 37]: When I add to this that Diamond 's mother was but poorly , for a new baby was coming , you will see that these were not very jolly times for our friends in the mews .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 54]: Notwithstanding the depressing influences around him , Joseph was able to keep a little hope alive in his heart ; and when he came home at night , would get Diamond to read to him , and would also make Nanny produce her book that he might see how she was getting on .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 29]: For Diamond had taken her education in hand , and as she was a clever child , she was very soon able to put letters and words together .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 14]: Thus the three months passed away , but Mr. Raymond did not return .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 40]: Joseph had been looking anxiously for him , chiefly with the desire of getting rid of Ruby -- not that he was absolutely of no use to him , but that he was a constant weight upon his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 62]: Indeed , as far as provision went , he was rather worse off with Ruby and Nanny than he had been before , but on the other hand , Nanny was a great help in the house , and it was a comfort to him to think that when the new baby did come , Nanny would be with his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 40]: Of God 's gifts a baby is of the greatest ; therefore it is no wonder that when this one came , she was as heartily welcomed by the little household as if she had brought plenty with her .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 59]: Of course she made a great difference in the work to be done -- far more difference than her size warranted , but Nanny was no end of help , and Diamond was as much of a sunbeam as ever , and began to sing to the new baby the first moment he got her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 58]: But he did not sing the same songs to her that he had sung to his brother , for , he said , she was a new baby and must have new songs ; and besides , she was a sister-baby and not a brother-baby , and of course would not like the same kind of songs .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 21]: Where the difference in his songs lay , however , I do not pretend to be able to point out .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 37]: One thing I am sure of , that they not only had no small share in the education of the little girl , but helped the whole family a great deal more than they were aware .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 17]: How they managed to get through the long dreary expensive winter , I can hardly say .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 8]: Sometimes things were better , sometimes worse .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 20]: But at last the spring came , and the winter was over and gone , and that was much .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 47]: Still , Mr. Raymond did not return , and although the mother would have been able to manage without Nanny now , they could not look for a place for her so long as they had Ruby ; and they were not altogether sorry for this .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 12]: One week at last was worse than they had yet had .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 10]: They were almost without bread before it was over .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 23]: But the sadder he saw his father and mother looking , the more Diamond set himself to sing to the two babies .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 21]: One thing which had increased their expenses was that they had been forced to hire another little room for Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 49]: When the second baby came , Diamond gave up his room that Nanny might be at hand to help his mother , and went to hers , which , although a fine place to what she had been accustomed to , was not very nice in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 19]: He did not mind the change though , for was not his mother the more comfortable for it ?
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 8]: And was not Nanny more comfortable too ?
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 15]: And indeed was not Diamond himself more comfortable that other people were more comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 16]: And if there was more comfort every way , the change was a happy one .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 27]: DIAMOND AND RUBY IT WAS Friday night , and Diamond , like the rest of the household , had had very little to eat that day .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 18]: The mother would always pay the week 's rent before she laid out anything even on food .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 19]: His father had been very gloomy -- so gloomy that he had actually been cross to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 29]: It is a strange thing how pain of seeing the suffering of those we love will sometimes make us add to their suffering by being cross with them .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 36]: This comes of not having faith enough in God , and shows how necessary this faith is , for when we lose it , we lose even the kindness which alone can soothe the suffering .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 17]: Diamond in consequence had gone to bed very quiet and thoughtful -- a little troubled indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 23]: It had been a very stormy winter , and even now that the spring had come , the north wind often blew .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 36]: When Diamond went to his bed , which was in a tiny room in the roof , he heard it like the sea moaning ; and when he fell asleep he still heard the moaning .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 19]: All at once he said to himself , `` Am I awake , or am I asleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 18]: But he had no time to answer the question , for there was North Wind calling him .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 19]: His heart beat very fast , it was such a long time since he had heard that voice .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 16]: He jumped out of bed , and looked everywhere , but could not see her .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 23]: `` Diamond , come here , '' she said again and again ; but where the here was he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 19]: To be sure the room was all but quite dark , and she might be close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 27]: `` Dear North Wind , '' said Diamond , `` I want so much to go to you , but I ca n't tell where . ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 12]: `` Come here , Diamond , '' was all her answer .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 21]: Diamond opened the door , and went out of the room , and down the stair and into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 21]: His little heart was in a flutter , for he had long given up all thought of seeing her again .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 8]: Neither now was he to see her .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 30]: When he got out , a great puff of wind came against him , and in obedience to it he turned his back , and went as it blew .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 14]: It blew him right up to the stable-door , and went on blowing .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 24]: `` She wants me to go into the stable , '' said Diamond to himself , `` but the door is locked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 24]: He knew where the key was , in a certain hole in the wall -- far too high for him to get at .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 32]: He ran to the place , however : just as he reached it there came a wild blast , and down fell the key clanging on the stones at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 17]: He picked it up , and ran back and opened the stable-door , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 8]: And what do you think he saw ?
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 36]: A little light came through the dusty window from a gas-lamp , sufficient to show him Diamond and Ruby with their two heads up , looking at each other across the partition of their stalls .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 32]: The light showed the white mark on Diamond 's forehead , but Ruby 's eye shone so bright , that he thought more light came out of it than went in .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 6]: This is what he saw .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 8]: But what do you think he heard ?
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 35]: He heard the two horses talking to each other -- in a strange language , which yet , somehow or other , he could understand , and turn over in his mind in English .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 18]: The first words he heard were from Diamond , who apparently had been already quarrelling with Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 9]: `` Look how fat you are Ruby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 4]: said old Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 20]: `` You are so plump and your skin shines so , you ought to be ashamed of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 17]: `` There 's no harm in being fat , '' said Ruby in a deprecating tone .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 8]: `` No , nor in being sleek .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 9]: I may as well shine as not . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 5]: `` No harm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 3]: retorted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 61]: `` Is it no harm to go eating up all poor master 's oats , and taking up so much of his time grooming you , when you only work six hours -- no , not six hours a day , and , as I hear , get along no faster than a big dray-horse with two tons behind him ?
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 7]: -- So they tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 11]: `` Your master 's not mine , '' said Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 37]: `` I must attend to my own master 's interests , and eat all that is given me , and be sleek and fat as I can , and go no faster than I need . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 39]: `` Now really if the rest of the horses were n't all asleep , poor things -- they work till they 're tired -- I do believe they would get up and kick you out of the stable .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 9]: You make me ashamed of being a horse .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 11]: You dare to say my master ai n't your master !
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 14]: That 's your gratitude for the way he feeds you and spares you !
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 14]: Pray where would your carcass be if it were n't for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 10]: `` He does n't do it for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 19]: If I were his own horse , he would work me as hard as he does you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 10]: `` And I 'm proud to be so worked .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 16]: I would n't be as fat as you -- not for all you 're worth .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 8]: You 're a disgrace to the stable .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 7]: Look at the horse next you .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 12]: He 's something like a horse -- all skin and bone .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 11]: And his master ai n't over kind to him either .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 11]: He put a stinging lash on his whip last week .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 29]: But that old horse knows he 's got the wife and children to keep -- as well as his drunken master -- and he works like a horse .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 22]: I daresay he grudges his master the beer he drinks , but I do n't believe he grudges anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 18]: `` Well , I do n't grudge yours what he gets by me , '' said Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 4]: `` Gets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 3]: retorted Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 9]: `` What he gets is n't worth grudging .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 14]: It comes to next to nothing -- what with your fat and shine .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 17]: `` Well , at least you ought to be thankful you 're the better for it .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 14]: You get a two hours ' rest a day out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 15]: `` I thank my master for that -- not you , you lazy fellow !
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 15]: You go along like a buttock of beef upon castors -- you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 19]: `` Ai n't you afraid I 'll kick , if you go on like that , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 3]: `` Kick !
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 8]: You could n't kick if you tried .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 17]: You might heave your rump up half a foot , but for lashing out -- oho !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 21]: If you did , you 'd be down on your belly before you could get your legs under you again .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 15]: It 's my belief , once out , they 'd stick out for ever .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 4]: Talk of kicking !
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 20]: Why do n't you put one foot before the other now and then when you 're in the cab ?
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 11]: The abuse master gets for your sake is quite shameful .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 9]: No decent horse would bring it on him .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 18]: Depend upon it , Ruby , no cabman likes to be abused any more than his fare .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 20]: But his fares , at least when you are between the shafts , are very much to be excused .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 5]: Indeed they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 18]: `` Well , you see , Diamond , I do n't want to go lame again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 16]: `` I do n't believe you were so very lame after all -- there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 8]: `` Oh , but I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 11]: `` Then I believe it was all your own fault .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 5]: I 'm not lame .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 9]: I never was lame in all my life .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 9]: You do n't take care of your legs .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 8]: You never lay them down at night .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 16]: There you are with your huge carcass crushing down your poor legs all night long .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 24]: You do n't even care for your own legs -- so long as you can eat , eat , and sleep , sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 6]: You a horse indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 10]: `` But I tell you I was lame . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 14]: `` I 'm not denying there was a puffy look about your off-pastern .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 16]: But my belief is , it was n't even grease -- it was fat . ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 30]: `` I tell you I put my foot on one of those horrid stones they make the roads with , and it gave my ankle such a twist . ''
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 4]: `` Ankle indeed !
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 7]: Why should you ape your betters ?
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 12]: Horses ai n't got any ankles : they 're only pasterns .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 39]: And so long as you do n't lift your feet better , but fall asleep between every step , you 'll run a good chance of laming all your ankles as you call them , one after another .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 14]: It 's not your lively horse that comes to grief in that way .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 21]: I tell you I believe it was n't much , and if it was , it was your own fault .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 4]: I 've done .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 6]: I 'm going to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 13]: I 'll try to think as well of you as I can .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 18]: If you would but step out a bit and run off a little of your fat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 27]: Here Diamond began to double up his knees ; but Ruby spoke again , and , as young Diamond thought , in a rather different tone .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 24]: `` I say , Diamond , I ca n't bear to have an honest old horse like you think of me like that .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 18]: I will tell you the truth : it was my own fault that I fell lame . ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 34]: `` I told you so , '' returned the other , tumbling against the partition as he rolled over on his side to give his legs every possible privilege in their narrow circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 10]: `` I meant to do it , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 47]: At the words , the old horse arose with a scramble like thunder , shot his angry head and glaring eye over into Ruby 's stall , and said -- `` Keep out of my way , you unworthy wretch , or I 'll bite you .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 4]: You a horse !
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 7]: Why did you do that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 9]: `` Because I wanted to grow fat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 4]: `` You grease-tub !
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 5]: my teeth and tail !
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 7]: I thought you were a humbug !
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 8]: Why did you want to get fat ?
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 14]: There 's no truth to be got out of you but by cross-questioning .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 10]: You ai n't fit to be a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 35]: `` Because once I am fat , my nature is to keep fat for a long time ; and I did n't know when master might come home and want to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 7]: `` You conceited , good-for-nothing brute !
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 10]: You 're only fit for the knacker 's yard .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 9]: You wanted to look handsome , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 21]: Hold your tongue , or I 'll break my halter and be at you -- with your handsome fat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 6]: `` Never mind , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 6]: You 're a good horse .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 7]: You ca n't hurt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 6]: `` Ca n't hurt you !
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 7]: Just let me once try . ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 8]: `` No , you ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 5]: `` Why then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 8]: `` Because I 'm an angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 9]: `` Of course you do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 7]: `` Indeed I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 7]: `` I know you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 16]: An ignorant , rude old human horse , like you , could n't know it .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 45]: But there 's young Diamond listening to all we 're saying ; and he knows well enough there are horses in heaven for angels to ride upon , as well as other animals , lions and eagles and bulls , in more important situations .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 19]: The horses the angels ride , must be angel-horses , else the angels could n't ride upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 9]: Well , I 'm one of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 6]: `` You ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 12]: `` Did you ever know a horse tell a lie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 4]: `` Never before .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 9]: But you 've confessed to shamming lame . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 6]: `` Nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 21]: It was necessary I should grow fat , and necessary that good Joseph , your master , should grow lean .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 21]: I could have pretended to be lame , but that no horse , least of all an angel-horse would do .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 55]: So I must be lame , and so I sprained my ankle -- for the angel-horses have ankles -- they do n't talk horse-slang up there -- and it hurt me very much , I assure you , Diamond , though you may n't be good enough to be able to believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 6]: Old Diamond made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 37]: He had lain down again , and a sleepy snort , very like a snore , revealed that , if he was not already asleep , he was past understanding a word that Ruby was saying .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 21]: When young Diamond found this , he thought he might venture to take up the dropt shuttlecock of the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 15]: `` I 'm good enough to believe it , Ruby , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 14]: But Ruby never turned his head , or took any notice of him .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 25]: I suppose he did not understand more of English than just what the coachman and stableman were in the habit of addressing him with .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 45]: Finding , however , that his companion made no reply , he shot his head over the partition and looking down at him said -- `` You just wait till to-morrow , and you 'll see whether I 'm speaking the truth or not .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 10]: -- I declare the old horse is fast asleep !
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 3]: -- Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 7]: -- No I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 13]: Ruby turned away , and began pulling at his hayrack in silence .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 18]: Diamond gave a shiver , and looking round saw that the door of the stable was open .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 37]: He began to feel as if he had been dreaming , and after a glance about the stable to see if North Wind was anywhere visible , he thought he had better go back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 27]: THE PROSPECT BRIGHTENS THE next morning , Diamond 's mother said to his father , `` I 'm not quite comfortable about that child again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 7]: `` Which child , Martha ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 3]: asked Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 9]: `` You 've got a choice now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 7]: `` Well , Diamond I mean .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 12]: I 'm afraid he 's getting into his queer ways again .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 13]: He 's been at his old trick of walking in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 15]: I saw him run up the stair in the middle of the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 11]: `` Did n't you go after him , wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 15]: `` Of course I did -- and found him fast asleep in his bed .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 20]: It 's because he 's had so little meat for the last six weeks , I 'm afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 6]: `` It may be that .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 5]: I 'm very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 21]: But if it do n't please God to send us enough , what am I to do , wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 19]: `` You ca n't help it , I know , my dear good man , '' returned Martha .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 9]: `` And after all I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 18]: I do n't see why he should n't get on as well as the rest of us .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 16]: There I 'm nursing baby all this time , and I get along pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 23]: I 'm sure , to hear the little man singing , you would n't think there was much amiss with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 14]: For at that moment Diamond was singing like a lark in the clouds .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 16]: He had the new baby in his arms , while his mother was dressing herself .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 37]: Joseph was sitting at his breakfast -- a little weak tea , dry bread , and very dubious butter -- which Nanny had set for him , and which he was enjoying because he was hungry .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 17]: He had groomed both horses , and had got old Diamond harnessed ready to put to .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 10]: `` Think of a fat angel , Dulcimer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 37]: The baby had not been christened yet , but Diamond , in reading his Bible , had come upon the word dulcimer , and thought it so pretty that ever after he called his sister Dulcimer !
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 12]: `` Think of a red , fat angel , Dulcimer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 15]: he repeated ; `` for Ruby 's an angel of a horse , Dulcimer .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 11]: He sprained his ankle and got fat on purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 7]: `` What purpose , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 4]: asked his father .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 6]: that I ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 14]: I suppose to look handsome when his master comes , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 9]: -- `` What do you think , Dulcimer ?
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 14]: It must be for some good , for Ruby 's an angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 26]: `` I wish I were rid of him , anyhow , '' said his father ; `` for he weighs heavy on my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 15]: `` No wonder , father : he 's so fat , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 23]: `` But you need n't be afraid , for everybody says he 's in better condition than when you had him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 18]: `` Yes , but he may be as thin as a tin horse before his owner comes .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 14]: It was too bad to leave him on my hands this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 12]: `` Perhaps he could n't help it , '' suggested Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 12]: `` I daresay he has some good reason for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 28]: `` So I should have said , '' returned his father , `` if he had not driven such a hard bargain with me at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 20]: `` But we do n't know what may come of it yet , husband , '' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 26]: `` Mr. Raymond may give a little to boot , seeing you 've had more of the bargain than you wanted or reckoned upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 27]: `` I 'm afraid not : he 's a hard man , '' said Joseph , as he rose and went to get his cab out .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 5]: Diamond resumed his singing .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 23]: For some time he carolled snatches of everything or anything ; but at last it settled down into something like what follows .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 11]: I can not tell where or how he got it .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 9]: Where did you come from , baby dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 7]: Out of the everywhere into here .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 9]: Where did you get your eyes so blue ?
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 9]: Out of the sky as I came through .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 10]: What makes the light in them sparkle and spin ?
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 8]: Some of the starry spikes left in .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 8]: Where did you get that little tear ?
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 9]: I found it waiting when I got here .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 9]: What makes your forehead so smooth and high ?
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 10]: A soft hand stroked it as I went by .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 10]: What makes your cheek like a warm white rose ?
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 9]: I saw something better than any one knows .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 7]: Whence that three-cornered smile of bliss ?
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 9]: Three angels gave me at once a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 8]: Where did you get this pearly ear ?
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 10]: God spoke , and it came out to hear .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 9]: Where did you get those arms and hands ?
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 8]: Love made itself into hooks and bands .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 11]: Feet , whence did you come , you darling things ?
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 10]: From the same box as the cherubs ' wings .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 10]: How did they all just come to be you ?
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 10]: God thought about me , and so I grew .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 11]: But how did you come to us , you dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 11]: God thought about you , and so I am here .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 14]: `` You never made that song , Diamond , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 5]: `` No , mother .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 5]: I wish I had .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 6]: No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 10]: That would be to take it from somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 9]: But it 's mine for all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 7]: `` What makes it yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 7]: `` I love it so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 10]: `` Does loving a thing make it yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 15]: `` I think so , mother -- at least more than anything else can .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 23]: If I did n't love baby -LRB- which could n't be , you know -RRB- she would n't be mine a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 15]: But I do love baby , and baby is my very own Dulcimer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 9]: `` The baby 's mine , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 11]: `` That makes her the more mine , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 9]: `` How do you make that out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 9]: `` Because you 're mine , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 9]: `` Is that because you love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 6]: `` Yes , just because .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 10]: Love makes the only myness , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 39]: When his father came home to have his dinner , and change Diamond for Ruby , they saw him look very sad , and he told them he had not had a fare worth mentioning the whole morning .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 17]: `` We shall all have to go to the workhouse , wife , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 28]: `` It would be better to go to the back of the north wind , '' said Diamond , dreamily , not intending to say it aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 10]: `` So it would , '' answered his father .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 12]: `` But how are we to get there , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 13]: `` We must wait till we 're taken , '' returned Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 26]: Before his father could speak again , a knock came to the door , and in walked Mr. Raymond with a smile on his face .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 13]: Joseph got up and received him respectfully , but not very cordially .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 14]: Martha set a chair for him , but he would not sit down .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 16]: `` You are not very glad to see me , '' he said to Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 13]: `` You do n't want to part with the old horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 10]: `` Indeed , sir , you are mistaken there .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 22]: What with anxiety about him , and bad luck , I 've wished I were rid of him a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 18]: It was only to be for three months , and here it 's eight or nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 15]: `` I 'm sorry to hear such a statement , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 11]: `` Has n't he been of service to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 13]: `` Not much , not with his lameness '' `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 16]: said Mr. Raymond , hastily -- `` you 've been laming him -- have you ?
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 5]: That accounts for it .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 7]: I see , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 14]: `` It was n't my fault , and he 's all right now .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 22]: I do n't know how it happened , but -- '' `` He did it on purpose , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 15]: `` He put his foot on a stone just to twist his ankle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 10]: `` How do you know that , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 8]: said his father , turning to him .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 16]: `` I never said so , for I could not think how it came . ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 13]: `` I heard it -- in the stable , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 14]: `` Let 's have a look at him , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 21]: `` If you 'll step into the yard , '' said Joseph , `` I 'll bring him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 22]: They went , and Joseph , having first taken off his harness , walked Ruby into the middle of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 18]: `` Why , '' said Mr. Raymond , `` you 've not been using him well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 13]: `` I do n't know what you mean by that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 10]: I did n't expect to hear that from you .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 15]: He 's sound in wind and limb -- as sound as a barrel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 9]: `` And as big , you might add .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 10]: Why , he 's as fat as a pig !
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 9]: You do n't call that good usage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 9]: Joseph was too angry to make any answer .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 11]: `` You 've not worked him enough , I say .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 9]: That 's not making good use of him .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 12]: That 's not doing as you 'd be done by . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 16]: `` I should n't be sorry if I was served the same , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 10]: `` He 's too fat , I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 24]: `` There was a whole month I could n't work him at all , and he did nothing but eat his head off .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 6]: He 's an awful eater .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 40]: I 've taken the best part of six hours a day out of him since , but I 'm always afraid of his coming to grief again , and so I could n't make the most even of that .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 28]: I declare to you , sir , when he 's between the shafts , I sit on the box as miserable as if I 'd stolen him .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 27]: He looks all the time as if he was a bottling up of complaints to make of me the minute he set eyes on you again .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 13]: look at him now , squinting round at me with one eye !
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 23]: I declare to you , on my word , I have n't laid the whip on him more than three times . ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 8]: `` I 'm glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 8]: He never did want the whip . ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 9]: `` I did n't say that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 11]: If ever a horse wanted the whip , he do .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 13]: He 's brought me to beggary almost with his snail 's pace .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 14]: I 'm very glad you 've come to rid me of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 12]: `` I do n't know that , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 16]: `` Suppose I were to ask you to buy him of me -- cheap . ''
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 12]: `` I would n't have him in a present , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 6]: I do n't like him .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 19]: And I would n't drive a horse that I did n't like -- no , not for gold .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 15]: It ca n't come to good where there 's no love between 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 22]: `` Just bring out your own horse , and let me see what sort of a pair they 'd make . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 11]: Joseph laughed rather bitterly as he went to fetch Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 24]: When the two were placed side by side , Mr. Raymond could hardly keep his countenance , but from a mingling of feelings .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 29]: Beside the great , red , round barrel , Ruby , all body and no legs , Diamond looked like a clothes-horse with a skin thrown over it .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 19]: There was hardly a spot of him where you could not descry some sign of a bone underneath .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 18]: Gaunt and grim and weary he stood , kissing his master , and heeding no one else .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 14]: `` You have n't been using him well , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 30]: `` I must say , '' returned Joseph , throwing an arm round his horse 's neck , `` that the remark had better have been spared , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 11]: The horse is worth three of the other now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 7]: `` I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 9]: I think they make a very nice pair .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 19]: If the one 's too fat , the other 's too lean -- so that 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 16]: And if you wo n't buy my Ruby , I must buy your Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 18]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said Joseph , in a tone implying anything but thanks .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 15]: `` You do n't seem to like the proposal , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 9]: `` I do n't , '' returned Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 23]: `` I would n't part with my old Diamond for his skin as full of nuggets as it is of bones . ''
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 10]: `` Who said anything about parting with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 8]: `` You did now , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 7]: `` No ; I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 13]: I only spoke of buying him to make a pair with Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 10]: We could pare Ruby and patch Diamond a bit .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 15]: And for height , they are as near a match as I care about .
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 20]: Of course you would be the coachman -- if only you would consent to be reconciled to Ruby . ''
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 8]: Joseph stood bewildered , unable to answer .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 33]: `` I 've bought a small place in Kent , '' continued Mr. Raymond , `` and I must have a pair to my carriage , for the roads are hilly thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 14]: I do n't want to make a show with a pair of high-steppers .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 7]: I think these will just do .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 20]: Suppose , for a week or two , you set yourself to take Ruby down and bring Diamond up .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 24]: If we could only lay a pipe from Ruby 's sides into Diamond 's , it would be the work of a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 9]: But I fear that would n't answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 21]: A strong inclination to laugh intruded upon Joseph 's inclination to cry , and made speech still harder than before .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 14]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , '' he said at length .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 34]: `` I 've been so miserable , and for so long , that I never thought you was only a chaffing of me when you said I had n't used the horses well .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 65]: I did grumble at you , sir , many 's the time in my trouble ; but whenever I said anything , my little Diamond would look at me with a smile , as much as to say : ' I know him better than you , father ; ' and upon my word , I always thought the boy must be right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 11]: `` Will you sell me old Diamond , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 31]: `` I will , sir , on one condition -- that if ever you want to part with him or me , you give me the option of buying him .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 9]: I could not part with him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 41]: As to who calls him his , that 's nothing ; for , as Diamond says , it 's only loving a thing that can make it yours -- and I do love old Diamond , sir , dearly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 34]: `` Well , there 's a cheque for twenty pounds , which I wrote to offer you for him , in case I should find you had done the handsome thing by Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 6]: Will that be enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 8]: `` It 's too much , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: His body ai n't worth it -- shoes and all .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 32]: It 's only his heart , sir -- that 's worth millions -- but his heart 'll be mine all the same -- so it 's too much , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 7]: `` I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 19]: It wo n't be , at least , by the time we 've got him fed up again .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 6]: You take it and welcome .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 39]: Just go on with your cabbing for another month , only take it out of Ruby and let Diamond rest ; and by that time I shall be ready for you to go down into the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 9]: `` Thank you , sir , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 16]: Diamond set you down for a friend , sir , the moment he saw you .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 14]: I do believe that child of mine knows more than other people . ''
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 16]: `` I think so , too , '' said Mr. Raymond as he walked away .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 25]: He had meant to test Joseph when he made the bargain about Ruby , but had no intention of so greatly prolonging the trial .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 17]: He had been taken ill in Switzerland , and had been quite unable to return sooner .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 21]: He went away now highly gratified at finding that he had stood the test , and was a true man .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 22]: Joseph rushed in to his wife who had been standing at the window anxiously waiting the result of the long colloquy .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 24]: When she heard that the horses were to go together in double harness , she burst forth into an immoderate fit of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 30]: Diamond came up with the baby in his arms and made big anxious eyes at her , saying -- `` What is the matter with you , mother dear ?
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 5]: Do cry a little .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 6]: It will do you good .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 18]: When father takes ever so small a drop of spirits , he puts water to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 6]: `` You silly darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 29]: said his mother ; `` how could I but laugh at the notion of that great fat Ruby going side by side with our poor old Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 7]: `` But why not , mother ?
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 24]: With a month 's oats , and nothing to do , Diamond 'll be nearer Ruby 's size than you will father 's .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 13]: I think it 's very good for different sorts to go together .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 13]: Now Ruby will have a chance of teaching Diamond better manners . ''
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 12]: `` How dare you say such a thing , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 6]: said his father , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 14]: `` To compare the two for manners , there 's no comparison possible .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 7]: Our Diamond 's a gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 23]: `` I do n't mean to say he is n't , father ; for I daresay some gentlemen judge their neighbours unjustly .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 6]: That 's all I mean .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 11]: Diamond should n't have thought such bad things of Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 12]: He did n't try to make the best of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 10]: `` How do you know that , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 11]: `` I heard them talking about it one night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 6]: `` Why Diamond and Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 6]: Ruby 's an angel . ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 7]: Joseph stared and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 29]: For all his new gladness , he was very gloomy as he re-harnessed the angel , for he thought his darling Diamond was going out of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 21]: He could not help thinking rather differently , however , when he found the change that had come over Ruby .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 18]: Considering his fat , he exerted himself amazingly , and got over the ground with incredible speed .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 21]: So willing , even anxious , was he to go now , that Joseph had to hold him quite tight .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 39]: Then as he laughed at his own fancies , a new fear came upon him lest the horse should break his wind , and Mr. Raymond have good cause to think he had not been using him well .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 52]: He might even suppose that he had taken advantage of his new instructions , to let out upon the horse some of his pent-up dislike ; whereas in truth , it had so utterly vanished that he felt as if Ruby , too , had been his friend all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 21]: IN THE COUNTRY BEFORE the end of the month , Ruby had got respectably thin , and Diamond respectably stout .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 10]: They really began to look fit for double harness .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 41]: Joseph and his wife got their affairs in order , and everything ready for migrating at the shortest notice ; and they felt so peaceful and happy that they judged all the trouble they had gone through well worth enduring .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 33]: As for Nanny , she had been so happy ever since she left the hospital , that she expected nothing better , and saw nothing attractive in the notion of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 31]: At the same time , she had not the least idea of what the word country meant , for she had never seen anything about her but streets and gas-lamps .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 49]: Besides , she was more attached to Jim than to Diamond : Jim was a reasonable being , Diamond in her eyes at best only an amiable , over-grown baby , whom no amount of expostulation would ever bring to talk sense , not to say think it .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 19]: Now that she could manage the baby as well as he , she judged herself altogether his superior .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 13]: Towards his father and mother , she was all they could wish .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 39]: Diamond had taken a great deal of pains and trouble to find Jim , and had at last succeeded through the help of the tall policeman , who was glad to renew his acquaintance with the strange child .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 37]: Jim had moved his quarters , and had not heard of Nanny 's illness till some time after she was taken to the hospital , where he was too shy to go and inquire about her .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 23]: But when at length she went to live with Diamond 's family , Jim was willing enough to go and see her .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 30]: It was after one of his visits , during which they had been talking of her new prospects , that Nanny expressed to Diamond her opinion of the country .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 16]: `` There ai n't nothing in it but the sun and moon , Diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 11]: `` There 's trees and flowers , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 13]: `` Well , they ai n't no count , '' returned Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 5]: `` Ai n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 15]: They 're so beautiful , they make you happy to look at them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 11]: `` That 's because you 're such a silly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 23]: Diamond smiled with a far-away look , as if he were gazing through clouds of green leaves and the vision contented him .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 36]: But he was thinking with himself what more he could do for Nanny ; and that same evening he went to find Mr. Raymond , for he had heard that he had returned to town .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 8]: how do you do , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 13]: said Mr. Raymond ; `` I am glad to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 14]: And he was indeed , for he had grown very fond of him .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 11]: His opinion of him was very different from Nanny 's .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 11]: `` What do you want now , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 13]: `` I 'm always wanting something , sir , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 17]: `` Well , that 's quite right , so long as what you want is right .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 19]: Everybody is always wanting something ; only we do n't mention it in the right place often enough .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 6]: What is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 17]: `` There 's a friend of Nanny 's , a lame boy , called Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 12]: `` I 've heard of him , '' said Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 15]: `` Nanny does n't care much about going to the country , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 12]: `` Well , what has that to do with Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 19]: `` You could n't find a corner for Jim to work in -- could you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 10]: `` I do n't know that I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 13]: That is , if you can show good reason for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 10]: `` He 's a good boy , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 11]: `` Well , so much the better for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 11]: `` I know he can shine boots , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 9]: `` So much the better for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 17]: `` You want your boots shined in the country -- do n't you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 8]: `` Yes , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 21]: `` It would n't be nice to walk over the flowers with dirty boots -- would it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 6]: `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 11]: `` They would n't like it -- would they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 8]: `` No , they would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 13]: `` Then Nanny would be better pleased to go , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 23]: `` If the flowers did n't like dirty boots to walk over them , Nanny would n't mind going to the country ?
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 4]: Is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 8]: I do n't quite see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 11]: `` No , sir ; I did n't mean that .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 32]: I meant , if you would take Jim with you to clean your boots , and do odd jobs , you know , sir , then Nanny would like it better .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 8]: She 's so fond of Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 10]: `` Now you come to the point , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 8]: I see what you mean , exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 9]: I will turn it over in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 9]: Could you bring Jim to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 7]: `` I 'll try , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 8]: But they do n't mind me much .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 17]: They think I 'm silly , '' added Diamond , with one of his sweetest smiles .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 14]: What Mr. Raymond thought , I dare hardly attempt to put down here .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 23]: But one part of it was , that the highest wisdom must ever appear folly to those who do not possess it .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 18]: `` I think he would come though -- after dark , you know , '' Diamond continued .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 8]: `` He does well at shining boots .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 12]: People 's kind to lame boys , you know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 12]: But after dark , there ai n't so much doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 23]: Diamond succeeded in bringing Jim to Mr. Raymond , and the consequence was that he resolved to give the boy a chance .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 68]: He provided new clothes for both him and Nanny ; and upon a certain day , Joseph took his wife and three children , and Nanny and Jim , by train to a certain station in the county of Kent , where they found a cart waiting to carry them and their luggage to The Mound , which was the name of Mr. Raymond 's new residence .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 19]: I will not describe the varied feelings of the party as they went , or when they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 29]: All I will say is , that Diamond , who is my only care , was full of quiet delight -- a gladness too deep to talk about .
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 34]: Joseph returned to town the same night , and the next morning drove Ruby and Diamond down , with the carriage behind them , and Mr. Raymond and a lady in the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 23]: For Mr. Raymond was an old bachelor no longer : he was bringing his wife with him to live at The Mound .
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 19]: The moment Nanny saw her , she recognised her as the lady who had lent her the ruby-ring .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 10]: That ring had been given her by Mr. Raymond .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 12]: The weather was very hot , and the woods very shadowy .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 50]: There were not a great many wild flowers , for it was getting well towards autumn , and the most of the wild flowers rise early to be before the leaves , because if they did not , they would never get a glimpse of the sun for them .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 23]: So they have their fun over , and are ready to go to bed again by the time the trees are dressed .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 33]: But there was plenty of the loveliest grass and daisies about the house , and Diamond 's chief pleasure seemed to be to lie amongst them , and breathe the pure air .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 31]: But all the time , he was dreaming of the country at the back of the north wind , and trying to recall the songs the river used to sing .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 23]: For this was more like being at the back of the north wind than anything he had known since he left it .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 54]: Sometimes he would have his little brother , sometimes his little sister , and sometimes both of them in the grass with him , and then he felt just like a cat with her first kittens , he said , only he could n't purr -- all he could do was to sing .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 25]: These were very different times from those when he used to drive the cab , but you must not suppose that Diamond was idle .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 58]: He did not do so much for his mother now , because Nanny occupied his former place ; but he helped his father still , both in the stable and the harness-room , and generally went with him on the box that he might learn to drive a pair , and be ready to open the carriage-door .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 12]: Mr. Raymond advised his father to give him plenty of liberty .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 18]: `` A boy like that , '' he said , `` ought not to be pushed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 14]: Joseph assented heartily , smiling to himself at the idea of pushing Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 20]: After doing everything that fell to his share , the boy had a wealth of time at his disposal .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 11]: And a happy , sometimes a merry time it was .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 17]: Only for two months or so , he neither saw nor heard anything of North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 37]: I MAKE DIAMOND 'S ACQUAINTANCE MR. RAYMOND 'S house was called The Mound , because it stood upon a little steep knoll , so smooth and symmetrical that it showed itself at once to be artificial .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 56]: It had , beyond doubt , been built for Queen Elizabeth as a hunting tower -- a place , namely , from the top of which you could see the country for miles on all sides , and so be able to follow with your eyes the flying deer and the pursuing hounds and horsemen .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 18]: The mound had been cast up to give a good basement-advantage over the neighbouring heights and woods .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 43]: There was a great quarry-hole not far off , brim-full of water , from which , as the current legend stated , the materials forming the heart of the mound -- a kind of stone unfit for building -- had been dug .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 46]: The house itself was of brick , and they said the foundations were first laid in the natural level , and then the stones and earth of the mound were heaped about and between them , so that its great height should be well buttressed .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 16]: Joseph and his wife lived in a little cottage a short way from the house .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 43]: It was a real cottage , with a roof of thick thatch , which , in June and July , the wind sprinkled with the red and white petals it shook from the loose topmost sprays of the rose-trees climbing the walls .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 53]: At first Diamond had a nest under this thatch -- a pretty little room with white muslin curtains , but afterwards Mr. and Mrs. Raymond wanted to have him for a page in the house , and his father and mother were quite pleased to have him employed without his leaving them .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 34]: So he was dressed in a suit of blue , from which his pale face and fair hair came out like the loveliest blossom , and took up his abode in the house .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 12]: `` Would you be afraid to sleep alone , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 4]: asked his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 15]: `` I do n't know what you mean , ma'am , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 19]: `` I never was afraid of anything that I can recollect -- not much , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 30]: `` There 's a little room at the top of the house -- all alone , '' she returned ; `` perhaps you would not mind sleeping there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 15]: `` I can sleep anywhere , and I like best to be high up .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 9]: Should I be able to see out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 35]: `` I will show you the place , '' she answered ; and taking him by the hand , she led him up and up the oval-winding stair in one of the two towers .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 23]: Near the top they entered a tiny little room , with two windows from which you could see over the whole country .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 7]: Diamond clapped his hands with delight .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 12]: `` You would like this room , then , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 4]: said his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 14]: `` It 's the grandest room in the house , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 19]: `` I shall be near the stars , and yet not far from the tops of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 8]: That 's just what I like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 31]: I daresay he thought , also , that it would be a nice place for North Wind to call at in passing ; but he said nothing of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 22]: Below him spread a lake of green leaves , with glimpses of grass here and there at the bottom of it .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 21]: As he looked down , he saw a squirrel appear suddenly , and as suddenly vanish amongst the topmost branches .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 3]: `` Aha !
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 17]: little squirrel , '' he cried , `` my nest is built higher than yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 20]: `` You can be up here with your books as much as you like , '' said his mistress .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 21]: `` I will have a little bell hung at the door , which I can ring when I want you .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 9]: Half-way down the stair is the drawing-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 16]: So Diamond was installed as page , and his new room got ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 13]: It was very soon after this that I came to know Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 19]: I was then a tutor in a family whose estate adjoined the little property belonging to The Mound .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 41]: I had made the acquaintance of Mr. Raymond in London some time before , and was walking up the drive towards the house to call upon him one fine warm evening , when I saw Diamond for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 25]: He was sitting at the foot of a great beech-tree , a few yards from the road , with a book on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 6]: He did not see me .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 21]: I walked up behind the tree , and peeping over his shoulder , saw that he was reading a fairy-book .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 7]: `` What are you reading ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 21]: I said , and spoke suddenly , with the hope of seeing a startled little face look round at me .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 34]: Diamond turned his head as quietly as if he were only obeying his mother 's voice , and the calmness of his face rebuked my unkind desire and made me ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 19]: `` I am reading the story of the Little Lady and the Goblin Prince , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 15]: `` I am sorry I do n't know the story , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 7]: `` Who is it by ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 7]: `` Mr. Raymond made it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 7]: `` Is he your uncle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 6]: I asked at a guess .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 6]: He 's my master . ''
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 9]: `` What do you do for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 4]: I asked respectfully .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 12]: `` Anything he wishes me to do , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 8]: `` I am busy for him now .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 8]: He gave me this story to read .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 8]: He wants my opinion upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 15]: `` Do n't you find it rather hard to make up your mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 5]: `` Oh dear no !
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 14]: Any story always tells me itself what I 'm to think about it .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 29]: Mr. Raymond does n't want me to say whether it is a clever story or not , but whether I like it , and why I like it .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 27]: I never can tell what they call clever from what they call silly , but I always know whether I like a story or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 14]: `` And can you always tell why you like it or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 8]: Very often I ca n't at all .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 4]: Sometimes I can .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 12]: I always know , but I ca n't always tell why .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 13]: Mr. Raymond writes the stories , and then tries them on me .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 9]: Mother does the same when she makes jam .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 13]: She 's made such a lot of jam since we came here !
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 14]: And she always makes me taste it to see if it 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 14]: Mother knows by the face I make whether it will or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 12]: At this moment I caught sight of two more children approaching .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 21]: One was a handsome girl , the other a pale-faced , awkward-looking boy , who limped much on one leg .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 18]: I withdrew a little , to see what would follow , for they seemed in some consternation .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 37]: After a few hurried words , they went off together , and I pursued my way to the house , where I was as kindly received by Mr. and Mrs. Raymond as I could have desired .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 31]: From them I learned something of Diamond , and was in consequence the more glad to find him , when I returned , seated in the same place as before .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 14]: `` What did the boy and girl want with you , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 11]: `` They had seen a creature that frightened them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 11]: `` And they came to tell you about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 13]: `` They could n't get water out of the well for it .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 10]: So they wanted me to go with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 9]: `` They 're both bigger than you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 11]: `` Yes , but they were frightened at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 10]: `` And were n't you frightened at it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 6]: `` Because I 'm silly .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 8]: I 'm never frightened at things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 14]: I could not help thinking of the old meaning of the word silly .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 7]: `` And what was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 16]: `` I think it was a kind of an angel -- a very little one .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 26]: It had a long body and great wings , which it drove about it so fast that they grew a thin cloud all round it .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 36]: It flew backwards and forwards over the well , or hung right in the middle , making a mist of its wings , as if its business was to take care of the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 12]: `` And what did you do to drive it away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 8]: `` I did n't drive it away .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 17]: I knew , whatever the creature was , the well was to get water out of .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 16]: So I took the jug , dipped it in , and drew the water . ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 9]: `` And what did the creature do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 5]: `` Flew about . ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 9]: `` And it did n't hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 4]: Why should it ?
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 8]: I was n't doing anything wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 9]: `` What did your companions say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 10]: `` They said -- ` Thank you , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 9]: What a dear silly you are ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 10]: `` And were n't you angry with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 27]: I should like if they would play with me a little ; but they always like better to go away together when their work is over .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 5]: They never heed me .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 9]: I do n't mind it much , though .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 6]: The other creatures are friendly .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 8]: They do n't run away from me .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 19]: Only they 're all so busy with their own work , they do n't mind me much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 9]: `` Do you feel lonely , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 15]: When nobody minds me , I get into my nest , and look up .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 14]: And then the sky does mind me , and thinks about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 7]: `` Where is your nest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 23]: He rose , saying , `` I will show you , '' and led me to the other side of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 12]: There hung a little rope-ladder from one of the lower boughs .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 12]: The boy climbed up the ladder and got upon the bough .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 15]: Then he climbed farther into the leafy branches , and went out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 16]: After a little while , I heard his voice coming down out of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 13]: `` I am in my nest now , '' said the voice .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 11]: `` I ca n't see you , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 21]: `` I ca n't see you either , but I can see the first star peeping out of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 10]: I should like to get up into the sky .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 11]: Do n't you think I shall , some day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 10]: Tell me what more you see up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 20]: `` I do n't see anything more , except a few leaves , and the big sky over me .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 5]: It goes swinging about .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 8]: The earth is all behind my back .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 5]: There comes another star !
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 10]: The wind is like kisses from a big lady .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 18]: When I get up here I feel as if I were in North Wind 's arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 10]: This was the first I heard of North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 44]: The whole ways and look of the child , so full of quiet wisdom , yet so ready to accept the judgment of others in his own dispraise , took hold of my heart , and I felt myself wonderfully drawn towards him .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 44]: It seemed to me , somehow , as if little Diamond possessed the secret of life , and was himself what he was so ready to think the lowest living thing -- an angel of God with something special to say or do .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 23]: A gush of reverence came over me , and with a single goodnight , I turned and left him in his nest .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 24]: I saw him often after this , and gained so much of his confidence that he told me all I have told you .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 9]: I can not pretend to account for it .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 14]: I leave that for each philosophical reader to do after his own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 23]: The easiest way is that of Nanny and Jim , who said often to each other that Diamond had a tile loose .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 62]: But Mr. Raymond was much of my opinion concerning the boy ; while Mrs. Raymond confessed that she often rang her bell just to have once more the pleasure of seeing the lovely stillness of the boy 's face , with those blue eyes which seemed rather made for other people to look into than for himself to look out of .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 18]: It was plainer to others than to himself that he felt the desertion of Nanny and Jim .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 28]: They appeared to regard him as a mere toy , except when they found he could minister to the scruple of using him -- generally with success .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 37]: They were , however , well-behaved to a wonderful degree ; while I have little doubt that much of their good behaviour was owing to the unconscious influence of the boy they called God 's baby .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 20]: One very strange thing is that I could never find out where he got some of his many songs .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 31]: At times they would be but bubbles blown out of a nursery rhyme , as was the following , which I heard him sing one evening to his little Dulcimer .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 29]: There were about a score of sheep feeding in a paddock near him , their white wool dyed a pale rose in the light of the setting sun .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 23]: Those in the long shadows from the trees were dead white ; those in the sunlight were half glorified with pale rose .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 34]: Little Bo Peep , she lost her sheep , And did n't know where to find them ; They were over the height and out of sight , Trailing their tails behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 79]: Little Bo Peep woke out of her sleep , Jump 'd up and set out to find them : `` The silly things , they 've got no wings , And they 've left their trails behind them : `` They 've taken their tails , but they 've left their trails , And so I shall follow and find them ; '' For wherever a tail had dragged a trail , The long grass grew behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 20]: And day 's eyes and butter-cups , cow 's lips and crow 's feet Were glittering in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 19]: She threw down her book , and caught up her crook , And after her sheep did run .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 35]: She ran , and she ran , and ever as she ran , The grass grew higher and higher ; Till over the hill the sun began To set in a flame of fire .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 37]: She ran on still -- up the grassy hill , And the grass grew higher and higher ; When she reached its crown , the sun was down , And had left a trail of fire .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 18]: The sheep and their tails were gone , all gone -- And no more trail behind them !
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 4]: Yes , yes !
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 12]: they were there -- long-tailed and fair , But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 6]: she could not find them .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 39]: Purple and gold , and rosy and blue , With their tails all white behind them , Her sheep they did run in the trail of the sun ; She saw them , but could not find them .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 37]: After the sun , like clouds they did run , But she knew they were her sheep : She sat down to cry , and look up at the sky , But she cried herself asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 36]: And as she slept the dew fell fast , And the wind blew from the sky ; And strange things took place that shun the day 's face , Because they are sweet and shy .
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 6]: Nibble , nibble , crop !
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 27]: she heard as she woke : A hundred little lambs Did pluck and eat the grass so sweet That grew in the trails of their dams .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 17]: Little Bo Peep caught up her crook , And wiped the tears that did blind her .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 6]: And nibble , nibble crop !
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 4]: without a stop !
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 7]: The lambs came eating behind her .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 18]: Home , home she came , both tired and lame , With three times as many sheep .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 23]: In a month or more , they 'll be as big as before , And then she 'll laugh in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 37]: But what would you say , if one fine day , When they 've got their bushiest tails , Their grown up game should be just the same , And she have to follow their trails ?
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 39]: Never weep , Bo Peep , though you lose your sheep , And do not know where to find them ; 'T is after the sun the mothers have run , And there are their lambs behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 32]: I confess again to having touched up a little , but it loses far more in Diamond 's sweet voice singing it than it gains by a rhyme here and there .
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 13]: Some of them were out of books Mr. Raymond had given him .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 14]: These he always knew , but about the others he could seldom tell .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 12]: Sometimes he would say , `` I made that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 32]: but generally he would say , `` I do n't know ; I found it somewhere ; '' or `` I got it at the back of the north wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 31]: One evening I found him sitting on the grassy slope under the house , with his Dulcimer in his arms and his little brother rolling on the grass beside them .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 23]: He was chanting in his usual way , more like the sound of a brook than anything else I can think of .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 11]: When I went up to them he ceased his chant .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 7]: `` Do go on , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 9]: Do n't mind me , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 6]: He began again at once .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 33]: While he sang , Nanny and Jim sat a little way off , one hemming a pocket-handkerchief , and the other reading a story to her , but they never heeded Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 16]: This is as near what he sang as I can recollect , or reproduce rather .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 17]: What would you see if I took you up To my little nest in the air ?
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 15]: You would see the sky like a clear blue cup Turned upside downwards there .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 17]: What would you do if I took you there To my little nest in the tree ?
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 17]: My child with cries would trouble the air , To get what she could but see .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 17]: What would you get in the top of the tree For all your crying and grief ?
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 18]: Not a star would you clutch of all you see -- You could only gather a leaf .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 32]: But when you had lost your greedy grief , Content to see from afar , You would find in your hand a withering leaf , In your heart a shining star .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 32]: As Diamond went on singing , it grew very dark , and just as he ceased there came a great flash of lightning , that blinded us all for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 25]: Dulcimer crowed with pleasure ; but when the roar of thunder came after it , the little brother gave a loud cry of terror .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 13]: Nanny and Jim came running up to us , pale with fear .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 15]: Diamond 's face , too , was paler than usual , but with delight .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 15]: Some of the glory seemed to have clung to it , and remained shining .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 12]: `` You 're not frightened -- are you , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 6]: Why should I be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 17]: he answered with his usual question , looking up in my face with calm shining eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 25]: `` He ai n't got sense to be frightened , '' said Nanny , going up to him and giving him a pitying hug .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 17]: `` Perhaps there 's more sense in not being frightened , Nanny , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 13]: `` Do you think the lightning can do as it likes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 10]: `` It might kill you , '' said Jim .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , it might n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 14]: As he spoke there came another great flash , and a tearing crack .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 8]: `` There 's a tree struck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 46]: I said ; and when we looked round , after the blinding of the flash had left our eyes , we saw a huge bough of the beech-tree in which was Diamond 's nest hanging to the ground like the broken wing of a bird .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 9]: cried Nanny ; `` I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 18]: If you had been up there you see what would have happened , you little silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 18]: `` No , I do n't , '' said Diamond , and began to sing to Dulcimer .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 32]: All I could hear of the song , for the other children were going on with their chatter , was -- The clock struck one , And the mouse came down .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 6]: Dickery , dickery , dock !
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 23]: Then there came a blast of wind , and the rain followed in straight-pouring lines , as if out of a watering-pot .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 26]: Diamond jumped up with his little Dulcimer in his arms , and Nanny caught up the little boy , and they ran for the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 14]: Jim vanished with a double shuffle , and I went into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 45]: When I came out again to return home , the clouds were gone , and the evening sky glimmered through the trees , blue , and pale-green towards the west , I turned my steps a little aside to look at the stricken beech .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 21]: I saw the bough torn from the stem , and that was all the twilight would allow me to see .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 68]: While I stood gazing , down from the sky came a sound of singing , but the voice was neither of lark nor of nightingale : it was sweeter than either : it was the voice of Diamond , up in his airy nest : -- The lightning and thunder , They go and they come ; But the stars and the stillness Are always at home .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 6]: And then the voice ceased .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 9]: `` Good-night , Diamond , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 9]: `` Good-night , sir , '' answered Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 43]: As I walked away pondering , I saw the great black top of the beech swaying about against the sky in an upper wind , and heard the murmur as of many dim half-articulate voices filling the solitude around Diamond 's nest .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 26]: DIAMOND QUESTIONS NORTH WIND MY READERS will not wonder that , after this , I did my very best to gain the friendship of Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 17]: Nor did I find this at all difficult , the child was so ready to trust .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 17]: Upon one subject alone was he reticent -- the story of his relations with North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 16]: I fancy he could not quite make up his mind what to think of them .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 22]: At all events it was some little time before he trusted me with this , only then he told me everything .
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 44]: If I could not regard it all in exactly the same light as he did , I was , while guiltless of the least pretence , fully sympathetic , and he was satisfied without demanding of me any theory of difficult points involved .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 29]: I let him see plainly enough , that whatever might be the explanation of the marvellous experience , I would have given much for a similar one myself .
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 38]: On an evening soon after the thunderstorm , in a late twilight , with a half-moon high in the heavens , I came upon Diamond in the act of climbing by his little ladder into the beech-tree .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 13]: `` What are you always going up there for , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 11]: I heard Nanny ask , rather rudely , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 22]: `` Sometimes for one thing , sometimes for another , Nanny , '' answered Diamond , looking skywards as he climbed .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 13]: `` You 'll break your neck some day , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 21]: `` I 'm going up to look at the moon to-night , '' he added , without heeding her remark .
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 16]: `` You 'll see the moon just as well down here , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 8]: `` I do n't think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 12]: `` You 'll be no nearer to her up there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 3]: I shall .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 9]: I must be nearer her , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 17]: I wish I could dream as pretty dreams about her as you can , Nanny . ''
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 4]: `` You silly !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 8]: you never have done about that dream .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 18]: I never dreamed but that one , and it was nonsense enough , I 'm sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 6]: `` It was n't nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 17]: It was a beautiful dream -- and a funny one too , both in one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 22]: `` But what 's the good of talking about it that way , when you know it was only a dream ?
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 6]: Dreams ai n't true . ''
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 8]: `` That one was true , Nanny .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 5]: You know it was .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 16]: Did n't you come to grief for doing what you were told not to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 7]: And is n't that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 21]: `` I ca n't get any sense into him , '' exclaimed Nanny , with an expression of mild despair .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 32]: `` Do you really believe , Diamond , that there 's a house in the moon , with a beautiful lady and a crooked old man and dusters in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 24]: `` If there is n't , there 's something better , '' he answered , and vanished in the leaves over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 14]: I went into the house , where I visited often in the evenings .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 34]: When I came out , there was a little wind blowing , very pleasant after the heat of the day , for although it was late summer now , it was still hot .
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 8]: The tree-tops were swinging about in it .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 25]: I took my way past the beech , and called up to see if Diamond were still in his nest in its rocking head .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 8]: `` Are you there , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 13]: `` Yes , sir , '' came his clear voice in reply .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 15]: `` Is n't it growing too dark for you to get down safely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 14]: `` Oh , no , sir -- if I take time to it .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 25]: I know my way so well , and never let go with one hand till I 've a good hold with the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 23]: `` Do be careful , '' I insisted -- foolishly , seeing the boy was as careful as he could be already .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 9]: `` I 'm coming , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 12]: `` I 've got all the moon I want to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 12]: I heard a rustling and a rustling drawing nearer and nearer .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 17]: Three or four minutes elapsed , and he appeared at length creeping down his little ladder .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 14]: I took him in my arms , and set him on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 10]: `` Thank you , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 15]: `` That 's the north wind blowing , is n't it , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 10]: `` I ca n't tell , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 14]: `` It feels cool and kind , and I think it may be .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 27]: But I could n't be sure except it were stronger , for a gentle wind might turn any way amongst the trunks of the trees . ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 17]: `` I shall know when I get up to my own room , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 10]: `` I think I hear my mistress 's bell .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 5]: Good-night , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 11]: He ran to the house , and I went home .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 30]: His mistress had rung for him only to send him to bed , for she was very careful over him and I daresay thought he was not looking well .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 34]: When he reached his own room , he opened both his windows , one of which looked to the north and the other to the east , to find how the wind blew .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 9]: It blew right in at the northern window .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 31]: Diamond was very glad , for he thought perhaps North Wind herself would come now : a real north wind had never blown all the time since he left London .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 40]: But , as she always came of herself , and never when he was looking for her , and indeed almost never when he was thinking of her , he shut the east window , and went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 52]: Perhaps some of my readers may wonder that he could go to sleep with such an expectation ; and , indeed , if I had not known him , I should have wondered at it myself ; but it was one of his peculiarities , and seemed nothing strange in him .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 27]: He was so full of quietness that he could go to sleep almost any time , if he only composed himself and let the sleep come .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: This time he went fast asleep as usual .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 9]: But he woke in the dim blue night .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 5]: The moon had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 10]: He thought he heard a knocking at his door .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 22]: `` Somebody wants me , '' he said to himself , and jumping out of bed , ran to open it .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 7]: But there was no one there .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 22]: He closed it again , and , the noise still continuing , found that another door in the room was rattling .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 19]: It belonged to a closet , he thought , but he had never been able to open it .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 12]: The wind blowing in at the window must be shaking it .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 10]: He would go and see if it was so .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 23]: The door now opened quite easily , but to his surprise , instead of a closet he found a long narrow room .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 21]: The moon , which was sinking in the west , shone in at an open window at the further end .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 23]: The room was low with a coved ceiling , and occupied the whole top of the house , immediately under the roof .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 5]: It was quite empty .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 12]: The yellow light of the half-moon streamed over the dark floor .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 34]: He was so delighted at the discovery of the strange , desolate , moonlit place close to his own snug little room , that he began to dance and skip about the floor .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 34]: The wind came in through the door he had left open , and blew about him as he danced , and he kept turning towards it that it might blow in his face .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 34]: He kept picturing to himself the many places , lovely and desolate , the hill-sides and farm-yards and tree-tops and meadows , over which it had blown on its way to The Mound .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 48]: And as he danced , he grew more and more delighted with the motion and the wind ; his feet grew stronger , and his body lighter , until at length it seemed as if he were borne up on the air , and could almost fly .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 41]: So strong did his feeling become , that at last he began to doubt whether he was not in one of those precious dreams he had so often had , in which he floated about on the air at will .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 75]: But something made him look up , and to his unspeakable delight , he found his uplifted hands lying in those of North Wind , who was dancing with him , round and round the long bare room , her hair now falling to the floor , now filling the arched ceiling , her eyes shining on him like thinking stars , and the sweetest of grand smiles playing breezily about her beautiful mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 17]: She was , as so often before , of the height of a rather tall lady .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 19]: She did not stoop in order to dance with him , but held his hands high in hers .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 27]: When he saw her , he gave one spring , and his arms were about her neck , and her arms holding him to her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 44]: The same moment she swept with him through the open window in at which the moon was shining , made a circuit like a bird about to alight , and settled with him in his nest on the top of the great beech-tree .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 36]: There she placed him on her lap and began to hush him as if he were her own baby , and Diamond was so entirely happy that he did not care to speak a word .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 35]: At length , however , he found that he was going to sleep , and that would be to lose so much , that , pleasant as it was , he could not consent .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 25]: `` Please , dear North Wind , '' he said , `` I am so happy that I 'm afraid it 's a dream .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 13]: How am I to know that it 's not a dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 7]: `` What does it matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 4]: returned North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 9]: `` I should , cry '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 7]: `` But why should you cry ?
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 19]: The dream , if it is a dream , is a pleasant one -- is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 13]: `` That 's just why I want it to be true . ''
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 14]: `` Have you forgotten what you said to Nanny about her dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 64]: `` It 's not for the dream itself -- I mean , it 's not for the pleasure of it , '' answered Diamond , `` for I have that , whether it be a dream or not ; it 's for you , North Wind ; I ca n't bear to find it a dream , because then I should lose you .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 13]: You would be nobody then , and I could not bear that .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 13]: You ai n't a dream , are you , dear North Wind ?
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 21]: Do say No , else I shall cry , and come awake , and you 'll be gone for ever .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 15]: I dare n't dream about you once again if you ai n't anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 35]: `` I 'm either not a dream , or there 's something better that 's not a dream , Diamond , '' said North Wind , in a rather sorrowful tone , he thought .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 28]: `` But it 's not something better -- it 's you I want , North Wind , '' he persisted , already beginning to cry a little .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 33]: She made no answer , but rose with him in her arms and sailed away over the tree-tops till they came to a meadow , where a flock of sheep was feeding .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 31]: `` Do you remember what the song you were singing a week ago says about Bo-Peep -- how she lost her sheep , but got twice as many lambs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 19]: asked North Wind , sitting down on the grass , and placing him in her lap as before .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 25]: `` Oh yes , I do , well enough , '' answered Diamond ; `` but I never just quite liked that rhyme . ''
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 7]: `` Why not , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 25]: `` Because it seems to say one 's as good as another , or two new ones are better than one that 's lost .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 42]: I 've been thinking about it a great deal , and it seems to me that although any one sixpence is as good as any other sixpence , not twenty lambs would do instead of one sheep whose face you knew .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 30]: Somehow , when once you 've looked into anybody 's eyes , right deep down into them , I mean , nobody will do for that one any more .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 20]: Nobody , ever so beautiful or so good , will make up for that one going out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 29]: So you see , North Wind , I ca n't help being frightened to think that perhaps I am only dreaming , and you are nowhere at all .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 16]: Do tell me that you are my own , real , beautiful North Wind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 36]: Again she rose , and shot herself into the air , as if uneasy because she could not answer him ; and Diamond lay quiet in her arms , waiting for what she would say .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 50]: He tried to see up into her face , for he was dreadfully afraid she was not answering him because she could not say that she was not a dream ; but she had let her hair fall all over her face so that he could not see it .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 6]: This frightened him still more .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 13]: `` Do speak , North Wind , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 15]: `` I never speak when I have nothing to say , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 21]: `` Then I do think you must be a real North Wind , and no dream , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 14]: `` But I 'm looking for something to say all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 15]: `` But I do n't want you to say what 's hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 39]: If you were to say one word to comfort me that was n't true , then I should know you must be a dream , for a great beautiful lady like you could never tell a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 31]: `` But she might n't know how to say what she had to say , so that a little boy like you would understand it , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 20]: `` Here , let us get down again , and I will try to tell you what I think .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 15]: You mus n't suppose I am able to answer all your questions , though .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 16]: There are a great many things I do n't understand more than you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 16]: She descended on a grassy hillock , in the midst of a wild furzy common .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 44]: There was a rabbit-warren underneath , and some of the rabbits came out of their holes , in the moonlight , looking very sober and wise , just like patriarchs standing in their tent-doors , and looking about them before going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 44]: When they saw North Wind , instead of turning round and vanishing again with a thump of their heels , they cantered slowly up to her and snuffled all about her with their long upper lips , which moved every way at once .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 37]: That was their way of kissing her ; and , as she talked to Diamond , she would every now and then stroke down their furry backs , or lift and play with their long ears .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 19]: They would , Diamond thought , have leaped upon her lap , but that he was there already .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 38]: `` I think , '' said she , after they had been sitting silent for a while , `` that if I were only a dream , you would not have been able to love me so .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 15]: You love me when you are not with me , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 13]: `` Indeed I do , '' answered Diamond , stroking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 4]: `` I see !
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 3]: I see !
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 22]: How could I be able to love you as I do if you were n't there at all , you know ?
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 41]: Besides , I could n't be able to dream anything half so beautiful all out of my own head ; or if I did , I could n't love a fancy of my own like that , could I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 34]: You might have loved me in a dream , dreamily , and forgotten me when you woke , I daresay , but not loved me like a real being as you love me .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 20]: Even then , I do n't think you could dream anything that had n't something real like it somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 24]: But you 've seen me in many shapes , Diamond : you remember I was a wolf once -- do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 15]: `` Oh yes -- a good wolf that frightened a naughty drunken nurse . ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 21]: `` Well , suppose I were to turn ugly , would you rather I were n't a dream then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 16]: `` Yes ; for I should know that you were beautiful inside all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 14]: You would love me , and I should love you all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 12]: I should n't like you to look ugly , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 10]: But I should n't believe it a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 8]: `` Not if you saw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 13]: `` No , not if I saw it ever so plain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 6]: `` There 's my Diamond !
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 11]: I will tell you all I know about it then .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 14]: I do n't think I am just what you fancy me to be .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 11]: I have to shape myself various ways to various people .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 8]: But the heart of me is true .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 15]: People call me by dreadful names , and think they know all about me .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 5]: But they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 31]: Sometimes they call me Bad Fortune , sometimes Evil Chance , sometimes Ruin ; and they have another name for me which they think the most dreadful of all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 9]: asked Diamond , smiling up in her face .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 9]: `` I wo n't tell you that name .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 18]: Do you remember having to go through me to get into the country at my back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 7]: `` Oh yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 8]: How cold you were , North Wind !
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 10]: and so white , all but your lovely eyes !
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 18]: My heart grew like a lump of ice , and then I forgot for a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 12]: `` You were very near knowing what they call me then .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 16]: Would you be afraid of me if you had to go through me again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 4]: Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 23]: Indeed I should be glad enough , if it was only to get another peep of the country at your back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 9]: `` You 've never seen it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 8]: `` Have n't I , North Wind ?
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 5]: I 'm so sorry !
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 5]: I thought I had .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 7]: What did I see then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 7]: `` Only a picture of it .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 16]: The real country at my real back is ever so much more beautiful than that .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 13]: You shall see it one day -- perhaps before very long . ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 8]: `` Do they sing songs there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 20]: `` Do n't you remember the dream you had about the little boys that dug for the stars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 7]: `` Yes , that I do .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 19]: I thought you must have had something to do with that dream , it was so beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 10]: `` Yes ; I gave you that dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 3]: thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 16]: Did you give Nanny her dream too -- about the moon and the bees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 14]: I was the lady that sat at the window of the moon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 6]: `` Oh , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 13]: I was almost sure you had something to do with that too .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 14]: And did you tell Mr. Raymond the story about the Princess Daylight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 11]: `` I believe I had something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 15]: At all events he thought about it one night when he could n't sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 21]: But I want to ask you whether you remember the song the boy-angels sang in that dream of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 17]: I could n't keep it , do what I would , and I did try . ''
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 7]: `` That was my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 10]: `` How could that be , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 20]: `` Because I did n't know it properly myself , and so I could n't teach it to you .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 32]: I could only make a rough guess at something like what it would be , and so I was n't able to make you dream it hard enough to remember it .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 16]: Nor would I have done so if I could , for it was not correct .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 10]: I made you dream pictures of it , though .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 46]: But you will hear the very song itself when you do get to the back of -- '' `` My own dear North Wind , '' said Diamond , finishing the sentence for her , and kissing the arm that held him leaning against her .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 21]: `` And now we 've settled all this -- for the time , at least , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 14]: `` But I ca n't feel quite sure yet , '' said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 9]: `` You must wait a while for that .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 14]: Meantime you may be hopeful , and content not to be quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 22]: Come now , I will take you home again , for it wo n't do to tire you too much . ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 7]: `` Oh , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 11]: I 'm not the least tired , '' pleaded Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 8]: `` It is better , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 16]: `` Very well ; if you wish it , '' yielded Diamond with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 13]: `` You are a dear good , boy '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 18]: `` I will come for you again to-morrow night and take you out for a longer time .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 35]: We shall make a little journey together , in fact , we shall start earlier , and as the moon will be later , we shall have a little moonlight all the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 12]: She rose , and swept over the meadow and the trees .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 10]: In a few moments the Mound appeared below them .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 16]: She sank a little , and floated in at the window of Diamond 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 24]: There she laid him on his bed , covered him over , and in a moment he was lapt in a dreamless sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 40]: ONCE MORE THE next night Diamond was seated by his open window , with his head on his hand , rather tired , but so eagerly waiting for the promised visit that he was afraid he could not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 14]: But he started suddenly , and found that he had been already asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 16]: He rose , and looking out of the window saw something white against his beech-tree .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 5]: It was North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 11]: She was holding by one hand to a top branch .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 25]: Her hair and her garments went floating away behind her over the tree , whose top was swaying about while the others were still .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 8]: `` Are you ready , Diamond ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' answered Diamond , `` quite ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 18]: In a moment she was at the window , and her arms came in and took him .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 29]: She sailed away so swiftly that he could at first mark nothing but the speed with which the clouds above and the dim earth below went rushing past .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 36]: But soon he began to see that the sky was very lovely , with mottled clouds all about the moon , on which she threw faint colours like those of mother-of-pearl , or an opal .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 36]: The night was warm , and in the lady 's arms he did not feel the wind which down below was making waves in the ripe corn , and ripples on the rivers and lakes .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 27]: At length they descended on the side of an open earthy hill , just where , from beneath a stone , a spring came bubbling out .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 17]: `` I am going to take you along this little brook , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 19]: `` I am not wanted for anything else to-night , so I can give you a treat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 29]: She stooped over the stream and holding Diamond down close to the surface of it , glided along level with its flow as it ran down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 23]: And the song of the brook came up into Diamond 's ears , and grew and grew and changed with every turn .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 15]: It seemed to Diamond to be singing the story of its life to him .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 5]: And so it was .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 18]: It began with a musical tinkle which changed to a babble and then to a gentle rushing .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 24]: Sometimes its song would almost cease , and then break out again , tinkle , babble , and rush , all at once .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 25]: At the bottom of the hill they came to a small river , into which the brook flowed with a muffled but merry sound .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 79]: Along the surface of the river , darkly clear below them in the moonlight , they floated ; now , where it widened out into a little lake , they would hover for a moment over a bed of water-lilies , and watch them swing about , folded in sleep , as the water on which they leaned swayed in the presence of North Wind ; and now they would watch the fishes asleep among their roots below .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 24]: Sometimes she would hold Diamond over a deep hollow curving into the bank , that he might look far into the cool stillness .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 12]: Sometimes she would leave the river and sweep across a clover-field .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 13]: The bees were all at home , and the clover was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 9]: Then she would return and follow the river .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 9]: It grew wider and wider as it went .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 78]: Now the armies of wheat and of oats would hang over its rush from the opposite banks ; now the willows would dip low branches in its still waters ; and now it would lead them through stately trees and grassy banks into a lovely garden , where the roses and lilies were asleep , the tender flowers quite folded up , and only a few wide-awake and sending out their life in sweet , strong odours .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 30]: Wider and wider grew the stream , until they came upon boats lying along its banks , which rocked a little in the flutter of North Wind 's garments .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 65]: Then came houses on the banks , each standing in a lovely lawn , with grand trees ; and in parts the river was so high that some of the grass and the roots of some of the trees were under water , and Diamond , as they glided through between the stems , could see the grass at the bottom of the water .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 34]: Then they would leave the river and float about and over the houses , one after another -- beautiful rich houses , which , like fine trees , had taken centuries to grow .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 26]: There was scarcely a light to be seen , and not a movement to be heard : all the people in them lay fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 12]: `` What a lot of dreams they must be dreaming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' returned North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 13]: `` They ca n't surely be all lies -- can they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 17]: `` I should think it depends a little on who dreams them , '' suggested Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 18]: `` The people who think lies , and do lies , are very likely to dream lies .
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 17]: But the people who love what is true will surely now and then dream true things .
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 25]: But then something depends on whether the dreams are home-grown , or whether the seed of them is blown over somebody else 's garden-wall .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 10]: there 's some one awake in this house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 13]: They were floating past a window in which a light was burning .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 15]: Diamond heard a moan , and looked up anxiously in North Wind 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 11]: `` It 's a lady , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 9]: `` She ca n't sleep for pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 10]: `` Could n't you do something for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 7]: `` No , I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 5]: But you could . ''
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 7]: `` What could I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 9]: `` Sing a little song to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 8]: `` She would n't hear me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 15]: `` I will take you in , and then she will hear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 11]: `` But that would be rude , would n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 21]: You can go where you please , of course , but I should have no business in her room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 8]: `` You may trust me , Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 13]: I shall take as good care of the lady as of you .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 5]: The window is open .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 3]: Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 23]: By a shaded lamp , a lady was seated in a white wrapper , trying to read , but moaning every minute .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 18]: North Wind floated behind her chair , set Diamond down , and told him to sing something .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 45]: He was a little frightened , but he thought a while , and then sang : -- The sun is gone down , And the moon 's in the sky ; But the sun will come up , And the moon be laid by .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 21]: The flower is asleep But it is not dead ; When the morning shines , It will lift its head .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 23]: When winter comes , It will die -- no , no ; It will only hide From the frost and the snow .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 20]: Sure is the summer , Sure is the sun ; The night and the winter Are shadows that run .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 17]: The lady never lifted her eyes from her book , or her head from her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 16]: As soon as Diamond had finished , North Wind lifted him and carried him away .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 9]: `` Did n't the lady hear me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 12]: asked Diamond when they were once more floating down the river .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 14]: `` Oh , yes , she heard you , '' answered North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 7]: `` Was she frightened then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 6]: `` Oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 13]: `` Why did n't she look to see who it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 10]: `` She did n't know you were there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 9]: `` How could she hear me then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 11]: `` She did n't hear you with her ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 9]: `` What did she hear me with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 6]: `` With her heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 11]: `` Where did she think the words came from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 13]: `` She thought they came out of the book she was reading .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 23]: She will search all through it to-morrow to find them , and wo n't be able to understand it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 7]: `` Oh , what fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 3]: said Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 7]: `` What will she do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 34]: `` I can tell you what she wo n't do : she 'll never forget the meaning of them ; and she 'll never be able to remember the words of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 21]: `` If she sees them in Mr. Raymond 's book , it will puzzle her , wo n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 7]: `` Yes , that it will .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 10]: She will never be able to understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 16]: `` Until she gets to the back of the north wind , '' suggested Diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 17]: `` Until she gets to the back of the north wind , '' assented the lady .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 11]: cried Diamond , `` I know now where we are .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 20]: do let me go into the old garden , and into mother 's room , and Diamond 's stall .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 14]: I wonder if the hole is at the back of my bed still .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 13]: I should like to stay there all the rest of the night .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 19]: It wo n't take you long to get home from here , will it , North Wind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 18]: `` No , '' she answered ; `` you shall stay as long as you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 31]: `` Oh , how jolly , '' cried Diamond , as North Wind sailed over the house with him , and set him down on the lawn at the back .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 13]: Diamond ran about the lawn for a little while in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 24]: He found part of it cut up into flower-beds , and the little summer-house with the coloured glass and the great elm-tree gone .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 12]: He did not like this , and ran into the stable .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 8]: There were no horses there at all .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 4]: He ran upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 5]: The rooms were empty .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 33]: The only thing left that he cared about was the hole in the wall where his little bed had stood ; and that was not enough to make him wish to stop .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 13]: He ran down the stair again , and out upon the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 10]: There he threw himself down and began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 8]: It was all so dreary and lost !
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 27]: `` I thought I liked the place so much , '' said Diamond to himself , `` but I find I do n't care about it .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 36]: I suppose it 's only the people in it that make you like a place , and when they 're gone , it 's dead , and you do n't care a bit about it .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 20]: North Wind told me I might stop as long as I liked , and I 've stopped longer already .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 4]: North Wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 11]: he cried aloud , turning his face towards the sky .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 15]: The moon was under a cloud , and all was looking dull and dismal .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 15]: A star shot from the sky , and fell in the grass beside him .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 10]: The moment it lighted , there stood North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 13]: cried Diamond , joyfully , `` were you the shooting star ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 7]: `` Yes , my child . ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 10]: `` Did you hear me call you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 8]: `` So high up as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 10]: `` Yes ; I heard you quite well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 7]: `` Do take me home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 12]: `` Have you had enough of your old home already ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 7]: `` Yes , more than enough .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 10]: It is n't a home at all now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 13]: `` I thought that would be it , '' said North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 31]: `` Everything , dreaming and all , has got a soul in it , or else it 's worth nothing , and we do n't care a bit about it .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 17]: Some of our thoughts are worth nothing , because they 've got no soul in them .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 16]: The brain puts them into the mind , not the mind into the brain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 12]: `` But how can you know about that , North Wind ?
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 8]: You have n't got a body . ''
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 13]: `` If I had n't you would n't know anything about me .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 12]: No creature can know another without the help of a body .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 10]: But I do n't care to talk about that .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 10]: It is time for you to go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 12]: So saying , North Wind lifted Diamond and bore him away .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 32]: AT THE BACK OF THE NORTH WIND I DID not see Diamond for a week or so after this , and then he told me what I have now told you .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 37]: I should have been astonished at his being able even to report such conversations as he said he had had with North Wind , had I not known already that some children are profound in metaphysics .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 51]: But a fear crosses me , lest , by telling so much about my friend , I should lead people to mistake him for one of those consequential , priggish little monsters , who are always trying to say clever things , and looking to see whether people appreciate them .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 33]: When a child like that dies , instead of having a silly book written about him , he should be stuffed like one of those awful big-headed fishes you see in museums .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 13]: But Diamond never troubled his head about what people thought of him .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 10]: He never set up for knowing better than others .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 21]: The wisest things he said came out when he wanted one to help him with some difficulty he was in .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 15]: He was not even offended with Nanny and Jim for calling him a silly .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 16]: He supposed there was something in it , though he could not quite understand what .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 24]: I suspect however that the other name they gave him , God 's Baby , had some share in reconciling him to it .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 59]: Happily for me , I was as much interested in metaphysics as Diamond himself , and therefore , while he recounted his conversations with North Wind , I did not find myself at all in a strange sea , although certainly I could not always feel the bottom , being indeed convinced that the bottom was miles away .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 14]: `` Could it be all dreaming , do you think , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 4]: he asked anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 12]: `` I dare n't say , Diamond , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 32]: `` But at least there is one thing you may be sure of , that there is a still better love than that of the wonderful being you call North Wind .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 23]: Even if she be a dream , the dream of such a beautiful creature could not come to you by chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 15]: `` Yes , I know , '' returned Diamond ; `` I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 16]: Then he was silent , but , I confess , appeared more thoughtful than satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 13]: The next time I saw him , he looked paler than usual .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 9]: `` Have you seen your friend again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' he answered , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 10]: `` Did she take you out with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 7]: She did not speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 59]: I woke all at once , as I generally do when I am going to see her , and there she was against the door into the big room , sitting just as I saw her sit on her own doorstep , as white as snow , and her eyes as blue as the heart of an iceberg .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 12]: She looked at me , but never moved or spoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 7]: `` Were n't you afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 7]: Why should I have been ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 3]: he answered .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 9]: `` I only felt a little cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 7]: `` Did she stay long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 5]: I fell asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 18]: I think I have been rather cold ever since though , '' he added with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 12]: I did not quite like this , but I said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 11]: Four days after , I called again at the Mound .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 14]: The maid who opened the door looked grave , but I suspected nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 14]: When I reached the drawing-room , I saw Mrs. Raymond had been crying .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 7]: `` Have n't you heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 8]: she said , seeing my questioning looks .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 10]: `` I 've heard nothing , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 31]: `` This morning we found our dear little Diamond lying on the floor of the big attic-room , just outside his own door -- fast asleep , as we thought .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 15]: But when we took him up , we did not think he was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 14]: We saw that -- '' Here the kind-hearted lady broke out crying afresh .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 9]: `` May I go and see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 13]: `` You know your way to the top of the tower . ''
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 12]: I walked up the winding stair , and entered his room .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 19]: A lovely figure , as white and almost as clear as alabaster , was lying on the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 8]: I saw at once how it was .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 6]: They thought he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 14]: I knew that he had gone to the back of the north wind .
