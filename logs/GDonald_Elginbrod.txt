Parsing [sent. 11 len. 7]: -- Prologue to the Canterbury Tales .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 3]: CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 3]: THE FIR-WOOD .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 27]: Of all the flowers in the mead , Then love I roost these flowers white and rede , Such that men callen daisies in our town .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 52]: I renne blithe As soon as ever the sun ginneth west , To see this flower , how it will go to rest , For fear of night , so hateth she darkness ; Her cheer is plainly spread in the brightness Of the sunne , for there it will unclose .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 10]: CHAUCER -- Prologue to the Legend of Good Women .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 3]: `` Meg !
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 13]: whaur are ye gaein ' that get , like a wull shuttle ?
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 7]: Come in to the beuk . ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 30]: Meg 's mother stood at the cottage door , with arms akimbo and clouded brow , calling through the boles of a little forest of fir-trees after her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 47]: One would naturally presume that the phrase she employed , comparing her daughter 's motions to those of a shuttle that had `` gane wull , '' or lost its way , implied that she was watching her as she threaded her way through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 56]: But although she could not see her , the fir-wood was certainly the likeliest place for her daughter to be in ; and the figure she employed was not in the least inapplicable to Meg 's usual mode of wandering through the trees , that operation being commonly performed in the most erratic manner possible .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 18]: It was the ordinary occupation of the first hour of almost every day of Margaret 's life .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 22]: As soon as she woke in the morning , the fir-wood drew her towards it , and she rose and went .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 45]: Through its crowd of slender pillars , she strayed hither and thither , in an aimless manner , as if resignedly haunting the neighbourhood of something she had lost , or , hopefully , that of a treasure she expected one day to find .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 78]: It did not seem that she had heard her mother 's call , for no response followed ; and Janet Elginbrod returned into the cottage , where David of the same surname , who was already seated at the white deal table with `` the beuk , '' or large family bible before him , straightway commenced reading a chapter in the usual routine from the Old Testament , the New being reserved for the evening devotions .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 57]: The chapter was the fortieth of the prophet Isaiah ; and as the voice of the reader re-uttered the words of old inspiration , one might have thought that it was the voice of the ancient prophet himself , pouring forth the expression of his own faith in his expostulations with the unbelief of his brethren .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 102]: The chapter finished -- it is none of the shortest , and Meg had not yet returned -- the two knelt , and David prayed thus : `` O Thou who holdest the waters in the hollow of ae han ' , and carriest the lambs o ' thy own making in thy bosom with the other han ' , it would be altogether unworthy o ' thee , and o ' thy Maijesty o ' love , to require o ' us that which thou knowest we can not bring unto thee , until thou enrich us with that same .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 52]: Therefore , like thine own bairns , we boo doon afore thee , an ' pray that thou wouldst tak ' thy wull o ' us , thy holy an ' perfect an ' blessed wull o ' us ; for , O God , we are a ' thine ain .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 65]: An ' for oor lassie , wha 's oot amo ' thy trees , an ' wha ' we dinna think forgets her Maker , though she may whiles forget her prayers , Lord , keep her a bonnie lassie in thy sicht , as white and clean in thy een as she is fair an ' halesome in oors ; an ' oh !
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 15]: we thank thee , Father in heaven , for giein ' her to us .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 130]: An ' noo , for a ' oor wrang-duins an ' ill-min ` ins , for a ' oor sins and trespasses o ' mony sorts , dinna forget them , O God , till thou pits them a ' richt , an ' syne exerceese thy michty power e ` en ower thine ain sel , an ' clean forget them a ` thegither ; cast them ahint thy back , whaur e ` en thine ain een shall ne'er see them again , that we may walk bold an ' upricht afore thee for evermore , an ' see the face o ' Him wha was as muckle God in doin ' thy biddin ' , as gin he had been ordering ' a ' thing Himsel .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 7]: For his sake , Ahmen . ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 18]: I hope my readers will not suppose that I give this as a specimen of Scotch prayers .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 6]: I know better than that .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 13]: David was an unusual man , and his prayers were unusual prayers .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 30]: The present was a little more so in its style , from the fact that one of the subjects of it was absent , a circumstance that rarely happened .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 27]: But the degree of difference was too small to be detected by any but those who were quite accustomed to his forms of thought and expression .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 32]: How much of it Janet understood or sympathized with , it is difficult to say ; for anything that could be called a thought rarely crossed the threshold of her utterance .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 78]: On this occasion , the moment the prayer was ended , she rose from her knees , smoothed down her check apron , and went to the door ; where , shading her eyes from the sun with her hand , she peered from under its penthouse into the fir-wood , and said in a voice softened apparently by the exercise in which she had taken a silent share , `` Whaur can the lassie be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 6]: And where was the lassie ?
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 80]: In the fir-wood , to be sure , with the thousand shadows , and the sunlight through it all ; for at this moment the light fell upon her far in its depths , and revealed her hastening towards the cottage in as straight a line as the trees would permit , now blotted out by a crossing shadow , and anon radiant in the sunlight , appearing and vanishing as she threaded the upright warp of the fir-wood .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 85]: It was morning all around her ; and one might see that it was morning within her too , as , emerging at last in the small open space around the cottage , Margaret -- I can not call her Meg , although her mother does -- her father always called her `` Maggy , my doo , '' Anglicé , dove -- Margaret approached her mother with a bright healthful face , and the least possible expression of uneasiness on her fair forehead .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 8]: She carried a book in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 28]: `` What gars ye gang stravaguin ' that get , Meg , whan ye ken weel eneuch ye sud a ' been in to worship lang syne ?
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 18]: An sae we maun hae worship our lanes for want o ' you , ye hizzy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 34]: `` I didna ken it was sae late , mither , '' replied Margaret , in a submissive tone , musical in spite of the rugged dialect into which the sounds were fashioned .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 4]: `` Nae dout !
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 15]: Ye had yer brakfast , an ' ye warna that hungry for the word .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 22]: But here comes yer father , and ye 'll no mend for his flytin ' , I ` se promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 3]: `` Hoots !
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 10]: lat the bairn alane , Janet , my woman .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 11]: The word 'll be mair to her afore lang . ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 13]: `` I wat she has a word o ' her nain there .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 9]: What beuk hae ye gotten there , Meg ?
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 7]: Whaur got ye ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 32]: Had it not been for the handsome binding of the book in her daughter 's hand , it would neither have caught the eye , nor roused the suspicions of Janet .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 34]: David glanced at the book in his turn , and a faint expression of surprise , embodied chiefly in the opening of his eyelids a little wider than usual , crossed his face .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 36]: But he only said with a smile : `` I didna ken that the tree o ' knowledge , wi ' sic fair fruit , grew in our wud , Maggy , my doo . ''
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 8]: `` Whaur gat ye the beuk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 3]: reiterated Janet .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 39]: Margaret 's face was by this time the colour of the crimson boards of the volume in her hand , but she replied at once : `` I got it frae Maister Sutherlan ' , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 20]: Janet 's first response was an inverted whistle ; her next , another question : `` Maister Sutherlan ' !
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 8]: wha 's that o ` t ? ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 6]: `` Hoot , lass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 9]: interposed David , `` ye ken weel aneuch .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 26]: It 's the new tutor lad , up at the hoose ; a fine , douce , honest chield , an ' weel-faured , forby .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 10]: Lat 's see the bit beuky , lassie . ''
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 7]: Margaret handed it to her father .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: `` Col-e-ridge 's Poems , '' read David , with some difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 11]: `` Tak ' it hame direckly , '' said Janet .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 51]: `` Na , na , '' said David ; `` a ' the apples o ' the tree o ' knowledge are no stappit wi sut an stew ; an ' gin this ane be , she 'll sune ken by the taste o ' t what 's comin ' .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 21]: It 's no muckle o ' an ill beuk ` at ye 'll read , Maggy , my doo . ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 7]: `` Guid preserve 's , man !
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 11]: I 'm no sayin ' it 's an ill beuk .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 25]: But it 's no richt to mak appintments wi ' stranger lads i ' the wud sae ear ' i ' the mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 10]: Is ' t noo , yersel , Meg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 3]: `` Mither !
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 3]: mither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 22]: said Margaret , and her eyes flashed through the watery veil that tried to hide them , `` hoo can ye ?
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 15]: Ye ken yersel I had nae appintment wi ' him or ony man . ''
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 6]: `` Weel , weel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 76]: said Janet ; and , apparently either satisfied with or overcome by the emotion she had excited , she turned and went in to pursue her usual house-avocations ; while David , handing the book to his daughter , went away down the path that led from the cottage door , in the direction of a road to be seen at a little distance through the trees , which surrounded the cottage on all sides .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 60]: Margaret followed her mother into the cottage , and was soon as busy as she with her share of the duties of the household ; but it was a good many minutes before the cloud caused by her mother 's hasty words entirely disappeared from a forehead which might with especial justice be called the sky of her face .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 33]: Meantime David emerged upon the more open road , and bent his course , still through fir-trees , towards a house for whose sake alone the road seemed to have been constructed .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 7]: DAVID ELGINBROD AND THE NEW TUTOR .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 24]: Concord between our wit and will Where highest notes to godliness are raised , And lowest sink not down to jot of ill .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 7]: What Languetus taught Sir Philip Sidney .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 6]: THE ARCADIA -- Third Eclogue .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 13]: The House of Turriepuffit stood about a furlong from David 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 22]: It was the abode of the Laird , or landed proprietor , in whose employment David filled several offices ordinarily distinct .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 31]: The estate was a small one , and almost entirely farmed by the owner himself ; who , with David 's help , managed to turn it to good account .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 39]: Upon week-days , he appeared on horseback in a costume more fitted for following the plough ; but he did not work with his own hands ; and on Sundays was at once recognizable as a country gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 72]: David was his bailiff or grieve , to overlook the labourers on the estate ; his steward to pay them , and keep the farm accounts ; his head gardener -- for little labour was expended in that direction , there being only one lady , the mistress of the house , and she no patroness of useless flowers : David was in fact the laird 's general adviser and executor .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 102]: The laird 's family , besides the lady already mentioned , consisted only of two boys , of the ages of eleven and fourteen , whom he wished to enjoy the same privileges he had himself possessed , and to whom , therefore , he was giving a classical and mathematical education , in view of the University , by means of private tutors ; the last of whom -- for the changes were not few , seeing the salary was of the smallest -- was Hugh Sutherland , the young man concerning whom David Elginbrod has already given his opinion .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 82]: But notwithstanding the freedom he always granted his daughter , and his good opinion of Hugh as well , David could not help feeling a little anxious , in his walk along the road towards the house , as to what the apparent acquaintance between her and the new tutor might evolve ; but he got rid of all the difficulty , as far as he was concerned , by saying at last : `` What richt hae I to interfere ?
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 8]: even supposin ' I wanted to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 28]: But I can lippen weel to my bonny doo ; an ' for the rest , she maun tak ' her chance like the lave o 's .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 28]: An ' wha ' kens but it micht jist be stan ` in ' afore Him , i ' the very get that He meant to gang .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 20]: The Lord forgie me for speakin ' o ' chance , as gin I believed in ony sic havers .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 9]: There 's no fear o ' the lassie .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 11]: Gude mornin ' t ` ye , Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 26]: That 's a braw beuk o ' ballants ye gae the len ' o ' to my Maggy , this mornin ' , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 14]: Sutherland was just entering a side-door of the house when David accosted him .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 29]: He was not old enough to keep from blushing at David 's words ; but , having a good conscience , he was ready with a good answer .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 10]: `` It 's a good book , Mr. Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 13]: It will do her no harm , though it be ballads . ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 12]: `` I 'm in no dreed o ' that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 5]: Bairns maun hae ballants .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 24]: An ' , to tell the truth , sir , I 'm no muckle mair nor a bairn in that respeck mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 52]: In fac , this verra mornin ' , at the beuk , I jist thocht I was readin ' a gran ' godly ballant , an ' it soundet nane the waur for the notion o ` t. '' `` You should have been a poet yourself , Mr. Elginbrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 12]: `` Na , na ; I ken naething aboot yer poetry .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 25]: I hae read auld John Milton ower an ' ower , though I dinna believe the half o ` t ; but , oh !
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 25]: weel I like some o ' the bonny bitties at the en ' o ` t. '' `` Il Penseroso , for instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 9]: `` Is that hoo ye ca ` t ?
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 15]: I ke n't weel by the sicht , but hardly by the soun ' .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 18]: I aye missed the name o ` t , an ' took to the thing itsel ' .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 4]: Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 15]: -- I beg yer pardon , sir -- but its wonnerfu ' bonny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 21]: `` I 'll come in some evening , and we 'll have a chat about it , '' replied Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 10]: `` I must go to my work now . ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 14]: `` We 'll a ' be verra happy to see you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: Good mornin ' , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 5]: `` Good morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 72]: David went to the garden , where there was not much to be done in the way of education at this season of the year ; and Sutherland to the school-room , where he was busy , all the rest of the morning and part of the afternoon , with Caesar and Virgil , Algebra and Euclid ; food upon which intellectual babes are reared to the stature of college youths .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 24]: Sutherland was himself only a youth ; for he had gone early to college , and had not yet quite completed the curriculum .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 24]: He was now filling up with teaching , the recess between his third and his fourth winter at one of the Aberdeen Universities .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 24]: He was the son of an officer , belonging to the younger branch of a family of some historic distinction and considerable wealth .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 110]: This officer , though not far removed from the estate and title as well , had nothing to live upon but his half-pay ; for , to the disgust of his family , he had married a Welsh girl of ancient descent , in whose line the poverty must have been at least coeval with the history , to judge from the perfection of its development in the case of her father ; and his relations made this the excuse for quarrelling with him ; so relieving themselves from any obligations they might have been supposed to lie under , of rendering him assistance of some sort or other .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 25]: This , however , rather suited the temperament of Major Robert Sutherland , who was prouder in his poverty than they in their riches .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 26]: So he disowned them for ever , and accommodated himself , with the best grace in the world , to his yet more straitened circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 29]: He resolved , however , cost what it might in pinching and squeezing , to send his son to college before turning him out to shift for himself .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 101]: In this Mrs. Sutherland was ready to support him to the utmost ; and so they had managed to keep their boy at college for three sessions ; after the last of which , instead of returning home , as he had done on previous occasions , he had looked about him for a temporary engagement as tutor , and soon found the situation he now occupied in the family of William Glasford , Esq. , of Turriepuffit , where he intended to remain no longer than the commencement of the session , which would be his fourth and last .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 32]: To what he should afterwards devote himself he had by no means made up his mind , except that it must of necessity be hard work of some kind or other .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 13]: So he had at least the virtue of desiring to be independent .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 15]: His other goods and bads must come out in the course of the story .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 31]: His pupils were rather stupid and rather good-natured ; so that their temperament operated to confirm their intellectual condition , and to render the labour of teaching them considerably irksome .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 29]: But he did his work tolerably well , and was not so much interested in the result as to be pained at the moderate degree of his success .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 31]: At the time of which I write , however , the probability as to his success was scarcely ascertained , for he had been only a fortnight at the task .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 16]: It was the middle of the month of April , in a rather backward season .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 14]: The weather had been stormy , with frequent showers of sleet and snow .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 39]: Old winter was doing his best to hold young Spring back by the skirts of her garment , and very few of the wild flowers had yet ventured to look out of their warm beds in the mould .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 13]: Sutherland , therefore , had made but few discoveries in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 78]: Not that the weather would have kept him to the house , had he had any particular desire to go out ; but , like many other students , he had no predilection for objectless exertion , and preferred the choice of his own weather indoors , namely , from books and his own imaginings , to an encounter with the keen blasts of the North , charged as they often were with sharp bullets of hail .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 42]: When the sun did shine out between the showers , his cold glitter upon the pools of rain or melted snow , and on the wet evergreens and gravel walks , always drove him back from the window with a shiver .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 62]: The house , which was of very moderate size and comfort , stood in the midst of plantations , principally of Scotch firs and larches , some of the former old and of great growth , so that they had arrived at the true condition of the tree , which seems to require old age for the perfection of its idea .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 59]: There was very little to be seen from the windows except this wood , which , somewhat gloomy at almost any season , was at the present cheerless enough ; and Sutherland found it very dreary indeed , as exchanged for the wide view from his own home on the side of an open hill in the Highlands .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 34]: In the midst of circumstances so uninteresting , it is not to be wondered at , that the glimpse of a pretty maiden should , one morning , occasion him some welcome excitement .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 39]: Passing downstairs to breakfast , he observed the drawing-room door ajar , and looked in to see what sort of a room it was ; for so seldom was it used that he had never yet entered it .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 32]: There stood a young girl , peeping , with mingled curiosity and reverence , into a small gilt-leaved volume , which she had lifted from the table by which she stood .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 46]: He watched her for a moment with some interest ; when she , seeming to become mesmerically aware that she was not alone , looked up , blushed deeply , put down the book in confusion , and proceeded to dust some of the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 8]: It was his first sight of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 28]: Some of the neighbours were expected to dinner , and her aid was in requisition to get the grand room of the house prepared for the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 64]: He supposed her to belong to the household , till , one day , feeling compelled to go out for a stroll , he caught sight of her so occupied at the door of her father 's cottage , that he perceived at once that must be her home : she was , in fact , seated upon a stool , paring potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 27]: She saw him as well , and , apparently ashamed at the recollection of having been discovered idling in the drawing-room , rose and went in .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 48]: He had met David once or twice about the house , and , attracted by his appearance , had had some conversation with him ; but he did not know where he lived , nor that he was the father of the girl whom he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 6]: THE DAISY AND THE PRIMROSE .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 13]: Dear secret Greenness , nursed below Tempests and winds and winter nights !
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 17]: Vex not that but one sees thee grow ; That One made all these lesser lights .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 3]: HENRY VAUGHAN .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 18]: It was , of course , quite by accident that Sutherland had met Margaret in the fir-wood .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 59]: The wind had changed during the night , and swept all the clouds from the face of the sky ; and when he looked out in the morning , he saw the fir-tops waving in the sunlight , and heard the sound of a south-west wind sweeping through them with the tune of running waters in its course .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 30]: It is a well-practised ear that can tell whether the sound it hears be that of gently falling waters , or of wind flowing through the branches of firs .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 34]: Sutherland 's heart , reviving like a dormouse in its hole , began to be joyful at the sight of the genial motions of Nature , telling of warmth and blessedness at hand .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 25]: Some goal of life , vague but sure , seemed to glimmer through the appearances around him , and to stimulate him to action .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 13]: Be dressed in haste , and went out to meet the Spring .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 9]: He wandered into the heart of the wood .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 39]: The sunlight shone like a sunset upon the red trunks and boughs of the old fir-trees , but like the first sunrise of the world upon the new green fringes that edged the young shoots of the larches .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 54]: High up , hung the memorials of past summers in the rich brown tassels of the clustering cones ; while the ground under foot was dappled with sunshine on the fallen fir-needles , and the great fallen cones which had opened to scatter their autumnal seed , and now lay waiting for decay .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 41]: Overhead , the tops whence they had fallen , waved in the wind , as in welcome of the Spring , with that peculiar swinging motion which made the poets of the sixteenth century call them `` sailing pines . ''
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 34]: The wind blew cool , but not cold ; and was filled with a delicious odour from the earth , which Sutherland took as a sign that she was coming alive at last .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: And the Spring he went out to meet , met him .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 44]: For , first , at the foot of a tree , he spied a tiny primrose , peeping out of its rough , careful leaves ; and he wondered how , by any metamorphosis , such leaves could pass into such a flower .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 25]: Had he seen the mother of the next spring-messenger he was about to meet , the same thought would have returned in another form .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 78]: For , next , as he passed on with the primrose in his hand , thinking it was almost cruel to pluck it , the Spring met him , as if in her own shape , in the person of Margaret , whom he spied a little way off , leaning against the stem of a Scotch fir , and looking up to its top swaying overhead in the first billows of the outburst ocean of life .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 42]: He went up to her with some shyness ; for the presence of even a child-maiden was enough to make Sutherland shy -- partly from the fear of startling her shyness , as one feels when drawing near a couching fawn .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 32]: But she , when she heard his footsteps , dropped her eyes slowly from the tree-top , and , as if she were in her own sanctuary , waited his approach .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 47]: He said nothing at first , but offered her , instead of speech , the primrose he had just plucked , which she received with a smile of the eyes only , and the sweetest `` thank you , sir , '' he had ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 33]: But while she held the primrose in her hand , her eyes wandered to the book which , according to his custom , Sutherland had caught up as he left the house .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 65]: It was the only well-bound book in his possession ; and the eyes of Margaret , not yet tutored by experience , naturally expected an entrancing page within such beautiful boards ; for the gayest bindings she had seen , were those of a few old annuals up at the house -- and were they not full of the most lovely tales and pictures ?
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 27]: In this case , however , her expectation was not vain ; for the volume was , as I have already disclosed , Coleridge 's Poems .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 17]: Seeing her eyes fixed upon the book -- `` Would you like to read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 20]: `` If you please , sir , '' answered Margaret , her eyes brightening with the expectation of deliglit .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 8]: `` Are you fond of poetry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 4]: Her face fell .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 47]: The only poetry she knew was the Scotch Psalms and Paraphrases , and such last-century verses as formed the chief part of the selections in her school-books ; for this was a very retired parish , and the newer books had not yet reached its school .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 7]: She had hoped chiefly for tales .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 17]: `` I dinna ken much about poetry , '' she answered , trying to speak English .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 33]: `` There 's an old book o ' t on my father 's shelf ; but the letters o ' t are auld-fashioned , an ' I dinna care aboot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 17]: `` But this is quite easy to read , and very beautiful , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 16]: The girl 's eyes glistened for a moment , and this was all her reply .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 9]: `` Would you like to read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 12]: resumed Hugh , seeing no further answer was on the road .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 9]: She held out her hand towards the volume .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 54]: When he , in his turn , held the volume towards her hand , she almost snatched it from him , and ran towards the house , without a word of thanks or leave-taking -- whether from eagerness , or doubt of the propriety of accepting the offer , Hugh could not conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 18]: He stood for some moments looking after her , and then retraced his steps towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 50]: It would have been something , in the monotony of one of the most trying of positions , to meet one who snatched at the offered means of spiritual growth , even if that disciple had not been a lovely girl , with the woman waking in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 45]: He commenced the duties of the day with considerably more of energy than he had yet brought to bear on his uninteresting pupils ; and this energy did not flag before its effects upon the boys began to react in fresh impulse upon itself .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 3]: THE COTTAGE .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: O little Bethlem !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 9]: poor in walls , But rich in furniture .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 6]: JOHN MASON 'S Spiritual Songs .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 14]: There was one great alleviation to the various discomforts of Sutherland 's tutor-life .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 21]: It was , that , except during school-hours , he was expected to take no charge whatever of his pupils .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 23]: They ran wild all other times ; which was far better , in every way , both for them and for him .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 39]: Consequently , he was entirely his own master beyond the fixed margin of scholastic duties ; and he soon found that his absence , even from the table , was a matter of no interest to the family .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 32]: To be sure , it involved his own fasting till the next meal-time came round -- for the lady was quite a household martinet ; but that was his own concern .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 30]: That very evening , he made his way to David 's cottage , about the country supper-time , when he thought he should most likely find him at home .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 17]: It was a clear , still , moonlit night , with just an air of frost .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 36]: There was light enough for him to see that the cottage was very neat and tidy , looking , in the midst of its little forest , more like an English than a Scotch habitation .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 32]: He had had the advantage of a few months ' residence in a leafy region on the other side of the Tweed , and so was able to make the comparison .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 10]: But what a different leafage that was from this !
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 49]: That was soft , floating , billowy ; this hard , stiff , and straight-lined , interfering so little with the skeleton form , that it needed not to be put off in the wintry season of death , to make the trees in harmony with the landscape .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 23]: A light was burning in the cottage , visible through the inner curtain of muslin , and the outer one of frost .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 34]: As he approached the door , he heard the sound of a voice ; and from the even pitch of the tone , he concluded at once that its owner was reading aloud .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 29]: The measured cadence soon convinced him that it was verse that was being read ; and the voice was evidently that of David , and not of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 6]: He knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 15]: The voice ceased , chairs were pushed back , and a heavy step approached .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 6]: David opened the door himself .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 17]: Maister Sutherlan ' , '' said he , `` I thocht it micht aiblins be yersel .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 6]: Ye 're welcome , sir .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 5]: Come butt the hoose .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 22]: Our place is but sma ' , but ye 'll no min ' sitttin ' doon wi ' our ain sels .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 10]: Janet , ooman , this is Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 22]: Maggy , my doo , he 's a frien ' o ' yours , o ' a day auld , already .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 9]: Ye 're kindly welcome , Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 23]: I 'm sure it 's verra kin ' o ' you to come an ' see the like o ' huz . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 25]: As Hugh entered , he saw his own bright volume lying on the table , evidently that from which David had just been reading .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 48]: Margaret had already placed for him a cushioned arm-chair , the only comfortable one in the house ; and presently , the table being drawn back , they were all seated round the peat-fire on the hearth , the best sort for keeping feet warm at least .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 27]: On the crook , or hooked iron-chain suspended within the chimney , hung a three-footed pot , in which potatoes were boiling away merrily for supper .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 48]: By the side of the wide chimney , or more properly lum , hung an iron lamp , of an old classical form common to the country , from the beak of which projected , almost horizontally , the lighted wick -- the pith of a rush .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 18]: The light perched upon it was small but clear , and by it David had been reading .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 16]: Margaret sat right under it , upon a creepie , or small three-legged wooden stool .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 22]: Sitting thus , with the light falling on her from above , Hugh could not help thinking she looked very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 37]: Almost the only object in the distance from which the feeble light was reflected , was the patch-work counterpane of a little bed filling a recess in the wall , fitted with doors which stood open .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 10]: It was probably Margaret 's refuge for the night .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 55]: `` Well , '' said the tutor , after they had been seated a few minutes , and had had some talk about the weather -- surely no despicable subject after such a morning -- the first of Spring -- `` well , how do you like the English poet , Mr. Elginbrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 31]: `` Spier that at me this day week , Maister Sutherlan ' , an ' I 'll aiblins answer ye ; but no the nicht , no the nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 6]: `` What for no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 8]: said Hugh , taking up the dialect .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 39]: `` For ae thing , we 're nae clean through wi ' the auld sailor 's story yet ; an ' gin I hae learnt ae thing aboon anither , its no to pass jeedgment upo ' halves .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 28]: I hae seen ill weather half the simmer , an ' a thrang corn-yard after an ' a ' , an ' that o ' the best .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 14]: No that I 'm ill pleased wi ' the bonny ballant aither . ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 18]: `` Weel , will ye jist lat me read the lave o ' t till ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 14]: `` Wi ' muckle pleesur , sir , an ' mony thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 33]: He showed Hugh how far they had got in the reading of the `` Ancient Mariner '' ; whereupon he took up the tale , and carried it on to the end .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 37]: He had some facility in reading with expression , and his few affectations -- for it must be confessed he was not free of such faults -- were not of a nature to strike uncritical hearers .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 46]: When he had finished , he looked up , and his eye chancing to light upon Margaret first , he saw that her cheek was quite pale , and her eyes overspread with the film , not of coming tears , but of emotion notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 35]: `` Well , '' said Hugh , again , willing to break the silence , and turning towards David , `` what do you think of it now you have heard it all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 23]: Whether Janet interrupted her husband or not , I can not tell ; but she certainly spoke first : `` Tshâvah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 12]: -- equivalent to pshaw -- `` it 's a ' lees .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 23]: What for are ye knittin ' yer broos ower a leein ' ballant -- a ' havers as weel as lees ? ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 43]: `` I 'm no jist prepared to say sae muckle , Janet , '' replied David ; `` there 's mony a thing ` at 's lees , as ye ca ` t , ` at 's no lees a ' through .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 37]: Ye see , Maister Sutherlan ' , I 'm no gleg at the uptak , an ' it jist taks me twise as lang as ither fowk to see to the ootside o ' a thing .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 37]: Whiles a sentence ` ill leuk to me clean nonsense a ` thegither ; an ' maybe a haill ook efter , it 'll come upo ' me a ' at ance ; an ' fegs !
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 12]: it 's the best thing in a ' the beuk . ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 35]: Margaret 's eyes were fixed on her father with a look which I can only call faithfulness , as if every word he spoke was truth , whether she could understand it or not .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 16]: `` But perhaps we may look too far for meanings sometimes , '' suggested Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 38]: `` Maybe , maybe ; but when a body has a suspeecion o ' a trowth , he sud never lat sit till he 's gotten eyther hit , or an assurance that there 's nothing there .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 42]: But there 's jist ae thing , in the poem ` at I can pit my finger upo ' , an ' say ` at it 's no richt clear to me whether it 's a ' straucht-foret or no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 9]: `` What 's that , Mr. Elginbrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 49]: `` It 's jist this -- what for a ' thae sailor-men fell doon deid , an ' the chield ` at shot the bonnie burdie , an ' did a ' the mischeef , cam ' to little hurt i ' the ` en -- comparateevely . ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 19]: `` Well , '' said Hugh , `` I confess I 'm not prepared to answer the question .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 18]: If you get any light on the subject '' -- `` Ow , I daursay I may .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 24]: A heap o ' things comes to me as I 'm takin ' a daunder by mysel ' i ' the gloamin ' .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 32]: I 'll no say a thing 's wrang till I hae tried it ower an ' ower ; for maybe I haena a richt grip o ' the thing ava . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 21]: `` What can ye expec , Dawvid , o ' a leevin ' corp , an ' a ' that ?
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 40]: -- ay , twa hunner corps -- fower times fifty 's twa hunner -- an ' angels turnin ' sailors , an ' sangs gaein fleein ' aboot like laverocks , and tummelin ' doon again , tired like ?
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 8]: -- Gude preserve 's a ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 14]: `` Janet , do ye believe ` at ever a serpent spak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 12]: Dawvid , the deil was in him , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 24]: `` The deil a word o ' that 's i ' the word itsel , though , '' rejoined David with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 47]: `` Dawvid , '' said Janet , solemnly , and with some consternation , `` ye 're no gaein ' to tell me , sittin ' there , at ye dinna believe ilka word ` at 's prentit atween the twa brods o ' the Bible ?
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 11]: What will Maister Sutherlan ' think o ' ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 40]: `` Janet , my bonnie lass -- '' and here David 's eyes beamed upon his wife -- `` I believe as mony o ' them as ye do , an ' maybe a wheen mair , my dawtie .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 8]: Keep yer min ' easy aboot that .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 36]: But ye jist see ` at fowk warna a ` thegither saitisfeed aboot a sairpent speikin ' , an ' sae they leukit aboot and aboot till at last they fand the deil in him .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 9]: Gude kens whether he was there or no .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 32]: Noo , ye see hoo , gin we was to leuk weel aboot thae corps , an ' thae angels , an ' a ' that queer stuff -- but oh !
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 6]: it 's bonny stuff tee !
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 27]: -- we micht fa ' in wi ' something we didna awthegither expec , though we was leukin ' for ' t a ' the time .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 34]: Sae I maun jist think aboot it , Mr. Sutherlan ' ; an ' I wad fain read it ower again , afore I lippen on giein ' my opingan on the maitter .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 9]: Ye cud lave the bit beukie , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 45]: We ` se tak ' guid care o ` t. '' `` Ye 're verra welcome to that or ony ither beuk I hae , '' replied Hugh , who began to feel already as if he were in the hands of a superior .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 25]: `` Mony thanks ; but ye see , sir , we hae eneuch to chow upo ' for an aucht days or so . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 19]: By this time the potatoes wore considered to be cooked , and were accordingly lifted off the fire .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 46]: The water was then poured away , the lid put aside , and the pot hung once more upon the crook , hooked a few rings further up in the chimney , in order that the potatoes might be thoroughly dry before they were served .
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 17]: Margaret was now very busy spreading the cloth and laying spoon and plates on the table .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 5]: Hugh rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 29]: `` Will ye no bide , '' said Janet , in a most hospitable tone , `` an ' tak ' a het pitawta wi ' us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid of being troublesome , '' answered he .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 20]: `` Nae fear o ' that , gin ye can jist pit up wi ' oor hamely meat . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 14]: `` Mak nae apologies , Janet , my woman , '' said David .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 14]: `` A het pitawta 's aye guid fare , for gentle or semple .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 9]: Sit ye doun again , Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 11]: Maggy , my doo , whaur 's the milk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 44]: `` I thocht Hawkie wad hae a drappy o ' het milk by this time , '' said Margaret , `` and sae I jist loot it be to the last ; but I 'll hae ' t drawn in twa minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 23]: And away she went with a jug , commonly called a decanter in that part of the north , in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 18]: `` That 's hardly fair play to Hawkie , '' said David to Janet with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 12]: Dawvid , ye see we haena a stranger ilka nicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 46]: `` But really , '' said Hugh , `` I hope this is the last time you will consider me a stranger , for I shall be here a great many times -- that is , if you do n't get tired of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 12]: `` Gie us the chance at least , Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 29]: It 's no sma ' preevilege to fowk like us to hae a frien ' wi ' sae muckle buik learnin ' as ye hae , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 15]: `` I am afraid it looks more to you than it really is . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 23]: `` Weel , ye see , we maun a ' leuk at the starns frae the hicht o ' oor ain een .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 17]: An ' ye seem nigher to them by a lang growth than the lave o 's .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 11]: My man , ye ought to be thankfu ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 29]: With the true humility that comes of worshipping the Truth , David had not the smallest idea that he was immeasurably nearer to the stars than Hugh Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 78]: Maggie having returned with her jug full of frothy milk , and the potatoes being already heaped up in a wooden bowl or bossie in the middle of the table , sending the smoke of their hospitality to the rafters , Janet placed a smaller wooden bowl , called a caup , filled with deliciously yellow milk of Hawkie 's latest gathering , for each individual of the company , with an attendant horn-spoon by its side .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 46]: They all drew their chairs to the table , and David , asking no blessing , as it was called , but nevertheless giving thanks for the blessing already bestowed , namely , the perfect gift of food , invited Hugh to make a supper .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 39]: Each , in primitive but not ungraceful fashion , took a potatoe from the dish with the fingers , and ate it , `` bite and sup , '' with the help of the horn-spoon for the milk .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 36]: Hugh thought he had never supped more pleasantly , and could not help observing how far real good-breeding is independent of the forms and refinements of what has assumed to itself the name of society .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 43]: Soon after supper was over , it was time for him to go ; so , after kind hand-shakings and good nights , David accompanied him to the road , where he left him to find his way home by the star-light .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 42]: As he went , he could not help pondering a little over the fact that a labouring man had discovered a difficulty , perhaps a fault , in one of his favourite poems , which had never suggested itself to him .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 46]: He soon satisfied himself , however , by coming to the conclusion that the poet had not cared about the matter at all , having had no further intention in the poem than Hugh himself had found in it , namely , witchery and loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 69]: But it seemed to the young student a wonderful fact , that the intercourse which was denied him in the laird 's family , simply from their utter incapacity of yielding it , should be afforded him in the family of a man who had followed the plough himself once , perhaps did so still , having risen only to be the overseer and superior assistant of labourers .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 32]: He certainly felt , on his way home , much more reconciled to the prospect of his sojourn at Turriepuffit , than he would have thought it possible he ever should .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 18]: David lingered a few moments , looking up at the stars , before he re-entered his cottage .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 22]: When he rejoined his wife and child , he found the Bible already open on the table for their evening devotions .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 18]: I will close this chapter , as I began the first , with something like his prayer .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 28]: David 's prayers were characteristic of the whole man ; but they also partook , in far more than ordinary , of the mood of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 49]: His last occupation had been star-gazing : `` O thou , wha keeps the stars alicht , an ' our souls burnin ' wi ' a licht aboon that o ' the stars , grant that they may shine afore thee as the stars for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 56]: An ' as thou hauds the stars burnin ' a ' the nicht , whan there 's no man to see , so haud thou the licht burnin ' in our souls , whan we see neither thee nor it , but are buried in the grave o ' sleep an ' forgetfu ` ness .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 55]: Be thou by us , even as a mother sits by the bedside o ' her ailin ' wean a ' the lang nicht ; only be thou nearer to us , even in our verra souls , an ' watch ower the warl ' o ' dreams that they mak ' for themsels .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 70]: Grant that more an ' more thochts o ' thy thinkin ' may come into our herts day by day , till there shall be at last an open road atween thee an ' us , an ' thy angels may ascend and descend upon us , so that we may be in thy heaven , e ` en while we are upo ' thy earth : Amen . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 3]: CHAPTER V .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 3]: THE STUDENTS .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 29]: In wood and stone , not the softest , but hardest , be always aptest for portraiture , both fairest for pleasure , and most durable for profit .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 78]: Hard wits be hard to receive , but sure to keep ; painful without weariness , heedful without wavering , constant without new-fangleness ; bearing heavy things , though not lightly , yet willingly ; entering hard things , though not easily , yet deeply ; and so come to that perfectness of learning in the end , that quick wits seem in hope but do not in deed , or else very seldom ever attain unto .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 4]: -- ROGER ASCHAM .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 4]: -- The Schoolmaster .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 25]: Two or three very simple causes united to prevent Hugh from repeating his visit to David so soon as he would otherwise have done .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 21]: One was , that , the fine weather continuing , he was seized with the desire of exploring the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 40]: The spring , which sets some wild animals to the construction of new dwellings , incites man to the enlarging of his , making , as it were , by discovery , that which lies around him his own .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 23]: So he spent the greater parts of several evenings in wandering about the neighbourhood ; till at length the moonlight failed him .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 56]: Another cause was , that , in the act of searching for some books for his boys , in an old garret of the house , which was at once lumber room and library , he came upon some stray volumes of the Waverley novels , with which he was as yet only partially acquainted .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 8]: These absorbed many of his spare hours .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 27]: But one evening , while reading the Heart of Midlothian , the thought struck him -- what a character David would have been for Sir Walter .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 29]: Whether he was right or not is a question ; but the notion brought David so vividly before him , that it roused the desire to see him .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 13]: He closed the book at once , and went to the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 29]: `` We 're no lik ` ly to ca ' ye onything but a stranger yet , Maister Sutherlan ' , '' said David , as he entered .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 18]: `` I 've been busy since I saw you , '' was all the excuse Hugh offered .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 40]: `` Weel , ye ' r welcome noo ; and ye 've jist come in time after a ' , for it 's no that mony hours sin ' I fand it oot awthegither to my ain settisfaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 6]: `` Found out what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 31]: said Hugh ; for he had forgotten all about the perplexity in which he had left David , and which had been occupying his thoughts ever since their last interview .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 22]: `` Aboot the cross-bow an ' the birdie , ye ken , '' answered David , in a tone of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 7]: `` Yes , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 6]: How stupid of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 32]: `` Weel , ye see , the meanin ' o ' the haill ballant is no that ill to win at , seein ' the poet himsel ' tells us that .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 29]: It 's jist no to be proud or ill-natured to oor neebours , the beasts and birds , for God made ane an ' a ' o 's .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 16]: But there 's harder things i n't nor that , and yon 's the hardest .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 37]: But ye see it was jist an unlucky thochtless deed o ' the puir auld sailor 's , an ' I 'm thinkin ' he was sair reprocht in 's hert the minit he did it .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 27]: His mates was fell angry at him , no for killin ' the puir innocent craytur , but for fear o ' ill luck in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 28]: Syne when nane followed , they turned richt roun ' , an ' took awa ' the character o ' the puir beastie efter 't was deid .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 16]: They appruved o ' the verra thing ` at he was nae doot sorry for .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 10]: -- But onything to haud aff o ' themsels !
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 42]: Nae suner cam the calm , than roun ' they gaed again like the weathercock , an ' naething wad content them bit hingin ' the deid craytur about the auld man 's craig , an ' abusin ' him forby .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 29]: Sae ye see hoo they war a wheen selfish crayturs , an ' a hantle waur nor the man ` at was led astray into an ill deed .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 52]: But still he maun rue ` t. Sae Death got them , an ' a kin ' o ' leevin ' Death , a she Death as ` twar , an ' in some respecks may be waur than the ither , got grips o ' him , puir auld body !
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 28]: It 's a ' fair and richt to the backbane o ' the ballant , Maister Sutherlan ' , an ' that I ` se uphaud . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 23]: Hugh could not help feeling considerably astonished to hear this criticism from the lips of one whom he considered an uneducated man .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 39]: For he did not know that there are many other educations besides a college one , some of them tending far more than that to develope the common-sense , or faculty of judging of things by their nature .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 34]: Life intelligently met and honestly passed , is the best education of all ; except that higher one to which it is intended to lead , and to which it had led David .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 15]: Both these educations , however , were nearly unknown to the student of books .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 30]: But he was still more astonished to hear from the lips of Margaret , who was sitting by : `` That 's it , father ; that 's it !
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 27]: I was jist ettlin ' efter that same thing mysel , or something like it , but ye put it in the richt words exackly . ''
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 22]: The sound of her voice drew Hugh 's eyes upon her : he was astonished at the alteration in her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 8]: While she spoke it was absolutely beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 16]: As soon as she ceased speaking , it settled back into its former shadowless calm .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 34]: Her father gave her one approving glance and nod , expressive of no surprise at her having approached the same discovery as himself , but testifying pleasure at the coincidence of their opinions .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 32]: Nothing was left for Hugh but to express his satisfaction with the interpretation of the difficulty , and to add , that the poem would henceforth possess fresh interest for him .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 24]: After this , his visits became more frequent ; and at length David made a request which led to their greater frequency still .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 26]: It was to this effect : `` Do ye think , Mr. Sutherlan ' , I could do onything at my age at the mathematics ?
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 21]: I unnerstan ' weel eneuch hoo to measur ' lan ' , an ' that kin ' o ' thing .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 6]: I jist follow the rule .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 10]: But the rule itsel 's a puzzler to me .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 8]: I dinna understan ' it by half .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 43]: Noo it seems to me that the best o ' a rule is , no to mak ye able to do a thing , but to lead ye to what maks the rule richt -- to the prenciple o ' the thing .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 38]: It 's no ` at I 'm misbelievin ' the rule , but I want to see the richts o ` t. '' `` I 've no doubt you could learn fast enough , '' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 13]: `` I shall be very happy to help you with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 13]: `` Na , na ; I 'm no gaein to trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 9]: Ye hae eneuch to do in that way .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 35]: But if ye could jist spare me ane or twa o ' yer beuks whiles -- ony o ' them ` at ye think proper , I sud be muckle obleeged te ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 50]: Hugh promised and fulfilled ; but the result was , that , before long , both the father and the daughter were seated at the kitchen-table , every evening , busy with Euclid and Algebra ; and that , on most evenings , Hugh was present as their instructor .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 9]: It was quite a new pleasure to him .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 12]: Few delights surpass those of imparting knowledge to the eager recipient .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 26]: What made Hugh 's tutor-life irksome , was partly the excess of his desire to communicate , over the desire of his pupils to partake .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 7]: But here there was no labour .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: All the questions were asked by the scholars .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 31]: A single lesson had not passed , however , before David put questions which Hugh was unable to answer , and concerning which he was obliged to confess his ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 46]: Instead of being discouraged , as eager questioners are very ready to be when they receive no answer , David merely said , `` Weel , weel , we maun bide a wee , '' and went on with what he was able to master .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 41]: Meantime Margaret , though forced to lag a good way behind her father , and to apply much more frequently to their tutor for help , yet secured all she got ; and that is great praise for any student .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 29]: She was not by any means remarkably quick , but she knew when she did not understand ; and that is a sure and indispensable step towards understanding .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 13]: It is indeed a rarer gift than the power of understanding itself .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 15]: The gratitude of David was too deep to be expressed in any formal thanks .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 36]: It broke out at times in two or three simple words when the conversation presented an opportunity , or in the midst of their work , as by its own self-birth , ungenerated by association .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 37]: During the lesson , which often lasted more than two hours , Janet would be busy about the room , and in and out of it , with a manifest care to suppress all unnecessary bustle .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 73]: As soon as Hugh made his appearance , she would put off the stout shoes -- man 's shoes , as we should consider them -- which she always wore at other times , and put on a pair of bauchles ; that is , an old pair of her Sunday shoes , put down at heel , and so converted into slippers , with which she could move about less noisily .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 75]: At times her remarks would seem to imply that she considered it rather absurd in her husband to trouble himself with book-learning ; but evidently on the ground that he knew everything already that was worthy of the honour of his acquaintance ; whereas , with regard to Margaret , her heart was as evidently full of pride at the idea of the education her daughter was getting from the laird 's own tutor .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 49]: Now and then she would stand still for a moment , and gaze at them , with her bright black eyes , from under the white frills of her mutch , her bare brown arms akimbo , and a look of pride upon her equally brown honest face .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 64]: Her dress consisted of a wrapper , or short loose jacket , of printed calico , and a blue winsey petticoat , which she had a habit of tucking between her knees , to keep it out of harm 's way , as often as she stooped to any wet work , or , more especially , when doing anything by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 92]: Margaret 's dress was , in ordinary , like her mother 's , with the exception of the cap ; but , every evening , when their master was expected , she put off her wrapper , and substituted a gown of the same material , a cotton print ; and so , with her plentiful dark hair gathered neatly under a net of brown silk , the usual head-dress of girls in her position , both in and out of doors , sat down dressed for the sacrament of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 59]: David made no other preparation than the usual evening washing of his large well-wrought hands , and bathing of his head , covered with thick dark hair , plentifully lined with grey , in a tub of cold water ; from which his face , which was `` cremsin dyed ingrayne '' by the weather , emerged glowing .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 87]: He sat down at the table in his usual rough blue coat and plain brass buttons ; with his breeches of broad-striped corduroy , his blue-ribbed stockings , and leather gaiters , or cuiticans , disposed under the table , and his shoes , with five rows of broad-headed nails in the soles , projecting from beneath it on the other side ; for he was a tall man -- six feet still , although five-and-fifty , and considerably bent in the shoulders with hard work .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 15]: Sutherland 's style was that of a gentleman who must wear out his dress-coat .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 66]: Such was the group which , three or four evenings in the week , might be seen in David Elginbrod 's cottage , seated around the white deal table , with their books and slates upon it , and searching , by the light of a tallow candle , substituted as more convenient , for the ordinary lamp , after the mysteries of the universe .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 24]: The influences of reviving nature and of genial companionship operated very favourably upon Hugh 's spirits , and consequently upon his whole powers .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 40]: For some time he had , as I have already hinted , succeeded in interesting his boy-pupils in their studies ; and now the progress they made began to be appreciable to themselves as well as to their tutor .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 11]: This of course made them more happy and more diligent .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 35]: There were no attempts now to work upon their parents for a holiday ; no real or pretended head or tooth-aches , whose disability was urged against the greater torture of ill-conceded mental labour .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 27]: They began in fact to understand ; and , in proportion to the beauty and value of the thing understood , to understand is to enjoy .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 53]: Therefore the laird and his lady could not help seeing that the boys were doing well , far better in fact than they had ever done before ; and consequently began not only to prize Hugh 's services , but to think more highly of his office than had been their wont .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 30]: The laird would now and then invite him to join him in a tumbler of toddy after dinner , or in a ride round the farm after school hours .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 37]: But it must be confessed that these approaches to friendliness were rather irksome to Hugh ; for whatever the laird might have been as a collegian , he was certainly now nothing more than a farmer .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 33]: Where David Elginbrod would have described many a `` bonny sicht , '' the laird only saw the probable results of harvest , in the shape of figures in his banking book .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 55]: On one occasion , Hugh roused his indignation by venturing to express his admiration of the delightful mingling of colours in a field where a good many scarlet poppies grew among the green blades of the corn , indicating , to the agricultural eye , the poverty of the soil where they were found .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 19]: This fault in the soil , the laird , like a child , resented upon the poppies themselves .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 6]: `` Nasty , ugly weyds !
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 64]: We 'll hae ye admirin ' the smut neist , '' said he , contemptuously ; '' 'cause the bairns can bleck ane anither 's faces wi ` t. '' `` But surely , '' said Hugh , `` putting other considerations aside , you must allow that the colour , especially when mingled with that of the corn , is beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 6]: `` Deil hae ` t !
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 22]: It 's jist there ` at I canna bide the sicht o ` t. Beauty ye may ca ' ` t !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 25]: I see nane o ` t. I 'd as sune hae a reid-heedit bairn , as see thae reid-coatit rascals i ' my corn .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 20]: I houp ye 're no gaen to cram stuff like that into the heeds o ' the twa laddies .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 2]: Faith !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 14]: we 'll hae them sawin ' thae ill-faured weyds amang the wheyt neist .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 6]: Poapies ca ' ye them ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 23]: Weel I wat they 're the Popp 's ain bairns , an ' the scarlet wumman to the mither o ' them .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 23]: Having manifested both wit and Protestantism in the closing sentence of his objurgation , the laird relapsed into good humour and stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 26]: Hugh would gladly have spent such hours in David 's cottage instead ; but he was hardly prepared to refuse his company to Mr. Glasford .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 5]: THE LAIRD 'S LADY .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 27]: Ye archewyves , standith at defence , Sin ye been strong , as is a great camayle ; Ne suffer not that men you don offence .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 31]: And slender wives , fell as in battaile , Beth eager , as is a tiger , yond in Inde ; Aye clappith as a mill , I you counsaile .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 2]: CHAUCER .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 6]: -- The Clerk 's Tale .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 41]: The length and frequency of Hugh 's absences , careless as she was of his presence , had already attracted the attention of Mrs. Glasford ; and very little trouble had to be expended on the discovery of his haunt .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 27]: For the servants knew well enough where he went , and of course had come to their own conclusions as to the object of his visits .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 17]: So the lady chose to think it her duty to expostulate with Hugh on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 155]: Accordingly , one morning after breakfast , the laird having gone to mount his horse , and the boys to have a few minutes ' play before lessons , Mrs. Glasford , who had kept her seat at the head of the table , waiting for the opportunity , turned towards Hugh who sat reading the week 's news , folded her hands on the tablecloth , drew herself up yet a little more stiffly in her chair , and thus addressed him : `` It 's my duty , Mr. Sutherland , seein ' ye have no mother to look after ye -- '' Hugh expected something matronly about his linen or his socks , and put down his newspaper with a smile ; but , to his astonishment , she went on -- -- `` To remonstrate wi ' ye , on the impropriety of going so often to David Elginbrod 's .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 15]: They 're not company for a young gentleman like you , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 21]: `` They 're good enough company for a poor tutor , Mrs. Glasford , '' replied Hugh , foolishly enough .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 14]: `` Not at all , not at all , '' insisted the lady .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 10]: `` With your connexions -- '' `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 8]: who ever said anything about my connexions ?
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 8]: I never pretended to have any . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 6]: Hugh was getting angry already .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 77]: Mrs. Glasford nodded her head significantly , as much as to say , `` I know more about you than you imagine , '' and then went on : `` Your mother will never forgive me if you get into a scrape with that smooth-faced hussy ; and if her father , honest man has n't eyes enough in his head , other people have -- ay , an ' tongues too , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 59]: Hugh was on the point of forgetting his manners , and consigning all the above mentioned organs to perdition ; but he managed to restrain his wrath , and merely said that Margaret was one of the best girls he had ever known , and that there was no possible danger of any kind of scrape with her .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 15]: This mode of argument , however , was not calculated to satisfy Mrs. Glasford .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 6]: She returned to the charge .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 14]: `` She 's a sly puss , with her shy airs and graces .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 28]: Her father 's jist daft wi ' conceit o ' her , an ' it 's no to be surprised if she cast a glamour ower you .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 10]: Mr. Sutherland , ye 're but young yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 59]: Hugh 's pride presented any alliance with a lassie who had herded the laird 's cows barefoot , and even now tended their own cow , as an all but inconceivable absurdity ; and he resented , more than he could have thought possible , the entertainment of such a degrading idea in the mind of Mrs. Glasford .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 18]: Indignation prevented him from replying ; while she went on , getting more vernacular as she proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 21]: `` It 's no for lack o ' company ` at yer driven to seek theirs , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 30]: There 's twa as fine lads an ' gude scholars as ye 'll fin ' in the haill kintra-side , no to mention the laird and mysel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 19]: But Hugh could bear it no longer ; nor would he condescend to excuse or explain his conduct .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 14]: `` Madam , I beg you will not mention this subject again . ''
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 68]: `` But I will mention ` t , Mr. Sutherlan ' ; an ' if ye 'll no listen to rizzon , I 'll go to them ` at maun do ` t. '' `` I am accountable to you , madam , for my conduct in your house , and for the way in which I discharge my duty to your children -- no further . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 39]: `` Do ye ca ' that dischairgin ' yer duty to my bairns , to set them the example o ' hingin ' at a quean 's âpron-strings , and fillin ' her lug wi ' idle havers ?
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 9]: Ca ' ye that dischairgin ' yer duty ?
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 3]: My certie !
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 6]: a bonny dischairgin ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 16]: `` I never see the girl but in her father and mother 's presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 91]: `` Weel , weel , Mr. Sutherlan ' , '' said Mrs. Glasford , in a final tone , and trying to smother the anger which she felt she had allowed to carry her further than was decorous , `` we 'll say nae mair aboot it at present ; but I maun jist speak to the laird himsel ' , an ' see what he says till ` t. '' And , with this threat , she walked out of the room in what she considered a dignified manner .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 52]: Hugh was exceedingly annoyed at this treatment , and thought , at first , of throwing up his situation at once ; but he got calmer by degrees , and saw that it would be to his own loss , and perhaps to the injury of his friends at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 37]: So he took his revenge by recalling the excited face of Mrs. Glasford , whose nose had got as red with passion as the protuberance of a turkey-cock when gobbling out its unutterable feelings of disdain .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 30]: He dwelt upon this soothing contemplation till a fit of laughter relieved him , and he was able to go and join his pupils as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 68]: Meanwhile the lady sent for David , who was at work in the garden , into no less an audience-chamber than the drawing-room , the revered abode of all the tutelar deities of the house ; chief amongst which were the portraits of the laird and herself : he , plethoric and wrapped in voluminous folds of neckerchief -- she long-necked , and lean , and bare-shouldered .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 65]: The original of the latter work of art seated herself in the most important chair in the room ; and when David , after carefully wiping the shoes he had already wiped three times on his way up , entered with a respectful but no wise obsequious bow , she ordered him , with the air of an empress , to shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 29]: When he had obeyed , she ordered him , in a similar tone , to be seated ; for she sought to mingle condescension and conciliation with severity .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 33]: `` David , '' she then began , `` I am informed that ye keep open door to our Mr. Sutherland , and that he spends most forenichts in your company . ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 17]: `` Weel , mem , it 's verra true , '' was all David 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 7]: He sat in an expectant attitude .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 9]: `` Dawvid , I wonner at ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 13]: returned Mrs. Glasford , forgetting her dignity , and becoming confidentially remonstrative .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 52]: `` Here 's a young gentleman o ' talans , wi ' ilka prospeck o ' waggin ' his heid in a poopit some day ; an ' ye aid an ' abet him in idlin ' awa ' his time at your chimla-lug , duin ' waur nor naething ava !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 8]: I 'm surprised at ye , Dawvid .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 8]: I thocht ye had mair sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 26]: David looked out of his clear , blue , untroubled eyes , upon the ruffled countenance of his mistress , with an almost paternal smile .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 30]: `` Weel , mem , I maun say I dinna jist think the young man 's in the warst o ' company , when he 's at our ingle-neuk .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 31]: An ' for idlin ' o ' his time awa ' , it 's weel waurd for himsel ' , forby for us , gin holy words binna lees . ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 9]: `` What do ye mean , Dawvid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 12]: said the lady rather sharply , for she loved no riddles .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 170]: `` I mean this , mem : that the young man is jist actin ' the pairt o ' Peter an ' John at the bonny gate o ' the temple , whan they said : ` Such as I have , gie I thee ; ' an ' gin ' it be more blessed to gie than to receive , as Sant Paul says ` at the Maister himsel ' said , the young man ` ill no be the waur aff in 's ain learnin ' , that he impairts o ' t to them that hunger for ` t. '' `` Ye mean by this , Dawvid , gin ye could express yersel ' to the pint , ` at the young man , wha 's ower weel paid to instruck my bairns , neglecks them , an ' lays himsel ' oot upo ' ither fowk 's weans , wha hae no richt to ettle aboon the station in which their Maker pat them . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 44]: This was uttered with quite a religious fervour of expostulation ; for the lady 's natural indignation at the thought of Meg Elginbrod having lessons from her boys ' tutor , was cowed beneath the quiet steady gaze of the noble-minded peasant father .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 36]: `` He lays himsel ' oot mair upo ' the ither fowk themsels ' than upo ' their weans , mem ; though , nae doubt , my Maggy comes in for a gude share .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 57]: But for negleckin ' o ' his duty to you , mem , I 'm sure I kenna hoo that can be ; for it was only yestreen ` at the laird himsel ' said to me , ` at hoo the bairns had never gotten on naething like it wi ' ony ither body . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 38]: `` The laird 's ower ready wi 's clavers , '' quoth the laird 's wife , nettled to find herself in the wrong , and forgetful of her own and her lord 's dignity at once .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 61]: `` But , '' she pursued , `` all I can say is , that I consider it verra improper o ' you , wi ' a young lass-bairn , to encourage the nichtly veesits o ' a young gentleman , wha 's sae far aboon her in station , an ' dootless will some day be farther yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 4]: `` Mem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 19]: said David , with dignity , `` I 'm willin ' no to understan ' what ye mean .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 69]: My Maggy 's no ane ` at needs luikin ' efter ; an ' a body had need to be carefu ' an ' no interfere wi ' the Lord 's herdin ' , for he ca 's himsel ' the Shepherd o ' the sheep , an ' weel as I loe her I maun lea ' him to lead them wha follow him wherever he goeth .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 20]: She 'll be no ill guidit , and I 'm no gaeing to kep her at ilka turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 5]: `` Weel , weel !
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 22]: that 's yer ain affair , Dawvid , my man , '' rejoined Mrs. Glasford , with rising voice and complexion .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 94]: `` A ' ` at I hae to add is jist this : ` at as lang as my tutor veesits her '' -- `` He veesits her no more than me , mem , '' interposed David ; but his mistress went on with dignified disregard of the interruption -- `` Veesits her , I canna , for the sake o ' my own bairns , an ' the morals o ' my hoosehold , employ her aboot the hoose , as I was in the way o ' doin ' afore .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 6]: Good mornin ' , Dawvid .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 18]: I 'll speak to the laird himsel ' , sin ' ye 'll no heed me . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 35]: `` It 's more to my lassie , mem , excuse me , to learn to unnerstan ' the works o ' her Maker , than it is to be employed in your household .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 26]: Mony thanks , mem , for what ye hev ' done in that way afore ; an ' good mornin ' to ye , mem .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 20]: I 'm sorry we should hae ony misunderstandin ' , but I canna help it for my pairt . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 24]: With these words David withdrew , rather anxious about the consequences to Hugh of this unpleasant interference on the part of Mrs. Glasford .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 45]: That lady 's wrath kept warm without much nursing , till the laird came home ; when she turned the whole of her battery upon him , and kept up a steady fire until he yielded , and promised to turn his upon David .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 29]: But he had more common-sense than his wife in some things , and saw at once how ridiculous it would be to treat the affair as of importance .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 40]: So , the next time he saw David , he addressed him half jocularly : `` Weel , Dawvid , you an ' the mistress hae been haein ' a bit o ' a dispute thegither , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 24]: `` Weel , sir , we warna a ` thegither o ' ae min ' , '' said David , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 28]: `` Weel , weel , we maun humour her , ye ken , or it may be the waur for us a ' , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 8]: And the laird nodded with humorous significance .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 47]: `` I 'm sure I sud be glaid , sir ; but this is no sma ' maitter to me an ' my Maggie , for we 're jist gettin ' food for the verra sowl , sir , frae him an ' his beuks . ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 15]: `` Cudna ye be content wi the beuks wi'out the man , Dawvid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 16]: `` We sud mak ' but sma ' progress , sir , that get . ''
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 24]: The laird began to be a little nettled himself at David 's stiffness about such a small matter , and held his peace .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 25]: David resumed : `` Besides , sir , that 's a maitter for the young man to sattle , an ' no for me .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 23]: It wad ill become me , efter a ' he 's dune for us , to steek the door in 's face .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 25]: Na , na ; as lang 's I hae a door to haud open , it 's no to be steekit to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 17]: `` Efter a ' , the door 's mine , Dawvid , '' said the laird .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 28]: `` As lang 's I 'm in your hoose an ' in your service , sir , the door 's mine , '' retorted David , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 10]: The laird turned and rode away without another word .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 10]: What passed between him and his wife never transpired .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 14]: Nothing more was said to Hugh as long as he remained at Turriepuffit .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 17]: But Margaret was never sent for to the House after this , upon any occasion whatever .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 29]: The laird gave her a nod as often as he saw her ; but the lady , if they chanced to meet , took no notice of her .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 29]: Margaret , on her part , stood or passed with her eyes on the ground , and no further change of countenance than a slight flush of discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 17]: The lessons went on as usual , and happy hours they were for all those concerned .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 145]: Often , in after years , and in far different circumstances , the thoughts of Hugh reverted , with a painful yearning , to the dim-lighted cottage , with its clay floor and its deal table ; to the earnest pair seated with him at the labours that unfold the motions of the stars ; and even to the homely , thickset , but active form of Janet , and that peculiar smile of hers with which , after an apparently snappish speech , spoken with her back to the person addressed , she would turn round her honest face half-apologetically , and shine full upon some one or other of the three , whom she honoured with her whole heart and soul , and who , she feared , might be offended at what she called her `` hame-ower fashion of speaking . ''
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 53]: Indeed it was wonderful what a share the motherhood of this woman , incapable as she was of entering into the intellectual occupations of the others , had in producing that sense of home-blessedness , which inwrapt Hugh also in the folds of its hospitality , and drew him towards its heart .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 43]: Certain it is that not one of the three would have worked so well without the sense of the presence of Janet , here and there about the room , or in the immediate neighbourhood of it -- love watching over labour .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 35]: Once a week , always on Saturday nights , Hugh stayed to supper with them : and on these occasions , Janet contrived to have something better than ordinary in honour of their guest .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 29]: Still it was of the homeliest country fare , such as Hugh could partake of without the least fear that his presence occasioned any inconvenience to his entertainers .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 10]: Nor was Hugh the only giver of spiritual food .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 63]: Putting aside the rich gifts of human affection and sympathy , which grew more and more pleasant -- I can hardly use a stronger word yet -- to Hugh every day , many things were spoken by the simple wisdom of David , which would have enlightened Hugh far more than they did , had he been sufficiently advanced to receive them .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 39]: But their very simplicity was often far beyond the grasp of his thoughts ; for the higher we rise , the simpler we become ; and David was one of those of whom is the kingdom of Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 63]: There is a childhood into which we have to grow , just as there is a childhood which we must leave behind ; a childlikeness which is the highest gain of humanity , and a childishness from which but few of those who are counted the wisest among men , have freed themselves in their imagined progress towards the reality of things .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 6]: THE SECRET OF THE WOOD .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 23]: The unthrift sunne shot vitall gold , A thousand pieces ; And heaven its azure did unfold , Chequered with snowy fleeces .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 26]: The air was all in spice , And every bush A garland wore : Thus fed my Eyes , But all the Eare lay hush .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 3]: HENRY VAUGHAN .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 15]: It was not in mathematics alone that Hugh Sutherland was serviceable to Margaret Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 54]: That branch of study had been chosen for her father , not for her ; but her desire to learn had led her to lay hold upon any mental provision with which the table happened to be spread ; and the more eagerly that her father was a guest at the same feast .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 67]: Before long , Hugh bethought him that it might possibly be of service to her , in the course of her reading , if he taught her English a little more thoroughly than she had probably picked it up at the parish school , to which she had been in the habit of going till within a very short period of her acquaintance with the tutor .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 24]: -- The English reader must not suppose the term parish school to mean what the same term would mean if used in England .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 34]: Boys and girls of very different ranks go to the Scotch parish schools , and the fees are so small as to place their education within the reach of almost the humblest means .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 44]: -- To his proposal to this effect Margaret responded thankfully ; and it gave Hugh an opportunity of directing her attention to many of the more delicate distinctions in literature , for the appreciation of which she manifested at once a remarkable aptitude .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 26]: Coleridge 's poems had been read long ago ; some of them , indeed , almost committed to memory in the process of repeated perusal .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 70]: No doubt a good many of them must have been as yet too abstruse for her ; not in the least , however , from inaptitude in her for such subjects as they treated of , but simply because neither the terms nor the modes of thought could possibly have been as yet presented to her in so many different positions as to enable her to comprehend their scope .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 17]: Hugh lent her Sir Walter 's poems next , but those she read at an eye-glance .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 19]: She returned the volume in a week , saying merely , they were `` verra bonnie stories . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 23]: He saw at once that , to have done them justice with the girl , he ought to have lent them first .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 14]: But that could not be helped now ; and what should come next ?
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: Upon this he took thought .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 21]: His library was too small to cause much perplexity of choice , but for a few days he continued undecided .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: Meantime the interest he felt in his girl-pupil deepened greatly .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 9]: She became a kind of study to him .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 16]: The expression of her countenance was far inferior to her intelligence and power of thought .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 63]: It was still to excess -- almost dull in ordinary ; not from any fault in the mould of the features , except , perhaps , in the upper lip , which seemed deficient in drawing , if I may be allowed the expression ; but from the absence of that light which indicates the presence of active thought and feeling within .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 18]: In this respect her face was like the earthen pitcher of Gideon : it concealed the light .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 16]: She seemed to have , to a peculiar degree , the faculty of retiring inside .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 69]: But now and then , while he was talking to her , and doubtful , from the lack of expression , whether she was even listening with attention to what he was saying , her face would lighten up with a radiant smile of intelligence ; not , however , throwing the light upon him , and in a moment reverting to its former condition of still twilight .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 16]: Her person seemed not to be as yet thoroughly possessed or informed by her spirit .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 19]: It sat apart within her ; and there was no ready transit from her heart to her face .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 31]: This lack of presence in the face is quite common in pretty school-girls and rustic beauties ; but it was manifest to an unusual degree in the case of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 32]: Yet most of the forms and lines in her face were lovely ; and when the light did shine through them for a passing moment , her countenance seemed absolutely beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 28]: Hence it grew into an almost haunting temptation with Hugh , to try to produce this expression , to unveil the coy light of the beautiful soul .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 13]: Often he tried ; often he failed , and sometimes he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 22]: Had they been alone it might have become dangerous -- I mean for Hugh ; I can not tell for Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 36]: When they first met , she had just completed her seventeenth year ; but , at an age when a town-bred girl is all but a woman , her manners were those of a child .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 35]: This childishness , however , soon began to disappear , and the peculiar stillness of her face , of which I have already said so much , made her seem older than she was .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 47]: It was now early summer , and all the other trees in the wood -- of which there were not many besides the firs of various kinds -- had put on their fresh leaves , heaped up in green clouds between the wanderer and the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 37]: In the morning the sun shone so clear upon these , that , to the eyes of one standing beneath , the light seemed to dissolve them away to the most ethereal forms of glorified foliage .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 27]: They were to be claimed for earth only by the shadows that the one cast upon the other , visible from below through the transparent leaf .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 39]: This effect is very lovely in the young season of the year , when the leaves are more delicate and less crowded ; and especially in the early morning , when the light is most clear and penetrating .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 38]: By the way , I do not think any man is compelled to bid good-bye to his childhood : every man may feel young in the morning , middle-aged in the afternoon , and old at night .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 26]: A day corresponds to a life , and the portions of the one are `` pictures in little '' of the seasons of the other .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 23]: Thus far man may rule even time , and gather up , in a perfect being , youth and age at once .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 58]: One morning , about six o'clock , Hugh , who had never been so early in the wood since the day he had met Margaret there , was standing under a beech-tree , looking up through its multitudinous leaves , illuminated , as I have attempted to describe , with the sidelong rays of the brilliant sun .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 21]: He was feeling young , and observing the forms of nature with a keen discriminating gaze : that was all .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 28]: Fond of writing verses , he was studying nature , not as a true lover , but as one who would hereafter turn his discoveries to use .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 48]: For it must be confessed that nature affected him chiefly through the medium of poetry ; and that he was far more ambitious of writing beautiful things about nature than of discovering and understanding , for their own sakes , any of her hidden yet patent meanings .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 36]: Changing his attitude after a few moments , he descried , under another beech-tree , not far from him , Margaret , standing and looking up fixedly as he had been doing a moment before .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 22]: He approached her , and she , hearing his advance , looked , and saw him , but did not move .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 12]: He thought he saw the glimmer of tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 9]: She was the first to speak , however .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 12]: `` What were you seeing up there , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 17]: `` I was only looking at the bright leaves , and the shadows upon them . ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 9]: I thocht maybe ye had seen something . ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 8]: `` I dinna richtly ken mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 11]: But I aye expeck to see something in this fir-wood .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 19]: I 'm here maist mornin 's as the day dawns , but I 'm later the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 12]: `` We were later than usual at our work last night .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 12]: But what kind of thing do you expect to see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 9]: `` That 's jist what I dinna ken .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 19]: An ' I canna min ' whan I began to come here first , luikin ' for something .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 19]: I 've tried mony a time , but I canna min ' , do what I like . ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 10]: Margaret had never said so much about herself before .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 39]: I can account for it only on the supposition that Hugh had gradually assumed in her mind a kind of pastoral superiority , which , at a favourable moment , inclined her to impart her thoughts to him .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 16]: But he did not know what to say to this strange fact in her history .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 22]: She went on , however , as if , having broken the ice , she must sweep it away as well .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 58]: `` The only thing ` at helps me to account for ` t , is a picter in our auld Bible , o ' an angel sittin ' aneth a tree , and haudin ' up his han ' as gin he were speakin ' to a woman ` at 's stan ` in ' afore him .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 74]: Ilka time ` at I come across that picter , I feel direckly as gin I war my lane in this fir-wood here ; sae I suppose that when I was a wee bairn , I maun hae come oot some mornin ' my lane , wi ' the expectation o ' seein ' an angel here waitin ' for me , to speak to me like the ane i ' the Bible .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 8]: But never an angel hae I seen .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 90]: Yet I aye hae an expectation like o ' seein ' something , I kenna what ; for the whole place aye seems fu ' o ' a presence , an ' it 's a hantle mair to me nor the kirk an ' the sermon forby ; an ' for the singin ' , the soun ' i ' the fir-taps is far mair solemn and sweet at the same time , an ' muckle mair like praisin ' o ' God than a ' the psalms thegither .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 42]: But I aye think ` at gin I could hear Milton playin ' on 's organ , it would be mair like that soun ' o ' mony waters , than onything else ` at I can think o ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 9]: Hugh stood and gazed at her in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 29]: To his more refined ear , there was a strange incongruity between the somewhat coarse dialect in which she spoke , and the things she uttered in it .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 19]: Not that he was capable of entering into her feelings , much less of explaining them to her .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 29]: He felt that there was something remarkable in them , but attributed both the thoughts themselves and their influence on him , to an uncommon and weird imagination .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 17]: As of such origin , however , he was just the one to value them highly .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 11]: `` Those are very strange ideas , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: `` But what can there be about the wood ?
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 56]: The very primroses -- ye brocht me the first this spring yersel ' , Mr. Sutherland -- come out at the fit o ' the trees , and look at me as if they said , ` We ken -- we ken a ' aboot it ; ' but never a word mair they say .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 10]: There 's something by ordinar ' i n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 10]: `` Do you like no other place besides ? ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 10]: said Hugh , for the sake of saying something .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 13]: `` Ou ay , mony ane ; but nane like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 11]: `` What kind of place do you like best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 22]: `` I like places wi ' green grass an ' flowers amo ` t. '' `` You like flowers then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 4]: `` Like them !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 31]: whiles they gar me greet an ' whiles they gar me lauch ; but there 's mair i ' them than that , an ' i ' the wood too .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 12]: I canna richtly say my prayers in ony ither place . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 28]: The Scotch dialect , especially to one brought up in the Highlands , was a considerable antidote to the effect of the beauty of what Margaret said .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 21]: Suddenly it struck Hugh , that if Margaret were such an admirer of nature , possibly she might enjoy Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 45]: He himself was as yet incapable of doing him anything like justice ; and , with the arrogance of youth , did not hesitate to smile at the Excursion , picking out an awkward line here and there as especial food for laughter even .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 37]: But many of his smaller pieces he enjoyed very heartily , although not thoroughly -- the element of Christian Pantheism , which is their soul , being beyond his comprehension , almost perception , as yet .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 26]: So he made up his mind , after a moment 's reflection , that this should be the next author he recommended to his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 69]: He hoped likewise so to end an interview , in which he might otherwise be compelled to confess that he could render Margaret no assistance in her search after the something in the wood ; and he was unwilling to say he could not understand her ; for a power of universal sympathy was one of those mental gifts which Hugh was most anxious to believe he possessed .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 36]: `` I will bring you another book to-night , '' said he `` which I think you will like , and which may perhaps help you to find out what is in the wood . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 28]: He said this smiling , half in playful jest , and without any idea of the degree of likelihood that there was notwithstanding in what he said .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 38]: For , certainly , Wordsworth , the high-priest of nature , though perhaps hardly the apostle of nature , was more likely than any other writer to contain something of the secret after which Margaret was searching .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 11]: Whether she can find it there , may seem questionable .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 26]: `` Thank you , sir , '' said Margaret , gratefully ; but her whole countenance looked troubled , as she turned towards her home .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 22]: Doubtless , however , the trouble vanished before she reached it , for hers was not a nature to cherish disquietude .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 8]: Hugh too went home , rather thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 24]: In the evening , he took a volume of Wordsworth , and repaired , according to his wont , to David 's cottage .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 11]: It was Saturday , and he would stay to supper .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 86]: After they had given the usual time to their studies , Hugh , setting Margaret some exercises in English to write on her slate , while he helped David with some of the elements of Trigonometry , and again going over those elements with her , while David worked out a calculation -- after these were over , and while Janet was putting the supper on the table , Hugh pulled out his volume , and , without any preface , read them the Leech-Gatherer .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 37]: All listened very intently , Janet included , who delayed several of the operations , that she might lose no word of the verses ; David nodding assent every now and then , and ejaculating ay !
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 5]: or eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 70]: or producing that strange muffled sound at once common and peculiar to Scotchmen , which can not be expressed in letters by a nearer approach than hm -- hm , uttered , if that can be called uttering , with closed lips and open nasal passage ; and Margaret sitting motionless on her creepie , with upturned pale face , and eyes fixed upon the lips of the reader .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 32]: When he had ceased , all were silent for a moment , when Janet made some little sign of anxiety about her supper , which certainly had suffered by the delay .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 15]: Then , without a word , David turned towards the table and gave thanks .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 33]: Turning again to Hugh , who had risen to place his chair , he said , `` That maun be the wark o ' a great poet , Mr. Sutherlan ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 10]: `` It 's Wordsworth 's , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 5]: That 's Wordsworth 's !
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 2]: Ay !
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 22]: Weel , I hae jist heard him made mention o ' , but I never read word o ' his afore .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 24]: An ' he never repentit o ' that same resolution , I ` se warrant , ` at he eynds aff wi ' .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 10]: Hoo does it gang , Mr. Sutherlan ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 20]: Sutherland read : -- '' ` God , ' said I , ` be my help and stay secure !
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 37]: I 'll think of the leech-gatherer on the lonely moor ; ' '' and added , `` It is said Wordsworth never knew what it was to be in want of money all his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 13]: `` Nae doubt , nae doubt : he trusted in Him . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 37]: It was for the sake of the minute notices of nature , and not for the religious lesson , which he now seemed to see for the first time , that Hugh had read the poem .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 33]: He could not help being greatly impressed by the confidence with which David received the statement he had just made on the authority of De Quincey in his unpleasant article about Wordsworth .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 29]: David resumed : `` He maun hae had a gleg ` ee o ' his ain , that Maister Wordsworth , to notice a ` thing that get .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 24]: Weel he maun hae likit leevin ' things , puir maukin an ' a ' -- jist like our Robbie Burns for that .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 14]: An ' see hoo they a ' ken ane anither , thae poets .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 6]: What says he aboot Burns ?
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 16]: -- ye needna tell me , Mr. Sutherlan ' ; I mi n't weel aneuch .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 25]: He says : -- ` Him wha walked in glory an ' in joy , Followin ' his ploo upo ' the muntain-side . '
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 3]: Puir Robbie !
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 3]: puir Robbie !
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 28]: But , man , he was a gran ' chield efter a ' ; an ' I trust in God he 's won hame by this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 57]: Both Janet and Hugh , who had had a very orthodox education , started , mentally , at this strange utterance ; but they saw the eye of David solemnly fixed , as if in deep contemplation , and lighted in its blue depths with an ethereal brightness ; and neither of them ventured to speak .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 28]: Margaret seemed absorbed for the moment in gazing on her father 's face ; but not in the least as if it perplexed her like the fir-wood .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 53]: To the seeing eye , the same kind of expression would have been evident in both countenances , as if Margaret 's reflected the meaning of her father 's ; whether through the medium of intellectual sympathy , or that of the heart only , it would have been hard to say .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 39]: Meantime supper had been rather neglected ; but its operations were now resumed more earnestly , and the conversation became lighter ; till at last it ended in hearty laughter , and Hugh rose and took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 4]: A SUNDAY MORNING .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 59]: It is the property of good and sound knowledge , to putrifie and dissolve into a number of subtle , idle , unwholesome , and -LRB- as I may tearme them -RRB- vermiculate questions ; which have indeed a kinde of quicknesse , and life of spirite , but no soundnesse of matter , or goodnesse of quality .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 4]: -- LORD BACON .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 5]: -- Advancement of Learning .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 20]: The following morning , the laird 's family went to church as usual , and Hugh went with them .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 38]: Their walk was first across fields , by pleasant footpaths ; and then up the valley of a little noisy stream , that obstinately refused to keep Scotch Sabbath , praising the Lord after its own fashion .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 42]: They emerged into rather a bleak country before reaching the church , which was quite new , and perched on a barren eminence , that it might be as conspicuous by its position , as it was remarkable for its ugliness .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 44]: One grand aim of the reformers of the Scottish ecclesiastical modes , appears to have been to keep the worship pure and the worshippers sincere , by embodying the whole in the ugliest forms that could be associated with the name of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 88]: It might be wished , however , that some of their followers , and amongst them the clergyman of the church in question , had been content to stop there ; and had left the object of worship , as represented by them , in the possession of some lovable attribute ; so as not to require a man to love that which is unlovable , or worship that which is not honourable -- in a word , to bow down before that which is not divine .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 23]: The cause of this degeneracy they share in common with the followers of all other great men as well as of Calvin .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 42]: They take up what their leader , urged by the necessity of the time , spoke loudest , never heeding what he loved most ; and then work the former out to a logical perdition of everything belonging to the latter .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 57]: Hugh , however , thought it was all right : for he had the same good reasons , and no other , for receiving it all , that a Mohammedan or a Buddhist has for holding his opinions ; namely , that he had heard those doctrines , and those alone , from his earliest childhood .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 63]: He was therefore a good deal startled when , having , on his way home , strayed from the laird 's party towards David 's , he heard the latter say to Margaret as he came up : `` Dinna ye believe , my bonny doo , ` at there 's ony mak ' ups or mak ' shifts wi ' Him .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 28]: He 's aye bringin ' things to the licht , no covenin ' them up and lattin them rot , an ' the moth tak ' them .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 17]: He sees us jist as we are , and ca 's us jist what we are .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 60]: It wad be an ill day for a ' o 's , Maggy , my doo , gin he war to close his een to oor sins , an ' ca ' us just in his sicht , whan we cudna possibly be just in oor ain or in ony ither body 's , no to say his . ''
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 9]: `` The Lord preserve 's , Dawvid Elginbrod !
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 26]: Dinna ye believe i ' the doctrine o ' Justification by Faith , an ' you a ` maist made an elder o ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 13]: Janet was the respondent , of course , Margaret listening in silence .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 16]: `` Ou ay , I believe i n't , nae doot ; but , troth !
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 45]: the minister , honest man , near-han ' gart me disbelieve i n't a ` thegither wi ' his gran ' sermon this mornin ' , about imputit richteousness , an ' a clean robe hidin ' a foul skin or a crookit back .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 4]: Na , na .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 38]: May Him ` at woosh the feet o ' his friens , wash us a ` thegither , and straucht oor crookit banes , till we 're clean and weel-faured like his ain bonny sel ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 14]: `` Weel , Dawvid -- but that 's sanctificaition , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 19]: `` Ca ' t ony name ` at you or the minister likes , Janet , my woman .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 52]: I daursay there 's neither o ' ye far wrang after a ' ; only this is jist my opingan aboot it in sma ' -- that that man , and that man only , is justifeed , wha pits himsel ' into the Lord 's han 's to sanctifee him .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 2]: Noo !
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 30]: An ' that 'll no be dune by pittin ' a robe o ' richteousness upo ' him , afore he 's gotten a clean skin aneath ` t .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 47]: As gin a father cudna bide to see the puir scabbit skin o ' his ain wee bit bairnie , ay , or o ' his prodigal son either , but bude to hap it a ' up afore he cud lat it come near him !
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 3]: Ahva ! ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 8]: Here Hugh ventured to interpose a remark .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 45]: `` But you do n't think , Mr. Elginbrod , that the minister intended to say that justification left a man at liberty to sin , or that the robe of Christ 's righteousness would hide him from the work of the Spirit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 19]: `` Na ; but there is a notion i n't o ' hidin ' frae God himsel ' .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 107]: I 'll tell ye what it is Mr. Sutherlan ' : the minister 's a ' richt in himsel ' , an ' sae 's my Janet here , an ' mony mair ; an ' aiblins there 's a kin ' o ' trowth in a ' ` at they say ; but this is my quarrel wi ' a ' thae words an ' words an ' airguments , an ' seemilies as they ca ' them , an ' doctrines , an ' a ' that -- they jist haud a puir body at airm 's lenth oot ower frae God himsel ' .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 67]: An ' they raise a mist an ' a stour a ' aboot him , ` at the puir bairn canna see the Father himsel ' , stan ` in ' wi ' his airms streekit oot as wide 's the heavens , to tak ' the worn crater , -- and the mair sinner , the mair welcome , -- hame to his verra hert .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 46]: Gin a body wad lea ' a ' that , and jist get fowk persuâdit to speyk a word or twa to God him lane , the loss , in my opingan , wad be unco sma ' , and the gain verra great . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 35]: Even Janet dared not reply to the solemnity of this speech ; for the seer-like look was upon David 's face , and the tears had gathered in his eyes and dimmed their blue .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 35]: A kind of tremulous pathetic smile flickered about his beautifully curved mouth , like the glimmer of water in a valley , betwixt the lofty aquiline nose and the powerful but finely modelled chin .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 25]: It seemed as if he dared not let the smile break out , lest it should be followed instantly by a burst of tears .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 31]: Margaret went close up to her father and took his hand as if she had been still a child , while Janet walked reverentially by him on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 41]: It must not be supposed that Janet felt any uneasiness about her husband 's opinions , although she never hesitated to utter what she considered her common-sense notions , in attempted modification of some of the more extreme of them .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 61]: The fact was that , if he was wrong , Janet did not care to be right ; and if he was right , Janet was sure to be ; `` for , '' said she -- and in spirit , if not in the letter , it was quite true -- `` I never mint at contradickin ' him .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 13]: My man sall hae his ain get , that sall he . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 72]: But she had one especial grudge at his opinions ; which was , that it must have been in consequence of them that he had declined , with a queer smile , the honourable position of Elder of the Kirk ; for which Janet considered him , notwithstanding his opinions , immeasurably more fitted than any other man `` in the haill country-side -- ye may add Scotlan ' forby . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 33]: The fact of his having been requested to fill the vacant place of Elder , is proof enough that David was not in the habit of giving open expression to his opinions .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 34]: He was looked upon as a douce man , long-headed enough , and somewhat precise in the exaction of the laird 's rights , but open-hearted and open-handed with what was his own .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 57]: Every one respected him , and felt kindly towards him ; some were a little afraid of him ; but few suspected him of being religious beyond the degree which is commonly supposed to be the general inheritance of Scotchmen , possibly in virtue of their being brought up upon oatmeal porridge and the Shorter Catechism .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 26]: Hugh walked behind the party for a short way , contemplating them in their Sunday clothes : David wore a suit of fine black cloth .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 10]: He then turned to rejoin the laird 's company .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 18]: Mrs. Glasford was questioning her boys , in an intermittent and desultory fashion , about the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 17]: `` An ' what was the fourth heid , can ye tell me , Willie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 56]: Willie , the eldest , who had carefully impressed the fourth head upon his memory , and had been anxiously waiting for an opportunity of bringing it out , replied at once : `` Fourthly : The various appellations by which those who have indued the robe of righteousness are designated in Holy Writ . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 7]: `` Weel done , Willie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 4]: cried the laird .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 12]: `` That 's richt , Willie , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 20]: Then turning to the younger , whose attention was attracted by a strange bird in the hedge in front .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 17]: `` An ' what called he them , Johnnie , that put on the robe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 16]: `` Whited sepulchres , '' answered Johnnie , indebted for his wit to his wool-gathering .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 8]: This put an end to the catechising .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 73]: Mrs. Glasford glanced round at Hugh , whose defection she had seen with indignation , and who , waiting for them by the roadside , had heard the last question and reply , with an expression that seemed to attribute any defect in the answer , entirely to the carelessness of the tutor , and the withdrawal of his energies from her boys to that `` saucy quean , Meg Elginbrod . ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 2]: NATURE .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 36]: When the Soul is kindled or enlightened by the Holy Ghost , then it beholds what God its Father does , as a Son beholds what his Father does at Home in his own House .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 10]: -- JACOB BEHMEN 'S Aurora -- Law 's Translation .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 16]: Margaret began to read Wordsworth , slowly at first , but soon with greater facility .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 68]: Ere long she perceived that she had found a friend ; for not only did he sympathize with her in her love for nature , putting many vague feelings into thoughts , and many thoughts into words for her , but he introduced her to nature in many altogether new aspects , and taught her to regard it in ways which had hitherto been unknown to her .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 35]: Not only was the pine wood now dearer to her than before , but its mystery seemed more sacred , and , at the same time , more likely to be one day solved .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 62]: She felt far more assuredly the presence of a spirit in nature , `` Whose dwelling is the light of setting suns , And the round ocean , and the living air ; '' for he taught her to take wider views of nature , and to perceive and feel the expressions of more extended aspects of the world around her .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 41]: The purple hill-side was almost as dear to her as the fir-wood now ; and the star that crowned its summit at eve , sparkled an especial message to her , before it went on its way up the blue .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 22]: She extended her rambles in all directions , and began to get with the neighbours the character of an idle girl .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 74]: Little they knew how early she rose , and how diligently she did her share of the work , urged by desire to read the word of God in his own handwriting ; or rather , to pore upon that expression of the face of God , which , however little a man may think of it , yet sinks so deeply into his nature , and moulds it towards its own likeness .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 28]: Nature was doing for Margaret what she had done before for Wordsworth 's Lucy : she was making of her `` a lady of her own . ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 7]: She grew taller and more graceful .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 26]: The lasting quiet of her face began to look as if it were ever upon the point of blossoming into an expression of lovely feeling .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 28]: The principal change was in her mouth , which became delicate and tender in its curves , the lips seeming to kiss each other for very sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 26]: But I am anticipating these changes , for it took a far longer time to perfect them than has yet been occupied by my story .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 55]: But even her mother was not altogether proof against the appearance of listlessness and idleness which Margaret 's behaviour sometimes wore to her eyes ; nor could she quite understand or excuse her long lonely walks ; so that now and then she could not help addressing her after this fashion : `` Meg !
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 2]: Meg !
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 17]: ye do try my patience , lass , idlin ' awa ' yer time that get .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 31]: It 's an awfu ' wastery o ' time , what wi ' beuks , an ' what wi ' stravaguin ' , an ' what wi ' naething ava .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 16]: Jist pit yer han ' to this kirn noo , like a gude bairn . ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 58]: Margaret would obey her mother instantly , but with a look of silent expostulation which her mother could not resist ; sometimes , perhaps , if the words were sharper than usual , with symptoms of gathering tears ; upon which Janet would say , with her honest smile of sweet relenting , `` Hootoots , bairn !
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 4]: never heed me .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 14]: My bark 's aye waur nor my bite ; ye ken that . ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 54]: Then Margaret 's face would brighten at once , and she would work hard at whatever her mother set her to do , till it was finished ; upon which her mother would be more glad than she , and in no haste to impose any further labour out of the usual routine .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 18]: In the course of reading Wordsworth , Margaret had frequent occasion to apply to Hugh for help .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 26]: These occasions , however , generally involved no more than small external difficulties , which prevented her from taking in the scope of a passage .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 80]: Hugh was always able to meet these , and Margaret supposed that the whole of the light which flashed upon her mind when they were removed , was poured upon the page by the wisdom of her tutor ; never dreaming -- such was her humility with regard to herself , and her reverence towards him -- that it came from the depths of her own lucent nature , ready to perceive what the poet came prepared to show .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 59]: Now and then , it is true , she applied to him with difficulties in which he was incapable of aiding her ; but she put down her failure in discovering the meaning , after all which it must be confessed he sometimes tried to say , to her own stupidity or peculiarity -- never to his incapacity .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 75]: She had been helped to so much by his superior acquirements , and his real gift for communicating what he thoroughly understood ; he had been so entirely her guide to knowledge , that she would at once have felt self-condemned of impiety -- in the old meaning of the word -- if she had doubted for a moment his ability to understand or explain any difficulty which she could place clearly before him .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 16]: By-and-by he began to lend her harder , that is , more purely intellectual books .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 44]: He was himself preparing for the class of Moral Philosophy and Metaphysics ; and he chose for her some of the simpler of his books on these subjects -- of course all of the Scotch school -- beginning with Abercrombie 's Intellectual Powers .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 13]: She took this eagerly , and evidently read it with great attention .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 49]: One evening in the end of summer , Hugh climbed a waste heathery hill that lay behind the house of Turriepuffit , and overlooked a great part of the neighbouring country , the peaks of some of the greatest of the Scotch mountains being visible from its top .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 9]: Here he intended to wait for the sunset .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 69]: He threw himself on the heather , that most delightful and luxurious of all couches , supporting the body with a kindly upholding of every part ; and there he lay in the great slumberous sunlight of the late afternoon , with the blue heavens , into which he was gazing full up , closing down upon him , as the light descended the side of the sky .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 5]: He fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 26]: If ever there be an excuse for falling asleep out of bed , surely it is when stretched at full length upon heather in bloom .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 32]: When he awoke , the last of the sunset was dying away ; and between him and the sunset sat Margaret , book in hand , waiting apparently for his waking .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 20]: He lay still for a few minutes , to come to himself before she should see he was awake .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 46]: But she rose at the moment , and drawing near very quietly , looked down upon him with her sweet sunset face , to see whether or not he was beginning to rouse , for she feared to let him lie much longer after sundown .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 21]: Finding him awake , she drew back again without a word , and sat down as before with her book .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 25]: At length he rose , and , approaching her , said -- `` Well , Margaret , what book are you at now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 10]: `` Dr. Abercrombie , sir , '' replied Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 8]: `` How do you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 7]: `` Verra weel for some things .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 19]: It makes a body think ; but not a ` thegither as I like to think either . ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 22]: It will be observed that Margaret 's speech had begun to improve , that is , to be more like English .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: `` What is the matter with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 25]: `` Weel , ye see , sir , it taks a body a ' to bits like , and never pits them together again .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 70]: An ' it seems to me that a body 's min ' or soul , or whatever it may be called -- but it 's jist a body 's ain sel ' -- can no more be ta'en to pieces like , than you could tak ' that red licht there oot o ' the blue , or the haill sunset oot o ' the heavens an ' earth .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 14]: It may be a ' verra weel , Mr. Sutherland , but oh !
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 7]: it 's no like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 32]: And Margaret looked around her from the hill-top , and then up into the heavens , where the stars were beginning to crack the blue with their thin , steely sparkle .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 21]: `` It seems to me to tak ' a ' the poetry oot o ' us , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 40]: `` Well , well , '' said Hugh , with a smile , `` you must just go to Wordsworth to put it in again ; or to set you again up after Dr. Abercrombie has demolished you . ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 26]: `` Na , na , sir , he sanna demolish me : nor I winna trouble Mr. Wordsworth to put the poetry into me again .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 36]: A ' the power on earth shanna tak ' that oot o ' me , gin it be God 's will ; for it 's his ain gift , Mr. Sutherland , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 54]: `` Of course , of course , '' replied Hugh , who very likely thought this too serious a way of speaking of poetry , and therefore , perhaps , rather an irreverent way of speaking of God ; for he saw neither the divine in poetry , nor the human in God .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 29]: Could he be said to believe that God made man , when he did not believe that God created poetry -- and yet loved it as he did ?
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 15]: It was to him only a grand invention of humanity in its loftiest development .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 33]: In this development , then , he must have considered humanity as farthest from its origin ; and God as the creator of savages , caring nothing for poets or their work .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 15]: They turned , as by common consent , to go down the hill together .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 10]: `` Shall I take charge of the offending volume ?
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 15]: You will not care to finish it , I fear , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 9]: `` No , sir , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 8]: I never like to leave onything unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 8]: I 'll read ilka word i n't .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 104]: I fancy the thing ` at sets me against it , is mostly this ; that , readin ' it alang wi ' Euclid , I canna help aye thinkin ' o ' my ain min ' as gin it were in some geometrical shape or ither , whiles ane an ' whiles anither ; and syne I try to draw lines an ' separate this power frae that power , the memory frae the jeedgement , an ' the imagination frae the rizzon ; an ' syne I try to pit them a ' thegither again in their relations to ane anither .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 20]: And this aye takes the shape o ' some proposition or ither , generally i ' the second beuk .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 7]: It near-han ' dazes me whiles .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 37]: I fancy gin ' I understood the pairts o ' the sphere , it would be mair to the purpose ; but I wat I wish I were clear o ' t a ` thegither . ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 20]: Hugh had had some experiences of a similar kind himself , though not at all to the same extent .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 6]: He could therefore understand her .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 28]: `` You must just try to keep the things altogether apart , '' said he , `` and not think of the two sciences at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 11]: `` But I canna help it , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 14]: `` I suppose you can , sir , because ye 're a man .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 16]: My father can understan ' things ten times better nor me an ' my mother .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 48]: But nae sooner do I begin to read and think about it , than up comes ane o ' thae parallelograms , an ' nothing will driv ' t oot o ' my head again , but a verse or twa o ' Coleridge or Wordsworth . ''
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 25]: Hugh immediately began to repeat the first poem of the latter that occurred to him : `` I wandered lonely as a cloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 33]: She listened , walking along with her eyes fixed on the ground ; and when he had finished , gave a sigh of delight and relief -- all the comment she uttered .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 32]: She seemed never to find it necessary to say what she felt ; least of all when the feeling was a pleasant one ; for then it was enough for itself .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 32]: This was only the second time since their acquaintance , that she had spoken of her feelings at all ; and in this case they were of a purely intellectual origin .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 30]: It is to be observed , however , that in both cases she had taken pains to explain thoroughly what she meant , as far as she was able .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 26]: It was dark before they reached home , at least as dark as it ever is at this season of the year in the north .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 25]: They found David looking out with some slight anxiety for his daughter 's return , for she was seldom out so late as this .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 29]: In nothing could the true relation between them have been more evident than in the entire absence from her manner of any embarrassment when she met her father .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 34]: She went up to him and told him all about finding Mr. Sutherland asleep on the hill , and waiting beside him till he woke , that she might walk home with him .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 51]: Her father seemed perfectly content with an explanation which he had not sought , and , turning to Hugh , said , smiling : `` Weel , no to be troublesome , Mr. Sutherlan ' , ye maun gie the auld man a turn as weel as the young lass .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 25]: We didna expec ye the nicht , but I 'm sair puzzled wi ' a sma ' eneuch matter on my sklet in there .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 12]: Will you no come in and gie me a lift ? ''
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 10]: `` With all my heart , '' said Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 9]: So there were five lessons in that week .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 23]: When Hugh entered the cottage he had a fine sprig of heather in his hand , which he laid on the table .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 40]: He had the weakness of being proud of small discoveries -- the tinier the better ; and was always sharpening his senses , as well as his intellect , to a fine point , in order to make them .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 25]: I fear that by these means he shut out some great ones , which could not enter during such a concentration of the faculties .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 27]: He would stand listening to the sound of goose-feet upon the road , and watch how those webs laid hold of the earth like a hand .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 17]: He would struggle to enter into their feelings in folding their wings properly on their backs .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 24]: He would calculate , on chemical and arithmetical grounds , whether one might not hear the nocturnal growth of plants in the tropics .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 62]: He was quite elated by the discovery , as he considered it , that Shakspeare named his two officers of the watch , Dogberry and Verjuice ; the poisonous Dogberry , and the acid liquor of green fruits , affording suitable names for the stupidly innocuous constables , in a play the very essence of which is Much Ado About Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 24]: Another of his discoveries he had , during their last lesson , unfolded to David , who had certainly contemplated it with interest .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 16]: It was , that the original forms of the Arabic numerals were these : 1.2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9 .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 28]: -LCB- original text has a picture -RCB- the number for which each figure stands being indicated by the number of straight lines employed in forming that numeral .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 21]: I fear the comparative anatomy of figures gives no countenance to the discovery which Hugh flattered himself he had made .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 32]: After he had helped David out of his difficulty , he took up the heather , and stripping off the bells , shook them in his hand at Margaret 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 42]: A half smile , like the moonlight of laughter , dawned on her face ; and she listened with something of the same expression with which a child listens to the message from the sea , inclosed in a twisted shell .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 10]: He did the same at David 's ear next .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 5]: `` Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 8]: that 's a bonny wee soun ' !
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 19]: It 's jist like sma ' sheep-bells -- fairy-sheep , I reckon , Maggy , my doo . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 11]: `` Lat me hearken as weel , '' said Janet .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 3]: Hugh obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 9]: `` It 's naething but a reestlin ' .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 16]: I wad raither hear the sheep baain ' , or the kye routin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 7]: `` Eh , Mr. Sutherlan ' !
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 13]: but , ye hae a gleg ee an ' a sharp lug .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 20]: Weel , the warld 's fu ' o ' bonny sichts and souns , doon to the verra sma'est .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 6]: The Lord lats naething gang .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 51]: I wadna wonner noo but there micht be thousands sic like , ower sma ' a ` thegither for human ears , jist as we ken there are creatures as perfect in beowty as ony we see , but far ower sma ' for our een wintin ' the glass .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 42]: But for my pairt , I aye like to see a heap o ' things at ance , an ' tak ' them a ' in thegither , an ' see them playin ' into ane anither 's han ' like .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 86]: I was jist thinkin ' , as I came hame the nicht in the sinset , hoo it wad hae been naewise sae complete , wi ' a ' its red an ' gowd an ' green , gin it hadna been for the cauld blue east ahint it , wi ' the twa-three shiverin ' starnies leukin ' through ` t. An ' doubtless the warld to come ` ill be a ' the warmer to them ` at hadna ower muckle happin here .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 26]: But I 'm jist haverin ' , clean haverin ' , Mr. Sutherlan ' , '' concluded David , with a smile of apologetic humour .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 47]: `` I suppose you could easily believe with Plato , David , that the planets make a grand choral music as they roll about the heavens , only that as some sounds are too small , so that is too loud for us to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 14]: `` I cud weel believe that , '' was David 's unhesitating answer .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 22]: Margaret looked as if she not only could believe it , but would be delighted to know that it was true .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 13]: Neither Janet nor Hugh gave any indication of feeling on the matter .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 4]: CHAPTER X. HARVEST .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 57]: So a small seed that in the earth lies hid And dies , reviving bursts her cloddy side , Adorned with yellow locks , of new is born , And doth become a mother great with corn , Of grains brings hundreds with it , which when old Enrich the furrows with a sea of gold .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 4]: SIR WILLIAM DRUMMOND .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 6]: -- Hymn of the Resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 64]: Hugh had watched the green corn grow , and ear , and turn dim ; then brighten to yellow , and ripen at last under the declining autumn sun , and the low skirting moon of the harvest , which seems too full and heavy with mellow and bountiful light to rise high above the fields which it comes to bless with perfection .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 98]: The long threads , on each of which hung an oat-grain -- the harvest here was mostly of oats -- had got dry and brittle ; and the grains began to spread out their chaff-wings , as if ready to fly , and rustled with sweet sounds against each other , as the wind , which used to billow the fields like the waves of the sea , now swept gently and tenderly over it , helping the sun and moon in the drying and ripening of the joy to be laid up for the dreary winter .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 37]: Most graceful of all hung those delicate oats ; next bowed the bearded barley ; and stately and wealthy and strong stood the few fields of wheat , of a rich , ruddy , golden hue .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 41]: Above the yellow harvest rose the purple hills , and above the hills the pale-blue autumnal sky , full of light and heat , but fading somewhat from the colour with which it deepened above the vanished days of summer .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 11]: For the harvest here is much later than in England .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 26]: At length the day arrived when the sickle must be put into the barley , soon to be followed by the scythe in the oats .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 8]: And now came the joy of labour .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: Everything else was abandoned for the harvest field .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 59]: Books were thrown utterly aside ; for , even when there was no fear of a change of weather to urge to labour prolonged beyond the natural hours , there was weariness enough in the work of the day to prevent even David from reading , in the hours of bodily rest , anything that necessitated mental labour .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 37]: Janet and Margaret betook themselves to the reaping-hook ; and the somewhat pale face of the latter needed but a single day to change it to the real harvest hue -- the brown livery of Ceres .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 14]: But when the oats were attacked , then came the tug of war .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 49]: The laird was in the fields from morning to night , and the boys would not stay behind ; but , with their father 's permission , much to the tutor 's contentment , devoted what powers they had to the gathering of the fruits of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 38]: Hugh himself , whose strength had grown amazingly during his stay at Turriepuffit , and who , though he was quite helpless at the sickle , thought he could wield the scythe , would not be behind .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 36]: Throwing off coat and waistcoat , and tying his handkerchief tight round his loins , he laid hold on the emblematic weapon of Time and Death , determined likewise to earn the name of Reaper .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 6]: He took the last scythe .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 75]: It was desperate work for a while , and he was far behind the first bout ; but David , who was the best scyther in the whole country side , and of course had the leading scythe , seeing the tutor dropping behind , put more power to his own arm , finished his own bout , and brought up Hugh 's before the others had done sharpening their scythes for the next .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 17]: `` Tak ' care an ' nae rax yersel ' ower sair , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 33]: Ye 'll be up wi ' the best o ' them in a day or twa ; but gin ye tyauve at it aboon yer strenth , ye 'll be clean forfochten .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 38]: Tak ' a guid sweep wi ' the scythe , ` at ye may hae the weicht o ' t to ca ' through the strae , an ' tak ' nae shame at bein ' hindmost .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 16]: Here , Maggy , my doo , come an ' gather to Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 17]: Ane o ' the young gentlemen can tak ' your place at the binin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 87]: The work of Janet and Margaret had been to form bands for the sheaves , by folding together cunningly the heads of two small handfuls of the corn , so as to make them long enough together to go round the sheaf ; then to lay this down for the gatherer to place enough of the mown corn upon it ; and last , to bind the band tightly around by another skilful twist and an insertion of the ends , and so form a sheaf .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 23]: From this work David called his daughter , desirous of giving Hugh a gatherer who would not be disrespectful to his awkwardness .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 45]: This arrangement , however , was far from pleasing to some of the young men in the field , and brought down upon Hugh , who was too hard-wrought to hear them at first , many sly hits of country wit and human contempt .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 58]: There had been for some time great jealousy of his visits at David 's cottage ; for Margaret , though she had very little acquaintance with the young men of the neighbourhood , was greatly admired amongst them , and not regarded as so far above the station of many of them as to render aspiration useless .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 45]: Their remarks to each other got louder and louder , till Hugh at last heard some of them , and could not help being annoyed , not by their wit or personality , but by the tone of contempt in which they were uttered .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 11]: `` Tak ' care o ' yer legs , sir .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: It 'll be ill cuttin ' upo ' stumps . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 3]: `` Fegs !
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 12]: he 's taen the wings aff o ' a pairtrick . ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 17]: `` Gin he gang on that get , he 'll cut twa bouts at ance . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 12]: `` Ye 'll hae the scythe ower the dyke , man .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 5]: Tak ' tent . ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 3]: `` Losh !
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 13]: sir ; ye 've taen aff my leg at the hip ! ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 17]: `` Ye 're shavin ' ower close : ye 'll draw the bluid , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 5]: `` Hoot , man !
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 3]: lat alane .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 19]: The gentleman 's only mista'en his trade , an ' imaigins he 's howkin ' a grave . ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 15]: Hugh gave no further sign of hearing their remarks than lay in increased exertion .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 19]: Looking round , however , he saw that Margaret was vexed , evidently not for her own sake .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 51]: He smiled to her , to console her for his annoyance ; and then , ambitious to remove the cause of it , made a fresh exertion , recovered all his distance , and was in his own place with the best of them at the end of the bout .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 42]: But the smile that had passed between them did not escape unobserved ; and he had aroused yet more the wrath of the youths , by threatening soon to rival them in the excellencies to which they had an especial claim .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 43]: They had regarded him as an interloper , who had no right to captivate one of their rank by arts beyond their reach ; but it was still less pardonable to dare them to a trial of skill with their own weapons .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 31]: To the fire of this jealousy , the admiration of the laird added fuel ; for he was delighted with the spirit with which Hugh laid himself to the scythe .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 20]: But all the time , nothing was further from Hugh 's thoughts than the idea of rivalry with them .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 53]: Whatever he might have thought of Margaret in relation to himself , he never thought of her , though labouring in the same field with them , as in the least degree belonging to their class , or standing in any possible relation to them , except that of a common work .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 30]: In ordinary , the labourers would have had sufficient respect for Sutherland 's superior position , to prevent them from giving such decided and articulate utterance to their feelings .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 47]: But they were incited by the presence and example of a man of doubtful character from the neighbouring village , a travelled and clever ne'er - do-weel , whose reputation for wit was equalled by his reputation for courage and skill , as well as profligacy .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 36]: Roused by the effervescence of his genius , they went on from one thing to another , till Hugh saw it must be put a stop to somehow , else he must abandon the field .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 46]: They dared not have gone so far if David had been present ; but he had been called away to superintend some operations in another part of the estate ; and they paid no heed to the expostulations of some of the other older men .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 41]: At the close of the day 's work , therefore , Hugh walked up to this fellow , and said : `` I hope you will be satisfied with insulting me all to-day , and leave it alone to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 35]: The man replied , with an oath and a gesture of rude contempt , `` I dinna care the black afore my nails for ony skelp-doup o ' the lot o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 26]: Hugh 's highland blood flew to his brain , and before the rascal finished his speech , he had measured his length on the stubble .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 50]: He sprang to his feet in a fury , threw off the coat which he had just put on , and darted at Hugh , who had by this time recovered his coolness , and was besides , notwithstanding his unusual exertions , the more agile of the two .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 8]: The other was heavier and more powerful .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 26]: Hugh sprang aside , as he would have done from the rush of a bull , and again with a quick blow felled his antagonist .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 33]: Beginning rather to enjoy punishing him , he now went in for it ; and , before the other would yield , he had rendered his next day 's labour somewhat doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 16]: He withdrew , with no more injury to himself than a little water would remove .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 13]: Janet and Margaret had left the field before he addressed the man .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 18]: He went borne and to bed -- more weary than he had ever been in his life .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 34]: Before he went to sleep , however , he made up his mind to say nothing of his encounter to David , but to leave him to hear of it from other sources .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 15]: He could not help feeling a little anxious as to his judgment upon it .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 19]: That the laird would approve , he hardly doubted ; but for his opinion he cared very little .
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 38]: `` Dawvid , I wonner at ye , '' said Janet to her husband , the moment he came home , `` to lat the young lad warstle himsel ' deid that get wi ' a scythe .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 26]: His banes is but saft yet , There wasna a dry steek on him or he wan half the lenth o ' the first bout .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 12]: He 's sair disjaskit , I ` se warran ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 15]: `` Nae fear o ' him , Janet ; it 'll do him guid .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: Mr. Sutherland 's no feckless winlestrae o ' a creater .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 14]: Did he haud his ain at a ' wi ' the lave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 5]: `` Haud his ain !
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 35]: Gin he be fit for onything the day , he maun be pitten neist yersel ' , or he 'll cut the legs aff o ' ony ither man i ' the corn . ''
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 17]: A glow of pleasure mantled in Margaret 's face at her mother 's praise of Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 26]: Janet went on : `` But I was jist clean affronted wi ' the way ` at the young chields behaved themselves till him . ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 71]: `` I thocht I heard a toot-moot o ' that kin ' afore I left , but I thocht it better to tak ' nae notice o ` t. I 'll be wi ' ye a ' day the morn though , an ' I 'm thinkin ' I 'll clap a rouch han ' on their mou 's ` at I hear ony mair o ' t frae . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: But there was no occasion for interference on David 's part .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 52]: Hugh made his appearance -- not , it is true , with the earliest in the hairst-rig , but after breakfast with the laird , who was delighted with the way in which he had handled his scythe the day before , and felt twice the respect for him in consequence .

WARNING: Untokenizable:  (U+9C, decimal: 156)
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 40]: It must be confessed he felt very stiff , but the best treatment for stiffness being the hom opathic one of more work , he had soon restored the elasticity of his muscles , and lubricated his aching joints .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 25]: His antagonist of the foregoing evening was nowhere to be seen ; and the rest of the young men were shame-faced and respectful enough .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 63]: David , having learned from some of the spectators the facts of the combat , suddenly , as they were walking home together , held out his hand to Hugh , shook his hard , and said : `` Mr. Sutherlan ' , I 'm sair obleeged to ye for giein ' that vratch , Jamie Ogg , a guid doonsettin ' .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 28]: He 's a coorse crater ; but the warst maun hae meat , an ' sae I didna like to refeese him when he cam for wark .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 15]: But its a greater kin ` ness to clout him nor to cleed him .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 12]: They say ye made an awfu ' munsie o ' him .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 13]: But it 's to be houpit he 'll live to thank ye .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 36]: There 's some fowk ` at can respeck no airgument but frae steekit neives ; an ' it 's fell cruel to haud it frae them , gin ye hae ' t to gie them .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 31]: I hae had eneuch ado to haud my ain han 's aff o ' the ted , but it comes a hantle better frae you , Mr. Sutherlan ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 16]: Hugh wielded the scythe the whole of the harvest , and Margaret gathered to him .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 94]: By the time it was over , leading-home and all , he measured an inch less about the waist , and two inches more about the shoulders ; and was as brown as a berry , and as strong as an ox , or `` owse , '' as David called it , when thus describing Mr. Sutherland 's progress in corporal development ; for he took a fatherly pride in the youth , to whom , at the same time , he looked up with submission , as his master in learning .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 6]: A CHANGE AND NO CHANGE .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 38]: Affliction , when I know it , is but this -- A deep alloy , whereby man tougher is To bear the hammer ; and the deeper still , We still arise more image of his will .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 21]: Sickness -- an humorous cloud ` twist us and light ; And death , at longest , but another night .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 20]: Man is his own star ; and that soul that can Be honest , is the only perfect Man .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 3]: JOHN FLETCHER .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 8]: -- Upon an Honest Man 's Fortune .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 129]: Had Sutherland been in love with Margaret , those would have been happy days ; and that a yet more happy night , when , under the mystery of a low moonlight and a gathering storm , the crop was cast in haste into the carts , and hurried home to be built up in safety ; when a strange low wind crept sighing across the stubble , as if it came wandering out of the past and the land of dreams , lying far off and withered in the green west ; and when Margaret and he came and went in the moonlight like creatures in a dream -- for the vapours of sleep were floating in Hugh 's brain , although he was awake and working .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 38]: `` Margaret , '' he said , as they stood waiting a moment for the cart that was coming up to be filled with sheaves , `` what does that wind put you in mind of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 15]: `` Ossian 's Poems , '' replied Margaret , without a moment 's hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 7]: Hugh was struck by her answer .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 7]: He had meant something quite different .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 80]: But it harmonized with his feeling about Ossian ; for the genuineness of whose poetry , Highlander as he was , he had no better argument to give than the fact , that they produced in himself an altogether peculiar mental condition ; that the spiritual sensations he had in reading them were quite different from those produced by anything else , prose or verse ; in fact , that they created moods of their own in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 58]: He was unwilling to believe , apart from national prejudices -LRB- which have not prevented the opinions on this question from being as strong on the one side as on the other -RRB- , that this individuality of influence could belong to mere affectations of a style which had never sprung from the sources of real feeling .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 54]: `` Could they , '' he thought , `` possess the power to move us like remembered dreams of our childhood , if all that they possessed of reality was a pretended imitation of what never existed , and all that they inherited from the past was the halo of its strangeness ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 21]: But Hugh was not in love with Margaret , though he could not help feeling the pleasure of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 50]: Any youth must have been the better for having her near him ; but there was nothing about her quiet , self-contained being , free from manifestation of any sort , to rouse the feelings commonly called love , in the mind of an inexperienced youth like Hugh Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 24]: -- I say commonly called , because I believe that within the whole sphere of intelligence there are no two loves the same .
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: -- Not that he was less easily influenced than other youths .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 46]: A designing girl might have caught him at once , if she had had no other beauty than sparkling eyes ; but the womanhood of the beautiful Margaret kept so still in its pearly cave , that it rarely met the glance of neighbouring eyes .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 25]: How Margaret regarded him I do not know ; but I think it was with a love almost entirely one with reverence and gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 21]: Cause for gratitude she certainly had , though less than she supposed ; and very little cause indeed for reverence .
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 16]: But how could she fail to revere one to whom even her father looked up ?
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 60]: Of course David 's feeling of respect for Hugh must have sprung chiefly from intellectual grounds ; and he could hardly help seeing , if he thought at all on the subject , which is doubtful , that Hugh was as far behind Margaret in the higher gifts and graces , as he was before her in intellectual acquirement .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 18]: But whether David perceived this or not , certainly Margaret did not even think in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 23]: She was pure of self-judgment -- conscious of no comparing of herself with others , least of all with those next her .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 63]: At length the harvest was finished ; or , as the phrase of the district was , clyack was gotten -- a phrase with the derivation , or even the exact meaning of which , I am unacquainted ; knowing only that it implies something in close association with the feast of harvest-home , called the kirn in other parts of Scotland .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 42]: Thereafter , the fields lay bare to the frosts of morning and evening , and to the wind that grew cooler and cooler with the breath of Winter , who lay behind the northern hills , and waited for his hour .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 76]: But many lovely days remained , of quiet and slow decay , of yellow and red leaves , of warm noons and lovely sunsets , followed by skies -- green from the west horizon to the zenith , and walked by a moon that seemed to draw up to her all the white mists from pond and river and pool , to settle again in hoar-frost , during the colder hours that precede the dawn .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 65]: At length every leafless tree sparkled in the morning sun , incrusted with fading gems ; and the ground was hard under foot ; and the hedges were filled with frosted spider-webs ; and winter had laid the tips of his fingers on the land , soon to cover it deep with the flickering snow-flakes , shaken from the folds of his outspread mantle .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 44]: But long ere this , David and Margaret had returned with renewed diligence , and powers strengthened by repose , or at least by intermission , to their mental labours , and Hugh was as constant a visitor at the cottage as before .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 33]: The time , however , drew nigh when he must return to his studies at Aberdeen ; and David and Margaret were looking forward with sorrow to the loss of their friend .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 60]: Janet , too , `` cudna bide to think o ` t. '' `` He 'll tak ' the daylicht wi ' him , I doot , my lass , '' she said , as she made the porridge for breakfast one morning , and looked down anxiously at her daughter , seated on the creepie by the ingle-neuk .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 58]: `` Na , na , mither , '' replied Margaret , looking up from her book ; `` he 'll lea ' sic gifts ahin ' him as 'll mak ' daylicht i ' the dark ; '' and then she bent her head and went on with her reading , as if she had not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 17]: The mother looked away with a sigh and a slight , sad shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 12]: But matters were to turn out quite different from all anticipations .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 26]: Before the day arrived on which Hugh must leave for the university , a letter from home informed him that his father was dangerously ill .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 36]: He hastened to him , but only to comfort his last hours by all that a son could do , and to support his mother by his presence during the first hours of her loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 40]: But anxious thoughts for the future , which so often force themselves on the attention of those who would gladly prolong their brooding over the past , compelled them to adopt an alteration of their plans for the present .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 41]: The half-pay of Major Sutherland was gone , of course ; and all that remained for Mrs. Sutherland was a small annuity , secured by her husband 's payments to a certain fund for the use of officers ' widows .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 50]: From this she could spare but a mere trifle for the completion of Hugh 's university-education ; while the salary he had received at Turriepuffit , almost the whole of which he had saved , was so small as to be quite inadequate for the very moderate outlay necessary .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 37]: He therefore came to the resolution to write to the laird , and offer , if they were not yet provided with another tutor , to resume his relation to the young gentlemen for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 42]: It was next to impossible to spend money there ; and he judged that before the following winter , he should be quite able to meet the expenses of his residence at Aberdeen , during the last session of his course .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 28]: He would have preferred trying to find another situation , had it not been that David and Janet and Margaret had made there a home for him .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 42]: Whether Mrs. Glasford was altogether pleased at the proposal , I can not tell ; but the laird wrote a very gentlemanlike epistle , condoling with him and his mother upon their loss , and urging the usual common-places of consolation .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 33]: The letter ended with a hearty acceptance of Hugh 's offer , and , strange to tell , the unsolicited promise of an increase of salary to the amount of five pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 23]: This is another to be added to the many proofs that verisimilitude is not in the least an essential element of verity .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 35]: He left his mother as soon as circumstances would permit , and returned to Turriepuffit ; an abode for the winter very different indeed from that in which he had expected to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 62]: He reached the place early in the afternoon ; received from Mrs. Glasford a cold `` I hope you 're well , Mr. Sutherland ; '' found his pupils actually reading , and had from them a welcome rather boisterously evidenced ; told them to get their books ; and sat down with them at once to commence their winter labours .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 45]: He spent two hours thus ; had a hearty shake of the hand from the laird , when he came home ; and , after a substantial tea , walked down to David 's cottage , where a welcome awaited him worth returning for .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 43]: `` Come yer wa 's butt , '' said Janet , who met him as he opened the door without any prefatory knock , and caught him with both hands ; `` I 'm blithe to see yer bonny face ance mair .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 17]: We 're a ' jist at ane mair wi ' expeckin ' o ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 13]: David stood in the middle of the floor , waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 54]: `` Come awa ' , my bonny lad , '' was all his greeting , as he held out a great fatherly hand to the youth , and , grasping his in the one , clapped him on the shoulder with the other , the water standing in his blue eyes the while .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 14]: Hugh thought of his own father , and could not restrain his tears .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 27]: Margaret gave him a still look full in the face , and , seeing his emotion , did not even approach to offer him any welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 37]: She hastened , instead , to place a chair for him as she had done when first he entered the cottage , and when he had taken it sat down at his feet on her creepie .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 15]: With true delicacy , no one took any notice of him for some time .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 19]: David said at last , `` An ' hoo 's yer puir mother , Mr. Sutherlan ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 13]: `` She 's pretty well , '' was all Hugh could answer .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 95]: `` It 's a sair stroke to bide , '' said David ; `` but it 's a gran ' thing whan a man 's won weel throw ` t. Whan my father deit , I min ' weel , I was sae prood to see him lyin ' there , in the cauld grandeur o ' deith , an ' no man ` at daured say he ever did or spak the thing ` at didna become him , ` at I jist gloried i ' the mids o ' my greetin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 78]: He was but a puir auld shepherd , Mr. Sutherlan ' , wi ' hair as white as the sheep ` at followed him ; an ' I wat as they followed him , he followed the great Shepherd ; an ' followed an ' followed , till he jist followed Him hame , whaur we 're a ' boun ' , an ' some o ' us far on the road , thanks to Him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 36]: And with that David rose , and got down the Bible , and , opening it reverently , read with a solemn , slightly tremulous voice , the fourteenth chapter of St. John 's Gospel .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 55]: When he had finished , they all rose , as by one accord , and knelt down , and David prayed : `` O Thou in whase sicht oor deeth is precious , an ' no licht maitter ; wha through darkness leads to licht , an ' through deith to the greater life !
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 29]: -- we canna believe that thou wouldst gie us ony guid thing , to tak ' the same again ; for that would be but bairns ' play .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 73]: We believe that thou taks , that thou may gie again the same thing better nor afore -- mair o ' t and better nor we could ha ' received it itherwise ; jist as the Lord took himsel ' frae the sicht o ' them ` at lo'ed him weel , that instead o ' bein ' veesible afore their een , he micht hide himsel ' in their verra herts .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 53]: Come thou , an ' abide in us , an ' tak ' us to bide in thee ; an ' syne gin we be a ' in thee , we canna be that far frae ane anither , though some sud be in haven , an ' some upo ' earth .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 92]: Lord help us to do oor wark like thy men an ' maidens doon the stair , remin ` in ' oursel 's , ` at them ` at we miss hae only gane up the stair , as gin ` twar to haud things to thy han ' i ' thy ain presence-chamber , whaur we houp to be called or lang , an ' to see thee an ' thy Son , wham we lo'e aboon a ' ; an ' in his name we say , Amen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 19]: Hugh rose from his knees with a sense of solemnity and reality that he had never felt before .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 24]: Little was said that evening ; supper was eaten , if not in silence , yet with nothing that could be called conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 12]: And , almost in silence , David walked home with Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 11]: The spirit of his father seemed to walk beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 42]: He felt as if he had been buried with him ; and had found that the sepulchre was clothed with green things and roofed with stars -- was in truth the heavens and the earth in which his soul walked abroad .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 33]: If Hugh looked a little more into his Bible , and tried a little more to understand it , after his father 's death , it is not to be wondered at .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 73]: It is but another instance of the fact that , whether from education or from the leading of some higher instinct , we are ready , in every more profound trouble , to feel as if a solution or a refuge lay somewhere -- lay in sounds of wisdom , perhaps , to be sought and found in the best of books , the deepest of all the mysterious treasuries of words .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 11]: But David never sought to influence Hugh to this end .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 19]: He read the Bible in his family , but he never urged the reading of it on others .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 45]: Sometimes he seemed rather to avoid the subject of religion altogether ; and yet it was upon those very occasions that , if he once began to speak , he would pour out , before he ceased , some of his most impassioned utterances .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 2]: CHARITY .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 9]: Knowledge bloweth up , but charity buildeth up .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 8]: LORD BACON 'S rendering of 1 Cor .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 2]: viii .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 58]: I. Things went on as usual for a few days , when Hugh began to encounter a source of suffering of a very material and unromantic kind , but which , nevertheless , had been able before now , namely , at the commencement of his tutorship , to cause him a very sufficient degree of distress .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 30]: It was this ; that he had no room in which he could pursue his studies in private , without having to endure a most undesirable degree of cold .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 65]: In summer this was a matter of little moment , for the universe might then be his secret chamber ; but in a Scotch spring or autumn , not to say winter , a bedroom without a fire-place , which , strange to say , was the condition of his , was not a study in which thought could operate to much satisfactory result .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 14]: Indeed , pain is a far less hurtful enemy to thinking than cold .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 48]: And to have to fight such suffering and its benumbing influences , as well as to follow out a train of reasoning , difficult at any time , and requiring close attention -- is too much for any machine whose thinking wheels are driven by nervous gear .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 50]: Sometimes -- for he must make the attempt -- he came down to his meals quite blue with cold , as his pupils remarked to their mother ; but their observation never seemed to suggest to her mind the necessity of making some better provision for the poor tutor .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 35]: And Hugh , after the way in which she had behaved to him , was far too proud to ask her a favour , even if he had had hopes of receiving his request .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 29]: He knew , too , that , in the house , the laird , to interfere in the smallest degree , must imperil far more than he dared .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 37]: The prospect , therefore , of the coming winter , in a country where there was scarcely any afternoon , and where the snow might lie feet deep for weeks , was not at all agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 32]: He had , as I have said , begun to suffer already , for the mornings and evenings were cold enough now , although it was a bright , dry October .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 39]: One evening Janet remarked that he had caught cold , for he was ` hostin ' sair ; ' and this led Hugh to state the discomfort he was condemned to experience up at the ha ' house .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 26]: `` Weel , '' said David , after some silent deliberation , `` that sattles ` t ; we maun set aboot it immedantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 20]: Of course Hugh was quite at a loss to understand what he meant , and begged him to explain .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 113]: `` Ye see , '' replied David , `` we hae verra little hoose-room i ' this bit cot ; for , excep this kitchen , we hae but the ben whaur Janet and me sleeps ; and sae last year I spak ' to the laird to lat me hae muckle timmer as I wad need to big a kin ' o ' a lean-to to the house ahin ' , so ` at we micht hae a kin ' o ' a bit parlour like , or rather a roomie ` at ony o ' us micht retire till for a bit , gin we wanted to be oor lanes .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 8]: He had nae objections , honest man .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 28]: But somehoo or ither I never sat han ' till ` t ; but noo the wa 's maun be up afore the wat weather sets in .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 44]: Sae I ` se be at it the morn , an ' maybe ye 'll len ' me a han ' , Mr. Sutherlan ' , and tak ' oot yer wages in house-room an ' firin ' efter it 's dune . ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 6]: `` Thank you heartily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 9]: said Hugh ; `` that would be delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 8]: It seems too good to be possible .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 23]: But will not wooden walls be rather a poor protection against such winters as I suppose you have in these parts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 21]: `` Hootoot , Mr. Sutherlan ' , ye micht gie me credit for raither mair rumgumption nor that comes till .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 101]: Timmer was the only thing I not -LRB- needed -RRB- to spier for ; the lave lies to ony body 's han ' -- a few cart-fu 's o ' sods frae the hill ahint the hoose , an ' a han ` fu ' or twa o ' stanes for the chimla oot o ' the quarry -- there 's eneuch there for oor turn ohn blastit mair ; an ' we 'll saw the wood oorsels ; an ' gin we had ance the wa 's up , we can carry on the inside at oor leisur ' .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 40]: That 's the way ` at the Maker does wi ' oorsels ; he gie 's us the wa 's an ' the material , an ' a whole lifetime , maybe mair , to furnish the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 4]: `` Capital ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 3]: exclaimed Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 18]: `` I 'll work like a horse , and we 'll be at it the morn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 65]: `` I ` se be at it afore daylicht , an ' ane or twa o ' the lads 'll len ' me a han ' efter wark-hours ; and there 's yersel ' , Mr. Sutherlan ' , worth ane an ' a half o ' ordinary workers ; an ' we 'll hae truff aneuch for the wa 's in a jiffey .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 65]: I 'll mark a feow saplin 's i ' the wud here at denner-time , an ' we 'll hae them for bauks , an ' couples , an ' things ; an ' there 's plenty dry eneuch for beurds i ' the shed , an ' bein ' but a lean-to , there 'll be but half wark , ye ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 55]: They went out directly , in the moonlight , to choose the spot ; and soon came to the resolution to build it so , that a certain back door , which added more to the cold in winter than to the convenience in summer , should be the entrance to the new chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 32]: The chimney was the chief difficulty ; but all the materials being in the immediate neighbourhood , and David capable of turning his hands to anything , no obstruction was feared .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 86]: Indeed , he set about that part first , as was necessary ; and had soon built a small chimney , chiefly of stones and lime ; while , under his directions , the walls were making progress at the same time , by the labour of Hugh and two or three of the young men from the farm , who were most ready to oblige David with their help , although they were still rather unfriendly to the colliginer , as they called him .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 25]: But Hugh 's frankness soon won them over , and they all formed within a day or two a very comfortable party of labourers .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 31]: They worked very hard ; for if the rain should set in before the roof was on , their labour would be almost lost from the soaking of the walls .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 42]: They built them of turf , very thick , with a slight slope on the outside towards the roof ; before commencing which , they partially cut the windows out of the walls , putting wood across to support the top .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 27]: I should have explained that the turf used in building was the upper and coarser part of the peat , which was plentiful in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 39]: The thatch-eaves of the cottage itself projected over the joining of the new roof , so as to protect it from the drip ; and David soon put a thick thatch of new straw upon the little building .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 19]: Second-hand windows were procured at the village , and the holes in the walls cut to their size .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 47]: They next proceeded to the saw-pit on the estate -- for almost everything necessary for keeping up the offices was done on the farm itself -- where they sawed thin planks of deal , to floor and line the room , and make it more cosie .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 37]: These David planed upon one side ; and when they were nailed against slight posts all round the walls , and the joints filled in with putty , the room began to look most enticingly habitable .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 47]: The roof had not been thatched two days before the rain set in ; but now they could work quite comfortably inside ; and as the space was small , and the forenights were long , they had it quite finished before the end of November .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 73]: David bought an old table in the village , and one or two chairs ; mended them up ; made a kind of rustic sofa or settle ; put a few bookshelves against the wall ; had a peat fire lighted on the hearth every day ; and at length , one Saturday evening , they had supper in the room , and the place was consecrated henceforth to friendship and learning .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 99]: From this time , every evening , as soon as lessons , and the meal which immediately followed them , were over , Hugh betook himself to the cottage , on the shelves of which all his books by degrees collected themselves ; and there spent the whole long evening , generally till ten o'clock ; the first part alone reading or writing ; the last in company with his pupils , who , diligent as ever , now of course made more rapid progress than before , inasmuch as the lessons were both longer and more frequent .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 97]: The only drawback to their comfort was , that they seemed to have shut Janet out ; but she soon remedied this , by contriving to get through with her house work earlier than she had ever done before ; and , taking her place on the settle behind them , knitted away diligently at her stocking , which , to inexperienced eyes , seemed always the same , and always in the same state of progress , notwithstanding that she provided the hose of the whole family , blue and grey , ribbed and plain .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 23]: Her occasional withdrawings , to observe the progress of the supper , were only a cheerful break in the continuity of labour .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 62]: Little would the passer-by imagine that beneath that roof , which seemed worthy only of the name of a shed , there sat , in a snug little homely room , such a youth as Hugh , such a girl as Margaret , such a grand peasant king as David , and such a true-hearted mother to them all as Janet .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 46]: There were no pictures and no music ; for Margaret kept her songs for solitary places ; but the sound of verse was often the living wind which set a-waving the tops of the trees of knowledge , fast growing in the sunlight of Truth .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 29]: The thatch of that shed-roof was like the grizzled hair of David , beneath which lay the temple not only of holy but of wise and poetic thought .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 68]: It was like the sylvan abode of the gods , where the architecture and music are all of their own making , in their kind the more beautiful , the more simple and rude ; and if more doubtful in their intent , and less precise in their finish , yet therein the fuller of life and its grace , and the more suggestive of deeper harmonies .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 2]: HERALDRY .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 63]: And like his father of face and of stature , And false of love -- it came him of nature ; As doth the fox Renard , the fox 's son ; Of kinde , he coud his old father 's wone , Without lore , as can a drake swim , When it is caught , and carried to the brim .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 2]: CHAUCER .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: -- Legend of Phillis .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 38]: Of course , the yet more lengthened absences of Hugh from the house were subjects of remark as at the first ; but Hugh had made up his mind not to trouble himself the least about that .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 58]: For some time Mrs. Glasford took no notice of them to himself ; but one evening , just as tea was finished , and Hugh was rising to go , her restraint gave way , and she uttered one spiteful speech , thinking it , no doubt , so witty that it ought to see the light .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 19]: `` Ye 're a day-labourer it seems , Mr. Sutherlan ' , and gang hame at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 10]: `` Exactly so , madam , '' rejoined Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 18]: `` There is no other relation between you and me , than that of work and wages .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 30]: You have done your best to convince me of that , by making it impossible for me to feel that this house is in any sense my home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 34]: With this grand speech he left the room , and from that time till the day of his final departure from Turriepuffit , there was not a single allusion made to the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 6]: He soon reached the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 67]: When he entered the new room , which was always called Mr. Sutherland 's study , the mute welcome afforded him by the signs of expectation , in the glow of the waiting fire , and the outspread arms of the elbow-chair , which was now called his , as well as the room , made ample amends to him for the unfriendliness of Mrs. Glasford .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 36]: Going to the shelves to find the books he wanted , he saw that they had been carefully arranged on one shelf , and that the others were occupied with books belonging to the house .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 8]: He looked at a few of them .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 171]: They were almost all old books , and such as may be found in many Scotch cottages ; for instance , Boston 's Fourfold State , in which the ways of God and man may be seen through a fourfold fog ; Erskine 's Divine Sonnets , which will repay the reader in laughter for the pain it costs his reverence , producing much the same effect that a Gothic cathedral might , reproduced by the pencil and from the remembrance of a Chinese artist , who had seen it once ; Drelincourt on Death , with the famous ghost-hoax of De Foe , to help the bookseller to the sale of the unsaleable ; the Scots Worthies , opening of itself at the memoir of Mr. Alexander Peden ; the Pilgrim 's Progress , that wonderful inspiration , failing never save when the theologian would sometimes snatch the pen from the hand of the poet ; Theron and Aspasio ; Village Dialogues ; and others of a like class .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 12]: To these must be added a rare edition of Blind Harry .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 43]: It was clear to Hugh , unable as he was fully to appreciate the wisdom of David , that it was not from such books as these that he had gathered it ; yet such books as these formed all his store .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 15]: He turned from them , found his own , and sat down to read .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 7]: By and by David came in .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 13]: `` I 'm ower sune , I doubt , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 7]: I 'm disturbin ' ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 9]: `` Not at all , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 23]: `` Besides , I am not much in a reading mood this evening : Mrs. Glasford has been annoying me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 4]: `` Poor body !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 9]: What 's she been sayin ' noo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 15]: Thinking to amuse David , Hugh recounted the short passage between them recorded above .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 36]: David , however , listened with a very different expression of countenance from what Hugh had anticipated ; and , when he had finished , took up the conversation in a kind of apologetic tone .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 28]: `` Weel , but ye see , '' said he , folding his palms together , `` she hasna ' jist had a ` thegither fair play .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 10]: She does na come o ' a guid breed .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 15]: Man , it 's a fine thing to come o ' a guid breed .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 16]: They hae a hantle to answer for ` at come o ' decent forbears . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 20]: `` I thought she brought the laird a good property , '' said Hugh , not quite understanding David .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 21]: `` Ow , ay , she brocht him gowpenfu 's o ' siller ; but hoo was ' t gotten ?
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 27]: An ' ye ken it 's no riches ` at ` ill mak ' a guid breed -- ` cep ' it be o ' maggots .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 10]: The richer cheese the mair maggots , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 32]: Ye maunna speyk o ' this ; but the mistress 's father was weel kent to hae made his siller by fardins and bawbees , in creepin ' , crafty ways .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 41]: He was a bit merchan ' in Aberdeen , an ' aye keepit his thoom weel ahint the peint o ' the ellwan ' , sae ` at he made an inch or twa upo ' ilka yard he sauld .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 26]: Sae he took frae his soul , and pat intill his siller-bag , an ' had little to gie his dochter but a guid tocher .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 16]: Mr. Sutherlan ' , it 's a fine thing to come o ' dacent fowk .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 35]: Noo , to luik at yersel ' : I ken naething aboot yer family ; but ye seem at eesicht to come o ' a guid breed for the bodily part o ' ye .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 40]: That 's a sma ' matter ; but frae what I ha'e seen -- an ' I trust in God I 'm no ' mista'en -- ye come o ' the richt breed for the min ' as weel .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 86]: I 'm no flatterin ' ye , Mr. Sutherlan ' ; but jist layin ' it upo ' ye , ` at gin ye had an honest father and gran ` father , an ' especially a guid mither , ye hae a heap to answer for ; an ' ye ought never to be hard upo ' them ` at 's sma ' creepin ' creatures , for they canna help it sae weel as the like o ' you and me can . ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 7]: David was not given to boasting .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 12]: Hugh had never heard anything suggesting it from his lips before .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 9]: He turned full round and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 30]: On his face lay a solemn quiet , either from a feeling of his own responsibility , or a sense of the excuse that must be made for others .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 21]: What he had said about the signs of breed in Hugh 's exterior , certainly applied to himself as well .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 28]: His carriage was full of dignity , and a certain rustic refinement ; his voice was wonderfully gentle , but deep ; and slowest when most impassioned .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 21]: He seemed to have come of some gigantic antediluvian breed : there was something of the Titan slumbering about him .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 29]: He would have been a stern man , but for an unusual amount of reverence that seemed to overflood the sternness , and change it into strong love .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 35]: No one had ever seen him thoroughly angry ; his simple displeasure with any of the labourers , the quality of whose work was deficient , would go further than the laird 's oaths .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 20]: Hugh sat looking at David , who supported the look with that perfect calmness that comes of unconscious simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 28]: At length Hugh 's eye sank before David 's , as he said : `` I wish I had known your father , then , David . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 19]: `` My father was sic a ane as I tauld ye the ither day , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 7]: I 'm a ' richt there .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 42]: A puir , semple , God-fearin ' shepherd , ` at never gae his dog an ill-deserved word , nor took the skin o ' ony puir lammie , wha 's woo ' he was clippin ' , atween the shears .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 16]: He was weel worthy o ' the grave ` at he wan till at last .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 19]: An ' my mither was jist sic like , wi ' aiblins raither mair heid nor my father .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 18]: They 're her beuks maistly upo ' the skelf there abune yer ain , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 15]: I honour them for her sake , though I seldom trouble them mysel ' .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 44]: She gae me a kin ' o ' a scunner at them , honest woman , wi ' garrin ' me read at them o ' Sundays , till they near scomfisht a ' the guid ` at was in me by nater .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 11]: There 's doctrine for ye , Mr. Sutherlan ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 8]: added David , with a queer laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 14]: `` I thought they could hardly be your books , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 47]: `` But I hae ae odd beuk , an ' that brings me upo ' my pedigree , Mr. Sutherlan ' ; for the puirest man has as lang a pedigree as the greatest , only he kens less aboot it , that 's a ' .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 41]: An ' I wat , for yer lords and ladies , it 's no a ' to their credit ` at 's tauld o ' their hither-come ; an ' that 's a ' against the breed , ye ken .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 31]: A wilfu ' sin in the father may be a sinfu ' weakness i ' the son ; an ' that 's what I ca ' no fair play . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 27]: So saying , David went to his bedroom , whence he returned with a very old-looking book , which he laid on the table before Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 21]: He opened it , and saw that it was a volume of Jacob B hmen , in the original language .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 32]: He found out afterwards , upon further inquiry , that it was in fact a copy of the first edition of his first work , The Aurora , printed in 1612 .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 33]: On the title-page was written a name , either in German or old English character , he was not sure which ; but he was able to read it -- Martin Elginbrodde .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 28]: David , having given him time to see all this , went on : `` That buik has been in oor family far langer nor I ken .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 23]: I needna say I canna read a word o ` t , nor I never heard o ' ane ` at could .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 108]: But I canna help tellin ' ye a curious thing , Mr. Sutherlan ' , in connexion wi ' the name on that buik : there 's a gravestane , a verra auld ane -- hoo auld I canna weel mak ' out , though I gaed ends-errand to Aberdeen to see ` t -- an ' the name upo ' that gravestane is Martin Elginbrod , but made mention o ' in a strange fashion ; an ' I 'm no sure a ` thegither aboot hoo ye 'll tak ' it , for it soun 's rather fearsome at first hearin ' o ` t .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 49]: But ye ` se hae ' t as I read it : '' ` Here lie I , Martin Elginbrodde : Hae mercy o ' my soul , Lord God ; As I wad do , were I Lord God , And ye were Martin Elginbrodde . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 30]: Certainly Hugh could not help a slight shudder at what seemed to him the irreverence of the epitaph , if indeed it was not deserving of a worse epithet .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 198]: But he made no remark ; and , after a moment 's pause , David resumed : `` I was unco ill-pleased wi ' t at the first , as ye may suppose , Mr. Sutherlan ' ; but , after a while , I begude -LRB- began -RRB- an ' gaed through twa or three bits o ' reasonin 's aboot it , in this way : By the natur ' o ` t , this maun be the man 's ain makin ' , this epitaph ; for no ither body cud ha ' dune ` t ; and he had left it in 's will to be pitten upo ' the deid-stane , nae doot : I ' the contemplation o ' deith , a man wad no be lik ` ly to desire the perpetuation o ' a blasphemy upo ' a table o ' stone , to stan ' against him for centuries i ' the face o ' God an ' man : therefore it cudna ha ' borne the luik to him o ' the presumptuous word o ' a proud man evenin ' himsel ' wi ' the Almichty .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 16]: Sae what was ` t , then , ` at made him mak ' it ?
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 142]: It seems to me -- though I confess , Mr. Sutherlan ' , I may be led astray by the nateral desire ` at a man has to think weel o ' his ain forbears -- for ` at he was a forbear o ' my ain , I canna weel doot , the name bein ' by no means a common ane , in Scotland ony way -- I 'm sayin ' , it seems to me , that it 's jist a darin ' way , maybe a childlike way , o ' judgin ' , as Job micht ha ' dune , ` the Lord by himsel ' ; ' an ' sayin ' , ` at gin he , Martin Elginbrod , wad hae mercy , surely the Lord was not less mercifu ' than he was .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 33]: The offspring o ' the Most High was , as it were , aware o ' the same spirit i ' the father o ' him , as muved in himsel ' .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 49]: He felt ` at the mercy in himsel ' was ane o ' the best things ; an ' he cudna think ` at there wad be less o ' t i ' the father o ' lichts , frae whom cometh ilka guid an ' perfeck gift .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 78]: An ' may be he remembered ` at the Saviour himsel ' said : ` Be ye perfect as your father in Heaven is perfect ; ' and that the perfection o ' God , as He had jist pinted oot afore , consisted in causin ' his bonny sun to shine on the evil an ' the good , an ' his caller rain to fa ' upo ' the just an ' the unjust . ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 17]: It may well be doubted whether David 's interpretation of the epitaph was the correct one .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 29]: It will appear to most of my readers to breathe rather of doubt lighted up by hope , than of that strong faith which David read in it .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 71]: But whether from family partiality , and consequent unwillingness to believe that his ancestor had been a man who , having led a wild , erring , and evil life , turned at last towards the mercy of God as his only hope , which the words might imply ; or simply that he saw this meaning to be the best ; this was the interpretation which David had adopted .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 26]: `` But , '' interposed Hugh , `` supposing he thought all that , why should he therefore have it carved on his tombstone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 12]: `` I hae thocht aboot that too , '' answered David .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 21]: `` For ae thing , a body has but feow ways o ' sayin ' his say to his brithermen .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 27]: Robbie Burns cud do ' t in sang efter sang ; but maybe this epitaph was a ' that auld Martin was able to mak ' .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 10]: He michtna hae had the gift o ' utterance .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 10]: But there may be mair i n't nor that .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 104]: Gin the clergy o ' thae times warna a gey hantle mair enlichtened nor a fowth o ' the clergy hereabouts , he wad hae heard a heap aboot the glory o ' God , as the thing ` at God himsel ' was maist anxious aboot uphaudin ' , jist like a prood creater o ' a king ; an ' that he wad mak ' men , an ' feed them , an ' cleed them , an ' gie them braw wives an ' toddlin ' bairnies , an ' syne damn them , a ' for 's ain glory .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 51]: Maybe ye wadna get mony o ' them ` at wad speyk sae fair-oot noo-a-days , for they gang wi ' the tide jist like the lave ; but i ' my auld minny 's buiks , I hae read jilt as muckle as that , an ' waur too .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 23]: Mony ane ` at spak like that , had nae doot a guid meanin ' i n't ; but , hech man !
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 14]: it 's an awesome deevilich way o ' sayin ' a holy thing .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 80]: Noo , what better could puir auld Martin do , seein ' he had no ae word to say i ' the kirk a ' his lifelang , nor jist say his ae word , as pithily as might be , i ' the kirkyard , efter he was deid ; an ' ower an ' ower again , wi ' a tongue o ' stane , let them tak ' it or lat it alane ` at likit ?
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 20]: That 's a ' my defence o ' my auld luckie-daddy -- Heaven rest his brave auld soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 34]: `` But are we not in danger , '' said Hugh , `` of thinking too lightly and familiarly of the Maker , when we proceed to judge him so by ourselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 136]: `` Mr. Sutherlan ' , '' replied David , very solemnly , `` I dinna thenk I can be in muckle danger o ' lichtlyin ' him , whan I ken in my ain sel ' , as weel as she ` at was healed o ' her plague , ` at I wad be a horse i ' that pleuch , or a pig in that stye , not merely if it was his will -- for wha can stan ' against that -- but if it was for his glory ; ay , an ' comfort mysel ' , a ' the time the change was passin ' upo ' me , wi ' the thocht that , efter an ' a ' , his blessed han 's made the pigs too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 23]: `` But , a moment ago , David , you seemed to me to be making rather little of his glory . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 35]: `` O ' his glory , as they consider glory -- ay ; efter a warldly fashion that 's no better nor pride , an ' in him would only be a greater pride .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 4]: But his glory !
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 14]: consistin ' in his trowth an ' lovin ` kindness -- -LRB- man !
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 19]: that 's a bonny word -RRB- -- an ' grand self-forgettin ' devotion to his creaters -- lord !
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 6]: man , it 's unspeakable .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 19]: I care little for his glory either , gin by that ye mean the praise o ' men .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 30]: A heap o ' the anxiety for the spread o ' his glory , seems to me to be but a desire for the sempathy o ' ither fowk .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 23]: There 's no fear but men 'll praise him , a ' in guid time -- that is , whan they can .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 77]: But , Mr. Sutherlan ' , for the glory o ' God , raither than , if it were possible , one jot or one tittle should fail of his entire perfection of holy beauty , I call God to witness , I would gladly go to hell itsel ' ; for no evil worth the full name can befall the earth or ony creater i n't , as long as God is what he is .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 17]: For the glory o ' God , Mr. Sutherlan ' , I wad die the deith .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 15]: For the will o ' God , I 'm ready for onything he likes .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: I canna surely be in muckle danger o ' lichtlyin ' him .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 7]: I glory in my God . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 22]: The almost passionate earnestness with which David spoke , would alone have made it impossible for Hugh to reply at once .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 31]: After a few moments , however , he ventured to ask the question : `` Would you do nothing that other people should know God , then , David ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: `` Onything ` at he likes .
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 11]: But I would tak ' tent o ' interferin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 24]: He 's at it himsel ' frae mornin ' to nicht , frae year 's en ' to year 's en ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 17]: `` But you seem to me to make out that God is nothing but love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 7]: `` Ay , naething but love .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 5]: What for no ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 10]: `` Because we are told he is just . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 13]: `` Would he be lang just if he didna lo'e us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: `` But does he not punish sin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 13]: `` Would it be ony kin ` ness no to punish sin ?
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 17]: No to us a ' means to pit awa ' the ae ill thing frae us ?
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 50]: Whatever may be meant by the place o ' meesery , depen ' upo ` t , Mr. Sutherlan ' , it 's only anither form o ' love , love shinin ' through the fogs o ' ill , an ' sae gart leuk something verra different thereby .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 41]: Man , raither nor see my Maggy -- an ' ye 'll no doot ` at I lo'e her -- raither nor see my Maggy do an ill thing , I 'd see her lyin ' deid at my feet .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 44]: But supposin ' the ill thing ance dune , it 's no at my feet I wad lay her , but upo ' my heart , wi ' my auld arms aboot her , to hand the further ill aff o ' her .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 11]: An ' shall mortal man be more just than God ?
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: Shall a man be more pure than his Maker ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 4]: O my God !
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 4]: my God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 25]: The entrance of Margaret would have prevented the prosecution of this conversation , even if it had not already drawn to a natural close .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 64]: Not that David would not have talked thus before his daughter , but simply that minds , like instruments , need to be brought up to the same pitch , before they can `` atone together , '' and that one feels this instinctively on the entrance of another who has not gone through the same immediate process of gradual elevation of tone .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 68]: Their books and slates were got out , and they sat down to their work ; but Hugh could not help observing that David , in the midst of his lines and angles and algebraic computations , would , every now and then , glance up at Margaret , with a look of tenderness in his face yet deeper and more delicate in its expression than ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 19]: Margaret was , however , quite unconscious of it , pursuing her work with her ordinary even diligence .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 5]: But Janet observed it .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 17]: `` What ails the bairn , Dawvid , ` at ye leuk at her that get ?
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 7]: `` Naething ails her , woman .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 14]: Do ye never leuk at a body but when something ails them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 11]: `` Ow , ay -- but no that get . ''
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 21]: `` Weel , maybe I was thinkin ' hoo I wad leuk at her gin onything did ail her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 3]: `` Hoot !
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 2]: hoot !
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 33]: dinna further the ill hither by makin ' a bien doonsittin ' an ' a bed for ` t. '' All David 's answer to this was one of his own smiles .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 37]: At supper , for it happened to be Saturday , Hugh said : `` I 've been busy , between whiles , inventing , or perhaps discovering , an etymological pedigree for you , David ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 13]: `` Weel , lat 's hear ` t , '' said David .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 36]: `` First -- do you know that that volume with your ancestor 's name on it , was written by an old German shoemaker , perhaps only a cobbler , for anything I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 15]: `` I know nothing aboot it , more or less , '' answered David .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 7]: `` He was a wonderful man .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 9]: Some people think he was almost inspired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 13]: `` Maybe , maybe , '' was all David 's doubtful response .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 23]: `` At all events , though I know nothing about it myself , he must have written wonderfully for a cobbler . ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 28]: `` For my pairt , '' replied David , `` if I see no wonder in the man , I can see but little in the cobbler .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 13]: What for shouldna a cobbler write wonnerfully , as weel as anither ?
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 9]: It 's a trade ` at furthers meditation .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 27]: My grandfather was a cobbler , as ye ca ` t ; an ' they say he was no fule in his ain way either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 10]: `` Then it does go in the family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 5]: cried Hugh , triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 52]: `` I was in doubt at first whether your name referred to the breadth of your shoulders , David , as transmitted from some ancient sire , whose back was an Ellwand-broad ; for the g might come from a w or v , for anything I know to the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 10]: But it would have been braid in that case .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 107]: And , now , I am quite convinced that that Martin or his father was a German , a friend of old Jacob B hmen , who gave him the book himself , and was besides of the same craft ; and he coming to this country with a name hard to be pronounced , they found a resemblance in the sound of it to his occupation ; and so gradually corrupted his name , to them uncouth , into Elsynbrod , Elshinbrod , thence Elginbrod , with a soft g , and lastly Elginbrod , as you pronounce it now , with a hard g .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 16]: This name , turned from Scotch into English , would then be simply Martin Awlbore .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 23]: The cobbler is in the family , David , descended from Jacob B hmen himself , by the mother 's side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 24]: This heraldic blazon amused them all very much , and David expressed his entire concurrence with it , declaring it to be incontrovertible .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 4]: Margaret laughed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 50]: Besides its own beauty , two things made Margaret 's laugh of some consequence ; one was , that it was very rare ; and the other , that it revealed her two regular rows of dainty white teeth , suiting well to the whole build of the maiden .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 40]: She was graceful and rather tall , with a head which , but for its smallness , might have seemed too heavy for the neck that supported it , so ready it always was to droop like a snowdrop .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 15]: The only parts about her which Hugh disliked , were her hands and feet .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 19]: The former certainly had been reddened and roughened by household work : but they were well formed notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 34]: The latter he had never seen , notwithstanding the bare-foot habits of Scotch maidens ; for he saw Margaret rarely except in the evenings , and then she was dressed to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 25]: Certainly , however , they were very far from following the shape of the clumsy country shoes , by which he misjudged their proportions .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 29]: Had he seen them , as he might have seen them some part of any day during the summer , their form at least would have satisfied him .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 2]: WINTER .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 8]: Out of whose womb came the ice ?
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 12]: and the hoary frost of heaven , who hath gendered it ?
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 18]: The waters are hid as with a stone , and the face of the deep is frozen .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 14]: He giveth snow like wool ; he scattereth the hoar frost like ashes .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 3]: JOB xxxviii .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 7]: 29 , 30 ; PSALM cxlvii .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 2]: 16 .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 7]: Winter was fairly come at last .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 32]: A black frost had bound the earth for many days ; and at length a peculiar sensation , almost a smell of snow in the air , indicated an approaching storm .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 36]: The snow fell at first in a few large unwilling flakes , that fluttered slowly and heavily to the earth , where they lay like the foundation of the superstructure that was about to follow .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 66]: Faster and faster they fell -- wonderful multitudes of delicate crystals , adhering in shapes of beauty which outvied all that jeweller could invent or execute of ethereal , starry forms , structures of evanescent yet prodigal loveliness -- till the whole air was obscured by them , and night came on , hastened by an hour , from the gathering of their white darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: In the morning , all the landscape was transfigured .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 28]: The snow had ceased to fall ; but the whole earth , houses , fields , and fences , ponds and streams , were changed to whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 27]: But most wonderful looked the trees -- every bough and every twig thickened , and bent earthward with its own individual load of the fairy ghost-birds .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 27]: Each retained the semblance of its own form , wonderfully , magically altered by its thick garment of radiant whiteness , shining gloriously in the sunlight .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 29]: It was the shroud of dead nature ; but a shroud that seemed to prefigure a lovely resurrection ; for the very death-robe was unspeakably , witchingly beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 19]: Again at night the snow fell ; and again and again , with intervening days of bright sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 53]: Every morning , the first fresh footprints were a new wonder to the living creatures , the young-hearted amongst them at least , who lived and moved in this death-world , this sepulchral planet , buried in the shining air before the eyes of its sister-stars in the blue , deathless heavens .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 48]: Paths had to be cleared in every direction towards the out-houses , and again cleared every morning ; till at last the walls of solid rain stood higher than the head of little Johnnie , as he was still called , though he was twelve years old .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 59]: It was a great delight to him to wander through the snow-avenues in every direction ; and great fun it was , both to him and his brother , when they were tired of snowballing each other and every living thing about the place except their parents and tutor , to hollow out mysterious caves and vaulted passages .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 85]: Sometimes they would carry these passages on from one path to within an inch or two of another , and there lie in wait till some passer-by , unweeting of harm , was just opposite their lurking cave ; when they would dash through the solid wall of snow with a hideous yell , almost endangering the wits of the maids , and causing a recoil and startled ejaculation even of the strong man on whom they chanced to try their powers of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 37]: Hugh himself was once glad to cover the confusion of his own fright with the hearty fit of laughter into which the perturbation of the boys , upon discovering whom they had startled , threw him .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 75]: It was rare fun to them ; but not to the women about the house , who moved from place to place in a state of chronic alarm , scared by the fear of being scared ; till one of them going into hysterics , real or pretended , it was found necessary to put a stop to the practice ; not , however , before Margaret had had her share of the jest .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 56]: Hugh happened to be looking out of his window at the moment -- watching her , indeed , as she passed towards the kitchen with some message from her mother ; when an indescribable monster , a chaotic mass of legs and snow , burst , as if out of the earth , upon her .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 34]: She turned pale as the snow around her -LRB- and Hugh had never observed before how dark her eyes were -RRB- , as she sprang back with the grace of a startled deer .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 32]: She uttered no cry , however , perceiving in a moment who it was , gave a troubled little smile , and passed on her way as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 14]: Hugh was not sorry when maternal orders were issued against the practical joke .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 25]: The boys did not respect their mother very much , but they dared not disobey her , when she spoke in a certain tone .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 38]: There was no pathway cut to David 's cottage ; and no track trodden , except what David , coming to the house sometimes , and Hugh going every afternoon to the cottage , made between them .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 23]: Hugh often went to the knees in snow , but was well dried and warmed by Janet 's care when he arrived .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 46]: She had always a pair of stockings and slippers ready for him at the fire , to be put on the moment of his arrival ; and exchanged again for his own , dry and warm , before he footed once more the ghostly waste .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 58]: When neither moon was up nor stars were out , there was a strange eerie glimmer from the snow that lighted the way home ; and he thought there must be more light from it than could be accounted for merely by the reflection of every particle of light that might fall upon it from other sources .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 17]: Margaret was not kept to the house by the snow , even when it was falling .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 18]: She went out as usual -- not of course wandering far , for walking was difficult now .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 60]: But she was in little danger of losing her way , for she knew the country as well as any one ; and although its face was greatly altered by the filling up of its features , and the uniformity of the colour , yet those features were discernible to her experienced eye through the sheet that covered them .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 25]: It was only necessary to walk on the tops of dykes , and other elevated ridges , to keep clear of the deep snow .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 25]: There were many paths between the cottages and the farms in the neighbourhood , in which she could walk with comparative ease and comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 13]: But she preferred wandering away through the fields and toward the hills .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 33]: Sometimes she would come home like a creature of the snow , born of it , and living in it ; so covered was she from head to foot with its flakes .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 13]: David used to smile at her with peculiar complacency on such occasions .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 15]: It was evident that it pleased him she should be the playmate of Nature .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 38]: Janet was not altogether indulgent to these freaks , as she considered them , of Marget -- she had quite given up calling her Meg , `` sin ' she took to the beuk so eident . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 64]: But whatever her mother might think of it , Margaret was in this way laying up a store not only of bodily and mental health , but of resources for thought and feeling , of secret understandings and communions with Nature , and everything simple , and strong , and pure through Nature , than which she could have accumulated nothing more precious .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 34]: This kind of weather continued for some time , till the people declared they had never known a storm last so long `` ohn ever devallt , '' that is , without intermission .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 35]: But the frost grew harder ; and then the snow , instead of falling in large adhesive flakes , fell in small dry flakes , of which the boys could make no snaw-ba 's .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 48]: All the time , however , there was no wind ; and this not being a sheep country , there was little uneasiness or suffering occasioned by the severity of the weather , beyond what must befall the poorer classes in every northern country during the winter .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 33]: One day , David heard that a poor old man of his acquaintance was dying , and immediately set out to visit him , at a distance of two or three miles .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 32]: He returned in the evening , only in time for his studies ; for there was of course little or nothing to be done at present in the way of labour .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 29]: As he sat down to the table , he said : `` I hae seen a wonnerfu ' sicht sin ' I saw you , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 18]: I gaed to see an auld Christian , whase body an ' brain are nigh worn oot .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 62]: He was never onything remarkable for intellec , and jist took what the minister tellt him for true , an ' keepit the guid o ` t ; for his hert was aye richt , an ' his faith a hantle stronger than maybe it had ony richt to be , accordin ' to his ain opingans ; but , hech !
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 19]: there 's something far better nor his opingans i ' the hert o ' ilka God-fearin ' body .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 31]: Whan I gaed butt the hoose , he was sittin ' in 's auld arm-chair by the side o ' the fire , an ' his face luikit dazed like .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 22]: There was no licht i n't but what cam ' noo an ' than frae a low i ' the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 57]: The snaw was driftin ' a wee aboot the bit winnock , an ' his auld een was fixed upo ` t ; an ' a ' ` at he said , takin ' no notice o ' me , was jist , ` The birdies is flutterin ' ; the birdies is flutterin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 40]: I spak ' till him , an ' tried to roose him , wi ' ae thing after anither , bit I micht as weel hae spoken to the door-cheek , for a ' the notice that he took .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 17]: Never a word he spak ' , but aye ` The birdies is flutterin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 50]: At last , it cam ' to my min ' ` at the body was aye fu ' o ' ane o ' the psalms in particler ; an ' sae I jist said till him at last : ` John , hae ye forgotten the twenty-third psalm ? '
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 7]: ` Forgotten the twenty-third psalm ! '
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 68]: quo ' he ; an ' his face lighted up in a moment frae the inside : ` The Lord 's my shepherd , -- an ' I hae followed Him through a ' the smorin ' drift o ' the warl ' , an ' he 'll bring me to the green pastures an ' the still waters o ' His summer-kingdom at the lang last .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 5]: I shall not want .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 11]: An ' I hae wanted for naething , naething . '
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 12]: He had been a shepherd himsel ' in 's young days .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 54]: And so on he gaed , wi ' a kin ' o ' a personal commentary on the haill psalm frae beginnin ' to en ' , and syne he jist fell back into the auld croonin ' sang , ` The birdies is flutterin ' ; the birdies is flutterin ' . '
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 35]: The licht deed oot o ' his face , an ' a ' that I could say could na ' bring back the licht to his face , nor the sense to his tongue .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 10]: He 'll sune be in a better warl ' .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 9]: Sae I was jist forced to leave him .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 24]: But I promised his dochter , puir body , that I would ca ' again an ' see him the morn 's afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 46]: It 's unco dowie wark for her ; for they hae scarce a neebor within reach o ' them , in case o ' a change ; an ' there had hardly been a creatur ' inside o ' their door for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 12]: The following afternoon , David set out according to his promise .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 29]: Before his return , the wind , which had been threatening to wake all day , had risen rapidly , and now blew a snowstorm of its own .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 35]: When Hugh opened the door to take his usual walk to the cottage , just as darkness was beginning to fall , the sight he saw made his young strong heart dance with delight .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 22]: The snow that fell made but a small part of the wild , confused turmoil and uproar of the ten-fold storm .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 70]: For the wind , raving over the surface of the snow , which , as I have already explained , lay nearly as loose as dry sand , swept it in thick fierce clouds along with it , tearing it up and casting it down again no one could tell where -- for the whole air was filled with drift , as they call the snow when thus driven .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 33]: A few hours of this would alter the face of the whole country , leaving some parts bare , and others buried beneath heaps on heaps of snow , called here snaw-wreaths .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 53]: For the word snow-wreaths does not mean the lovely garlands hung upon every tree and bush in its feathery fall ; but awful mounds of drifted snow , that may be the smooth , soft , white sepulchres of dead men , smothered in the lapping folds of the almost solid wind .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 8]: Path or way was none before him .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 78]: He could see nothing but the surface of a sea of froth and foam , as it appeared to him , with the spray torn from it , whirled in all shapes and contortions , and driven in every direction ; but chiefly , in the main direction of the wind , in long sloping spires of misty whiteness , swift as arrows , and as keen upon the face of him who dared to oppose them .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 13]: Hugh plunged into it with a wild sense of life and joy .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 69]: In the course of his short walk , however , if walk it could be called , which was one chain of plungings and emergings , struggles with the snow , and wrestles with the wind , he felt that it needed not a stout heart only , but sound lungs and strong limbs as well , to battle with the storm , even for such a distance .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 55]: When he reached the cottage , he found Janet in considerable anxiety , not only about David , who had not yet returned , but about Margaret as well , whom she had not seen for some time , and who must be out somewhere in the storm -- `` the wull hizzie . ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 12]: Hugh suggested that she might have gone to meet her father .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 6]: `` The Lord forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 3]: ejaculated Janet .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 41]: `` The road lies ower the tap o ' the Halshach , as eerie and bare a place as ever was hill-moss , wi ' never a scoug or bield i n't , frae the tae side to the tither .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 12]: The win ' there jist gangs clean wud a ` thegither .

Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 11]: `` How could you let him go , Janet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 7]: `` Lat him gang , laddie !

Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 9]: But I 'm no that feared aboot him .

Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 17]: But I 'm no easy i ' my min ' aboot Maggy -- the wull hizzie !
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 26]: Gin she be meetin ' her father , an ' chance to miss him , the Lord kens what may come o ' her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 19]: Hugh tried to comfort her , but all that could be done was to wait David 's return .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 11]: The storm seemed to increase rather than abate its force .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 29]: The footprints Hugh had made , had all but vanished already at the very door of the house , which stood quite in the shelter of the fir-wood .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 18]: As they looked out , a dark figure appeared within a yard or two of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 10]: `` The Lord grant it be my bairn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 4]: prayed poor Janet .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 8]: But it was David , and alone .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 5]: Janet gave a shriek .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 8]: `` Dawvid , whaur 's Maggie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 15]: `` I haena seen the bairn , '' replied David , in repressed perturbation .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 13]: `` She 's no theroot , is she , the nicht ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 19]: `` She 's no at hame , Dawvid , that 's a ' ` at I ken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 6]: `` Whaur gaed she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 5]: `` The Lord kens .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 12]: She 's smoored i ' the snaw by this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 19]: `` She 's i ' the Lord 's han 's , Janet , be she aneath a snaw-vraith .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 6]: Dinna forget that , wuman .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 12]: Hoo lang is ' t sin ' ye missed her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 13]: `` An hour an ' mair -- I dinna ken hoo lang .

Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 11]: `` I 'll awa ' an ' leuk for her .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 16]: Just haud the hert in her till I come back , Mr. Sutherlan ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 10]: `` I wo n't be left behind , David .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 7]: I 'm going with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 14]: `` Ye dinna ken what ye 're sayin ' , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 17]: I wad sune hae twa o ' ye to seek in place o ' ane . ''
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 18]: `` Never heed me ; I 'm going on my own account , come what may . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 11]: `` Weel , weel ; I downa bide to differ .

Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 5]: My puir lassie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 23]: The sigh that must have accompanied the last words , was lost in the wind , as they vanished in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 37]: Janet fell on her knees in the kitchen , with the door wide open , and the wind drifting in the powdery snow , and scattering it with the ashes from the hearth over the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 11]: A picture of more thorough desolation can hardly be imagined .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 50]: She soon came to herself , however ; and reflecting that , if the lost child was found , there must be a warm bed to receive her , else she might be a second time lost , she rose and shut the door , and mended the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 33]: It was as if the dumb attitude of her prayer was answered ; for though she had never spoken or even thought a word , strength was restored to her distracted brain .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 25]: When she had made every preparation she could think of , she went to the door again , opened it , and looked out .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 47]: It was a region of howling darkness , tossed about by pale snow-drifts ; out of which it seemed scarce more hopeful that welcome faces would emerge , than that they should return to our eyes from the vast unknown in which they vanish at last .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 36]: She closed the door once more , and knowing nothing else to be done , sat down on a chair , with her hands on her knees , and her eyes fixed on the door .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 61]: The clock went on with its slow swing , tic -- tac , tic -- tac , an utterly inhuman time-measurer ; but she heard the sound of every second , through the midst of the uproar in the fir-trees , which bent their tall heads hissing to the blast , and swinging about in the agony of their strife .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 27]: The minutes went by , till an hour was gone , and there was neither sound nor hearing , but of the storm and the clock .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 13]: Still she sat and stared , her eyes fixed on the door-latch .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 13]: Suddenly , without warning it was lifted , and the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 13]: Her heart bounded and fluttered like a startled bird ; but alas !
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 15]: the first words she heard were : `` Is she no come yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 13]: It was her husband , followed by several of the farm servants .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 31]: He had made a circuit to the farm , and finding that Hugh had never been there , hoped , though with trembling , that Margaret had already returned home .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 28]: The question fell upon Janet 's heart like the sound of the earth on the coffin-lid , and her silent stare was the only answer David received .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 38]: But at that very moment , like a dead man burst from the tomb , entered from behind the party at the open door , silent and white , with rigid features and fixed eyes , Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 16]: He stumbled in , leaning forward with long strides , and dragging something behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 38]: He pushed and staggered through them as if he saw nothing before him ; and as they parted horror-stricken , they saw that it was Margaret , or her dead body , that he dragged after him .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 26]: He dropped her at her mother 's feet , and fell himself on the floor , before they were able to give him any support .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 37]: David , who was quite calm , got the whisky bottle out , and tried to administer some to Margaret first ; but her teeth were firmly set , and to all appearance she was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 51]: One of the young men succeeded better with Hugh , whom at David 's direction they took into the study ; while he and Janet got Margaret undressed and put to bed , with hot bottles all about her ; for in warmth lay the only hope of restoring her .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 42]: After she had lain thus for a while , she gave a sigh ; and when they had succeeded in getting her to swallow some warm milk , she began to breathe , and soon seemed to be only fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 17]: After half an hour 's rest and warming , Hugh was able to move and speak .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 31]: David would not allow him to say much , however , but got him to bed , sending word to the house that he could not go home that night .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 28]: He and Janet sat by the fireside all night , listening to the storm that still raved without , and thanking God for both of the lives .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 21]: Every few minutes a tip-toe excursion was made to the bedside , and now and then to the other room .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 6]: Both the patients slept quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 29]: Towards morning Margaret opened her eyes , and faintly called her mother ; but soon fell asleep once more , and did not awake again till nearly noon .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 39]: When sufficiently restored to be able to speak , the account she gave was , that she had set out to meet her father ; but the storm increasing , she had thought it more prudent to turn .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 32]: It grew in violence , however , so rapidly , and beat so directly in her face , that she was soon exhausted with struggling , and benumbed with the cold .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 45]: The last thing she remembered was , dropping , as she thought , into a hole , and feeling as if she were going to sleep in bed , yet knowing it was death ; and thinking how much sweeter it was than sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 20]: Hugh 's account was very strange and defective , but he was never able to add anything to it .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 37]: He said that , when he rushed out into the dark , the storm seized him like a fury , beating him about the head and face with icy wings , till he was almost stunned .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 41]: He took the road to the farm , which lay through the fir-wood ; but he soon became aware that he had lost his way and might tramp about in the fir-wood till daylight , if he lived as long .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 18]: Then , thinking of Margaret , he lost his presence of mind , and rushed wildly along .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 52]: He thought he must have knocked his head against the trunk of a tree , but he could not tell ; for he remembered nothing more but that he found himself dragging Margaret , with his arms round her , through the snow , and nearing the light in the cottage-window .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 25]: Where or how he had found her , or what the light was that he was approaching , he had not the least idea .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 15]: He had only a vague notion that he was rescuing Margaret from something dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 32]: Margaret , for her part , had no recollection of reaching the fir-wood , and as , long before morning , all traces were obliterated , the facts remained a mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 23]: Janet thought that David had some wonderful persuasion about it ; but he was never heard even to speculate on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 12]: Certain it was , that Hugh had saved Margaret 's life .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 21]: He seemed quite well next day , for he was of a very powerful and enduring frame for his years .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 19]: She recovered more slowly , and perhaps never altogether overcame the effects of Death 's embrace that night .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 79]: From the moment when Margaret was brought home , the storm gradually died away , and by the morning all was still ; but many starry and moonlit nights glimmered and passed , before that snow was melted away from the earth ; and many a night Janet awoke from her sleep with a cry , thinking she heard her daughter moaning , deep in the smooth ocean of snow , and could not find where she lay .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 36]: The occurrences of this dreadful night could not lessen the interest his cottage friends felt in Hugh ; and a long winter passed with daily and lengthening communion both in study and in general conversation .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 19]: I fear some of my younger readers will think my story slow ; and say : `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 13]: are they not going to fall in love with each other yet ?
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 10]: We have been expecting it ever so long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 9]: I have two answers to make to this .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 45]: The first is : `` I do not pretend to know so much about love as you -- excuse me -- think you do ; and must confess , I do not know whether they were in love with each other or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 39]: The second is : `` That I dare not pretend to understand thoroughly such a sacred mystery as the heart of Margaret ; and I should feel it rather worse than presumptuous to talk as if I did .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 27]: Even Hugh 's is known to me only by gleams of light thrown , now and then , and here and there , upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 13]: Perhaps the two answers are only the same answer in different shapes .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 94]: Mrs. Glasford , however , would easily answer the question , if an answer is all that is wanted ; for she , notwithstanding the facts of the story , which she could not fail to have heard correctly from the best authority , and notwithstanding the nature of the night , which might have seemed sufficient to overthrow her conclusions , uniformly remarked , as often as their escape was alluded to in her hearing , `` Lat them tak ' it They had no business to be oot aboot thegither . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 2]: TRANSITION .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 18]: Tell me , bright boy , tell me , my golden lad , Whither away so frolic ?
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 4]: Why so glad ?
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 7]: What all thy wealth in council ?
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 4]: all thy state ?
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 5]: Are husks so dear ?
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 8]: troth , 't is a mighty rate .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 3]: RICHARD CRASHAW .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 14]: The long Scotch winter passed by without any interruption to the growing friendship .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 26]: But the spring brought a change ; and Hugh was separated from his friends sooner than he had anticipated , by more than six months .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 35]: For his mother wrote to him in great distress , in consequence of a claim made upon her for some debt which his father had contracted , very probably for Hugh 's own sake .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 30]: Hugh could not bear that any such should remain undischarged , or that his father 's name should not rest in peace as well as his body and soul .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 48]: He requested , therefore , from the laird , the amount due to him , and despatched almost the whole of it for the liquidation of this debt , so that he was now as unprovided as before for the expenses of the coming winter at Aberdeen .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 41]: But , about the same time , a fellow-student wrote to him with news of a situation for the summer , worth three times as much as his present one , and to be procured through his friend 's interest .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 58]: Hugh having engaged himself to the laird only for the winter , although he had intended to stay till the commencement of the following session , felt that , although he would much rather remain where he was , he must not hesitate a moment to accept his friend 's offer ; and therefore wrote at once .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 9]: I will not attempt to describe the parting .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 11]: It was very quiet , but very solemn and sad .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 13]: Janet showed far more distress than Margaret , for she wept outright .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 18]: The tears stood in David 's eyes , as he grasped the youth 's hand in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 9]: Margaret was very pale ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 37]: As soon as Hugh disappeared with her father , who was going to walk with him to the village through which the coach passed , she hurried away , and went to the fir-wood for comfort .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 13]: Hugh found his new situation in Perthshire very different from the last .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 20]: The heads of the family being themselves a lady and a gentleman , he found himself a gentleman too .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 16]: He had more to do , but his work left him plenty of leisure notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 50]: A good portion of his spare time he devoted to verse-making , to which he felt a growing impulse ; and whatever may have been the merit of his compositions , they did him intellectual good at least , if it were only through the process of their construction .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 32]: He wrote to David after his arrival , telling him all about his new situation ; and received in return a letter from Margaret , written at her father 's dictation .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 37]: The mechanical part of letter-writing was rather laborious to David ; but Margaret wrote well , in consequence of the number of papers , of one sort and another , which she had written for Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 12]: Three or four letters more passed between them at lengthening intervals .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 59]: Then they ceased -- on Hugh 's side first ; until , when on the point of leaving for Aberdeen , feeling somewhat conscience-stricken at not having written for so long , he scribbled a note to inform them of his approaching departure , promising to let them know his address as soon as he found himself settled .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 16]: Will it be believed that the session went by without the redemption of this pledge ?
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 24]: Surely he could not have felt , to any approximate degree , the amount of obligation he was under to his humble friends .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 96]: Perhaps , indeed , he may have thought that the obligation was principally on their side ; as it would have been , if intellectual assistance could outweigh heart-kindness , and spiritual impulse and enlightenment ; for , unconsciously in a great measure to himself , he had learned from David to regard in a new and more real aspect , many of those truths which he had hitherto received as true , and which yet had till then produced in him no other than a feeling of the common-place and uninteresting at the best .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 72]: Besides this , and many cognate advantages , a thousand seeds of truth must have surely remained in his mind , dropped there from the same tongue of wisdom , and only waiting the friendly aid of a hard winter , breaking up the cold , selfish clods of clay , to share in the loveliness of a new spring , and be perfected in the beauty of a new summer .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 67]: However this may have been , it is certain that he forgot his old friends far more than he himself could have thought it possible he should ; for , to make the best of it , youth is easily attracted and filled with the present show , and easily forgets that which , from distance in time or space , has no show to show .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 178]: Spending his evenings in the midst of merry faces , and ready tongues fluent with the tones of jollity , if not always of wit , which glided sometimes into no too earnest discussion of the difficult subjects occupying their student hours ; surrounded by the vapours of whisky-toddy , and the smoke of cutty pipes , till far into the short hours ; then hurrying home , and lapsing into unrefreshing slumbers over intended study ; or sitting up all night to prepare the tasks which had been neglected for a ball or an evening with Wilson , the great interpreter of Scottish song -- it is hardly to be wondered at that he should lose the finer consciousness of higher powers and deeper feelings , not from any behaviour in itself wrong , but from the hurry , noise , and tumult in the streets of life , that , penetrating too deep into the house of life , dazed and stupefied the silent and lonely watcher in the chamber of conscience , far apart .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 9]: He had no time to think or feel .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 7]: The session drew to a close .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 106]: He eschewed all idleness ; shut himself up , after class hours , with his books ; ate little , studied hard , slept irregularly , working always best between midnight and two in the morning ; carried the first honours in most of his classes ; and at length breathed freely , but with a dizzy brain , and a face that revealed , in pale cheeks , and red , weary eyes , the results of an excess of mental labour -- an excess which is as injurious as any other kind of intemperance , the moral degradation alone kept out of view .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 58]: Proud of his success , he sat down and wrote a short note , with a simple statement of it , to David ; hoping , in his secret mind , that he would attribute his previous silence to an absorption in study which had not existed before the end of the session was quite at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 72]: Now that he had more time for reflection , he could not bear the idea that that noble rustic face should look disapprovingly or , still worse , coldly upon him ; and he could not help feeling as if the old ploughman had taken the place of his father , as the only man of whom he must stand in awe , and who had a right to reprove him .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 9]: He did reprove him now , though unintentionally .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 68]: For David was delighted at having such good news from him ; and the uneasiness which he had felt , but never quite expressed , was almost swept away in the conclusion , that it was unreasonable to expect the young man to give his time to them both absent and present , especially when he had been occupied to such good purpose as this letter signified .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 13]: So he was nearly at peace about him -- though not quite .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 45]: Hugh received from him the following letter in reply to his ; dictated , as usual , to his secretary , Margaret : -- `` MY DEAR SIR , `` Ye 'll be a great man some day , gin ye haud at it .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 16]: But things maunna be gotten at the outlay o ' mair than they 're worth .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 7]: Ye 'll ken what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 17]: An ' there 's better things nor bein ' a great man , efter a ' .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 17]: Forgie the liberty I tak ' in remin ` in ' ye o ' sic like .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 16]: I 'm only remin ` in ' ye o ' what ye ken weel aneuch .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 51]: But ye 're a brave lad , an ' ye hae been an unco frien ' to me an ' mine ; an ' I pray the Lord to thank ye for me , for ye hae dune muckle guid to his bairns -- meanin ' me an ' mine .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 95]: It 's verra kin ' o ' ye to vrite till 's in the verra moment o ' victory ; but weel ye kent that amid a ' yer frien 's -- an ' ye canna fail to hae mony a ane , wi ' a head an ' a face like yours -- there was na ane -- na , no ane , that wad rejoice mair ower your success than Janet , or my doo , Maggie , or yer ain auld obleeged frien ' an ' servant , `` DAVID ELGINBROD .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 17]: `` P.S. -- We 're a ' weel , an ' unco blythe at your letter .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 6]: Maggy -- `` P.S. 2 .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 37]: -- Dear Mr. Sutherland , -- I wrote all the above at my father 's dictation , and just as he said it , for I thought you would like his Scotch better than my English .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 12]: My mother and I myself are rejoiced at the good news .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 6]: My mother fairly grat outright .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 12]: I gaed out to the tree where I met you first .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 17]: I wonder sair sometimes if you was the angel I was to meet in the fir-wood .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 13]: I am , `` Your obedient servant , `` MARGARET ELGINBROD . ''
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 6]: This letter certainly touched Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 20]: But he could not help feeling rather offended that David should write to him in such a warning tone .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 15]: He had never addressed him in this fashion when he saw him every day .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 13]: Indeed , David could not very easily have spoken to him thus .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 39]: But writing is a different thing ; and men who are not much accustomed to use a pen , often assume a more solemn tone in doing so , as if it were a ceremony that required state .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 80]: As for David , having been a little uneasy about Hugh , and not much afraid of offending him -- for he did not know his weaknesses very thoroughly , and did not take into account the effect of the very falling away which he dreaded , in increasing in him pride , and that impatience of the gentlest reproof natural to every man -- he felt considerably relieved after he had discharged his duty in this memento vivere .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 27]: But one of the results , and a very unexpected one , was , that a yet longer period elapsed before Hugh wrote again to David .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 32]: He meant to do so , and meant to do so ; but , as often as the thought occurred to him , was checked both by consciousness and by pride .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 32]: So much contributes , not the evil alone that is in us , but the good also sometimes , to hold us back from doing the thing we ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: It now remained for Hugh to look about for some occupation .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 54]: The state of his funds rendered immediate employment absolutely necessary ; and as there was only one way in which he could earn money without yet further preparation , he must betake himself to that way , as he had done before , in the hope that it would lead to something better .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 23]: At all events , it would give him time to look about him , and make up his mind for the future .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 48]: Many a one , to whom the occupation of a tutor is far more irksome than it was to Hugh , is compelled to turn his acquirements to this immediate account ; and , once going in this groove , can never get out of it again .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 93]: But Hugh was hopeful enough to think , that his reputation at the university would stand him in some stead ; and , however much he would have disliked the thought of being a tutor all his days , occupying a kind of neutral territory between the position of a gentleman and that of a menial , he had enough of strong Saxon good sense to prevent him , despite his Highland pride , from seeing any great hardship in labouring still for a little while , as he had laboured hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 43]: But he hoped to find a situation more desirable than either of those he had occupied before ; and , with this expectation , looked towards the South , as most Scotchmen do , indulging the national impulse to spoil the Egyptians .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 57]: Nor did he look long , sending his tentacles afloat in every direction , before he heard , through means of a college friend , of just such a situation as he wanted , in the family of a gentleman of fortune in the county of Surrey , not much more than twenty miles from London .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 10]: This he was fortunate enough to obtain without difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 10]: Margaret was likewise on the eve of a change .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 22]: She stood like a young fledged bird on the edge of the nest , ready to take its first long flight .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 28]: It was necessary that she should do something for herself , not so much from the compulsion of immediate circumstances , as in prospect of the future .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 50]: Her father was not an old man , but at best he could leave only a trifle at his death ; and if Janet outlived him , she would probably require all that , and what labour she would then be capable of as well , to support herself .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 19]: Margaret was anxious , too , though not to be independent , yet , not to be burdensome .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 39]: Both David and Janet saw that , by her peculiar tastes and habits , she had separated herself so far from the circle around her , that she could never hope to be quite comfortable in that neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 40]: It was not that by any means she despised or refused the labours common to the young women of the country ; but , all things considered , they thought that something more suitable for her might be procured .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 15]: The laird 's lady continued to behave to her in the most supercilious fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 28]: The very day of Hugh 's departure , she had chanced to meet Margaret walking alone with a book , this time unopened , in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 4]: Mrs. Glasford stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 9]: Margaret stopped too , expecting to be addressed .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 54]: The lady looked at her , all over , from head to foot , as if critically examining the appearance of an animal she thought of purchasing ; then , without a word , but with a contemptuous toss of the head , passed on , leaving poor Margaret both angry and ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 46]: But David was much respected by the gentry of the neighbourhood , with whom his position , as the laird 's steward , brought him not unfrequently into contact ; and to several of them he mentioned his desire of finding some situation for Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 94]: Janet could not bear the idea of her lady-bairn leaving them , to encounter the world alone ; but David , though he could not help sometimes feeling a similar pang , was able to take to himself hearty comfort from the thought , that if there was any safety for her in her father 's house , there could not be less in her heavenly Father 's , in any nook of which she was as full in His eye , and as near His heart , as in their own cottage .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 90]: He felt that anxiety in this case , as in every other , would just be a lack of confidence in God , to suppose which justifiable would be equivalent to saying that He had not fixed the foundations of the earth that it should not be moved ; that He was not the Lord of Life , nor the Father of His children ; in short , that a sparrow could fall to the ground without Him , and that the hairs of our head are not numbered .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 9]: Janet admitted all this , but sighed nevertheless .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 59]: So did David too , at times ; for he knew that the sparrow must fall ; that many a divine truth is hard to learn , all-blessed as it is when learned ; and that sorrow and suffering must come to Margaret , ere she could be fashioned into the perfection of a child of the kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 11]: Still , she was as safe abroad as at home .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 18]: An elderly lady of fortune was on a visit to one of the families in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 23]: She was in want of a lady 's - maid , and it occurred to the housekeeper that Margaret might suit her .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 22]: This was not quite what her parents would have chosen , but they allowed her to go and see the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 21]: Margaret was delighted with the benevolent-looking gentlewoman ; and she , on her part , was quite charmed with Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 35]: It was true she knew nothing of the duties of the office ; but the present maid , who was leaving on the best of terms , would soon initiate her into its mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 25]: And David and Janet were so much pleased with Margaret 's account of the interview , that David himself went to see the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 33]: The sight of him only increased her desire to have Margaret , whom she said she would treat like a daughter , if only she were half as good as she looked .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 32]: Before David left her , the matter was arranged ; and within a month , Margaret was borne in her mistress 's carriage , away from father and mother and cottage-home .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 6]: END OF THE FIRST BOOK .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: BOOK II .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 2]: ARNSTEAD .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 9]: The earth hath bubbles as the water has .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 2]: MACBETH .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 6]: -- I. 3 CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 4]: A NEW HOME .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 11]: A wise man 's home is whereso'er he 's wise .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 3]: JOHN MARSTON .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 5]: -- Antonio 's Revenge .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 27]: Hugh left the North dead in the arms of grey winter , and found his new abode already alive in the breath of the west wind .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 39]: As he walked up the avenue to the house , he felt that the buds were breaking all about , though , the night being dark and cloudy , the green shadows of the coming spring were invisible .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 51]: He was received at the hall-door , and shown to his room , by an old , apparently confidential , and certainly important butler ; whose importance , however , was inoffensive , as founded , to all appearance , on a sense of family and not of personal dignity .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 31]: Refreshment was then brought him , with the message that , as it was late , Mr. Arnold would defer the pleasure of meeting him till the morning at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 11]: Left to himself , Hugh began to look around him .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 25]: Everything suggested a contrast between his present position and that which he had first occupied about the same time of the year at Turriepuffit .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 22]: He was in an old handsome room of dark wainscot , furnished like a library , with book-cases about the walls .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 26]: One of them , with glass doors , had an ancient escritoire underneath , which was open , and evidently left empty for his use .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 43]: A fire was burning cheerfully in an old high grate ; but its light , though assisted by that of two wax candles on the table , failed to show the outlines of the room , it was so large and dark .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 15]: The ceiling was rather low in proportion , and a huge beam crossed it .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 19]: At one end , an open door revealed a room beyond , likewise lighted with fire and candles .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 21]: Entering , he found this to be an equally old-fashioned bedroom , to which his luggage had been already conveyed .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 21]: `` As far as creature comforts go , '' thought Hugh , `` I have fallen on my feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 18]: He rang the bell , had the tray removed , and then proceeded to examine the book-cases .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 20]: He found them to contain much of the literature with which he was most desirous of making an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 9]: A few books of the day were interspersed .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 36]: The sense of having good companions in the authors around him , added greatly to his feeling of comfort ; and he retired for the night filled with pleasant anticipations of his sojourn at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 21]: All the night , however , his dreams were of wind and snow , and Margaret out in them alone .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 13]: Janet was waiting in the cottage for him to bring her home .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 32]: He had found her , but could not move her ; for the spirit of the storm had frozen her to ice , and she was heavy as a marble statue .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 25]: When he awoke , the shadows of boughs and budding twigs were waving in changeful network-tracery , across the bright sunshine on his window-curtains .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 28]: Before he was called he was ready to go down ; and to amuse himself till breakfast-time , he proceeded to make another survey of the books .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 36]: He concluded that these must be a colony from the mother-library ; and also that the room must , notwithstanding , be intended for his especial occupation , seeing his bedroom opened out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 28]: Next , he looked from all the windows , to discover into what kind of a furrow on the face of the old earth he had fallen .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 9]: All he could see was trees and trees .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 3]: But oh !
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 13]: how different from the sombre , dark , changeless fir-wood at Turriepuffit !
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 28]: whose trees looked small and shrunken in his memory , beside this glory of boughs , breaking out into their prophecy of an infinite greenery at hand .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 25]: His rooms seemed to occupy the end of a small wing at the back of the house , as well as he could judge .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 53]: His sitting-room windows looked across a small space to another wing ; and the windows of his bedroom , which were at right-angles to those of the former , looked full into what seemed an ordered ancient forest of gracious trees of all kinds , coming almost close to the very windows .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 32]: They were the trees which had been throwing their shadows on these windows for two or three hours of the silent spring sunlight , at once so liquid and so dazzling .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 25]: Then he resolved to test his faculty for discovery , by seeing whether he could find his way to the breakfast-room without a guide .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 73]: In this he would have succeeded without much difficulty , for it opened from the main-entrance hall , to which the huge square-turned oak staircase , by which he had ascended , led ; had it not been for the somewhat intricate nature of the passages leading from the wing in which his rooms were -LRB- evidently an older and more retired portion of the house -RRB- to the main staircase itself .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 29]: After opening many doors and finding no thoroughfare , he became convinced that , in place of finding a way on , he had lost the way back .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 18]: At length he came to a small stair , which led him down to a single door .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 37]: This he opened , and straightway found himself in the library , a long , low , silent-looking room , every foot of the walls of which was occupied with books in varied and rich bindings .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 24]: The lozenge-paned windows , with thick stone mullions , were much overgrown with ivy , throwing a cool green shadowiness into the room .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 32]: One of them , however , had been altered to a more modern taste , and opened with folding-doors upon a few steps , descending into an old-fashioned , terraced garden .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 45]: To approach this window he had to pass a table , lying on which he saw a paper with verses on it , evidently in a woman 's hand , and apparently just written , for the ink of the corrective scores still glittered .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 30]: Just as he reached the window , which stood open , a lady had almost gained it from the other side , coming up the steps from the garden .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 21]: She gave a slight start when she saw him , looked away , and as instantly glanced towards him again .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 37]: Then approaching him through the window , for he had retreated to allow her to enter , she bowed with a kind of studied ease , and a slight shade of something French in her manner .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 28]: Her voice was very pleasing , almost bewitching ; yet had , at the same time , something assumed , if not affected , in the tone .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 24]: All this was discoverable , or rather spiritually palpable , in the two words she said -- merely , `` Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 2]: interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 23]: Hugh bowed , and said : `` I am very glad you have found me , for I had quite lost myself .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 12]: I doubt whether I should ever have reached the breakfast-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 9]: `` Come this way , '' she rejoined .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 20]: As they passed the table on which the verses lay , she stopped and slipped them into a writing-case .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 42]: Leading him through a succession of handsome , evidently modern passages , she brought him across the main hall to the breakfast-room , which looked in the opposite direction to the library , namely , to the front of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 33]: She rang the bell ; the urn was brought in ; and she proceeded at once to make the tea ; which she did well , rising in Hugh 's estimation thereby .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 60]: Before he had time , however , to make his private remarks on her exterior , or his conjectures on her position in the family , Mr. Arnold entered the room , with a slow , somewhat dignified step , and a dull outlook of grey eyes from a grey head well-balanced on a tall , rather slender frame .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 30]: The lady rose , and , addressing him as uncle , bade him good morning ; a greeting which he returned cordially , with a kiss on her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 33]: Then accosting Hugh , with a manner which seemed the more polite and cold after the tone in which he had spoken to his niece , he bade him welcome to Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 14]: `` I trust you were properly attended to last night , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 39]: Your pupil wanted very much to sit up till you arrived , but he is altogether too delicate , I am sorry to say , for late hours , though he has an unfortunate preference for them himself .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 20]: Jacob , '' -LRB- to the man in waiting -RRB- , `` is not Master Harry up yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: Master Harry 's entrance at that moment rendered reply unnecessary .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 20]: `` Good morning , Euphra , '' he said to the lady , and kissed her on the cheek .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 20]: `` Good morning , dear , '' was the reply , accompanied by a pretence of returning the kiss .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 76]: But she smiled with a kind of confectionary sweetness on him ; and , dropping an additional lump of sugar into his tea at the same moment , placed it for him beside herself ; while he went and shook hands with his father , and then glancing shyly up at Hugh from a pair of large dark eyes , put his hand in his , and smiled , revealing teeth of a pearly whiteness .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 25]: The lips , however , did not contrast them sufficiently , being pale and thin , with indication of suffering in their tremulous lines .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 29]: Taking his place at table , he trifled with his breakfast ; and after making pretence of eating for a while , asked Euphra if he might go .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 9]: She giving him leave , he hastened away .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 22]: Mr. Arnold took advantage of his retreat to explain to Hugh what he expected of him with regard to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 14]: `` How old would you take Harry to be , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 30]: `` I should say about twelve from his size , '' replied Hugh ; `` but from his evident bad health , and intelligent expression -- '' `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 20]: you perceive the state he is in , '' interrupted Mr. Arnold , with some sadness in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 10]: `` You are right ; he is nearly fifteen .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 12]: He has not grown half-an-inch in the last twelve months . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 14]: `` Perhaps that is better than growing too fast , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 10]: `` Perhaps -- perhaps ; we will hope so .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 10]: But I can not help being uneasy about him .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 38]: He reads too much , and I have not yet been able to help it ; for he seems miserable , and without any object in life , if I compel him to leave his books . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 15]: `` Perhaps we can manage to get over that in a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 27]: `` Besides , '' Mr. Arnold went on , paying no attention to what Hugh said , `` I can get him to take no exercise .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 8]: He does not even care for riding .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 22]: I bought him a second pony a month ago , and he has not been twice on its back yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 41]: Hugh could not help thinking that to increase the supply was not always the best mode of increasing the demand ; and that one who would not ride the first pony , would hardly be likely to ride the second .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 29]: Mr. Arnold concluded with the words : `` I do n't want to stop the boy 's reading , but I ca n't have him a milksop . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 15]: `` Will you let me manage him as I please , Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 5]: Hugh ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 42]: Mr. Arnold looked full at him , with a very slight but quite manifest expression of surprise ; and Hugh was aware that the eyes of the lady , called by the boy Euphra , were likewise fixed upon him penetratingly .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 35]: As if he were then for the first time struck by the manly development of Hugh 's frame , Mr. Arnold answered : `` I do n't want you to overdo it , either .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 11]: You can not make a muscular Christian of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 11]: -LRB- The speaker smiled at his own imagined wit . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 15]: `` The boy has talents , and I want him to use them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 22]: `` I will do my best for him both ways , '' answered Hugh , `` if you will trust me .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 34]: For my part , I think the only way is to make the operation of the intellectual tendency on the one side , reveal to the boy himself his deficiency on the other .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 10]: This once done , all will be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 22]: As he said this , Hugh caught sight of a cloudy , inscrutable dissatisfaction slightly contracting the eyebrows of the lady .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 12]: Mr. Arnold , however , seemed not to be altogether displeased .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 25]: `` Well , '' he answered , `` I have my plans ; but let us see first what you can do with yours .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 14]: If they fail , perhaps you will oblige me by trying mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 39]: This was said with the decisive politeness of one who is accustomed to have his own way , and fully intends to have it -- every word as articulate and deliberate as organs of speech could make it .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 18]: But he seemed at the same time somewhat impressed by Hugh , and not unwilling to yield .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 43]: Throughout the conversation , the lady had said nothing , but had sat watching , or rather scrutinizing , Hugh 's countenance , with a far keener and more frequent glance than , I presume , he was at all aware of .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 72]: Whether or not she was satisfied with her conclusions , she allowed no sign to disclose ; but , breakfast being over , rose and withdrew , turning , however , at the door , and saying : `` When you please , Mr. Sutherland , I shall be glad to show you what Harry has been doing with me ; for till now I have been his only tutor . ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 21]: `` Thank you , '' replied Hugh ; `` but for some time we shall be quite independent of school-books .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 8]: Perhaps we may require none at all .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 11]: He can read , I presume , fairly well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 29]: `` Reading is not only his forte but his fault , '' replied Mr. Arnold ; while Euphra , fixing one more piercing look upon him , withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 41]: `` Yes , '' responded Hugh ; `` but a boy may shuffle through a book very quickly , and have no such accurate perceptions of even the mere words , as to be able to read aloud intelligibly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 13]: How little this applied to Harry , Hugh was soon to learn .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 13]: `` Well , you know best about these things , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 6]: I leave it to you .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 25]: With such testimonials as you have , Mr. Sutherland , I can hardly be wrong in letting you try your own plans with him .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 9]: Now , I must bid you good morning .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 14]: You will , in all probability , find Harry in the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 5]: HARRY 'S NEW HORSE .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 27]: Spielender Unterricht heisst nicht , dem Kinde Anstrengungen ersparen und abnehmen , sondern eine Leidenschaft in ihm erwecken , welche ihm die stärksten aufnöthigt und erleichtert .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 3]: JEAN PAUL .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 5]: -- Die Unsichtbare Loge .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 42]: It is not the intention of sportive instruction that the child should be spared effort , or delivered from it ; but that thereby a passion should be wakened in him , which shall both necessitate and facilitate the strongest exertion .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 36]: Hugh made no haste to find his pupil in the library ; thinking it better , with such a boy , not to pounce upon him as if he were going to educate him directly .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 55]: He went to his own rooms instead ; got his books out and arranged them , -- supplying thus , in a very small degree , the scarcity of modern ones in the book-cases ; then arranged his small wardrobe , looked about him a little , and finally went to seek his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 46]: He found him in the library , as he had been given to expect , coiled up on the floor in a corner , with his back against the book-shelves , and an old folio on his knees , which he was reading in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 29]: `` Well , Harry , '' said Hugh , in a half-indifferent tone , as he threw himself on a couch , `` what are you reading ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 8]: Harry had not heard him come in .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 46]: He started , and almost shuddered ; then looked up , hesitated , rose , and , as if ashamed to utter the name of the book , brought it to Hugh , opening it at the title-page as he held it out to him .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: It was the old romance of Polexander .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 27]: Hugh knew nothing about it ; but , glancing over some of the pages , could not help wondering that the boy should find it interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 9]: `` Do you like this very much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 5]: `` Well -- no .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 5]: Yes , rather . ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 15]: `` I think I could find you something more interesting in the book-shelves . ''
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 11]: please , sir , may n't I read this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 12]: pleaded Harry , with signs of distress in his pale face .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , certainly , if you wish .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 14]: But tell me why you want to read it so very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 12]: `` Because I have set myself to read it through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 19]: Hugh saw that the child was in a diseased state of mind , as well as of body .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 20]: `` You should not set yourself to read anything , before you know whether it is worth reading . ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 7]: `` I could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 9]: I was forced to say I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 5]: `` To whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 4]: `` To myself .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 7]: May n't I read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 29]: `` Certainly , '' was all Hugh 's answer ; for he saw that he must not pursue the subject at present : the boy was quite hypochondriacal .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 16]: His face was keen , with that clear definition of feature which suggests superior intellect .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 23]: He was , though very small for his age , well proportioned , except that his head and face were too large .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 32]: His forehead indicated thought ; and Hugh could not doubt that , however uninteresting the books which he read might be , they must have afforded him subjects of mental activity .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 56]: But he could not help seeing as well , that this activity , if not altered in its direction and modified in its degree , would soon destroy itself , either by ruining his feeble constitution altogether , or , which was more to be feared , by irremediably injuring the action of the brain .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 61]: He resolved , however , to let him satisfy his conscience by reading the book ; hoping , by the introduction of other objects of thought and feeling , to render it so distasteful , that he would be in little danger of yielding a similar pledge again , even should the temptation return , which Hugh hoped to prevent .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 15]: `` But you have read enough for the present , have you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 10]: said he , rising , and approaching the book-shelves .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 11]: `` Yes ; I have been reading since breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 6]: there 's a capital book .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 11]: Have you ever read it -- Gulliver 's Travels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 8]: The outside looked always so uninteresting . ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 8]: `` So does Polexander 's outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 9]: But I could n't help that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 6]: `` Well , come along .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 7]: I will read to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 3]: thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 5]: That will be delightful .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 10]: But must we not go to our lessons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 11]: `` I 'm going to make a lesson of this .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 24]: I have been talking to your papa ; and we 're going to begin with a holiday , instead of ending with one .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 18]: I must get better acquainted with you first , Harry , before I can teach you right .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 9]: We must be friends , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 40]: The boy crept close up to him , laid one thin hand on his knee , looked in his face for a moment , and then , without a word , sat down on the couch close beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 18]: Before an hour had passed , Harry was laughing heartily at Gulliver 's adventures amongst the Lilliputians .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 19]: Having arrived at this point of success , Hugh ceased reading , and began to talk to him .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 8]: `` Is that lady your cousin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 6]: Is n't she beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 6]: `` I hardly know yet .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 10]: I have not got used to her enough yet .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 6]: What is her name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 8]: such a pretty name -- Euphrasia . ''
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 11]: `` Is she the only lady in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 11]: `` Yes ; my mamma is dead , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 20]: She was ill for a long time , they say ; and she died when I was born . ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 10]: The tears came in the poor boy 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 16]: Hugh thought of his own father , and put his hand on Harry 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 9]: Harry laid his head on Hugh 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 16]: `` But , '' he went on , `` Euphra is so kind to me !
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 7]: And she is so clever too !
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 5]: She knows everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 9]: `` Have you no brothers or sisters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 5]: `` No , none .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 6]: I wish I had . ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'll be your big brother .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 17]: Only you must mind what I say to you ; else I shall stop being him .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 6]: Is it a bargain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 8]: `` Yes , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 28]: cried Harry in delight ; and , springing from the couch , he began hopping feebly about the room on one foot , to express his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 9]: `` Well , then , that 's settled .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 39]: Now , you must come and show me the horses -- your ponies , you know -- and the pigs -- '' `` I do n't like the pigs -- I do n't know where they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 8]: `` Well , we must find out .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 9]: Perhaps I shall make some discoveries for you .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 6]: Have you any rabbits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 8]: `` A dog though , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 21]: I had a canary , but the cat killed it , and I have never had a pet since . ''
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 13]: `` Well , get your cap , and come out with me .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 8]: I will wait for you here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 8]: Harry walked away -- he seldom ran .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 13]: He soon returned with his cap , and they sallied out together .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 29]: Happening to look back at the house , when a few paces from it , Hugh thought he saw Euphra standing at the window of a back staircase .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 33]: They made the round of the stables , and the cow-house , and the poultry-yard ; and even the pigs , as proposed , came in for a share of their attention .
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 17]: As they approached the stye , Harry turned away his head with a look of disgust .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 8]: They were eating out of the trough .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 9]: `` They make such a nasty noise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 14]: `` Yes , but just look : do n't they enjoy it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: Harry looked at them .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 15]: The notion of their enjoyment seemed to dawn upon him as something quite new .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 9]: He went nearer and nearer to the stye .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 10]: At last a smile broke out over his countenance .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 10]: `` How tight that one curls his tail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 8]: said he , and burst out laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 11]: `` How dreadfully this boy must have been mismanaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 5]: thought Hugh to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 14]: `` But there is no fear of him now , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 30]: By this time they had been wandering about for more than an hour ; and Hugh saw , by Harry 's increased paleness , that he was getting tired .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 18]: `` Here , Harry , get on my back , my boy , and have a ride .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 5]: You 're tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 5]: And Hugh knelt down .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 4]: Harry shrunk back .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 11]: `` I shall spoil your coat with my shoes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 3]: `` Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 8]: Rub them well on the grass there .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 9]: And then get on my back directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 22]: Harry did as he was bid , and found his tutor 's broad back and strong arms a very comfortable saddle .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 22]: So away they went , wandering about for a long time , in their new relation of horse and his rider .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 25]: At length they got into the middle of a long narrow avenue , quite neglected , overgrown with weeds , and obstructed with rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 14]: But the trees were fine beeches , of great growth and considerable age .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 37]: One end led far into a wood , and the other towards the house , a small portion of which could be seen at the end , the avenue appearing to reach close up to it .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 11]: `` Do n't go down this , '' said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 23]: `` Well , it 's not a very good road for a horse certainly , but I think I can go it .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 5]: What a beautiful avenue !
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 7]: Why is it so neglected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 13]: `` Do n't go down there , please , dear horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 10]: Harry was getting wonderfully at home with Hugh already .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 3]: asked Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 17]: `` They call it the Ghost 's Walk , and I do n't much like it .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 8]: It has a strange distracted look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 60]: `` That 's a long word , and a descriptive one too , '' thought Hugh ; but , considering that there would come many a better opportunity of combating the boy 's fears than now , he simply said : `` Very well , Harry , '' -- and proceeded to leave the avenue by the other side .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 7]: But Harry was not yet satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 16]: `` Please , Mr. Sutherland , do n't go on that side , just now .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 6]: Ride me back , please .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 13]: It is not safe , they say , to cross her path .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 11]: She always follows any one who crosses her path . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 32]: Hugh laughed ; but again said , `` Very well , my boy ; '' and , returning , left the avenue by the side by which he had entered it .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 10]: `` Shall we go home to luncheon now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 12]: `` Could we not go by the front of the house ?
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 10]: I should like very much to see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 29]: `` Oh , certainly , '' said Harry , and proceeded to direct Hugh how to go ; but evidently did not know quite to his own satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 18]: There being , however , but little foliage yet , Hugh could discover his way pretty well .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 15]: He promised himself many a delightful wander in the woody regions in the evenings .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 48]: They managed to get round to the front of the house , not without some difficulty ; and then Hugh saw to his surprise that , although not imposing in appearance , it was in extent more like a baronial residence than that of a simple gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 28]: The front was very long , apparently of all ages , and of all possible styles of architecture , the result being somewhat mysterious and eminently picturesque .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 152]: All kinds of windows ; all kinds of projections and recesses ; a house here , joined to a hall there ; here a pointed gable , the very bell on the top overgrown and apparently choked with ivy ; there a wide front with large bay windows ; and next a turret of old stone , with not a shred of ivy upon it , but crowded over with grey-green lichens , which looked as if the stone itself had taken to growing ; multitudes of roofs , of all shapes and materials , so that one might very easily be lost amongst the chimneys and gutters and dormer windows and pinnacles -- made up the appearance of the house on the outside to Hugh 's first inquiring glance , as he paused at a little distance with Harry on his back , and scanned the wonderful pile before him .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 29]: But as he looked at the house of Arnstead , Euphra was looking at him with the boy on his back , from one of the smaller windows .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 7]: Was she making up her mind ?
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 23]: `` You are as kind to me as Euphra , '' said Harry , as Hugh set him down in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 15]: `` I 've enjoyed my ride very much , thank you , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 15]: I am sure Euphra will like you very much -- she likes everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 2]: EUPHRASIA .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 17]: then purged with Euphrasy and Rue The visual nerve , for he had much to see .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 6]: Paradise Lost , b. xi .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 7]: Soft music came to mine ear .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 27]: It was like the rising breeze , that whirls , at first , the thistle 's beard ; then flies , dark-shadowy , over the grass .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 30]: It was the maid of Fuärfed wild : she raised the nightly song ; for she knew that my soul was a stream , that flowed at pleasant sounds .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 2]: Ossian .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 3]: -- Oina-Morul .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 42]: Harry led Hugh by the hand to the dining-room , a large oak hall with Gothic windows , and an open roof supported by richly carved woodwork , in the squares amidst which were painted many escutcheons parted by fanciful devices .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 25]: Over the high stone carving above the chimney hung an old piece of tapestry , occupying the whole space between that and the roof .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 13]: It represented a hunting-party of ladies and gentlemen , just setting out .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 21]: The table looked very small in the centre of the room , though it would have seated twelve or fourteen .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 21]: It was already covered for luncheon ; and in a minute Euphra entered and took her place without a word .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 11]: Hugh sat on one side and Harry on the other .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 29]: Euphra , having helped both to soup , turned to Harry and said , `` Well , Harry , I hope you have enjoyed your first lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 11]: `` Very much , '' answered Harry with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 9]: `` I have learned pigs and horseback . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 11]: `` The boy is positively clever , '' thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 19]: `` Mr. Sutherland '' -- he continued , `` has begun to teach me to like creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 16]: `` But I thought you were very fond of your wild-beast book , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 13]: yes ; but that was only in the book , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 10]: I like the stories about them , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 12]: But to like pigs , you know , is quite different .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 7]: They are so ugly and ill-bred .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 6]: I like them though . ''
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 24]: `` You seem to have quite gained Harry already , '' said Euphra , glancing at Hugh , and looking away as quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 18]: `` We are very good friends , and shall be , I think , '' replied he .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 18]: Harry looked at him affectionately , and said to him , not to Euphra , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 11]: yes , that we shall , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 20]: Then turning to the lady -- `` Do you know , Euphra , he is my big brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 25]: `` You must mind how you make new relations , though , Harry ; for you know that would make him my cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: `` Well , you will be a kind cousin to him , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 26]: `` I will try , '' replied Euphra , looking up at Hugh with a naïve expression of shyness , and the slightest possible blush .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 10]: Hugh began to think her pretty , almost handsome .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 11]: His next thought was to wonder how old she was .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 13]: But about this he could not at once make up his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 10]: She might be four-and-twenty ; she might be two-and-thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 92]: She had black , lustreless hair , and eyes to match , as far as colour was concerned -- but they could sparkle , and probably flash upon occasion ; a low forehead , but very finely developed in the faculties that dwell above the eyes ; slender but very dark eyebrows -- just black arched lines in her rather sallow complexion ; nose straight , and nothing remarkable -- `` an excellent thing in woman , '' a mouth indifferent when at rest , but capable of a beautiful laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 18]: She was rather tall , and of a pretty enough figure ; hands good ; feet invisible .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 36]: Hugh came to these conclusions rapidly enough , now that his attention was directed to her ; for , though naturally unobservant , his perception was very acute as soon as his attention was roused .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 12]: `` Thank you , '' he replied to her pretty speech .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 11]: `` I shall do my best to deserve it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 18]: `` I hope you will , Mr. Sutherland , '' rejoined she , with another arch look .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 8]: `` Take some wine , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 22]: She poured out a glass of sherry , and gave it to the boy , who drank it with some eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 15]: Hugh could not approve of this , but thought it too early to interfere .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 20]: Turning to Harry , he said : `` Now , Harry , you have had rather a tiring morning .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 13]: I should like you to go and lie down a while . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 25]: `` Very well , Mr. Sutherland , '' replied Harry , who seemed rather deficient in combativeness , as well as other boyish virtues .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 10]: `` Shall I lie down in the library ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 8]: `` No -- have a change . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 6]: `` In my bed-room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 7]: `` No , I think not .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 17]: Go to my room , and lie on the couch till I come to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 56]: Harry went ; and Hugh , partly for the sake of saying something , and partly to justify his treatment of Harry , told Euphra , whose surname he did not yet know , what they had been about all the morning , ending with some remark on the view of the house in front .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 53]: She heard the account of their proceedings with apparent indifference , replying only to the remark with which he closed it : `` It is rather a large house , is it not , for three -- I beg your pardon , for four persons to live in , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 12]: `` It is , indeed ; it quite bewilders me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 19]: `` To tell the truth , I do n't quite know above the half of it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 39]: Hugh thought this rather a strange assertion , large as the house was ; but she went on : `` I lost myself between the housekeeper 's room and my own , no later than last week . ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 24]: I suppose there was a particle of truth in this ; and that she had taken a wrong turning in an abstracted fit .
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 13]: Perhaps she did not mean it to be taken as absolutely true .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 11]: `` You have not lived here long , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 9]: `` Not long for such a great place .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 4]: A few years .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 8]: I am only a poor relation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 12]: She accompanied this statement with another swift uplifting of the eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 30]: But this time her eyes rested for a moment on Hugh 's , with something of a pleading expression ; and when they fell , a slight sigh followed .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 10]: Hugh felt that he could not quite understand her .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 16]: A vague suspicion crossed his mind that she was bewitching him , but vanished instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 22]: He replied to her communication by a smile , and the remark : `` You have the more freedom , then .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: -- Did you know Harry 's mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 7]: he added , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 7]: She died when Harry was born .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 20]: She was very beautiful , and , they say , very clever , but always in extremely delicate health .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 24]: Between ourselves , I doubt if there was much sympathy -- that is , if my uncle and she quite understood each other .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 8]: But that is an old story . ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 26]: Euphra resumed : `` As to the freedom you speak of , Mr. Sutherland , I do not quite know what to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 18]: I live here as if the place were my own , and give what orders I please .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 36]: But Mr. Arnold shows me little attention -- he is so occupied with one thing and another , I hardly know what ; and if he did , perhaps I should get tired of him .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 24]: So , except when we have visitors , which is not very often , the time hangs rather heavy on my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 22]: `` But you are fond of reading -- and writing , too , I suspect ; '' Hugh ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 26]: She gave him another of her glances , in which the apparent shyness was mingled with something for which Hugh could not find a name .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 36]: Nor did he suspect , till long after , that it was in reality slyness , so tempered with archness , that , if discovered , it might easily pass for an expression playfully assumed .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 47]: yes , '' she said ; `` one must read a book now and then ; and if a verse '' -- again a glance and a slight blush -- `` should come up from nobody knows where , one may as well write it down .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 13]: But , please , do not take me for a literary lady .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 9]: Indeed , I make not the slightest pretensions .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 28]: I do n't know what I should do without Harry ; and indeed , indeed , you must not steal him from me , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 11]: `` I should be very sorry , '' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 29]: `` Let me beg you , as far as I have a right to do so , to join us as often and as long as you please .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 9]: I will go and see how he is .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 16]: I am sure the boy only wants thorough rousing , alternated with perfect repose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 22]: He went to his own room , where he found Harry , to his satisfaction , fast asleep on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 22]: He took care not to wake him , but sat down beside him to read till his sleep should be over .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 24]: But , a moment after , the boy opened his eyes with a start and a shiver , and gave a slight cry .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 27]: When he saw Hugh he jumped up , and with a smile which was pitiful to see upon a scared face , said : `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 9]: I am so glad you are there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 10]: `` What is the matter , dear Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 8]: `` I had a dreadful dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 4]: It always comes .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 6]: It is always the same .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 4]: I know that .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 11]: And yet I can never remember what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 24]: Hugh soothed him as well as he could ; and he needed it , for the cold drops were standing on his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 27]: When he had grown calmer , he went and fetched Gulliver , and , to the boy 's great delight , read to him till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 22]: Before the first bell rang , he had quite recovered , and indeed seemed rather interested in the approach of dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 10]: Dinner was an affair of some state at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 27]: Almost immediately after the second bell had rung , Mr. Arnold made his appearance in the drawing-room , where the others were already waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 20]: This room had nothing of the distinctive character of the parts of the house which Hugh had already seen .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 13]: It was merely a handsome modern room , of no great size .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 13]: Mr. Arnold led Euphra to dinner , and Hugh followed with Harry .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 24]: Mr. Arnold 's manner to Hugh was the same as in the morning -- studiously polite , without the smallest approach to cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 28]: He addressed him as an equal , it is true ; but an equal who could never be in the smallest danger of thinking he meant it .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 48]: Hugh , who , without having seen a great deal of the world , yet felt much the same wherever he was , took care to give him all that he seemed to look for , as far at least as was consistent with his own self-respect .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 38]: He soon discovered that he was one of those men , who , if you will only grant their position , and acknowledge their authority , will allow you to have much your own way in everything .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 38]: His servants had found this out long ago , and almost everything about the house was managed as they pleased ; but as the oldest of them were respectable family servants , nothing went very far wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 28]: They all , however , waited on Euphra with an assiduity that showed she was , or could be , quite mistress when and where she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 29]: Perhaps they had found out that she had great influence with Mr. Arnold ; and certainly he seemed very fond of her indeed , after a stately fashion .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 22]: She spoke to the servants with peculiar gentleness ; never said , if you please ; but always , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 18]: Harry never asked for anything , but always looked to Euphra , who gave the necessary order .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 22]: Hugh saw that the boy was quite dependent upon her , seeming of himself scarcely capable of originating the simplest action .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 36]: Mr. Arnold , however , dull as he was , could not help seeing that Harry 's manner was livelier than usual , and seemed pleased at the slight change already visible for the better .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 22]: Turning to Hugh he said : `` Do you find Harry very much behind with his studies , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 14]: `` I have not yet attempted to find out , '' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 4]: `` Not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 7]: said Mr. Arnold , with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 16]: If he be behind , I feel confident it will not be for long . ''
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 15]: `` But , '' began Mr. Arnold , pompously ; and then he paused .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 22]: `` You were kind enough to say , Mr. Arnold , that I might try my own plans with him first .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 7]: I have been doing so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 5]: `` Yes -- certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 57]: But -- '' Here Harry broke in with some animation : `` Mr. Sutherland has been my horse , carrying me about on his back all the morning -- no , not all the morning -- but an hour , or an hour and a half -- or was it two hours , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 23]: `` I really do n't know , Harry , '' answered Hugh ; `` I do n't think it matters much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 24]: Harry seemed relieved , and went on : `` He has been reading Gulliver 's Travels to me -- oh , such fall !
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 22]: And we have been to see the cows and the pigs ; and Mr. Sutherland has been teaching me to jump .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 19]: Do you know , papa , he jumped right over the pony 's back without touching it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 13]: Mr. Arnold stared at the boy with lustreless eyes and hanging checks .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 12]: These grew red , as if he were going to choke .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 25]: Such behaviour was quite inconsistent with the dignity of Arnstead and its tutor , who had been recommended to him as a thorough gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: But for the present he said nothing ; probably because he could think of nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 11]: `` Certainly Harry seems better already , '' interposed Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 15]: `` I can not help thinking Mr. Sutherland has made a good beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 32]: Mr. Arnold did not reply , but the cloud wore away from his face by degrees ; and at length he asked Hugh to take a glass of wine with him .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 22]: When Euphra rose from the table , and Harry followed her example , Hugh thought it better to rise as well .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 22]: Mr. Arnold seemed to hesitate whether or not to ask him to resume his seat and have a glass of claret .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 32]: Had he been a little wizened pedagogue , no doubt he would have insisted on his company , sure of acquiescence from him in every sentiment he might happen to utter .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 79]: But Hugh really looked so very much like a gentleman , and stated his own views , or adopted his own plans , with so much independence , that Mr. Arnold judged it safer to keep him at arm 's length for a season at least , till he should thoroughly understand his position -- not that of a guest , but that of his son 's tutor , belonging to the household of Arnstead only on approval .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 70]: On leaving the dining-room , Hugh hesitated , in his turn , whether to betake himself to his own room , or to accompany Euphra to the drawing-room , the door of which stood open on the opposite side of the hall , revealing a brightness and warmth , which the chill of the evening , and the lowness of the fire in the dining-room , rendered quite enticing .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 36]: But Euphra , who was half-across the hall , seeming to divine his thoughts , turned , and said , `` Are you not going to favour us with your company , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 35]: `` With pleasure , '' replied Hugh ; but , to cover his hesitation , added , `` I will be with you presently ; '' and ran up stairs to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 26]: `` The old gentleman sits on his dignity -- can hardly be said to stand on it , '' thought he , as he went .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 16]: `` The poor relation , as she calls herself , treats me like a guest .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 13]: She is mistress here , however ; that is clear enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 23]: As he descended the stairs to the drawing-room , a voice rose through the house , like the voice of an angel .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 13]: At least so thought Hugh , hearing it for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 20]: It seemed to take his breath away , as he stood for a moment on the stairs , listening .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 11]: It was only Euphra singing The Flowers of the Forest .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 17]: The drawing-room door was still open , and her voice rang through the wide lofty hall .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 17]: He entered almost on tip-toe , that he might lose no thread of the fine tones .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 14]: -- Had she chosen the song of Scotland out of compliment to him ?
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 13]: -- She saw him enter , but went on without hesitating even .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 37]: In the high notes , her voice had that peculiar vibratory richness which belongs to the nightingale 's ; but he could not help thinking that the low tones were deficient both in quality and volume .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 16]: The expression and execution , however , would have made up for a thousand defects .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 29]: Her very soul seemed brooding over the dead upon Flodden field , as she sang this most wailful of melodies -- this embodiment of a nation 's grief .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 39]: The song died away as if the last breath had gone with it ; failing as it failed , and ceasing with its inspiration , as if the voice that sang lived only for and in the song .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 7]: A moment of intense silence followed .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 47]: Then , before Hugh had half recovered from the former , with an almost grand dramatic recoil , as if the second sprang out of the first , like an eagle of might out of an ocean of weeping , she burst into Scots wha hae .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 14]: She might have been a new Deborah , heralding her nation to battle .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 18]: Hugh was transfixed , turned icy cold , with the excitement of his favourite song so sung .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 19]: -- Was that a glance of satisfied triumph with which Euphra looked at him for a single moment ?
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 23]: -- She sang the rest of the song as if the battle were already gained ; but looked no more at Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 47]: The excellence of her tones , and the lambent fluidity of her transitions , if I may be allowed the phrase , were made by her art quite subservient to the expression , and owed their chief value to the share they bore in producing it .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 36]: Possibly there was a little too much of the dramatic in her singing , but it was all in good taste ; and , in a word , Hugh had never heard such singing before .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 15]: As soon as she had finished , she rose , and shut the piano .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 23]: `` Do not , do not , '' faltered Hugh , seeking to arrest her hand , as she closed the instrument .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 31]: `` I can sing nothing after that , '' she said with emotion , or perhaps excitement ; for the trembling of her voice might be attributed to either cause .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 7]: `` Do not ask me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 32]: Hugh respectfully desisted ; but after a few minutes ' pause ventured to remark : `` I can not understand how you should be able to sing Scotch songs so well .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 23]: I never heard any but Scotch women sing them , even endurably , before : your singing of them is perfect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 33]: `` It seems to me , '' said Euphra , speaking as if she would rather have remained silent , `` that a true musical penetration is independent of styles and nationalities .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 16]: It can perceive , or rather feel , and reproduce , at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 12]: If the music speaks Scotch , the musical nature hears Scotch .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 19]: It can take any shape , indeed can not help taking any shape , presented to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 23]: Hugh was yet further astonished by this criticism from one whom he had been criticising with so much carelessness that very day .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 56]: `` You think , then , '' said he , modestly , not as if he would bring her to book , but as really seeking to learn from her , `` that a true musical nature can pour itself into the mould of any song , in entire independence of association and education ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 16]: `` Yes ; in independence of any but what it may provide for itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 37]: Euphrasia , however , had left one important element unrepresented in the construction of her theory -- namely , the degree of capability which a mind may possess of sympathy with any given class of feelings .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 35]: The blossom of the mind , whether it flower in poetry , music , or any other art , must be the exponent of the nature and condition of that whose blossom it is .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 22]: No mind , therefore , incapable of sympathising with the feelings whence it springs , can interpret the music of another .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 13]: And Euphra herself was rather a remarkable instance of this forgotten fact .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 39]: Further conversation on the subject was interrupted by the entrance of Mr. Arnold , who looked rather annoyed at finding Hugh in the drawing-room , and ordered Harry off to bed , with some little asperity of tone .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 19]: The boy rose at once , rang the bell , bade them all good night , and went .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 15]: A servant met him at the door with a candle , and accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 14]: Thought Hugh : `` Here are several things to be righted at once .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 26]: The boy must not have wine ; and he must have only one dinner a-day -- especially if he is ordered to bed so early .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 12]: I must make a man of him if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 17]: He made inquiries , and , with some difficulty , found out where the boy slept .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 25]: During the night he was several times in Harry 's room , and once in happy time to wake him from a nightmare dream .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 24]: The boy was so overcome with terror , that Hugh got into bed beside him and comforted him to sleep in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 33]: Nor did he leave him till it was time to get up , when he stole back to his own quarters , which , happily , were at no very great distance .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 28]: I may mention here , that it was not long before Hugh succeeded in stopping the wine , and reducing the dinner to a mouthful of supper .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 29]: Harry , as far as he was concerned , yielded at once ; and his father only held out long enough to satisfy his own sense of dignity .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 6]: THE CAVE IN THE STRAW .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 20]: All knowledge and wonder -LRB- which is the seed of knowledge -RRB- is an impression of pleasure in itself .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 3]: LORD BACON .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 5]: -- Advancement of Learning .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 29]: The following morning dawned in a cloud ; which , swathed about the trees , wetted them down to the roots , without having time to become rain .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 19]: They drank it in like sorrow , the only material out of which true joy can be fashioned .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 36]: This cloud of mist would yet glimmer in a new heaven , namely , in the cloud of blooms which would clothe the limes and the chestnuts and the beeches along the ghost 's walk .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 33]: But there was gloomy weather within doors as well ; for poor Harry was especially sensitive to variations of the barometer , without being in the least aware of the fact himself .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 20]: Again Hugh found him in the library , seated in his usual corner , with Polexander on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 28]: He half dropped the book when Hugh entered , and murmured with a sigh : `` It 's no use ; I ca n't read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 9]: `` What 's the matter , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 4]: said his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 16]: `` I should like to tell you , but you will laugh at me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 11]: `` I shall never laugh at you , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 4]: `` Never ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 6]: `` No , never . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 17]: `` Then tell me how I can be sure that I have read this book . ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 9]: `` I do not quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 12]: I was sure nobody could be so stupid as I am .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 64]: Do you know , Mr. Sutherland , I seem to have read a page from top to bottom sometimes , and when I come to the bottom I know nothing about it , and doubt whether I have read it at all ; and then I stare at it all over again , till I grow so queer , and sometimes nearly scream .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 15]: You see I must be able to say I have read the book . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 7]: Nobody will ever ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 11]: `` Perhaps not ; but you know that is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 18]: I want to know that I have read the book -- really and truly read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 56]: Hugh thought for a moment , and seemed to see that the boy , not being strong enough to be a law to himself , just needed a benign law from without , to lift him from the chaos of feeble and conflicting notions and impulses within , which generated a false law of slavery .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 14]: So he said : `` Harry , am I your big brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 18]: `` Then , ought you to do what I wish , or what you wish yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 8]: `` What you wish , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 17]: `` Then I want you to put away that book for a month at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 6]: `` Oh , Mr. Sutherland !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 4]: I promised . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 5]: `` To whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 5]: `` To myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 18]: `` But I am above you ; and I want you to do as I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 6]: Will you , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 9]: `` Put away the book , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 32]: Harry sprang to his feet , put the book on its shelf , and , going up to Hugh , said , `` You have done it , not me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 6]: `` Certainly , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 34]: The notions of a hypochondriacal child will hardly be interesting to the greater part of my readers ; but Hugh learned from this a little lesson about divine law which he never forgot .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 22]: `` Now , Harry , '' added he , `` you must not open a book till I allow you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 7]: `` No poetry , either ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 9]: said poor Harry ; and his face fell .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 26]: `` I do n't mind poetry so much ; but of prose I will read as much to you as will be good for you .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 12]: Come , let us have a bit of Gulliver again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 7]: `` Oh , how delightful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 3]: cried Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 14]: `` I am so glad you made me put away that tiresome book .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 11]: I wonder why it insisted so on being read . ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 28]: Hugh read for an hour , and then made Harry put on his cloak , notwithstanding the rain , which fell in a slow thoughtful spring shower .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 15]: Taking the boy again on his back , he carried him into the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 54]: There he told him how the drops of wet sank into the ground , and then went running about through it in every direction , looking for seeds : which were all thirsty little things , that wanted to grow , and could not , till a drop came and gave them drink .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 35]: And he told him how the rain-drops were made up in the skies , and then came down , like millions of angels , to do what they were told in the dark earth .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 21]: The good drops went into all the cellars and dungeons of the earth , to let out the imprisoned flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 45]: And he told him how the seeds , when they had drunk the rain-drops , wanted another kind of drink next , which was much thinner and much stronger , but could not do them any good till they had drunk the rain first .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 6]: `` What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 17]: `` I feel as if you were reading out of the Bible , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 11]: `` It is the sunlight , '' answered his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 94]: `` When a seed has drunk of the water , and is not thirsty any more , it wants to breathe next ; and then the sun sends a long , small finger of fire down into the grave where the seed is lying ; and it touches the seed , and something inside the seed begins to move instantly and to grow bigger and bigger , till it sends two green blades out of it into the earth , and through the earth into the air ; and then it can breathe .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 55]: And then it sends roots down into the earth ; and the roots keep drinking water , and the leaves keep breathing the air , and the sun keeps them alive and busy ; and so a great tree grows up , and God looks at it , and says it is good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 9]: `` Then they really are living things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 3]: said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 14]: I do n't think I shall dislike rain so much any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 17]: Hugh took him next into the barn , where they found a great heap of straw .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 24]: Recalling his own boyish amusements , he made him put off his cloak , and help to make a tunnel into this heap .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 19]: Harry was delighted -- the straw was so nice , and bright , and dry , and clean .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 30]: They drew it out by handfuls , and thus excavated a round tunnel to the distance of six feet or so ; when Hugh proceeded to more extended operations .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 31]: Before it was time to go to lunch , they had cleared half of a hollow sphere , six feet in diameter , out of the heart of the heap .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 34]: After lunch , for which Harry had been very unwilling to relinquish the straw hut , Hugh sent him to lie down for a while ; when he fell fast asleep as before .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 23]: After he had left the room , Euphra said : `` How do you get on with Harry , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 10]: `` Perfectly to my satisfaction , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 10]: `` Do you not find him very slow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 6]: `` Quite the contrary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 5]: `` You surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 11]: But you have not given him any lessons yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 18]: `` I have given him a great many , and he is learning them very fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 22]: `` I fear he will have forgotten all my poor labours before you take up the work where we left it .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 9]: When will you give him any book-lessons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 8]: `` Not for a while yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 5]: Euphra did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 15]: Her silence seemed intended to express dissatisfaction ; at least so Hugh interpreted it .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 26]: `` I hope you do not think it is to indulge myself that I manage Master Harry in this peculiar fashion , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 28]: `` The fact is , he is a very peculiar child , and may turn out a genius or a weakling , just as he is managed .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 10]: At least so it appears to me at present .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 15]: May I ask where you left the work you were doing with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 29]: `` He was going through the Eton grammar for the third time , '' answered Euphra , with a defiant glance , almost of dislike , at Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 24]: `` But I need not enumerate his studies , for I daresay you will not take them up at all after my fashion .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 12]: I only assure you I have been a very exact disciplinarian .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 14]: What he knows , I think you will find he knows thoroughly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 27]: So saying , Euphra rose , and with a flush on her cheek , walked out of the room in a more stately manner than usual .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 13]: Hugh felt that he had , somehow or other , offended her .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 21]: But , to tell the truth , he did not much care , for her manner had rather irritated him .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 33]: He retired to his own room , wrote to his mother , and , when Harry awoke , carried him again to the barn for an hour 's work in the straw .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 31]: Before it grew dusk , they had finished a little , silent , dark chamber , as round as they could make it , in the heart of the straw .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 24]: All the excavated material they had thrown on the top , reserving only a little to close up the entrance when they pleased .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 32]: The next morning was still rainy ; and when Hugh found Harry in the library as usual , he saw that the clouds had again gathered over the boy 's spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 12]: He was pacing about the room in a very odd manner .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 10]: The carpet was divided diamond-wise in a regular pattern .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 45]: Harry 's steps were , for the most part , planted upon every third diamond , as he slowly crossed the floor in a variety of directions ; for , as on previous occasions , he had not perceived the entrance of his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 48]: But , every now and then , the boy would make the most sudden and irregular change in his mode of progression , setting his foot on the most unexpected diamond , at one time the nearest to him , at another the farthest within his reach .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 59]: When he looked up , and saw his tutor watching him , he neither started nor blushed : but , still retaining on his countenance the perplexed , anxious expression which Hugh had remarked , said to him : `` How can God know on which of those diamonds I am going to set my foot next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 63]: `` If you could understand how God knows , Harry , then you would know yourself ; but before you have made up your mind , you do n't know which you will choose ; and even then you only know on which you intend to set your foot ; for you have often changed your mind after making it up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 7]: Harry looked as puzzled as before .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 29]: `` Why , Harry , to understand how God understands , you would need to be as wise as he is ; so it is no use trying .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 21]: You see you ca n't quite understand me , though I have a real meaning in what I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 17]: I see it is no use ; but I ca n't bear to be puzzled . ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 16]: `` But you need not be puzzled ; you have no business to be puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 21]: You are trying to get into your little brain what is far too grand and beautiful to get into it .
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 24]: Would you not think it very stupid to puzzle yourself how to put a hundred horses into a stable with twelve stalls ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 7]: Harry laughed , and looked relieved .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 15]: `` It is more unreasonable a thousand times to try to understand such things .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 21]: For my part , it would make me miserable to think that there was nothing but what I could understand .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 11]: I should feel as if I had no room anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 9]: Shall we go to our cave again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 27]: yes , please , '' cried Harry ; and in a moment he was on Hugh 's back once more , cantering joyously to the barn .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 34]: After various improvements , including some enlargement of the interior , Hugh and Harry sat down together in the low yellow twilight of their cave , to enjoy the result of their labours .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 22]: They could just see , by the light from the tunnel , the glimmer of the golden hollow all about them .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 35]: The rain was falling heavily out-of-doors ; and they could hear the sound of the multitudinous drops of the broken cataract of the heavens like the murmur of the insects in a summer wood .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 25]: They knew that everything outside was rained upon , and was again raining on everything beneath it , while they were dry and warm .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 6]: `` This is nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 11]: exclaimed Harry , after a few moments of silent enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 13]: `` This is your first lesson in architecture , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 8]: `` Am I to learn architecture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 8]: asked Harry , in a rueful tone .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 24]: `` It is well to know how things came to be done , if you should know nothing more about them , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 36]: Men lived in the cellars first of all , and next on the ground floor ; but they could get no further till they joined the two , and then they could build higher . ''
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 11]: `` I do n't quite understand you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 11]: `` I did not mean you should , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 9]: `` Then I do n't mind , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 8]: But I thought architecture was building . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 13]: `` So it is ; and this is one way of building .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 24]: It is only making an outside by pulling out an inside , instead of making an inside by setting up an outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 18]: Harry thought for a while , and then said joyfully : `` I see it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 4]: I see it .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 12]: The inside is the chief thing -- not the outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 11]: `` Yes , Harry ; and not in architecture only .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 5]: Never forget that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 13]: They lay for some time in silence , listening to the rain .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 35]: At length Harry spoke : `` I have been thinking of what you told me yesterday , Mr. Sutherland , about the rain going to look for the seeds that were thirsty for it .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 38]: And now I feel just as if I were a seed , lying in its little hole in the earth , and hearing the rain-drops pattering down all about it , waiting -- oh , so thirsty !
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 17]: -- for some kind drop to find me out , and give me itself to drink .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 17]: I wonder what kind of flower I should grow up , '' added he , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 84]: `` There is more truth than you think , in your pretty fancy , Harry , '' rejoined Hugh , and was silent -- self-rebuked ; for the memory of David came back upon him , recalled by the words of the boy ; of David , whom he loved and honoured with the best powers of his nature , and whom yet he had neglected and seemed to forget ; nay , whom he had partially forgotten -- he could not deny .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 54]: The old man , whose thoughts were just those of a wise child , had said to him once : `` We ken no more , Maister Sutherlan ' , what we 're growin ' till , than that neep-seed there kens what a neep is , though a neep it will be .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 23]: The only odds is , that we ken that we dinna ken , and the neep-seed kens nothing at all aboot it .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 36]: But ae thing , Maister Sutherlan ' , we may be sure o ' : that , whatever it be , it will be worth God 's makin ' an ' our growin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 77]: A solemn stillness fell upon Hugh 's spirit , as he recalled these words ; out of which stillness , I presume , grew the little parable which follows ; though Hugh , after he had learned far more about the things therein hinted at , could never understand how it was , that he could have put so much more into it , than he seemed to have understood at that period of his history .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 19]: For Harry said : `` Would n't this be a nice place for a story , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 9]: Do you ever tell stories , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 32]: `` I was just thinking of one , Harry ; but it is as much yours as mine , for you sowed the seed of the story in my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 21]: `` Do you mean a story that never was in a book -- a story out of your own head ?
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 6]: that will be grand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 25]: `` Wait till we see what it will be , Harry ; for I ca n't tell you how it will turn out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 27]: After a little further pause , Hugh began : `` Long , long ago , two seeds lay beside each other in the earth , waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 26]: It was cold , and rather wearisome ; and , to beguile the time , the one found means to speak to the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 9]: ` What are you going to be ? '
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 6]: said the one . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 11]: I do n't know , ' answered the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 17]: ` For me , ' rejoined the first , ' I mean to be a rose .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 8]: There is nothing like a splendid rose .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 8]: Everybody will love me then ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 41]: ` It 's all right , ' whispered the second ; and that was all he could say ; for somehow when he had said that , he felt as if all the words in the world were used up .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 12]: So they were silent again for a day or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 6]: ` Oh , dear ! '
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 11]: cried the first , ' I have had some water .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 9]: I never knew till it was inside me .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 4]: I 'm growing !
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 4]: I 'm growing !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 4]: Good-bye ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 4]: ` Good-bye ! '
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 14]: repeated the other , and lay still ; and waited more than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 30]: `` The first grew and grew , pushing itself straight up , till at last it felt that it was in the open air , for it could breathe .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 8]: And what a delicious breath that was !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 9]: It was rather cold , but so refreshing .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 43]: The flower could see nothing , for it was not quite a flower yet , only a plant ; and they never see till their eyes come , that is , till they open their blossoms -- then they are flowers quite .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 35]: So it grew and grew , and kept its head up very steadily , meaning to see the sky the first thing , and leave the earth quite behind as well as beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 20]: But somehow or other , though why it could not tell , it felt very much inclined to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 7]: At length it opened its eye .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 16]: It was morning , and the sky was over its head ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 11]: itself was no rose -- only a tiny white flower .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 45]: It felt yet more inclined to hang down its head and to cry ; but it still resisted , and tried hard to open its eye wide , and to hold its head upright , and to look full at the sky . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 11]: I will be a star of Bethlehem at least ! '
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 6]: said the flower to itself .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 24]: `` But its head felt very heavy ; and a cold wind rushed over it , and bowed it down towards the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 37]: And the flower saw that the time of the singing of birds was not come , that the snow covered the whole land , and that there was not a single flower in sight but itself .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 13]: And it half-closed its leaves in terror and the dismay of loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 33]: But that instant it remembered what the other flower used to say ; and it said to itself : ` It 's all right ; I will be what I can . '
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 28]: And thereon it yielded to the wind , drooped its head to the earth , and looked no more on the sky , but on the snow .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 56]: And straightway the wind stopped , and the cold died away , and the snow sparkled like pearls and diamonds ; and the flower knew that it was the holding of its head up that had hurt it so ; for that its body came of the snow , and that its name was Snow-drop .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 14]: And so it said once more , ` It 's all right ! '
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 6]: and waited in perfect peace .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 15]: All the rest it needed was to hang its head after its nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 9]: `` And what became of the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 3]: asked Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 14]: `` I have n't done with this one yet , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 9]: `` I only told you it was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 37]: One day a pale , sad-looking girl , with thin face , large eyes , and long white hands , came , hanging her head like the snowdrop , along the snow where the flower grew .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 13]: She spied it , smiled joyously , and saying , ` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 9]: my little sister , are you come ? '
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 6]: stooped and plucked the snowdrop .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 43]: It trembled and died in her hand ; which was a heavenly death for a snowdrop ; for had it not cast a gleam of summer , pale as it had been itself , upon the heart of a sick girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 6]: `` And the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 3]: repeated Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 22]: `` The other had a long time to wait ; but it did grow one of the loveliest roses ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 27]: And at last it had the highest honour ever granted to a flower : two lovers smelled it together , and were content with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 17]: Harry was silent , and so was Hugh ; for he could not understand himself quite .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 23]: He felt , all the time he was speaking , is if he were listening to David , instead of talking himself .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 24]: The fact was , he was only expanding , in an imaginative soil , the living seed which David had cast into it .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 18]: There seemed to himself to be more in his parable than he had any right to invent .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 16]: But is it not so with all stories that are rightly rooted in the human ?
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 10]: `` What a delightful story , Mr. Sutherland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 6]: said Harry , at last .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 21]: `` Euphra tells me stories sometimes ; but I do n't think I ever heard one I liked so much .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 15]: I wish we were meant to grow into something , like the flower-seeds . ''
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 8]: `` So we are , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 5]: `` Are we indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 17]: How delightful it would be to think that I am only a seed , Mr. Sutherland !
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 9]: Do you think I might think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 13]: `` Then , please , let me begin to learn something directly .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 24]: I have n't had anything disagreeable to do since you came ; and I do n't feel as if that was right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 23]: Poor Harry , like so many thousands of good people , had not yet learned that God is not a hard task-master .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 20]: `` I do n't intend that you should have anything disagreeable to do , if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 26]: We must do such things when they come to us ; but we must not make them for ourselves , or for each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 15]: `` Then I 'm not to learn any more Latin , am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 27]: said Harry , in a doubtful kind of tone , as if there were after all a little pleasure in doing what he did not like .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 9]: `` Is Latin so disagreeable , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 18]: `` Yes ; it is rule after rule , that has nothing in it I care for .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 7]: How can anybody care for Latin ?
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 21]: But I am quite ready to begin , if I am only a seed -- really , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 6]: `` Not yet , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 30]: Indeed , we shall not begin again -- I wo n't let you -- till you ask me with your whole heart , to let you learn Latin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 19]: `` I am afraid that will be a long time , and Euphra will not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 9]: `` I will talk to her about it .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 12]: But perhaps it will not be so long as you think .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 24]: Now , do n't mention Latin to me again , till you are ready to ask me , heartily , to teach you .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 11]: And do n't give yourself any trouble about it either .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 9]: You never can make yourself like anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 4]: Harry was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 22]: They returned to the house , through the pouring rain ; Harry , as usual , mounted on his big brother .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 11]: As they crossed the hall , Mr. Arnold came in .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: He looked surprised and annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 25]: Hugh set Harry down , who ran upstairs to get dressed for dinner ; while he himself half-stopped , and turned towards Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 13]: But Mr. Arnold did not speak , and so Hugh followed Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 43]: Hugh spent all that evening , after Harry had gone to bed , in correcting his impressions of some of the chief stories of early Roman history ; of which stories he intended commencing a little course to Harry the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 24]: Meantime there was very little intercourse between Hugh and Euphra , whose surname , somehow or other , Hugh had never inquired after .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 20]: He disliked asking questions about people to an uncommon degree , and so preferred waiting for a natural revelation .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 40]: Her later behaviour had repelled him , impressing him with the notion that she was proud , and that she had made up her mind , notwithstanding her apparent frankness at first , to keep him at a distance .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 27]: That she was fitful , too , and incapable of showing much tenderness even to poor Harry , he had already concluded in his private judgment-hall .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 30]: Nor could he doubt that , whether from wrong theories , incapacity , or culpable indifference , she must have taken very bad measures indeed with her young pupil .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 19]: The next day resembled the two former ; with this difference , that the rain fell in torrents .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 12]: Seated in their strawy bower , they cared for no rain .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 15]: They were safe from the whole world , and all the tempers of nature .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 18]: Then Hugh told Harry about the slow beginnings and the mighty birth of the great Roman people .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 20]: He told him tales of their battles and conquests ; their strifes at home , and their wars abroad .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 20]: He told him stories of their grand men , great with the individuality of their nation and their own .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 26]: He told him their characters , their peculiar opinions and grounds of action , and the results of their various schemes for their various ends .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 87]: He told him about their love to their country , about their poetry and their religion ; their courage , and their hardihood ; their architecture , their clothes , and their armour ; their customs and their laws ; but all in such language , or mostly in such language , as one boy might use in telling another of the same age ; for Hugh possessed the gift of a general simplicity of thought , one of the most valuable a man can have .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 44]: It cost him a good deal of labour -LRB- well-repaid in itself , not to speak of the evident delight of Harry -RRB- , to make himself perfectly competent for this ; but he had a good foundation of knowledge to work upon .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 19]: This went on for a long time after the period to which I am now more immediately confined .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 47]: Every time they stopped to rest from their rambles or games -- as often , in fact , as they sat down alone , Harry 's constant request was : `` Now , Mr. Sutherland , might n't we have something more about the Romans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 8]: And Mr. Sutherland gave him something more .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 12]: But all this time he never uttered the word -- Latin .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 7]: CHAPTER V. LARCH AND OTHER HUNTING .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 132]: For there is neither buske nor hay In May , that it n'ill shrouded bene , And it with newé leavés wrene ; These woodés eke recoveren grene , That drie in winter ben to sene , And the erth waxeth proud withall , For swoté dewes that on it fall , And the poore estate forget , In which that winter had it set : And than becomes the ground so proude , That it wol have a newé shroude , And maketh so queint his robe and faire , That it hath hewes an hundred paire , Of grasse and floures , of Ind and Pers , And many hewés full divers : That is the robe I mean , ywis , Through which the ground to praisen is .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 10]: CHAUCER 'S translation of the Romaunt of the Rose .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 8]: So passed the three days of rain .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 20]: After breakfast the following morning , Hugh went to find Harry , according to custom , in the library .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 4]: He was reading .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 9]: `` What are you reading , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 3]: asked he .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 21]: `` A poem , '' said Harry ; and , rising as before , he brought the book to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 7]: It was Mrs. Hemans 's Poems .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 10]: `` You are fond of poetry , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 6]: `` Yes , very . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 9]: `` Whose poems do you like best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 8]: `` Mrs. Hemans 's , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 12]: Do n't you think she is the best , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 9]: `` She writes very beautiful verses , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 8]: Which poem are you reading now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 11]: one of my favourites -- The Voice of Spring . ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 10]: `` Who taught you to like Mrs. Hemans ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 7]: `` Euphra , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 10]: `` Will you read the poem to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 50]: Harry began , and read the poem through , with much taste and evident enjoyment ; an enjoyment which seemed , however , to spring more from the music of the thought and its embodiment in sound , than from sympathy with the forms of nature called up thereby .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 23]: This was shown by his mode of reading , in which the music was everything , and the sense little or nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 39]: When he came to the line , `` And the larch has hung all his tassels forth , '' he smiled so delightedly , that Hugh said : `` Are you fond of the larch , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 6]: `` Yes , very . ''
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 8]: `` Are there any about here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: What is it like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 10]: `` You said you were fond of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 16]: `` Oh , yes ; it is a tree with beautiful tassels , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 9]: I think I should like to see one .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 8]: Is n't it a beautiful line ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 23]: `` When you have finished the poem , we will go and see if we can find one anywhere in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 23]: We must know where we are in the world , Harry -- what is all round about us , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 19]: `` Oh , yes , '' said Harry ; `` let us go and hunt the larch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 21]: `` Perhaps we shall meet Spring , if we look for her -- perhaps hear her voice , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 12]: `` That would be delightful , '' answered Harry , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 5]: And away they went .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 84]: I may just mention here that Mrs. Hemans was allowed to retire gradually , till at last she was to be found only in the more inaccessible recesses of the library-shelves ; while by that time Harry might be heard , not all over the house , certainly , but as far off as outside the closed door of the library , reading aloud to himself one or other of Macaulay 's ballads , with an evident enjoyment of the go in it .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 30]: A story with drum and trumpet accompaniment was quite enough , for the present , to satisfy Harry ; and Macaulay could give him that , if little more .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 27]: As they went across the lawn towards the shrubbery , on their way to look for larches and Spring , Euphra joined them in walking dress .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 6]: It was a lovely morning .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 19]: `` I have taken you at your word , you see , Mr. Sutherland , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 12]: `` I do n't want to lose my Harry quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 7]: `` You dear kind Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 13]: said Harry , going round to her side and taking her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 19]: He did not stay long with her , however , nor did Euphra seem particularly to want him .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 36]: `` There was one thing I ought to have mentioned to you the other night , Mr. Sutherland ; and I daresay I should have mentioned it , had not Mr. Arnold interrupted our tête-à-tête .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 27]: I feel now as if I had been guilty of claiming far more than I have a right to , on the score of musical insight .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 25]: I have Scotch blood in me , and was indeed born in Scotland , though I left it before I was a year old .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 35]: My mother , Mr. Arnold 's sister , married a gentleman who was half Sootch ; and I was born while they were on a visit to his relatives , the Camerons of Lochnie .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 27]: His mother , my grandmother , was a Bohemian lady , a countess with sixteen quarterings -- not a gipsy , I beg to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: Hugh thought she might have been , to judge from present appearances .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 25]: But how was he to account for this torrent of genealogical information , into which the ice of her late constraint had suddenly thawed ?
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 15]: It was odd that she should all at once volunteer so much about herself .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 32]: Perhaps she had made up one of those minds which need making up , every now and then , like a monthly magazine ; and now was prepared to publish it .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 18]: Hugh responded with a question : `` Do I know your name , then , at last ?
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 6]: You are Miss Cameron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 11]: `` Euphrasia Cameron ; at your service , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 22]: And she dropped a gay little courtesy to Hugh , looking up at him with a flash of her black diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 10]: `` Then you must sing to me to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 38]: `` With all the pleasure in gipsy-land , '' replied she , with a second courtesy , lower than the first ; taking for granted , no doubt , his silent judgment on her person and complexion .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 25]: By this time they had reached the woods in a different quarter from that which Hugh had gone through the other day with Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 25]: And here , in very deed , the Spring met them , with a profusion of richness to which Hugh was quite a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 23]: The ground was carpeted with primroses , and anemones , and other spring flowers , which are the loveliest of all flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 15]: They were drinking the sunlight , which fell upon them through the budded boughs .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 49]: By the time the light should be hidden from them by the leaves , which are the clouds of the lower firmament of the woods , their need of it would be gone : exquisites in living , they cared only for the delicate morning of the year .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 11]: `` Do look at this darling , Mr. Sutherland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 34]: exclaimed Euphrasia suddenly , as she bent at the root of a great beech , where grew a large bush of rough leaves , with one tiny but perfectly-formed primrose peeping out between .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 8]: `` Is it not a little pet ?
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 24]: -- all eyes -- all one eye staring out of its curtained bed to see what ever is going on in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 16]: -- You had better lie down again : it is not a nice place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 15]: She spoke to it as if it had been a kitten or a baby .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 22]: And as she spoke , she pulled the leaves yet closer over the little starer so as to hide it quite .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 30]: As they went on , she almost obtrusively avoided stepping on the flowers , saying she almost felt cruel , or at least rude , when she did so .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 19]: Yet she trailed her dress over them in quite a careless way , not lifting it at all .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 16]: This was a peculiarity of hers , which Hugh never understood till he understood herself .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 35]: All about in shady places , the ferns were busy untucking themselves from their grave-clothes , unrolling their mysterious coils of life , adding continually to the hidden growth as they unfolded the visible .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 14]: In this , they were like the other revelations of God the Infinite .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 16]: All the wild lovely things were coming up for their month 's life of joy .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 43]: Orchis-harlequins , cuckoo-plants , wild arums , more properly lords-and-ladies , were coming , and coming -- slowly ; for had they not a long way to come , from the valley of the shadow of death into the land of life ?
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 46]: At last the wanderers came upon a whole company of bluebells -- not what Hugh would have called bluebells , for the bluebells of Scotland are the single-poised harebells -- but wild hyacinths , growing in a damp and shady spot , in wonderful luxuriance .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 62]: They were quite three feet in height , with long , graceful , drooping heads ; hanging down from them , all along one side , the largest and loveliest of bells -- one lying close above the other , on the lower part ; while they parted thinner and thinner as they rose towards the lonely one at the top .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 25]: Miss Cameron went into ecstasies over these ; not saying much , but breaking up what she did say with many prettily passionate pauses .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 37]: She had a very happy turn for seeing external resemblances , either humorous or pathetic ; for she had much of one element that goes to the making of a poet -- namely , surface impressibility .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 19]: `` Look , Harry ; they are all sad at having to go down there again so soon .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 10]: They are looking at their graves so ruefully . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 8]: Harry looked sad and rather sentimental immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 14]: When Hugh glanced at Miss Cameron , he saw tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 17]: `` You have nothing like this in your country , have you , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 8]: said she , with an apparent effort .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 9]: `` No , indeed , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 6]: And he said no more .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 47]: For a vision rose before him of the rugged pine-wood and the single primrose ; and of the thoughtful maiden , with unpolished speech and rough hands , and -- but this he did not see -- a soul slowly refining itself to a crystalline clearness .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 48]: And he thought of the grand old grey-haired David , and of Janet with her quaint motherhood , and of all the blessed bareness of the ancient time -- in sunlight and in snow ; and he felt again that he had forgotten and forsaken his friends .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 18]: `` How the fairies will be ringing the bells in these airy steeples in the moonlight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 15]: said Miss Cameron to Harry , who was surprised and delighted with it all .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 62]: He could not help wondering , however , after he went to bed that night , that Euphra had never before taken him to see these beautiful things , and had never before said anything half so pretty to him , as the least pretty thing she had said about the flowers that morning when they were out with Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 9]: Had Mr. Sutherland anything to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 17]: Was he giving Euphra a lesson in flowers such as he had given him in pigs ?
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 21]: Miss Cameron presently drew Hugh into conversation again , and the old times were once more forgotten for a season .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 89]: They were worthy of distinguishing note -- that trio in those spring woods : the boy waking up to feel that flowers and buds were lovelier in the woods than in verses ; Euphra finding everything about her sentimentally useful , and really delighting in the prettinesses they suggested to her ; and Hugh regarding the whole chiefly as a material and means for reproducing in verse such impressions of delight as he had received and still received from all -LRB- but the highest -RRB- poetry about nature .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 45]: The presence of Harry and his necessities was certainly a saving influence upon Hugh ; but , however much he sought to realize Harry 's life , he himself , at this period of his history , enjoyed everything artistically far more than humanly .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 26]: Margaret would have walked through all this infant summer without speaking at all , but with a deep light far back in her quiet eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 12]: Perhaps she would not have had many thoughts about the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 28]: Rather she would have thought the very flowers themselves ; would have been at home with them , in a delighted oneness with their life and expression .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 26]: Certainly she would have walked through them with reverence , and would not have petted or patronised nature by saying pretty things about her children .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 19]: Their life would have entered into her , and she would have hardly known it from her own .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 15]: I daresay Miss Cameron would have called a mountain a darling or a beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 34]: But there are other ways of showing affection than by patting and petting -- though Margaret , for her part , would have needed no art-expression , because she had the things themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 42]: It is not always those who utter best who feel most ; and the dumb poets are sometimes dumb because it would need the `` large utterance of the early gods '' to carry their thoughts through the gates of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 15]: But the fancy and skin-sympathy of Miss Cameron began already to tell upon Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 18]: He knew very little of women , and had never heard a woman talk as she talked .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 22]: He did not know how cheap this accomplishment is , and took it for sensibility , imaginativeness , and even originality .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 14]: He thought she was far more en rapport with nature than he was .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 19]: It was much easier to make this mistake after hearing the really delightful way in which she sang .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 43]: Certainly she could not have sung so , perhaps not even have talked so , except she had been capable of more ; but to be capable of more , and to be able for more , are two very distinct conditions .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 20]: Many walks followed this , extending themselves farther and farther from home , as Harry 's strength gradually improved .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 28]: It was quite remarkable how his interest in everything external increased , in exact proportion as he learned to see into the inside or life of it .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 18]: With most children , the interest in the external comes first , and with many ceases there .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 42]: But it is in reality only a shallower form of the deeper sympathy ; and in those cases where it does lead to a desire after the hidden nature of things , it is perhaps the better beginning of the two .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 49]: In such exceptional cases as Harry 's , it is of unspeakable importance that both the difference and the identity should be recognized ; and in doing so , Hugh became to Harry his big brother indeed , for he led him where he could not go alone .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 22]: As often as Mr. Arnold was from home , which happened not unfrequently , Miss Cameron accompanied them in their rambles .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 30]: She gave as her reason for doing so only on such occasions , that she never liked to be out of the way when her uncle might want her .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 70]: Traces of an inclination to quarrel with Hugh , or even to stand upon her dignity , had all but vanished ; and as her vivacity never failed her , as her intellect was always active , and as by the exercise of her will she could enter sympathetically , or appear to enter , into everything , her presence was not in the least a restraint upon them .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 39]: On one occasion , when Harry had actually run a little way after a butterfly , Hugh said to her : `` What did you mean , Miss Cameron , by saying you were only a poor relation ?
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 9]: You are certainly mistress of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 6]: `` On sufferance , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 8]: But I am only a poor relation .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 9]: I have no fortune of my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: `` But Mr. Arnold does not treat you as such . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 2]: no .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 4]: He likes me .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 7]: He is very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 11]: -- He gave me this ring on my last birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 7]: Is it not a beauty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 19]: She pulled off her glove and showed a very fine diamond on a finger worthy of the ornament .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 14]: `` It is more like a gentleman 's , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 7]: she added , drawing it off .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 13]: `` Let me see how it would look on your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 35]: She gave the ring to Hugh ; who , laughing , got it with some difficulty just over the first joint of his little finger , and held it up for Euphra to see .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 17]: I see I can not ask you to wear it for me , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 8]: `` I do n't like it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 28]: I am afraid , however , '' she added , with an arch look , `` my uncle would not like it either -- on your finger .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 7]: Put it on mine again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 18]: Holding her hand towards Hugh , she continued : `` It must not be promoted just yet .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 15]: Besides , I see you have a still better one of your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 30]: As Hugh did according to her request , the words sprang to his lips , `` There are other ways of wearing a ring than on the finger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 10]: But they did not cross the threshold of speech .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 25]: Was it the repression of them that caused that strange flutter and slight pain at the heart , which he could not quite understand ?
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 2]: FATIMA .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 102]: Those lips that Love 's own hand did make Breathed forth the sound that said , `` I hate , '' To me that languished for her sake : But when she saw my woeful state , Straight in her heart did mercy come , Chiding that tongue that , ever sweet , Was used in giving gentle doom , And taught it thus anew to greet : `` I hate '' she altered with an end , That followed it as gentle day Doth follow night , who , like a fiend , From heaven to hell is flown away .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 22]: `` I hate '' from hate away she threw , And saved my life , saying -- `` Not you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 2]: SHAKSPERE .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 23]: Mr. Arnold was busy at home for a few days after this , and Hugh and Harry had to go out alone .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 49]: One day , when the wind was rather cold , they took refuge in the barn ; for it was part of Hugh 's especial care that Harry should be rendered hardy , by never being exposed to more than he could bear without a sense of suffering .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 24]: As soon as the boy began to feel fatigue , or cold , or any other discomfort , his tutor took measures accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 31]: Harry would have crept into the straw-house ; but Hugh said , pulling a book out of his pocket , `` I have a poem here for you , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 18]: I want to read it to you now ; and we ca n't see in there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 29]: They threw themselves down on the straw , and Hugh , opening a volume of Robert Browning 's Poems , read the famous ride from Ghent to Aix .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 11]: He knew the poem well , and read it well .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 5]: Harry was in raptures .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 15]: `` I wish I could read that as you do , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 7]: `` Try , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 16]: Harry tried the first verse , and threw the book down in disgust with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 9]: `` Why can not I read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 8]: `` Because you ca n't ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: `` I could ride , if I had such a horse as that to ride upon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 22]: `` But you could never have such a horse as that except you could ride , and ride well , first .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 13]: After that , there is no saying but you might get one .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 25]: You might , in fact , train one for yourself -- till from being a little foal it became your own wonderful horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 5]: that would be delightful !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 12]: Will you teach me horses as well , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 6]: `` Perhaps I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 27]: That evening , at dinner , Hugh said to Mr. Arnold : `` Could you let me have a horse to-morrow morning , Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 14]: Mr. Arnold stared a little , as he always did at anything new .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 36]: But Hugh went on : `` Harry and I want to have a ride to-morrow ; and I expect we shall like it so much , that we shall want to ride very often . ''
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 8]: `` Yes , that we shall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 3]: cried Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 13]: `` Could not Mr. Sutherland have your white mare , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 11]: said Mr. Arnold , reconciled at once to the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 14]: `` I would rather not , if you do n't mind , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 17]: My Fatty is not used to such a burden as I fear Mr. Sutherland would prove .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 12]: She drops a little now , on the hard road . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 9]: The fact was , Euphra would want Fatima .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 30]: `` Well , Harry , '' said Mr. Arnold , graciously pleased to be facetious , `` do n't you think your Welsh dray-horse could carry Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 2]: ha !
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 27]: Papa , do you know , Mr. Sutherland set him up on his hind legs yesterday , and made him walk on them like a dancing-dog .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 30]: He was going to lift him , but he kicked about so when he felt himself leaving the ground , that he tumbled Mr. Sutherland into the horse-trough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 19]: Even the solemn face of the butler relaxed into a smile , but Mr. Arnold 's clouded instead .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 10]: His boy 's tutor ought to be a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 10]: `` Was n't it fun , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 11]: `` It was to you , you little rogue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 5]: said Sutherland , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 13]: `` And how you did run home , dripping like a water-cart !
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 9]: -- and all the dogs after you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 11]: Mr. Arnold 's monotonous solemnity soon checked Harry 's prattle .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 17]: `` I will see , Mr. Sutherland , what I can do to mount you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 52]: `` I do n't care what it is , '' said Hugh ; who though by no means a thorough horseman , had been from boyhood in the habit of mounting everything in the shape of a horse that he could lay hands upon , from a cart-horse upwards and downwards .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 14]: `` There 's an old bay that would carry me very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: `` That is my own horse , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 8]: This stopped the conversation in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 23]: But next morning after breakfast , an excellent chestnut horse was waiting at the door , along with Harry 's new pony .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 8]: Mr. Arnold would see them go off .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 20]: This did not exactly suit Miss Cameron , but if she frowned , it was when nobody saw her .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 21]: Hugh put Harry up himself , told him to stick fast with his knees , and then mounted his chestnut .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 27]: As they trotted slowly down the avenue , Euphrasia heard Mr. Arnold say to himself , `` The fellow sits well , at all events . ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 23]: She took care to make herself agreeable to Hugh by reporting this , with the omission of the initiatory epithet , however .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 13]: Harry returned from his ride rather tired , but in high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 6]: `` Oh , Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 11]: he cried , `` Mr. Sutherland is such a rider !
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 8]: He jumps hedges and ditches and everything .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 14]: And he has promised to teach me and my pony to jump too .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 19]: And if I am not too tired , we are to begin to-morrow , out on the common .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 3]: jolly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 25]: The little fellow 's heart was full of the sense of growing life and strength , and Hugh was delighted with his own success .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 31]: He caught sight of a serpentine motion in Euphra 's eyebrows , as she bent her face again over the work from which she had lifted it on their entrance .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 4]: He addressed her .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 16]: `` You will be glad to hear that Harry has ridden like a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 11]: `` I am glad to hear it , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 17]: Why did she reply to the subject of the remark , and not to the speaker ?
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 35]: Hugh perplexed himself in vain to answer this question ; but a very small amount of experience would have made him able to understand at once as much of her behaviour as was genuine .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 27]: At luncheon she spoke only in reply ; and then so briefly , as not to afford the smallest peg on which to hang a response .
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 8]: `` What can be the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 3]: thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 8]: `` What a peculiar creature she is !
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 15]: But after what has passed between us , I ca n't stand this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 50]: When dinner was over that evening , she rose as usual and left the room , followed by Hugh and Harry ; but as soon as they were in the drawing-room , she left it ; and , returning to the dining-room , resumed her seat at the table .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 12]: `` Take a glass of claret , Euphra , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 4]: said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 10]: `` I will , if you please , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 5]: I should like it .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 11]: I have seldom a minute with you alone now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 29]: Evidently flattered , Mr. Arnold poured out a glass of claret , rose and carried it to his niece himself , and then took a chair beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 20]: `` Thank you , dear uncle , '' she said , with one of her bewitching flashes of smile .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 16]: `` Harry has been getting on bravely with his riding , has he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 3]: she continued .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 7]: `` So it would appear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 32]: Harry had been full of the story of the day at the dinner-table , where he still continued to present himself ; for his father would not be satisfied without him .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 29]: It was certainly good moral training for the boy , to sit there almost without eating ; and none the worse that he found it rather hard sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 20]: He talked much more freely now , and asked the servants for anything he wanted without referring to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 45]: Now and then he would glance at her , as if afraid of offending her ; but the cords which bound him to her were evidently relaxing ; and she saw it plainly enough , though she made no reference to the unpleasing fact .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 27]: `` I am only a little fearful , uncle , lest Mr. Sutherland should urge the boy to do more than his strength will admit of .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 19]: He is exceedingly kind to him , but he has evidently never known what weakness is himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 9]: `` True , there is danger of that .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 14]: But you see he has taken him so entirely into his own hands .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 19]: I do n't seem to be allowed a word in the matter of his education any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 10]: Mr. Arnold spoke with the peevishness of weak importance .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 19]: `` I wish you would take care that he does not carry things too far , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 7]: This was just what Euphra wanted .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 27]: `` I think , if you do not disapprove , uncle , I will have Fatima saddled to-morrow morning , and go with them myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 16]: `` Thank you , my love ; I shall be much obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 10]: The glass of claret was soon finished after this .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 21]: A little more conversation about nothing followed , and Euphra rose the second time , and returned to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 5]: She found it unoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 20]: She sat down to the piano , and sang song after song -- Scotch , Italian , and Bohemian .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 8]: But Hugh did not make his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 21]: The fact was , he was busy writing to his mother , whom he had rather neglected since he came .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 28]: Writing to her made him think of David , and he began a letter to him too ; but it was never finished , and never sent .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 10]: He did not return to the drawing-room that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 22]: Indeed , except for a short time , while Mr. Arnold was drinking his claret , he seldom showed himself there .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 10]: Had Euphra repelled him too much -- hurt him ?
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 8]: She would make up for it to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 33]: Breakfast was scarcely over , when the chestnut and the pony passed the window , accompanied by a lovely little Arab mare , broad-chested and light-limbed , with a wonderfully small head .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 12]: She was white as snow , with keen , dark eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 8]: Her curb-rein was red instead of white .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 55]: Hearing their approach , and begging her uncle to excuse her , Euphra rose from the table , and left the room ; but re-appeared in a wonderfully little while , in a well-fitted riding-habit of black velvet , with a belt of dark red leather clasping a waist of the roundest and smallest .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 30]: Her little hat , likewise black , had a single long , white feather , laid horizontally within the upturned brim , and drooping over it at the back .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 23]: Her white mare would be just the right pedestal for the dusky figure -- black eyes , tawny skin , and all .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 47]: As she stood ready to mount , and Hugh was approaching to put her up , she called the groom , seemed just to touch his hand , and was in the saddle in a moment , foot in stirrup , and skirt falling over it .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 21]: Hugh thought she was carrying out the behaviour of yesterday , and was determined to ask her what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 60]: The little Arab began to rear and plunge with pride , as soon as she felt her mistress on her back ; but she seemed as much at home as if she had been on the music-stool , and patted her arching neck , talking to her in the same tone almost in which she had addressed the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 14]: `` Be quiet , Fatty dear ; you 're frightening Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 19]: But Hugh , seeing the next moment that she was in no danger , sprang into his saddle .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 22]: Away they went , Fatima infusing life and frolic into the equine as Euphra into the human portion of the cavalcade .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 82]: Having reached the common , out of sight of the house , Miss Cameron , instead of looking after Harry , lest he should have too much exercise , scampered about like a wild girl , jumping everything that came in her way , and so exciting Harry 's pony , that it was almost more than he could do to manage it , till at last Hugh had to beg her to go more quietly , for Harry 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 31]: She drew up alongside of them at once , and made her mare stand as still as she could , while Harry made his first essay upon a little ditch .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 27]: After crossing it two or three times , he gathered courage ; and setting his pony at a larger one beyond , bounded across it beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 3]: `` Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 3]: Harry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 6]: cried both Euphra and Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 25]: Harry galloped back , and over it again ; then came up to them with a glow of proud confidence on his pale face .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 14]: `` You 'll be a horseman yet , Harry , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 20]: `` I hope so , '' said Harry , in an aspiring tone , which greatly satisfied his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 8]: The boy 's spirit was evidently reviving .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 7]: Euphra must have managed him ill .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 10]: Yet she was not in the least effeminate herself .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 7]: It puzzled Hugh a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 36]: But he did not think about it long ; for Harry cantering away in front , he had an opportunity of saying to Euphra : `` Are you offended with me , Miss Cameron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 5]: `` Offended with you !
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 5]: What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 12]: A girl like me offended with a man like you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 19]: She looked two and twenty as she spoke ; but even at that she was older than Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: He , however , certainly looked considerably older than he really was .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 8]: `` What makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 9]: she added , turning her face towards him .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 14]: `` You would not speak to me when we came home yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 6]: `` Not speak to you ?
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 27]: -- I had a little headache -- and perhaps I was a little sullen , from having been in such bad company all the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 7]: `` What company had you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 10]: asked Hugh , gazing at her in some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 19]: `` My own , '' answered she , with a lovely laugh , thrown full in his face .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 29]: Then after a pause : `` Let me advise you , if you want to live in peace , not to embark on that ocean of discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 4]: `` What ocean ?
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 4]: what discovery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 9]: asked Hugh , bewildered , and still gazing .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 13]: `` The troubled ocean of ladies ' looks , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 38]: `` You will never be able to live in the same house with one of our kind , if it be necessary to your peace to find out what every expression that puzzles you may mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 15]: `` I did not intend to be inquisitive -- it really troubled me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 5]: `` There it is .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 6]: You must never mind us .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 25]: We show so much sooner than men -- but , take warning , there is no making out what it is we do show .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 27]: Your faces are legible ; ours are so scratched and interlined , that you had best give up at once the idea of deciphering them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 19]: Hugh could not help looking once more at the smooth , simple , naïve countenance shining upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 22]: `` There you are at it again , '' she said , blushing a little , and turning her head away .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 34]: `` Well , to comfort you , I will confess I was rather cross yesterday -- because -- because you seemed to have been quite happy with only one of your pupils . ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 24]: As she spoke the words , she gave Fatima the rein , and bounded off , overtaking Harry 's pony in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 14]: Nor did she leave her cousin during all the rest of their ride .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 26]: Most women in whom the soul has anything like a chance of reaching the windows , are more or less beautiful in their best moments .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 11]: Euphra 's best was when she was trying to fascinate .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 6]: Then she was -- fascinating .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 37]: During the first morning that Hugh spent at Arnstead , she had probably been making up her mind whether , between her and Hugh , it was to be war to the knife , or fascination .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 13]: The latter had carried the day , and was now carrying him .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 11]: But had she calculated that fascination may re-act as well ?
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 18]: Hugh 's heart bounded , like her Arab steed , as she uttered the words last recorded .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 96]: He gave his chestnut the rein in his turn , to overtake her ; but Fatima 's canter quickened into a gallop , and , inspirited by her companionship , and the fact that their heads were turned stablewards , Harry 's pony , one of the quickest of its race , laid itself to the ground , and kept up , taking three strides for Fatty 's two , so that Hugh never got within three lengths of them till they drew rein at the hall door , where the grooms were waiting them .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 25]: Euphra was off her mare in a moment , and had almost reached her own room before Hugh and Harry had crossed the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 79]: She came down to luncheon in a white muslin dress , with the smallest possible red spot in it ; and , taking her place at the table , seemed to Hugh to have put off not only her riding habit , but the self that was in it as well ; for she chatted away in the most unconcerned and easy manner possible , as if she had not been out of her room all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 39]: She had ridden so hard , that she had left her last speech in the middle of the common , and its mood with it ; and there seemed now no likelihood of either finding its way home .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 4]: THE PICTURE GALLERY .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 27]: the house is crencled to and fro , And hath so queint waies for to go , For it is shapen as the mase is wrought .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 6]: CHAUCER -- Legend of Ariadne .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 35]: Luncheon over , and Harry dismissed as usual to lie down , Miss Cameron said to Hugh : `` You have never been over the old house yet , I believe , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 9]: Would you not like to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: `` I should indeed , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 21]: `` It is what I have long hoped for , and have often been on the point of begging . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 31]: `` Come , then ; I will be your guide -- if you will trust yourself with a madcap like me , in the solitudes of the old hive . ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 16]: `` Lead on to the family vaults , if you will , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 11]: `` That might be possible , too , from below .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 9]: We are not so very far from them .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 17]: Even within the house there is an old chapel , and some monuments worth looking at .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 7]: Shall we take it last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 10]: `` As you think best , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: She rose and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 25]: When it was answered , `` Jacob , '' she said , `` get me the keys of the house from Mrs. Horton . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 12]: Jacob vanished , and reappeared with a huge bunch of keys .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 4]: She took them .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 13]: They should not be allowed to get quite rusty , Jacob . ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 28]: `` Please , Miss , Mrs. Horton desired me to say , she would have seen to them , if she had known you wanted them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 3]: never mind .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 14]: Just tell my maid to bring me an old pair of gloves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 12]: Jacob went ; and the maid came with the required armour .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 6]: `` Now , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 8]: Jane , you will come with us .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 9]: No , you need not take the keys .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 11]: I will find those I want as we go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 18]: She unlocked a door in the corner of the hall , which Hugh had never seen open .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 35]: Passing through a long low passage , they came to a spiral staircase of stone , up which they went , arriving at another wide hall , very dusty , but in perfect repair .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 17]: Hugh asked if there was not some communication between this hall and the great oak staircase .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' answered Euphra ; `` but this is the more direct way . ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 53]: As she said this , he felt somehow as if she cast on him one of her keenest glances ; but the place was very dusky , and he stood in a spot where the light fell upon him from an opening in a shutter , while she stood in deep shadow .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 8]: `` Jane , open that shutter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 33]: The girl obeyed ; and the entering light revealed the walls covered with paintings , many of them apparently of no value , yet adding much to the effect of the place .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 27]: Seeing that Hugh was at once attracted by the pictures , Euphra said : `` Perhaps you would like to see the picture gallery first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 3]: Hugh assented .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 26]: Euphra chose key after key , and opened door after door , till they came into a long gallery , well lighted from each end .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 6]: The windows were soon opened .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 62]: `` Mr. Arnold is very proud of his pictures , especially of his family portraits ; but he is content with knowing he has them , and never visits them except to show them ; or perhaps once or twice a year , when something or other keeps him at home for a day , without anything particular to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 32]: In glancing over the portraits , some of them by famous masters , Hugh 's eyes were arrested by a blonde beauty in the dress of the time of Charles II .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 41]: There was such a reality of self-willed boldness as well as something worse in her face , that , though arrested by the picture , Hugh felt ashamed of looking at it in the presence of Euphra and her maid .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 19]: The pictured woman almost put him out of countenance , and yet at the same time fascinated him .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 23]: Dragging his eyes from it , he saw that Jane had turned her back upon it , while Euphra regarded it steadily .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 23]: `` Open that opposite window , Jane , '' said she ; `` there is not light enough on this portrait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 3]: Jane obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 24]: While she did so , Hugh caught a glimpse of her face , and saw that the formerly rosy girl was deadly pale .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 15]: He said to Euphra : `` Your maid seems ill , Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 11]: `` Jane , what is the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 17]: She did not reply , but , leaning against the wall , seemed ready to faint .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 11]: `` The place is close , '' said her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 22]: `` Go into the next room there , '' -- she pointed to a door -- `` and open the window .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 7]: You will soon be well . ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 14]: `` If you please , Miss , I would rather stay with you .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 9]: This place makes me feel that strange . ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 15]: She had come but lately , and had never been over the house before .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 9]: said Miss Cameron , looking at her sharply .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 32]: `` Please , do n't be angry , Miss ; but the first night e'er I slept here , I saw that very lady -- '' `` Saw that lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 35]: `` Well , Miss , I mean , I dreamed that I saw her ; and I remembered her the minute I see her up there ; and she give me a turn like .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 29]: I 'm all right now , Miss. '' Euphra fixed her eyes on her , and kept them fixed , till she was very nearly all wrong again .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 15]: She turned as pale as before , and began to draw her breath hard .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 6]: `` You silly goose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 18]: said Euphra , and withdrew her eyes ; upon which the girl began to breathe more freely .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 64]: Hugh was making some wise remarks in his own mind on the unsteady condition of a nature in which the imagination predominates over the powers of reflection , when Euphra turned to him , and began to tell him that that was the picture of her three or four times great-grandmother , painted by Sir Peter Lely , just after she was married .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 7]: `` Is n't she fair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 12]: -- `` She turned nun at last , they say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 12]: `` She is more fair than honest , '' thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 17]: `` It would take a great deal of nun to make her into a saint . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 13]: But he only said , `` She is more beautiful than lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 6]: What was her name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 23]: `` If you mean her maiden name , it was Halkar -- Lady Euphrasia Halkar -- named after me , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 31]: She had foreign blood in her , of course ; and , to tell the truth , there were strange stories told of her , of more sorts than one .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 7]: I know nothing of her family .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 17]: It was never heard of in England , I believe , till after the Restoration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 31]: All the time Euphra was speaking , Hugh was being perplexed with that most annoying of perplexities -- the flitting phantom of a resemblance , which he could not catch .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 13]: He was forced to dismiss it for the present , utterly baffled .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 12]: `` Were you really named after her , Miss Cameron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: It is a family name with us .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 25]: But , indeed , I may be said to be named after her , for she was the first of us who bore it .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 10]: You do n't seem to like the portrait . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 19]: `` I do not ; but I can not help looking at it , for all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 27]: `` I am so used to the lady 's face , '' said Euphra , `` that it makes no impression on me of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 49]: But it is said , '' she added , glancing at the maid , who stood at some distance , looking uneasily about her -- and as she spoke she lowered her voice to a whisper -- `` it is said , she can not lie still . ''
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 6]: `` Can not lie still !
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 15]: `` I mean down there in the chapel , '' she answered , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 7]: The Celtic nerves of Hugh shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 79]: Euphra laughed ; and her voice echoed in silvery billows , that broke on the faces of the men and women of old time , that had owned the whole ; whose lives had flowed and ebbed in varied tides through the ancient house ; who had married and been given in marriage ; and gone down to the chapel below -- below the prayers and below the psalms -- and made a Sunday of all the week .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 24]: Ashamed of his feeling of passing dismay , Hugh said , just to say something : `` What a strange ornament that is !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 8]: Is it a brooch or a pin ?
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 21]: No , I declare it is a ring -- large enough for three cardinals , and worn on her thumb .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 6]: It seems almost to sparkle .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 11]: Is it ruby , or carbuncle , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 17]: `` I do n't know : some clumsy old thing , '' answered Euphra , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 15]: I see , '' said Hugh ; `` it is not a red stone .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 12]: The glow is only a reflection from part of her dress .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: It is as clear as a diamond .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 9]: But that is impossible -- such a size .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 24]: There seems to me something curious about it ; and the longer I look at it , the more strange it appears . ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: Euphra stole another of her piercing glances at him , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 25]: `` Surely , '' Hugh went on , `` a ring like that would hardly be likely to be lost out of the family ?
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 8]: Your uncle must have it somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 13]: Euphra laughed ; but this laugh was very different from the last .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 6]: It rattled rather than rang .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 21]: `` You are wonderfully taken with a bauble -- for a man of letters , that is , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 23]: The stone may have been carried down any one of the hundred streams into which a family river is always dividing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 24]: `` It is a very remarkable ornament for a lady 's finger , notwithstanding , '' said Hugh , smiling in his turn .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 51]: `` But we shall never get through the pictures at this rate , '' remarked Euphra ; and going on , she directed Hugh 's attention now to this , now to that portrait , saying who each was , and mentioning anything remarkable in the history of their originals .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 20]: She manifested a thorough acquaintance with the family story , and made , in fact , an excellent show-woman .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 59]: Having gone nearly to the other end of the gallery , `` This door , '' said she , stopping at one , and turning over the keys , `` leads to one of the oldest portions of the house , the principal room in which is said to have belonged especially to the lady over there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 15]: As she said this , she fixed her eyes once more on the maid .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 11]: do n't ye now , Miss , '' interrupted Jane .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 30]: `` Hannah do say as how a whitey-blue light shines in the window of a dark night , sometimes -- that lady 's window , you know , Miss. .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 25]: Do n't ye open the door -- pray , Miss. '' Jane seemed on the point of falling into the same terror as before .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 30]: `` Really , Jane , '' said her mistress , `` I am ashamed of you ; and of myself , for having such silly servants about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 43]: `` I beg your pardon , Miss , but -- '' `` So Mr. Sutherland and I must give up our plan of going over the house , because my maid 's nerves are too delicate to permit her to accompany us .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 4]: For shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 11]: `` Oh , do ye now go without me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 8]: cried the girl , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 12]: `` And you will wait here till we come back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 7]: do n't ye leave me here .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 8]: Just show me the way out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 9]: And once more she turned pale as death .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 23]: `` Mr. Sutherland , I am very sorry , but we must put off the rest of our ramble till another time .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 14]: I am , like Hamlet , very vilely attended , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 15]: Come , then , you foolish girl , '' she added , more mildly .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 26]: The poor maid , what with terror of Lady Euphrasia , and respect for her mistress , was in a pitiable condition of moral helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 10]: She seemed almost too frightened to walk behind them .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 35]: But if she had been in front it would have been no better ; for , like other ghost-fearers , she seemed to feel very painfully that she had no eyes in her back .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 20]: They returned as they came ; and Jane receiving the keys to take to the housekeeper , darted away .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 16]: When she reached Mrs. Horton 's room , she sank on a chair in hysterics .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 36]: `` I must get rid of that girl , I fear , '' said Miss Cameron , leading the way to the library ; `` she will infect the whole household with her foolish terrors .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 14]: We shall not hear the last of this for some time to come .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 29]: We had a fit of it the same year I came ; and I suppose the time has come round for another attack of the same epidemic . ''
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 14]: `` What is there about the room to terrify the poor thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 10]: they say it is haunted ; that is all .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 23]: Was there ever an old house anywhere over Europe , especially an old family house , but was said to be haunted ?
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 24]: Here the story centres in that room -- or at least in that room and the avenue in front of its windows . ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 12]: `` Is that the avenue called the Ghost 's Walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 5]: Who told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 10]: `` Harry would not let me cross it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 4]: `` Poor boy !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 6]: This is really too bad .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 13]: He can not stand anything of that kind , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 4]: Those servants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 15]: I hope we shall soon get him too well to be frightened at anything .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 13]: Are these places said to be haunted by any particular ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 7]: By Lady Euphrasia -- Rubbish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 40]: Had Hugh possessed a yet keener perception of resemblance , he would have seen that the phantom-likeness which haunted him in the portrait of Euphrasia Halkar , was that of Euphrasia Cameron -- by his side all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 28]: But the mere difference of complexion was sufficient to throw him out -- insignificant difference as that is , beside the correspondence of features and their relations .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 19]: Euphra herself was perfectly aware of the likeness , but had no wish that Hugh should discover it .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 46]: As if the likeness , however , had been dimly identified by the unconscious part of his being , he sat in one corner of the library sofa , with his eyes fixed on the face of Euphra , as she sat in the other .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 25]: Presently he was made aware of his unintentional rudeness , by seeing her turn pale as death , and sink back in the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 20]: In a moment she started up , and began pacing about the room , rubbing her eyes and temples .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 6]: He was bewildered and alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 9]: `` Miss Cameron , are you ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 19]: She gave a kind of half-hysterical laugh , and said : `` No -- nothing worth speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 10]: I felt a little faint , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 6]: I am better now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 30]: She turned full towards him , and seemed to try to look all right ; but there was a kind of film over the clearness of her black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 8]: `` I fear you have headache . ''
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 9]: `` A little , but it is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 8]: I will go and lie down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 18]: `` Do , pray ; else you will not be well enough to appear at dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 8]: She retired , and Hugh joined Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 24]: Euphra had another glass of claret with her uncle that evening , in order to give her report of the morning 's ride .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 14]: `` Really , there is not much to be afraid of , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 8]: He takes very good care of Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 43]: To be sure , I had occasion several times to check him a little ; but he has this good quality in addition to a considerable aptitude for teaching , that he perceives a hint , and takes it at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 24]: Knowing her uncle 's formality , and preference for precise and judicial modes of expression , Euphra modelled her phrase to his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 27]: `` I am glad he has your good opinion so far , Euphra ; for I confess there is something about the youth that pleases me .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 34]: I was afraid at first that I might be annoyed by his overstepping the true boundaries of his position in my family : he seems to have been in good society , too .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 15]: But your assurance that he can take a hint , lessens my apprehension considerably .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 14]: To-morrow , I will ask him to resume his seat after dessert . ''
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 14]: This was not exactly the object of Euphra 's qualified commendation of Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 8]: But she could not help it now .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 30]: `` I think , however , if you approve , uncle , that it will be more prudent to keep a little watch over the riding for a while .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 34]: I confess , too , I should be glad of a little more of that exercise than I have had for some time : I found my seat not very secure to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 11]: `` Very desirable on both considerations , my love . ''
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 6]: And so the conference ended .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 2]: NEST-BUILDING .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 49]: If you will have a tree bear more fruit than it hath used to do , it is not anything you can do to the boughs , but it is the stirring of the earth , and putting new mould about the roots , that must work it .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 10]: LORD BACON 'S Advancement of Learning , b. ii .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 38]: In a short time Harry 's health was so much improved , and consequently the strength and activity of his mind so much increased , that Hugh began to give him more exact mental operations to perform .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 56]: But as if he had been a reader of Lord Bacon , which as yet he was not , and had learned from him that `` wonder is the seed of knowledge , '' he came , by a kind of sympathetic instinct , to the same conclusion practically , in the case of Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 19]: He tried to wake a question in him , by showing him something that would rouse his interest .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 14]: The reply to this question might be the whole rudiments of a science .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 10]: Things themselves should lead to the science of them .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 18]: If things are not interesting in themselves , how can any amount of knowledge about them be ?
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 68]: To be sure , there is such a thing as a purely or abstractly intellectual interest -- the pleasure of the mere operation of the intellect upon the signs of things ; but this must spring from a highly exercised intellectual condition , and is not to be expected before the pleasures of intellectual motion have been experienced through the employment of its means for other ends .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 15]: Whether this is a higher condition or not , is open to much disquisition .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 34]: One day Hugh was purposely engaged in taking the altitude of the highest turret of the house , with an old quadrant he had found in the library , when Harry came up .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 10]: `` What are you doing , big brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 31]: said he ; for now that he was quite at home with Hugh , there was a wonderful mixture of familiarity and respect in him , that was quite bewitching .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 16]: `` Finding out how high your house is , little brother , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 10]: `` How can you do it with that thing ?
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 13]: Will it measure the height of other things besides the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 15]: `` Yes , the height of a mountain , or anything you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 7]: `` Do show me how . ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 11]: Hugh showed him as much of it as he could .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 9]: `` But I do n't understand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 6]: that is quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 18]: To do that , you must learn a great many things -- Euclid to begin with . ''
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 32]: That very afternoon Harry began Euclid , and soon found quite enough of interest on the road to the quadrant , to prevent him from feeling any tediousness in its length .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 12]: Of an afternoon Hugh had taken to reading Shakspere to Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: Euphra was always a listener .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 25]: On one occasion Harry said : `` I am so sorry , Mr. Sutherland , but I do n't understand the half of it .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 36]: Sometimes when Euphra and you are laughing , -- and sometimes when Euphra is crying , '' added he , looking at her slyly , `` I ca n't understand what it is all about .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 10]: Am I so very stupid , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 6]: And he almost cried himself .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 24]: `` Not a bit of it , Harry , my boy ; only you must learn a great many other things first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 7]: `` How can I learn them ?
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 7]: I am willing to learn anything .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: I do n't find it tire me now as it used . ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 23]: `` There are many things necessary to understand Shakspere that I can not teach you , and that some people never learn .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 8]: Most of them will come of themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 31]: But of one thing you may be sure , Harry , that if you learn anything , whatever it be , you are so far nearer to understanding Shakspere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 28]: The same afternoon , when Harry had waked from his siesta , upon which Hugh still insisted , they went out for a walk in the fields .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 15]: The sun was half way down the sky , but very hot and sultry .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 18]: `` I wish we had our cave of straw to creep into now , '' said Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 39]: `` I felt exactly like the little field-mouse you read to me about in Burns 's poems , when we went in that morning , and found it all torn up , and half of it carried away .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 35]: We have no place to go to now for a peculiar own place ; and the consequence is , you have not told me any stories about the Romans for a whole week . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 14]: `` Well , Harry , is there any way of making another ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 37]: `` There 's no more straw lying about that I know of , '' answered Harry ; `` and it wo n't do to pull the inside out of a rick , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 47]: `` But do n't you think it would be pleasant to have a change now ; and as we have lived underground , or say in the snow like the North people , try living in the air , like some of the South people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 4]: `` Delightful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 3]: cried Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 6]: -- `` A balloon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 7]: `` No , not quite that .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 10]: Do n't you think a nest would do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 7]: `` Up in a tree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 16]: Harry darted off for a run , as the only means of expressing his delight .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 18]: When he came back , he said : `` When shall we begin , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 24]: `` We will go and look for a place at once ; but I am not quite sure when we shall begin yet .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 9]: I shall find out to-night , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 21]: They left the fields , and went into the woods in the neighbourhood of the house , at the back .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 18]: Here the trees had grown to a great size , some of them being very old indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 70]: They soon fixed upon a grotesque old oak as a proper tree in which to build their nest ; and Harry , who , as well as Hugh , had a good deal of constructiveness in his nature , was so delighted , that the heat seemed to have no more influence upon him ; and Hugh , fearful of the reaction , was compelled to restrain his gambols .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 46]: Pursuing their way through the dark warp of the wood , with its golden weft of crossing sunbeams , Hugh began to tell Harry the story of the killing of Cæsar by Brutus and the rest , filling up the account with portions from Shakspere .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 16]: Fortunately , he was able to give the orations of Brutus and Antony in full .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 12]: Harry was in ecstasy over the eloquence of the two men .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 14]: `` Well , what language do you think they spoke , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 30]: `` Why , '' said Harry , hesitating , `` I suppose -- '' then , as if a sudden light broke upon him -- `` Latin of course .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 4]: How strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 5]: `` Why strange ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 14]: `` That such men should talk such a dry , unpleasant language . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 24]: `` I allow it is a difficult language , Harry ; and very ponderous and mechanical ; but not necessarily dry or unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 40]: The Romans , you know , were particularly fond of law in everything ; and so they made a great many laws for their language ; or rather , it grew so , because they were of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 25]: It was like their swords and armour generally , not very graceful , but very strong ; -- like their architecture too , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 14]: Nobody can ever understand what a people is , without knowing its language .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 30]: It is not only that we find all these stories about them in their language , but the language itself is more like them than anything else can be .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 16]: Besides , Harry , I do n't believe you know anything about Latin yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 10]: `` I know all the declensions and conjugations . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 20]: `` But do n't you think it must have been a very different thing to hear it spoken ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 12]: `` Yes , to be sure -- and by such men .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 9]: But how ever could they speak it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 10]: `` They spoke it just as you do English .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 7]: It was as natural to them .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 37]: But you can not say you know anything about it , till you read what they wrote in it ; till your ears delight in the sound of their poetry ; -- '' `` Poetry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 17]: `` Yes ; and beautiful letters ; and wise lessons ; and histories and plays . ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 8]: I should like you to teach me .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 14]: Will it be as hard to learn always as it is now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 9]: I am sure you will like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 8]: `` When will you begin me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 3]: `` To-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 21]: And if you get on pretty well , we will begin our nest , too , in the afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 8]: `` Oh , how kind you are !
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 7]: I will try very hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 10]: `` I am sure you will , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 76]: Next morning , accordingly , Hugh did begin him , after a fashion of his own ; namely , by giving him a short simple story to read , finding out all the words with him in the dictionary , and telling him what the terminations of the words signified ; for he found that he had already forgotten a very great deal of what , according to Euphra , he had been thoroughly taught .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 11]: No one can remember what is entirely uninteresting to him .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 51]: Hugh was as precise about the grammar of a language as any Scotch Professor of Humanity , old Prosody not excepted ; but he thought it time enough to begin to that , when some interest in the words themselves should have been awakened in the mind of his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 78]: He hated slovenliness as much as any one ; but the question was , how best to arrive at thoroughness in the end , without losing the higher objects of study ; and not how , at all risks , to commence teaching the lesson of thoroughness at once , and so waste on the shape of a pin-head the intellect which , properly directed , might arrive at the far more minute accuracies of a steam-engine .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 56]: The fault of Euphra in teaching Harry , had been that , with a certain kind of tyrannical accuracy , she had determined to have the thing done -- not merely decently and in order , but prudishly and pedantically ; so that she deprived progress of the pleasure which ought naturally to attend it .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 35]: She spoiled the walk to the distant outlook , by stopping at every step , not merely to pick flowers , but to botanise on the weeds , and to calculate the distance advanced .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 48]: It is quite true that we ought to learn to do things irrespective of the reward ; but plenty of opportunities will be given in the progress of life , and in much higher kinds of action , to exercise our sense of duty in severe loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 55]: We have no right to turn intellectual exercises into pure operations of conscience : these ought to involve essential duty ; although no doubt there is plenty of room for mingling duty with those ; while , on the other hand , the highest act of suffering self-denial is not without its accompanying reward .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 27]: Neither is there any exercise of the higher intellectual powers in learning the mere grammar of a language , necessary as it is for a means .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 24]: And language having been made before grammar , a language must be in some measure understood , before its grammar can become intelligible .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 19]: Harry 's weak -LRB- though true and keen -RRB- life could not force its way into any channel .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 9]: His was a nature essentially dependent on sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 33]: It could flow into truth through another loving mind : left to itself , it could not find the way , and sank in the dry sand of ennui and self-imposed obligations .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 32]: Euphra was utterly incapable of understanding him ; and the boy had been dying for lack of sympathy , though neither he nor any one about him had suspected the fact .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 12]: There was a strange disproportion between his knowledge and his capacity .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 58]: He was able , when his attention was directed , his gaze fixed , and his whole nature supported by Hugh , to see deep into many things , and his remarks were often strikingly original ; but he was one of the most ignorant boys , for his years , that Hugh had ever come across .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 41]: A long and severe illness , when he was just passing into boyhood , had thrown him back far into his childhood ; and he was only now beginning to show that he had anything of the boy-life in him .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 14]: Hence arose that unequal development which has been sufficiently evident in the story .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 21]: In the afternoon , they went to the wood , and found the tree they had chosen for their nest .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 30]: To Harry 's intense admiration , Hugh , as he said , went up the tree like a squirrel , only he was too big for a bear even .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 27]: Just one layer of foliage above the lowest branches , he came to a place where he thought there was a suitable foundation for the nest .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 67]: From the ground Harry could scarcely see him , as , with an axe which he had borrowed for the purpose -LRB- for there was a carpenter 's work-shop on the premises -RRB- , he cut away several small branches from three of the principal ones ; and so had these three as rafters , ready dressed and placed , for the foundation of the nest .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 32]: Having made some measurements , he descended ; and repairing with Harry to the work-shop , procured some boarding and some tools , which Harry assisted in carrying to the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 57]: Ascending again , and drawing up his materials , by the help of Harry , with a piece of string , Hugh in a very little while had a level floor , four feet square , in the heart of the oak tree , quite invisible from below -- buried in a cloud of green leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 18]: For greater safety , he fastened ropes as handrails all around it from one branch to another .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 23]: And now nothing remained but to construct a bench to sit on , and such a stair as Harry could easily climb .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 30]: The boy was quite restless with anxiety to get up and see the nest ; and kept calling out constantly to know if he might not come up yet .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 24]: At length Hugh allowed him to try ; but the poor boy was not half strong enough to climb the tree without help .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 17]: So Hugh descended , and with his aid Harry was soon standing on the new-built platform .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 23]: `` I feel just like an eagle , '' he cried ; but here his voice faltered , and he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 4]: said his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 26]: `` Oh , nothing , '' replied he ; `` only I did n't exactly know whereabouts we were till I got up here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 8]: `` Whereabouts are we , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 12]: `` Close to the end of the Ghost 's Walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 14]: `` But you do n't mind that now , surely , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 16]: `` No , sir ; that is , not so much as I used . ''
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 17]: `` Shall I take all this down again , and build our nest somewhere else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 13]: `` Oh , no , if you do n't think it matters .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 17]: It would be a great pity , after you have taken so much trouble with it .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 31]: Besides , I shall never be here without you ; and I do not think I should be afraid of the ghost herself , if you were with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 13]: Yet Harry shuddered involuntarily at the thought of his own daring speech .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 15]: `` Very well , Harry , my boy ; we will finish it here .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 27]: Now , if you stand there , I will fasten a plank across here between these two stumps -- no , that wo n't do exactly .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 32]: I must put a piece on to this one , to raise it to a level with the other -- then we shall have a seat in a few minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 38]: Hammer and nails were busy again ; and in a few minutes they sat down to enjoy the `` soft pipling cold '' which swung all the leaves about like little trap-doors that opened into the Infinite .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 5]: Harry was highly contented .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 78]: He drew a deep breath of satisfaction as , looking above and beneath and all about him , he saw that they were folded in an almost impenetrable net of foliage , through which nothing could steal into their sanctuary , save `` the chartered libertine , the air , '' and a few stray beams of the setting sun , filtering through the multitudinous leaves , from which they caught a green tint as they passed .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 35]: `` Fancy yourself a fish , '' said Hugh , `` in the depth of a cavern of sea weed , which floats about in the slow swinging motion of the heavy waters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 7]: `` What a funny notion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 54]: `` Not so absurd as you may think , Harry ; for just as some fishes crawl about on the bottom of the sea , so do we men at the bottom of an ocean of air ; which , if it be a thinner one , is certainly a deeper one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 14]: `` Then the birds are the swimming fishes , are they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 8]: `` Yes , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 12]: `` And you and I are two mermen -- doing what ?
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 10]: Waiting for mother mermaid to give us our dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 5]: I am getting hungry .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 19]: But it will be a long time before a mermaid gets up here , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 39]: `` That reminds me , '' said Hugh , `` that I must build a stair for you , Master Harry ; for you are not merman enough to get up with a stroke of your scaly tail .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 4]: So here goes .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 10]: You can sit there till I fetch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 50]: Nailing a little rude bracket here and there on the stem of the tree , just where Harry could avail himself of hand-hold as well , Hugh had soon finished a strangely irregular staircase , which it took Harry two or three times trying , to learn quite off .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 3]: GEOGRAPHY POINT .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 43]: I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the farthest inch of Asia ; bring you the length of Prester John 's foot ; fetch you a hair off the great Cham 's beard ; do you any embassage to the Pigmies .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 5]: Much Ado about Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 30]: The next day , after dinner , Mr. Arnold said to the tutor : `` Well , Mr. Sutherland , how does Harry get on with his geography ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 13]: Mr. Arnold , be it understood , had a weakness for geography .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 14]: `` We have not done anything at that yet , Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 7]: `` Not done anything at geography !
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 8]: And the boy getting quite robust now !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 7]: I am astonished , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 19]: Why , when he was a mere child , he could repeat all the counties of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 20]: `` Perhaps that may be the reason for the decided distaste he shows for it now , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 16]: But I will begin to teach him at once , if you desire it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 9]: `` I do desire it , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 13]: A thorough geographical knowledge is essential to the education of a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 24]: Ask me any question you please , Mr. Sutherland , on the map of the world , or any of its divisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 13]: Hugh asked a few questions , which Mr. Arnold answered at once .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 3]: pooh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 11]: said he , `` this is mere child 's play .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 10]: Let me ask you some , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 19]: His very first question posed Hugh , whose knowledge in this science was not by any means minute .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 26]: `` I fear I am no gentleman , '' said he , laughing ; `` but I can at least learn as well as teach .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 6]: We shall begin to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 7]: `` What books have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 10]: no books , if you please , just yet .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 22]: If you are satisfied with Harry 's progress so far , let me have my own way in this too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 11]: `` But geography does not seem your strong point . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 24]: `` No ; but I may be able to teach it all the better from feeling the difficulties of a learner myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 11]: `` Well , you shall have a fair trial . ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 20]: Next morning Hugh and Harry went out for a walk to the top of a hill in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 28]: When they reached it , Hugh took a small compass from his pocket , and set it on the ground , contemplating it and the horizon alternately .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 10]: `` What are you doing , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 20]: `` I am trying to find the exact line that would go through my home , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 12]: `` Is that funny little thing able to tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 9]: `` Yes ; this along with other things .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 43]: Is n't it curious , Harry , to have in my pocket a little thing with a kind of spirit in it , that understands the spirit that is in the big world , and always points to its North Pole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 7]: `` Explain it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 15]: `` It is nearly as much a mystery to me as to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 8]: `` Where is the North Pole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 11]: `` Look , the little thing points to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 8]: `` But I will turn it away .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 5]: it wo n't go .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 12]: It goes back and back , do what I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 15]: `` Yes , it will , if you turn it away all day long .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 30]: Look , Harry , if you were to go straight on in this direction , you would come to a Laplander , harnessing his broad-horned reindeer to his sledge .
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 9]: He 's at it now , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 28]: If you were to go in this line exactly , you would go through the smoke and fire of a burning mountain in a land of ice .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 41]: If you were to go this way , straight on , you would find yourself in the middle of a forest with a lion glaring at your feet , for it is dark night there now , and so hot !
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 14]: And over there , straight on , there is such a lovely sunset .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 20]: The top of a snowy mountain is all pink with light , though the sun is down -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 8]: such colours all about , like fairyland !
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 25]: And there , there is a desert of sand , and a camel dying , and all his companions just disappearing on the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 39]: And there , there is an awful sea , without a boat to be seen on it , dark and dismal , with huge rocks all about it , and waste borders of sand -- so dreadful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 11]: `` How do you know all this , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 17]: You have never walked along those lines , I know , for you could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 7]: `` Geography has taught me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 7]: `` No , Mr. Sutherland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 5]: said Harry , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 21]: `` Well , shall we travel along this line , just across that crown of trees on the hill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 8]: `` Yes , do let us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 31]: `` Then , '' said Hugh , drawing a telescope from his pocket , `` this hill is henceforth Geography Point , and all the world lies round about it .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 14]: Do you know we are in the very middle of the earth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 7]: `` Are we , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 20]: Do n't you know any point you like to choose on a ball is the middle of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 6]: yes -- of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 12]: What lies at the bottom of the hill down there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 8]: `` Arnstead , to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 7]: `` And what beyond there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 6]: `` Look through here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 18]: that must be the village we rode to yesterday -- I forget the name of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 27]: Hugh told him the name ; and then made him look with the telescope all along the receding line to the trees on the opposite hill .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 21]: Just as he caught them , a voice beside them said : `` What are you about , Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 14]: Hugh felt a glow of pleasure as the voice fell on his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 5]: It was Euphra 's .
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 14]: replied Harry , `` Mr. Sutherland is teaching me geography with a telescope .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 6]: It 's such fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 14]: `` He 's a wonderful tutor , that of yours , Harry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 8]: `` Yes , is n't he just ?
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 19]: But , '' Harry went on , turning to Hugh , `` what are we to do now ?
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 10]: We ca n't get farther for that hill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 17]: we must apply to your papa now , to lend us some of his beautiful maps .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 10]: They will teach us what lies beyond that hill .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 56]: And then we can read in some of his books about the places ; and so go on and on , till we reach the beautiful , wide , restless sea ; over which we must sail in spite of wind and tide -- straight on and on , till we come to land again .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 39]: But we must make a great many such journeys before we really know what sort of a place we are living in ; and we shall have ever so many things to learn that will surprise us . ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 6]: it will be nice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 3]: cried Harry .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 20]: After a little more geographical talk , they put up their instruments , and began to descend the hill .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 20]: Harry was in no need of Hugh 's back now , but Euphra was in need of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 9]: In fact , she appealed for its support .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 6]: `` How awkward of me !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 9]: I am stumbling over the heather shamefully ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 19]: She was , in fact , stumbling over her own dress , which she would not hold up .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 21]: Hugh offered his hand ; and her small one seemed quite content to be swallowed up in his large one .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 14]: `` Why do you never let me put you on your horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 11]: `` You always manage to prevent me somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 14]: The last time , I just turned my head , and , behold !
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 11]: when I looked , you were gathering your reins . ''
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 20]: `` It is only a trick of independence , Hugh -- Mr. Sutherland -- I beg your pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 26]: I can make no excuse for Euphra , for she had positively never heard him called Hugh : there was no one to do so .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 31]: But , the slip had not , therefore , the less effect ; for it sounded as if she had been saying his name over and over again to herself .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 30]: `` I beg your pardon , '' repeated Euphra , hastily ; for , as Hugh did not reply , she feared her arrow had swerved from its mark .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 17]: `` For a sweet fault , Euphra -- I beg your pardon -- Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 18]: `` You punish me with forgiveness , '' returned she , with one of her sweetest looks .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 9]: Hugh could not help pressing the little hand .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 5]: Was the pressure returned ?
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 34]: So slight , so airy was the touch , that it might have been only the throb of his own pulses , all consciously vital about the wonderful woman-hand that rested in his .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 20]: If he had claimed it , she might easily have denied it , so ethereal and uncertain was it .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 6]: Yet he believed in it .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 12]: He never dreamed that she was exercising her skill upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 11]: What could be her object in bewitching a poor tutor ?
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 3]: what indeed ?
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 56]: Meantime this much is certain , that she was drawing Hugh closer and closer to her side ; that a soothing dream of delight had begun to steal over his spirit , soon to make it toss in feverous unrest -- as the first effects of some poisons are like a dawn of tenfold strength .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 71]: The mountain wind blew from her to him , sometimes sweeping her garments about him , and bathing him in their faint sweet odours -- odours which somehow seemed to belong to her whom they had only last visited ; sometimes , so kindly strong did it blow , compelling her , or at least giving her excuse enough , to leave his hand and cling closely to his arm .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 19]: A fresh spring began to burst from the very bosom of what had seemed before a perfect summer .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 5]: A spring to summer !
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 7]: What would the following summer be ?
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 5]: and what the autumn ?
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 5]: And what the winter ?
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 16]: For if the summer be tenfold summer , then must the winter be tenfold winter .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 14]: But though knowledge is good for man , foreknowledge is not so good .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 35]: And , though Love be good , a tempest of it in the brain will not ripen the fruits like a soft steady wind , or waft the ships home to their desired haven .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 23]: Perhaps , what enslaved Hugh most , was the feeling that the damsel stooped to him , without knowing that she stooped .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 10]: She seemed to him in every way above him .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 95]: She knew so many things of which he was ignorant ; could say such lovely things ; could , he did not doubt , write lovely verses ; could sing like an angel ; -LRB- though Scotch songs are not of essentially angelic strain , nor Italian songs either , in general ; and they were all that she could do -RRB- ; was mistress of a great rich wonderful house , with a history ; and , more than all , was , or appeared to him to be -- a beautiful woman .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 73]: It was true that his family was as good as hers ; but he had disowned his family -- so his pride declared ; and the same pride made him despise his present position , and look upon a tutor 's employment as -- as -- well , as other people look upon it ; as a rather contemptible one in fact , especially for a young , powerful , six-foot fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 26]: The influence of Euphrasia was not of the best upon him from the first ; for it had greatly increased this feeling about his occupation .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 18]: It could not affect his feelings towards Harry ; so the boy did not suffer as yet .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 43]: But it set him upon a very unprofitable kind of castle-building : he would be a soldier like his father ; he would leave Arnstead , to revisit it with a sword by his side , and a Sir before his name .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 16]: Sir Hugh Sutherland would be somebody even in the eyes of the master of Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 32]: Yes , a six-foot fellow , though he may be sensible in the main , is not , therefore , free from small vanities , especially if he be in love .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 5]: But how leave Euphra ?
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 6]: Again I outrun my story .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 4]: CHAPTER X. ITALIAN .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 8]: Per me si va nella città dolente .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 11]: DANTE Through me thou goest into the city of grief .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 41]: Of necessity , with so many shafts opened into the mountain of knowledge , a far greater amount of time must be devoted by Harry and his tutor to the working of the mine , than they had given hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 65]: This made a considerable alteration in the intercourse of the youth and the lady ; for , although Euphra was often present during school-hours , it must be said for Hugh that , during those hours , he paid almost all his attention to Harry ; so much of it , indeed , that perhaps there was not enough left to please the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 7]: But she did not say so .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 20]: She sat beside them in silence , occupied with her work , and saving up her glances for use .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 36]: Now and then she would read ; taking an opportunity sometimes , but not often , when a fitting pause occurred , to ask him to explain some passage about which she was in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 50]: It must be conceded that such passages were well chosen for the purpose ; for she was too wise to do her own intellect discredit by feigning a difficulty where she saw none ; intellect being the only gift in others for which she was conscious of any reverence .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 11]: By-and-by she began to discontinue these visits to the schoolroom .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 6]: Perhaps she found them dull .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 7]: Perhaps -- but we shall see .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 62]: One morning , in the course of their study -- Euphra not present -- Hugh had occasion to go from his own room , where , for the most part , they carried on the severer portion of their labours , down to the library for a book , to enlighten them upon some point on which they were in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 14]: As he was passing an open door , Euphra 's voice called him .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 11]: He entered , and found himself in her private sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 9]: He had not known before where it was .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 23]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Sutherland , for calling you , but I am at this moment in a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 10]: I can not manage this line in the Inferno .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 5]: Do help me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 22]: She moved the book towards him , as he now stood by her side , she remaining seated at her table .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 16]: To his mortification , he was compelled to confess his utter ignorance of the language .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 8]: I am disappointed , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 12]: `` Not so much as I am , '' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 15]: `` But could you spare me one or two of your Italian books ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 15]: `` With pleasure , '' she answered , rising and going to her bookshelves .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 16]: `` I want only a grammar , a dictionary , and a New Testament . ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 23]: `` There they are , '' she said , taking them down one after the other , and bringing them to him .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 14]: `` I daresay you will soon get up with poor stupid me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 25]: `` I shall do my best to get within hearing of your voice , at least , in which Italian must be lovely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 11]: No reply , but a sudden droop of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 40]: `` But , '' continued Hugh , `` upon second thoughts , lest I should be compelled to remain dumb , or else annoy your delicate ear with discordant sounds , just give me one lesson in the pronunciation .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 10]: Let me hear you read a little first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 7]: `` With all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 15]: Euphra began , and read delightfully ; for she was an excellent Italian scholar .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 11]: It was necessary that Hugh should look over the book .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 20]: This was difficult while he remained standing , as she did not offer to lift it from the table .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 18]: Gradually , therefore , and hardly knowing how , he settled into a chair by her side .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 32]: Half-an-hour went by like a minute , as he listened to the silvery tones of her voice , breaking into a bell-like sound upon the double consonants of that sweet lady-tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 19]: Then it was his turn to read and be corrected , and read again and be again corrected .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 9]: Another half-hour glided away , and yet another .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 58]: But it must be confessed he made good use of the time -- if only it had been his own to use ; for at the end of it he could pronounce Italian very tolerably -- well enough , at least , to keep him from fixing errors in his pronunciation , while studying the language alone .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 14]: Suddenly he came to himself , and looked up as from a dream .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 6]: Had she been bewitching him ?
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 11]: He was in Euphra 's room -- alone with her .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 10]: And the door was shut -- how or when ?
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 28]: And -- he looked at his watch -- poor little Harry had been waiting his return from the library , for the last hour and a half .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 4]: He was conscience-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 35]: He gathered up the books hastily , thanked Euphra in the same hurried manner , and left the room with considerable disquietude , closing the door very gently , almost guiltily , behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 15]: I am afraid Euphra had been perfectly aware that he knew nothing about Italian .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 19]: Did she see her own eyes shine in the mirror before her , as he closed the door ?
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 9]: Was she in love with him , then ?
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 40]: When Hugh returned with the Italian books , instead of the encyclopædia he had gone to seek , he found Harry sitting where he had left him , with his arms and head on the table , fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 5]: `` Poor boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 16]: said Hugh to himself ; but he could not help feeling glad he was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 38]: He stole out of the room again , passed the fatal door with a longing pain , found the volume of his quest in the library , and , returning with it , sat down beside Harry .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 7]: There he sat till he awoke .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 14]: When he did awake at last , it was almost time for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 22]: The shame-faced boy was exceedingly penitent for what was no fault , while Hugh could not relieve him by confessing his .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 14]: He could only say : `` It was my fault , Harry dear .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 6]: I stayed away too long .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 12]: You were so nicely asleep , I would not wake you .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 12]: You will not need a siesta , that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 17]: He was ashamed of himself , as he uttered the false words to the true-hearted child .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 5]: But this , alas !
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 8]: was not the end of it all .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 22]: Desirous of learning the language , but far more desirous of commending himself to Euphra , Hugh began in downright earnest .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 16]: That very evening , he felt that he had a little hold of the language .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 8]: Harry was left to his own resources .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 24]: Nor was there any harm in this in itself : Hugh had a right to part of every day for his own uses .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 33]: But then , he had been with Harry almost every evening , or a great part of it , and the boy missed him much ; for he was not yet self-dependent .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 17]: He would have gone to Euphrasia , but somehow she happened to be engaged that evening .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 32]: So he took refuge in the library , where , in the desolation of his spirit , Polexander began , almost immediately , to exercise its old dreary fascination upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 62]: Although he had not opened the book since Hugh had requested him to put it away , yet he had not given up the intention of finishing it some day ; and now he took it down , and opened it listlessly , with the intention of doing something towards the gradual redeeming of the pledge he had given to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 9]: But he found it more irksome than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 19]: Still he read on ; till at length he could discover no meaning at all in the sentences .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 12]: Then he began to doubt whether he had read the words .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 43]: He fixed his attention by main force on every individual word ; but even then he began to doubt whether he could say he had read the words , for he might have missed seeing some of the letters composing each word .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 28]: He grew so nervous and miserable over it , almost counting every letter , that at last he burst into tears , and threw the book down .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 38]: His intellect , which in itself was excellent , was quite of the parasitic order , requiring to wind itself about a stronger intellect , to keep itself in the region of fresh air and possible growth .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 40]: Left to itself , its weak stem could not raise it above the ground : it would grow and mass upon the earth , till it decayed and corrupted , for lack of room , light , and air .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 13]: But , of course , there was no danger in the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 11]: This was but the passing sadness of an occasional loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 53]: He crept to Hugh 's room , and received an invitation to enter , in answer to his gentle knock ; but Hugh was so absorbed in his new study , that he hardly took any notice of him , and Harry found it almost as dreary here as in the study .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 27]: He would have gone out , but a drizzling rain was falling ; and he shrank into himself at the thought of the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 7]: The dinner-bell was a welcome summons .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 56]: Hugh , inspirited by the reaction from close attention , by the presence of Euphra , and by the desire to make himself generally agreeable , which sprung from the consciousness of having done wrong , talked almost brilliantly , delighting Euphra , overcoming Harry with reverent astonishment , and even interesting slow Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 45]: With the latter Hugh had been gradually becoming a favourite ; partly because he had discovered in him what he considered high-minded sentiments ; for , however stupid and conventional Mr. Arnold might be , he had a foundation of sterling worthiness of character .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 40]: Euphra , instead of showing any jealousy of this growing friendliness , favoured it in every way in her power , and now and then alluded to it in her conversations with Hugh , as affording her great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 10]: `` I am so glad he likes you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: she would say .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 8]: `` Why should she be glad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 3]: thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 62]: This gentle claim of a kind of property in him , added considerably to the strength of the attraction that drew him towards her , as towards the centre of his spiritual gravitation ; if indeed that could be called spiritual which had so little of the element of moral or spiritual admiration , or even approval , mingled with it .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 8]: He never felt that Euphra was good .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 36]: He only felt that she drew him with a vague force of feminine sovereignty -- a charm which he could no more resist or explain , than the iron could the attraction of the lodestone .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 29]: Neither could he have said , had he really considered the matter , that she was beautiful -- only that she often , very often , looked beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 19]: I suspect if she had been rather ugly , it would have been all the same for Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 18]: He pursued his Italian studies with a singleness of aim and effort that carried him on rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 16]: He asked no assistance from Euphra , and said nothing to her about his progress .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 18]: But he was so absorbed in it , that it drew him still further from his pupil .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 30]: Of course he went out with him , walking or riding every day that the weather would permit ; and he had regular school hours with him within doors .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 70]: But during the latter , while Harry was doing something on his slate , or writing , or learning some lesson -LRB- which kind of work happened oftener now than he could have approved of -RRB- , he would take up his Italian ; and , notwithstanding Harry 's quiet hints that he had finished what had been set him , remain buried in it for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 40]: When he woke at last to the necessity of taking some notice of the boy , he would only appoint him something else to occupy him again , so as to leave himself free to follow his new bent .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 106]: Now and then he would become aware of his blameable neglect , and make a feeble struggle to rectify what seemed to be growing into a habit -- and one of the worst for a tutor ; but he gradually sank back into the mire , for mire it was , comforting himself with the resolution that as soon as he was able to read Italian without absolutely spelling his way , he would let Euphra see what progress he had made , and then return with renewed energy to Harry 's education , keeping up his own new accomplishment by more moderate exercise therein .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 19]: It must not be supposed , however , that a long course of time passed in this way .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 25]: At the end of a fortnight , he thought he might venture to request Euphra to show him the passage which had perplexed her .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 23]: This time he knew where she was -- in her own room ; for his mind had begun to haunt her whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 24]: He knocked at her door , heard the silvery , thrilling , happy sound , `` Come in ; '' and entered trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 17]: `` Would you show me the passage in Dante that perplexed you the other day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 17]: Euphra looked a little surprised ; but got the book and pointed it out at once .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 5]: Hugh glanced at it .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 31]: His superior acquaintance with the general forms of language enabled him , after finding two words in Euphra 's larger dictionary , to explain it , to her immediate satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 9]: `` You astonish me , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 15]: `` Latin gives me an advantage , you see , '' said Hugh modestly .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 11]: `` It seems to be very wonderful , nevertheless . ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 9]: These were sweet sounds to Hugh 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 6]: He had gained his end .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 4]: And she hers .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 22]: `` Well , '' she said , `` I have just come upon another passage that perplexes me not a little .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 11]: Will you try your powers upon that for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 9]: So saying , she proceeded to find it .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 18]: `` It is school-time , '' said Hugh `` I fear I must not wait now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 2]: pooh !
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 8]: Do n't make a pedagogue of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 21]: You know you are here more as a guardian -- big brother , you know -- to the dear child .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 22]: By the way , I am rather afraid you are working him a little more than his constitution will stand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 7]: `` Do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 8]: returned Hugh quite willing to be convinced .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 8]: `` I should be very sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 10]: `` This is the passage , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 11]: Hugh sat down once more at the table beside her .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 10]: He found this morsel considerably tougher than the last .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 21]: But at length he succeeded in pulling it to pieces and reconstructing it in a simpler form for the lady .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 8]: She was full of thanks and admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 30]: Naturally enough , they went on to the next line , and the next stanza , and the next and the next ; till -- shall I be believed ?
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 11]: -- they had read a whole canto of the poem .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 34]: Euphra knew more words by a great many than Hugh ; so that , what with her knowledge of the words , and his insight into the construction , they made rare progress .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 9]: `` What a beautiful passage it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 3]: said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 18]: `` It is indeed , '' responded Hugh ; `` I never read anything more beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 14]: `` I wonder if it would be possible to turn that into English .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 7]: I should like to try . ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 9]: `` You mean verse , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 6]: `` To be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 7]: `` Let us try , then .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 11]: I will bring you mine when I have finished it .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 15]: I fear it will take some time , though , to do it well .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 11]: Shall it be in blank verse , or what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 16]: do n't you think we had better keep the Terza Rima of the original ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 5]: `` As you please .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 9]: It will add much to the difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 4]: `` Recreant knight !
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 11]: will you shrink from following where your lady leads ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: so help me , my good pen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 18]: answered Hugh , and took his departure , with burning cheeks and a trembling at the heart .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 5]: the morning was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 21]: Harry was not in his study : he sought and found him in the library , apparently buried in Polexander .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 20]: `` I am so glad you are come , '' said Harry ; `` I am so tired . ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 12]: `` Why do you read that stupid book , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 8]: you know , I told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 3]: `` Tut !
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 2]: tut !
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 2]: nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 31]: Put it away , '' said Hugh , his dissatisfaction with himself making him cross with Harry , who felt , in consequence , ten times more desolate than before .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 7]: He could not understand the change .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 18]: If it went ill before with the hours devoted to common labour , it went worse now .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 21]: Hugh seized every gap of time , and widened its margins shamefully , in order to work at his translation .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 15]: He found it very difficult to render the Italian in classical and poetic English .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 22]: The three rhyming words , and the mode in which the stanzas are looped together , added greatly to the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 12]: Blank verse he would have found quite easy compared to this .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 6]: But he would not blench .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 26]: The thought of her praise , and of the yet better favour he might gain , spurred him on ; and Harry was the sacrifice .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 16]: But he would make it all up to him , when this was once over .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 5]: Indeed , he would .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 14]: Thus he baked cakes of clay to choke the barking of Cerberian conscience .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 6]: But it would growl notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 17]: The boy 's spirit was sinking ; but Hugh did not or would not see it .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 6]: His step grew less elastic .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 20]: He became more listless , more like his former self -- sauntering about with his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 34]: And Hugh , of course , found himself caring less about him ; for the thought of him , rousing as it did the sense of his own neglect , had become troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 11]: Sometimes he even passed poor Harry without speaking to him .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 27]: Gradually , however , he grew still further into the favour of Mr. Arnold , until he seemed to have even acquired some influence with him .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 51]: Mr. Arnold would go out riding with them himself sometimes , and express great satisfaction , not only with the way Harry sat his pony , for which he accorded Hugh the credit due to him , but with the way in which Hugh managed his own horse as well .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 27]: Mr. Arnold was a good horseman , and his praise was especially grateful to Hugh , because Euphra was always near , and always heard it .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 42]: I fear , however , that his progress in the good graces of Mr. Arnold , was , in a considerable degree , the result of the greater anxiety to please , which sprung from the consciousness of not deserving approbation .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 8]: Pleasing was an easy substitute for well-doing .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 41]: Not acceptable to himself , he had the greater desire to be acceptable to others ; and so reflect the side-beams of a false approbation on himself -- who needed true light and would be ill-provided for with any substitute .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 30]: For a man who is received as a millionaire can hardly help feeling like one at times , even if he knows he has overdrawn his banker 's account .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 22]: The necessity to Hugh 's nature of feeling right , drove him to this false mode of producing the false impression .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 17]: If one only wants to feel virtuous , there are several royal roads to that end .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 32]: But , fortunately , the end itself would be unsatisfactory if gained ; while not one of these roads does more than pretend to lead even to that land of delusion .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 11]: The reaction in Hugh 's mind was sometimes torturing enough .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 13]: But he had not strength to resist Euphra , and so reform .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 12]: Well or ill done , at length his translation was finished .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 5]: So was Euphra 's .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 21]: They exchanged papers for a private reading first ; and arranged to meet afterwards , in order to compare criticisms .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 4]: THE FIRST MIDNIGHT .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 21]: Well , if anything be damned , It will be twelve o'clock at night ; that twelve Will never scape .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 3]: CYRIL TOURNEUR .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 6]: -- The Revenger 's Tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 13]: Letters arrived at Arnstead generally while the family was seated at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 47]: One morning , the post-bag having been brought in , Mr. Arnold opened it himself , according to his unvarying custom ; and found , amongst other letters , one in an old-fashioned female hand , which , after reading it , he passed to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 9]: `` You remember Mrs. Elton , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 12]: `` Quite well , uncle -- a dear old lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 34]: But the expression which passed across her face , rather belied her words , and seemed to Hugh to mean : `` I hope she is not going to bore us again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 38]: She took care , however , to show no sign with regard to the contents of the letter ; but , laying it beside her on the table , waited to hear her uncle 's mind first .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 7]: `` Poor , dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 5]: said he at last .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 13]: `` You must try to make her as comfortable as you can .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 19]: There is consumption in the family , you see , '' he added , with a meditative sigh .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 8]: `` Of course I will , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 3]: Poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 13]: I hope there is not much amiss though , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 26]: But , as she spoke , an irrepressible flash of dislike , or displeasure of some sort , broke from her eyes , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 26]: No one but himself seemed to Hugh to have observed it ; but he was learned in the lady 's eyes , and their weather-signs .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 20]: Mr. Arnold rose from the table and left the room , apparently to write an answer to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 14]: As soon as he was gone , Euphra gave the letter to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 42]: He read as follows : -- `` MY DEAR MR. ARNOLD , `` Will you extend the hospitality of your beautiful house to me and my young friend , who has the honour of being your relative , Lady Emily Lake ?
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 32]: For some time her health has seemed to be failing , and she is ordered to spend the winter abroad , at Pau , or somewhere in the south of France .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 81]: It is considered highly desirable that in the meantime she should have as much change as possible ; and it occurred to me , remembering the charming month I passed at your seat , and recalling the fact that Lady Emily is cousin only once removed to your late most lovely wife , that there would be no impropriety in writing to ask you whether you could , without inconvenience , receive us as your guests for a short time .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 28]: I say us ; for the dear girl has taken such a fancy to unworthy old me , that she almost refuses to set out without me .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 35]: Not to be cumbersome either to our friends or ourselves , we shall bring only our two maids , and a steady old man-servant , who has been in my family for many years .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 49]: -- I trust you will not hesitate to refuse my request , should I happen to have made it at an unsuitable season ; assured , as you must be , that we can not attribute the refusal to any lack of hospitality or friendliness on your part .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 32]: At all events , I trust you will excuse what seems -- now I have committed it to paper -- a great liberty , I hope not presumption , on mine .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 18]: I am , my dear Mr. Arnold , `` Yours most sincerely , `` HANNAH ELTON . ''
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 12]: Hugh refolded the letter , and laid it down without remark .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 6]: Harry had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 8]: `` Is n't it a bore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 3]: said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 7]: Hugh answered only by a look .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 7]: `` Who is Mrs. Elton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 8]: `` Oh , a good-hearted creature enough .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 4]: Frightfully prosy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 9]: `` But that is a well-written letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 19]: She is famed for her letter-writing ; and , I believe , practises every morning on a slate .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 13]: It is the only thing that redeems her from absolute stupidity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 27]: Euphra , with her taper fore-finger , tapped the table-cloth impatiently , and shifted back in her chair , as if struggling with an inward annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 11]: `` And what sort of person is Lady Emily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 3]: asked Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 7]: `` I have never seen her .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 10]: Some blue-eyed milk-maid with a title , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 7]: And in a consumption , too !
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 13]: I presume the dear girl is as religious as the old one .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 4]: -- Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 6]: what shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 41]: she burst out at length ; and , rising from her chair , she paced about the room hurriedly , but all the time with a gliding kind of footfall , that would have shaken none but the craziest floor .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 5]: `` Dear Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 9]: Hugh ventured to say , `` never mind .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 11]: Let us try to make the best of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 28]: She stopped in her walk , turned towards him , smiled as if ashamed and delighted at the same moment , and slid out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 21]: Had Euphra been the same all through , she could hardly have smiled so without being in love with Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 10]: That morning he sought her again in her room .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 8]: They talked over their versions of Dante .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 18]: Hugh 's was certainly the best , for he was more practised in such things than Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 22]: He showed her many faults , which she at once perceived to be faults , and so rose in his estimation .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 36]: But at the same time there were individual lines and passages of hers , which he considered not merely better than the corresponding lines and passages , but better than any part of his version .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 18]: This he was delighted to say ; and she seemed as delighted that he should think so .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: A great part of the morning was spent thus .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 11]: `` I can not stay longer , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 18]: `` Let us read for an hour , then , after we come up stairs to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 11]: `` With more pleasure than I dare to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 10]: `` But you mean what you do say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 11]: `` You can doubt it no more than myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 11]: Yet he did not like Euphra 's making the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 21]: No more did he like the flippant , almost cruel way in which she referred to Lady Emily 's illness .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 43]: But he put it down to annoyance and haste -- got over it somehow -- anyhow ; and began to feel that if she were a devil he could not help loving her , and would not help it if he could .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 34]: The hope of meeting her alone that night , gave him spirit and energy with Harry ; and the poor boy was more cheery and active than he had been for some time .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 16]: He thought his big brother was going to love him again as at the first .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 24]: Hugh 's treatment of his pupil might still have seemed kind from another , but Harry felt it a great change in him .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 27]: In the course of the day , Euphra took an opportunity of whispering to him : `` Not in my room -- in the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 17]: I presume she thought it would be more prudent , in the case of any interruption .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 25]: After dinner that evening , Hugh did not go to the drawingroom with Mr. Arnold , but out into the woods about the house .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 14]: It was early in the twilight ; for now the sun set late .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 23]: The month was June ; and the even a rich , dreamful , rosy even -- the sleep of a gorgeous day .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 31]: `` It is like the soul of a gracious woman , '' thought Hugh , charmed into a lucid interval of passion by the loveliness of the nature around him .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 48]: Strange to tell , at that moment , instead of the hushed gloom of the library , towards which he was hoping and leaning in his soul , there arose before him the bare , stern , leafless pine-wood -- for who can call its foliage leaves ?
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 103]: -- with the chilly wind of a northern spring morning blowing through it with a wailing noise of waters ; and beneath a weird fir-tree , lofty , gaunt , and huge , with bare goblin arms , contorted sweepily , in a strange mingling of the sublime and the grotesque -- beneath this fir-tree , Margaret sitting on one of its twisted roots , the very image of peace , with a face that seemed stilled by the expected approach of a sacred and unknown gladness ; a face that would blossom the more gloriously because its joy delayed its coming .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 26]: And above it , the tree shone a `` still , '' almost `` awful red , '' in the level light of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 22]: The vision came and passed , for he did not invite its stay : it rebuked him to the deepest soul .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 10]: He strayed in troubled pleasure , restless and dissatisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 49]: Woods of the richest growth were around him ; heaps on heaps of leaves floating above him like clouds , a trackless wilderness of airy green , wherein one might wish to dwell for ever , looking down into the vaults and aisles of the long-ranging boles beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 29]: But no peace could rest on his face ; only , at best , a false mask , put on to hide the trouble of the unresting heart .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 27]: Had he been doing his duty to Harry , his love for Euphra , however unworthy she might be , would not have troubled him thus .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 6]: He came upon an avenue .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 61]: At the further end the boughs of the old trees , bare of leaves beneath , met in a perfect pointed arch , across which were barred the lingering colours of the sunset , transforming the whole into a rich window full of stained glass and complex tracery , closing up a Gothic aisle in a temple of everlasting worship .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 53]: A kind of holy calm fell upon him as he regarded the dim , dying colours ; and the spirit of the night , a something that is neither silence nor sound , and yet is like both , sank into his soul , and made a moment of summer twilight there .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 21]: He walked along the avenue for some distance ; and then , leaving it , passed on through the woods .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 15]: -- Suddenly it flashed upon him that he had crossed the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 13]: A slight but cold shudder passed through the region of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 30]: Then he laughed at himself , and , as it were in despite of his own tremor , turned , and crossed yet again the path of the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 43]: A spiritual epicure in his pleasures , he would not spoil the effect of the coming meeting , by seeing Euphra in the drawingroom first : he went to his own study , where he remained till the hour had nearly arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 7]: He tried to write some verses .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 47]: But he found that , although the lovely form of its own Naiad lay on the brink of the Well of Song , its waters would not flow : during the sirocco of passion , its springs withdrew into the cool caves of the Life beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 27]: At length he rose , too much preoccupied to mind his want of success ; and , going down the back stair , reached the library .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 16]: There he seated himself , and tried to read by the light of his chamber-candle .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 26]: But it was scarcely even an attempt , for every moment he was looking up to the door by which he expected her to enter .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 14]: Suddenly an increase of light warned him that she was in the room .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 9]: How she had entered he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 70]: One hand carried her candle , the light of which fell on her pale face , with its halo of blackness -- her hair , which looked like a well of darkness , that threatened to break from its bonds and overflood the room with a second night , dark enough to blot out that which was now looking in , treeful and deep , at the uncurtained windows .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 28]: The other hand was busy trying to incarcerate a stray tress which had escaped from its net , and made her olive shoulders look white beside it .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 16]: `` Let it alone , '' said Hugh , `` let it be beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 73]: But she gently repelled the hand he raised to hers , and , though she was forced to put down her candle first , persisted in confining the refractory tress ; then seated herself at the table , and taking from her pocket the manuscript which Hugh had been criticising in the morning , unfolded it , and showed him all the passages he had objected to , neatly corrected or altered .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 11]: It was wonderfully done for the time she had had .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 24]: He went over it all with her again , seated close to her , their faces almost meeting as they followed the lines .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 37]: They had just finished it , and were about to commence reading from the original , when Hugh , who missed a sheet of Euphra 's translation , stooped under the table to look for it .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 20]: A few moments were spent in the search , before he discovered that Euphra 's foot was upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 18]: He begged her to move a little , but received no reply either by word or act .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 18]: Looking up in some alarm , he saw that she was either asleep or in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 25]: By an impulse inexplicable to himself at the time , he went at once to the windows , and drew down the green blinds .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 19]: When he turned towards her again , she was reviving or awaking , he could not tell which .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 11]: `` How stupid of me to go to sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 10]: `` Let us go on with our reading . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 38]: They had read for about half an hour , when three taps upon one of the windows , slight , but peculiar , and as if given with the point of a finger , suddenly startled them .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 24]: Hugh turned at once towards the windows ; but , of course , he could see nothing , having just lowered the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 6]: He turned again towards Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 36]: She had a strange wild look ; her lips were slightly parted , and her nostrils wide ; her face was rigid , and glimmering pale as death from the cloud of her black hair .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 6]: `` What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 14]: said Hugh , affected by her fear with the horror of the unknown .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 15]: But she made no answer , and continued staring towards one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 34]: He rose and was about to advance to it , when she caught him by the hand with a grasp of which hers would have been incapable except under the influence of terror .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 12]: At that moment a clock in the room began to strike .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 24]: It was a slow clock , and went on deliberately , striking one ... two ... three ... till it had struck twelve .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 18]: Every stroke was a blow from the hammer of fear , and his heart was the bell .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 15]: He could not breathe for dread so long as the awful clock was striking .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 17]: When it had ended , they looked at each other again , and Hugh breathed once .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 4]: `` Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 3]: he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 17]: But she made no answer ; she turned her eyes again to one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 5]: They were both standing .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 18]: He sought to draw her to him , but she yielded no more than a marble statue .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 32]: `` I crossed the Ghost 's Walk to-night , '' said he , in a hard whisper , scarcely knowing that he uttered it , till he heard his own words .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 17]: They seemed to fall upon his ear as if spoken by some one outside the room .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 15]: She looked at him once more , and kept looking with a fixed stare .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 13]: Gradually her face became less rigid , and her eyes less wild .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 6]: She could move at last .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 14]: `` Come , come , '' she said , in a hurried whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 40]: `` Let us go -- no , no , not that way ; '' -- as Hugh would have led her towards the private stair -- `` let us go the front way , by the oak staircase . ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 5]: They went up together .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 27]: When they reached the door of her room , she said , `` Good night , '' without even looking at him , and passed in .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 65]: Hugh went on , in a state of utter bewilderment , to his own apartment ; shut the door and locked it -- a thing he had never done before ; lighted both the candles on his table ; and then walked up and down the room , trying , like one aware that he is dreaming , to come to his real self .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 4]: `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 13]: `` It was only a little bird , or a large moth .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 13]: How odd it is that darkness can make a fool of one !
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 6]: I am ashamed of myself .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 31]: I wish I had gone out at the window , if only to show Euphra I was not afraid , though of course there was nothing to be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 53]: As he said this in his mind , -- he could not have spoken it aloud , for fear of hearing his own voice in the solitude , -- he went to one of the windows of his sitting-room , which was nearly over the library , and looked into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 5]: -- Could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 3]: -- Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 22]: -- He did see something white , gliding through the wood , away in the direction of the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 10]: It vanished ; and he saw it no more .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 12]: The morning was far advanced before he could go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 39]: When the first light of the aurora broke the sky , he looked out again ; -- and the first glimmerings of the morning in the wood were more dreadful than the deepest darkness of the past night .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 25]: Possessed by a new horror , he thought how awful it would be to see a belated ghost , hurrying away in helpless haste .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 83]: The spectre would be yet more terrible in the grey light of the coming day , and the azure breezes of the morning , which to it would be like a new and more fearful death , than amidst its own homely sepulchral darkness ; while the silence all around -- silence in light -- could befit only that dread season of loneliness when men are lost in sleep , and ghosts , if they walk at all , walk in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 16]: But at length fear yielded to sleep , though still he troubled her short reign .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 25]: When he awoke , he found it so late , that it was all he could do to get down in time for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 25]: But so anxious was he not to be later than usual , that he was in the room before Mr. Arnold made his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 9]: Euphra , however , was there before him .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 11]: She greeted him in the usual way , quite circumspectly .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 5]: But she looked troubled .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 19]: Her face was very pale , and her eyes were red , as if from sleeplessness or weeping .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 26]: When her uncle entered , she addressed him with more gaiety than usual , and he did not perceive that anything was amiss with her .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 32]: But the whole of that day she walked as in a reverie , avoiding Hugh two or three times that they chanced to meet without a third person in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 26]: Once in the forenoon -- when she was generally to be found in her room -- he could not refrain from trying to see her .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 10]: The change and the mystery were insupportable to him .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 45]: But when he tapped at her door , no answer came ; and he walked back to Harry , feeling , as if , by an unknown door in his own soul , he had been shut out of the half of his being .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 23]: Or rather -- a wall seemed to have been built right before his eyes , which still was there wherever he went .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 56]: As to the gliding phantom of the previous night , the day denied it all , telling him it was but the coinage of his own over-wrought brain , weakened by prolonged tension of the intellect , and excited by the presence of Euphra at an hour claimed by phantoms when not yielded to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 14]: This was the easiest and most natural way of disposing of the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 11]: The cloud around Euphra hid the ghost in its skirts .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 29]: Although fear in some measure returned with the returning shadows , he yet resolved to try to get Euphra to meet him again in the library that night .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 16]: But she never gave him a chance of even dropping a hint to that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 27]: She had not gone out with them in the morning ; and when he followed her into the drawing-room , she was already at the piano .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 44]: He thought he might convey his wish without interrupting the music ; but as often as he approached her , she broke , or rather glided , out into song , as if she had been singing in an undertone all the while .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 16]: He could not help seeing she did not intend to let him speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 43]: But , all the time , whatever she sang was something she knew he liked ; and as often as she spoke to him in the hearing of her uncle or cousin , it was in a manner peculiarly graceful and simple .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 38]: He could not understand her ; and was more bewitched , more fascinated than ever , by seeing her through the folds of the incomprehensible , in which element she had wrapped herself from his nearer vision .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 28]: She had always seemed above him -- now she seemed miles away as well ; a region of Paradise , into which he was forbidden to enter .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 30]: Everything about her , to her handkerchief and her gloves , was haunted by a vague mystery of worshipfulness , and drew him towards it with wonder and trembling .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 47]: When they parted for the night , she shook hands with him with a cool frankness , that put him nearly beside himself with despair ; and when he found himself in his own room , it was some time before he could collect his thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 32]: Having succeeded , however , he resolved , in spite of growing fears , to go to the library , and see whether it were not possible she might be there .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 13]: He took up a candle , and went down the back stair .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 70]: But when he opened the library door , a gust of wind blew his candle out ; all was darkness within ; a sudden horror seized him ; and , afraid of yielding to the inclination to bound up the stair , lest he should go wild with the terror of pursuit , he crept slowly back , feeling his way to his own room with a determined deliberateness .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 10]: -- Could the library window have been left open ?
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 7]: Else whence the gust of wind ?
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 33]: Next day , and the next , and the next , he fared no better : her behaviour continued the same ; and she allowed him no opportunity of requesting an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 3]: A SUNDAY .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 49]: A man may be a heretic in the truth ; and if he believe things only because his pastor says so , or the assembly so determines , without knowing other reason , though his belief be true , yet the very truth he holds becomes his heresy .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 3]: -- MILTON .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 3]: -- Areopagitica .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 7]: At length the expected visitors arrived .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 11]: Hugh saw nothing of them till they assembled for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 37]: Mrs. Elton was a benevolent old lady -- not old enough to give in to being old -- rather tall , and rather stout , in rich widow-costume , whose depth had been moderated by time .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 27]: Her kindly grey eyes looked out from a calm face , which seemed to have taken comfort from loving everybody in a mild and moderate fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 20]: Lady Emily was a slender girl , rather shy , with fair hair , and a pale innocent face .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 13]: She wore a violet dress , which put out her blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 41]: She showed to no advantage beside the suppressed glow of life which made Euphra look like a tropical twilight -- I am aware there is no such thing , but if there were , it would be just like her .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 34]: Mrs. Elton seemed to have concentrated the motherhood of her nature , which was her most prominent characteristic , notwithstanding -- or perhaps in virtue of -- her childlessness , upon Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 37]: To her Mrs. Elton was solicitously attentive ; and she , on her part , received it all sweetly and gratefully , taking no umbrage at being treated as more of an invalid than she was .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 20]: Lady Emily ate nothing but chicken , and custard-pudding or rice , all the time she was at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 16]: The richer and more seasoned any dish , the more grateful it was to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 7]: Mr. Arnold was a saddle-of-mutton man .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 8]: Hugh preferred roast-beef , but ate anything .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 14]: `` What sort of a clergyman have you now , Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 8]: asked Mrs. Elton , at the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 19]: a very respectable young gentleman , brother to Sir Richard , who has the gift , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 12]: A very moderate , excellent clergyman he makes , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 62]: but you know , Lady Emily and I '' -- here she looked at Lady Emily , who smiled and blushed faintly , `` are very dependent on our Sundays , and '' -- `` We all go to church regularly , I assure you , Mrs. Elton ; and of course my carriage shall be always at your disposal . ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 17]: `` I was in no doubt about either of those things , indeed , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 10]: But what sort of a preacher is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 5]: `` Ah , well !
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 4]: let me see .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 17]: -- What was the subject of his sermon last Sunday , Euphra , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 20]: `` The devil and all his angels , '' answered Euphra , with a wicked flash in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 9]: `` Yes , yes ; so it was .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 19]: I assure you , Mrs. Elton , he is quite a respectable preacher , as well as clergyman .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 9]: He is an honour to the cloth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 21]: Hugh could not help thinking that the tailor should have his due , and that Mr. Arnold gave it him .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 35]: `` He is no Puseyite either , '' added Mr. Arnold , seeing but not understanding Mrs. Elton 's baffled expression , `` though he does preach once a month in his surplice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 25]: `` I am afraid you will not find him very original , though , '' said Hugh , wishing to help the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 4]: `` Original ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 4]: interposed Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 17]: `` Really , I am bound to say I do n't know how the remark applies .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 38]: How is a man to be original on a subject that is all laid down in plain print -- to use a vulgar expression -- and has been commented upon for eighteen hundred years and more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 12]: `` Very true , Mr. Arnold , '' responded Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 10]: `` We do n't want originality , do we ?
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 8]: It is only the gospel we want .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 7]: Does he preach the gospel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 8]: `` How can he preach anything else ?
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 13]: His text is always out of some part of the Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 26]: `` I am glad to see you hold by the Inspiration of the Scriptures , Mr. Arnold , '' said Mrs. Elton , chaotically bewildered .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 7]: Madam , what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 12]: Could you for a moment suppose me to be an atheist ?
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 12]: Surely you have not become a student of German Neology ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 8]: And Mr. Arnold smiled a grim smile .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 7]: `` Not I , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 23]: protested poor Mrs. Elton , moving uneasily in her seat ; -- `` I quite agree with you , Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 38]: `` Then you may take my word for it , that you will hear nothing but what is highly orthodox , and perfectly worthy of a gentleman and a clergyman , from the pulpit of Mr. Penfold .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 9]: He dined with us only last week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 20]: This last assertion was made in an injured tone , just sufficient to curl the tail of the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 9]: After which , what was to be said ?
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 36]: Several vain attempts followed , before a new subject was started , sufficiently uninteresting to cause , neither from warmth nor stupidity , any danger of dissension , and quite worthy of being here omitted .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 27]: Dinner over , and the ceremony of tea -- in Lady Emily 's case , milk and water -- having been observed , the visitors withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 6]: The next day was Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 13]: Lady Emily came down stairs in black , which suited her better .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 31]: She was a pretty , gentle creature , interesting from her illness , and good , because she knew no evil , except what she heard of from the pulpit .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 32]: They walked to church , which was at no great distance , along a meadow-path paved with flags , some of them worn through by the heavy shoes of country generations .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 62]: The church was one of those which are , in some measure , typical of the Church itself ; for it was very old , and would have been very beautiful , had it not been all plastered over , and whitened to a smooth uniformity of ugliness -- the attempt having been more successful in the case of the type .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 65]: The open roof had had a French heaven added to it -- I mean a ceiling ; and the pillars , which , even if they were not carved -- though it was impossible to come to a conclusion on that point -- must yet have been worn into the beauty of age , had been filled up , and stained with yellow ochre .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 26]: Even the remnants of stained glass in some of the windows , were half concealed by modern appliances for the partial exclusion of the light .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 12]: The church had fared as Chaucer in the hands of Dryden .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 52]: So had the truth , that flickered through the sermon , fared in the hands of the clergyman , or of the sermon-wright whose manuscript he had bought for eighteen pence -- I am told that sermons are to be procured at that price -- on his last visit to London .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 74]: Having , although a Scotchman , had an episcopalian education , Hugh could not help rejoicing that not merely the Bible , but the Church-service as well , had been fixed beyond the reach of such degenerating influences as those which had operated on the more material embodiments of religion ; for otherwise such would certainly have been the first to operate , and would have found the greatest scope in any alteration .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 49]: We may hope that nothing but a true growth in such religion as needs and seeks new expression for new depth and breadth of feeling , will ever be permitted to lay the hand of change upon it -- a hand , otherwise , of desecration and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 37]: The sermon was chiefly occupied with proving that God is no respecter of persons ; a mark of indubitable condescension in the clergyman , the rank in society which he could claim for himself duly considered .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 76]: But , unfortunately , the church was so constructed , that its area contained three platforms of position , actually of differing level ; the loftiest , in the chancel , on the right hand of the pulpit , occupied by the gentry ; the middle , opposite the pulpit , occupied by the tulip-beds of their servants ; and the third , on the left of the pulpit , occupied by the common parishioners .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 63]: Unfortunately , too , by the perpetuation of some old custom , whose significance was not worn out , all on the left of the pulpit were expected , as often as they stood up to sing -- which was three times -- to turn their backs to the pulpit , and so face away from the chancel where the gentry stood .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 62]: But there was not much inconsistency , after all ; the sermon founding its argument chiefly on the antithetical facts , that death , lowering the rich to the level of the poor , was a dead leveller ; and that , on the other hand , the life to come would raise the poor to the level of the rich .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 39]: It was a pity that there was no phrase in the language to justify him in carrying out the antithesis , and so balancing his sentence like a rope-walker , by saying that life was a live leveller .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 49]: The sermon ended with a solemn warning : `` Those who neglect the gospel-scheme , and never think of death and judgment -- be they rich or poor , be they wise or ignorant -- whether they dwell in the palace or the hut -- shall be damned .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 37]: Glory be to the Father , and to the Son , and to the Holy Ghost , '' & c. Lady Emily was forced to confess that she had not been much interested in the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 18]: Mrs. Elton thought he spoke plainly , but there was not much of the gospel in it .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 129]: Mr. Arnold opined that people should not go to church to hear sermons , but to make the responses ; whoever read prayers , it made no difference , for the prayers were the Church 's , not the parson 's ; and for the sermon , as long as it showed the uneducated how to be saved , and taught them to do their duty in the station of life to which God had called them , and so long as the parson preached neither Puseyism nor Radicalism -- -LRB- he frowned solemnly and disgustedly as he repeated the word -RRB- -- nor Radicalism , it was of comparatively little moment whether he was a man of intellect or not , for he could not go wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 26]: Little was said in reply to this , except something not very audible or definite , by Mrs. Elton , about the necessity of faith .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 28]: The conversation , which took place at luncheon , flagged , and the visitors withdrew to their respective rooms , to comfort themselves with their Daily Portions .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 24]: At dinner , Mr. Arnold , evidently believing he had made an impression by his harangue of the morning , resumed the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 25]: Hugh was a little surprised to find that he had , even of a negative sort , strong opinions on the subject of religion .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 23]: `` What do you think , then , Mrs. Elton , my dear madam , that a clergyman ought to preach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 23]: `` I think , Mr. Arnold , that he ought to preach salvation by faith in the merits of the Saviour . ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 6]: of course , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 7]: We shall not differ about that .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 5]: Everybody believes that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 7]: `` I doubt it very much .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 100]: -- He ought , in order that men may believe , to explain the divine plan , by which the demands of divine justice are satisfied , and the punishment due to sin averted from the guilty , and laid upon the innocent ; that , by bearing our sins , he might make atonement to the wrath of a justly offended God ; and so -- '' `` Now , my dear madam , permit me to ask what right we , the subjects of a Supreme Authority , have to inquire into the reasons of his doings ?
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 76]: It seems to me -- I should be sorry to offend any one , but it seems to me quite as presumptuous as the present arrogance of the lower classes in interfering with government , and demanding a right to give their opinion , forsooth , as to the laws by which they shall be governed ; as if they were capable of understanding the principles by which kings rule , and governors decree justice .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 8]: -- I believe I quote Scripture . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 17]: `` Are we , then , to remain in utter ignorance of the divine character ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 10]: `` What business have we with the divine character ?
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 7]: Or how could we understand it ?
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 13]: It seems to me we have enough to do with our own .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 10]: Do I inquire into the character of my sovereign ?
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 60]: All we have to do is , to listen to what we are told by those who are educated for such studies , whom the Church approves , and who are appointed to take care of the souls committed to their charge ; to teach them to respect their superiors , and to lead honest , hard-working lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 15]: Much more of the same sort flowed from the oracular lips of Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 13]: When he ceased , he found that the conversation had ceased also .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 30]: As soon as the ladies withdrew , he said , without looking at Hugh , as he filled his glass : `` Mr. Sutherland , I hate cant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: And so he canted against it .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 30]: But the next day , and during the whole week , he seemed to lay himself out to make amends for the sharpness of his remarks on the Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 21]: He was afraid he had made his guests uncomfortable , and so sinned against his own character as a host .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 101]: Everything that he could devise , was brought to bear for their entertainment ; daily rides in the open carriage , in which he always accompanied them , to show his estate , and the improvements he was making upon it ; visits sometimes to the more deserving , as he called them , of the poor upon his property -- the more deserving being the most submissive and obedient to the wishes of their lord ; inspections of the schools , & c. , & c. ; in all of which matters he took a stupid , benevolent interest .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 37]: For if people would be content to occupy the corner in which he chose to place them , he would throw them morsel after morsel , as long as ever they chose to pick it up .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 13]: But woe to them if they left this corner a single pace !
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 32]: Euphra made one of the party always ; and it was dreary indeed for Hugh to be left in the desolate house without her , though but for a few hours .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 18]: And when she was at home , she never yet permitted him to speak to her alone .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 49]: There might have been some hope for Harry in Hugh 's separation from Euphra ; but the result was , that , although he spent school-hours more regularly with him , Hugh was yet more dull , and uninterested in the work , than he had been before .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 55]: Instead of caring that his pupil should understand this or that particular , he would be speculating on Euphra 's behaviour , trying to account for this or that individual look or tone , or seeking , perhaps , a special symbolic meaning in some general remark that she had happened to let fall .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 32]: Meanwhile , poor Harry would be stupifying himself with work which he could not understand for lack of some explanation or other that ought to have been given him weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 58]: Still , however , he clung to Hugh with a far-off , worshipping love , never suspecting that he could be to blame , but thinking at one time that he must be ill , at another that he himself was really too stupid , and that his big brother could not help getting tired of him .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 114]: When Hugh would be wandering about the place , seeking to catch a glimpse of the skirt of Euphra 's dress , as she went about with her guests , or devising how he could procure an interview with her alone , Harry would be following him at a distance , like a little terrier that had lost its master , and did not know whether this man would be friendly or not ; never spying on his actions , but merely longing to be near him -- for had not Hugh set him going in the way of life , even if he had now left him to walk in it alone ?
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 26]: If Hugh could have once seen into that warm , true , pining little heart , he would not have neglected it as he did .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 11]: He had no eyes , however , but for Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 25]: Still , it may be that even now Harry was able to gather , though with tears , some advantage from Hugh 's neglect .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 39]: He used to wander about alone ; and it may be that the hints which his tutor had already given him , enabled him now to find for himself the interest belonging to many objects never before remarked .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 45]: Perhaps even now he began to take a few steps alone ; the waking independence of which was of more value for the future growth of his nature , than a thousand miles accomplished by the aid of the strong arm of his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 48]: One certain advantage was , that the constitutional trouble of the boy 's nature had now assumed a definite form , by gathering around a definite object , and blending its own shadowy being with the sorrow he experienced from the loss of his tutor 's sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 18]: Should that sorrow ever be cleared away , much besides might be cleared away along with it .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 50]: Meantime , nature found some channels , worn by his grief , through which her comforts , that , like waters , press on all sides , and enter at every cranny and fissure in the house of life , might gently flow into him with their sympathetic soothing .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 75]: Often he would creep away to the nest which Hugh had built and then forsaken ; and seated there in the solitude of the wide-bourgeoned oak , he would sometimes feel for a moment as if lifted up above the world and its sorrows , to be visited by an all-healing wind from God , that came to him , through the wilderness of leaves around him -- gently , like all powerful things .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 15]: But I am putting the boy 's feelings into forms and words for him .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 8]: He had none of either for them .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 3]: A STORM .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 29]: When the mind 's free , The body 's delicate : the tempest in my mind Doth from my senses take all feeling else Save what beats there .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 3]: King Lear .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 55]: While Harry took to wandering abroad in the afternoon sun , Hugh , on the contrary , found the bright weather so distasteful to him , that he generally trifled away his afternoons with some old romance in the dark library , or lay on the couch in his study , listless and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 7]: He could neither read nor write .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 13]: What he felt he must do he did ; but nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 12]: One day , about noon , the weather began to change .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 36]: In the afternoon it grew dark ; and Hugh , going to the window , perceived with delight -- the first he had experienced for many days -- that a great thunder-storm was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 17]: Harry was rather frightened ; but under his fear , there evidently lay a deep delight .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 32]: The storm came nearer and nearer ; till at length a vivid flash broke from the mass of darkness over the woods , lasted for one brilliant moment , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 44]: The thunder followed , like a pursuing wild beast , close on the traces of the vanishing light ; as if the darkness were hunting the light from the earth , and bellowing with rage that it could not overtake and annihilate it .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 63]: Without the usual prelude of a few great drops , the rain poured at once , in continuous streams , from the dense canopy overhead ; and in a few moments there were six inches of water all round the house , which the force of the falling streams made to foam , and fume , and flash like a seething torrent .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 55]: Harry had crept close to Hugh , who stood looking out of the window ; and as if the convulsion of the elements had begun to clear the spiritual and moral , as well as the physical atmosphere , Hugh looked down on the boy kindly , and put his arm round his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 12]: Harry nestled closer , and wished it would thunder for ever .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 31]: But longing to hear his tutor 's voice , he ventured to speak , looking up to his face : `` Euphra says it is only electricity , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 5]: What is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 21]: A common tutor would have seized the opportunity of explaining what he knew of the laws and operations of electricity .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 36]: But Hugh had been long enough a pupil of David to feel that to talk at such a time of anything in nature but God , would be to do the boy a serious wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 40]: One capable of so doing would , in the presence of the Saviour himself , speculate on the nature of his own faith ; or upon the death of his child , seize the opportunity of lecturing on anatomy .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 65]: But before Hugh could make any reply , a flash , almost invisible from excess of light , was accompanied rather than followed by a roar that made the house shake ; and in a moment more the room was filled with the terrified household , which , by an unreasoning impulse , rushed to the neighbourhood of him who was considered the strongest .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 8]: -- Mr. Arnold was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 10]: `` Come from the window instantly , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 8]: How can you be so imprudent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 17]: cried Mrs. Elton , her usually calm voice elevated in command , but tremulous with fear .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 36]: `` Why , Mrs. Elton , '' answered Hugh on whose temper , as well as conduct , recent events had had their operation , `` do you think the devil makes the thunder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 59]: Lady Emily gave a faint shriek , whether out of reverence for the devil , or fear of God , I hesitate to decide ; and flitting out of the room , dived into her bed , and drew the clothes over her head -- at least so she was found at a later period of the day .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 45]: Euphra walked up to the window beside Hugh , as if to show her approval of his rudeness ; and stood looking out with eyes that filled their own night with home-born flashes , though her lip was pale , and quivered a little .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 45]: Mrs. Elton , confounded at Hugh 's reply , and perhaps fearing the house might in consequence share the fate of Sodom , notwithstanding the presence of a goodly proportion of the righteous , fled , accompanied by the housekeeper , to the wine-cellar .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 58]: The rest of the household crept into corners , except the coachman , who , retaining his composure , in virtue of a greater degree of insensibility from his nearer approximation to the inanimate creation , emptied the jug of ale intended for the dinner of the company , and went out to look after his horses .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 59]: But there was one in the house who , left alone , threw the window wide open ; and , with gently clasped hands and calm countenance , looked up into the heavens ; and the clearness of whose eye seemed the prophetic symbol of the clearness that rose all untroubled above the turmoil of the earthly storm .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 43]: Truly God was in the storm ; but there was more of God in the clear heaven beyond ; and yet more of Him in the eye that regarded the whole with a still joy , in which was mingled no dismay .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 16]: Euphra , Hugh , and Harry were left together , looking out upon the storm .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 9]: Hugh could not speak in Harry 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 22]: At length the boy sat down in a dark corner on the floor , concealed from the others by a window-curtain .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 8]: Hugh thought he had left the room .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 7]: `` Euphra , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 32]: Euphra looked round for Harry , and not seeing him , thought likewise that he had left the room : she glided away without making any answer to Hugh 's invocation .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 35]: He stood for a few moments in motionless despair ; then glancing round the room , and taking in all its desertedness , caught up his hat , and rushed out into the storm .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 69]: It was the best relief his feelings could have had ; for the sullen gloom , alternated with bursts of flame , invasions of horrid uproar , and long wailing blasts of tyrannous wind , gave him his own mood to walk in ; met his spirit with its own element ; widened , as it were , his microcosm to the expanse of the macrocosm around him .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 27]: All the walls of separation were thrown down , and he lived , not in his own frame , but in the universal frame of nature .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 38]: The world was for the time , to the reality of his feeling , what Schleiermacher , in his Monologen , describes it as being to man , an extension of the body in which he dwells .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 23]: His spirit flashed in the lightning , raved in the thunder , moaned in the wind , and wept in the rain .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 13]: But this could not last long , either without or within him .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 8]: He came to himself in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 16]: How far he had wandered , or whereabout he was , he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 17]: The storm had died away , and all that remained was the wind and the rain .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 23]: The tree-tops swayed wildly in the irregular blasts , and shook new , fitful , distracted , and momentary showers upon him .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 15]: It was evening , but what hour of the evening he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 20]: He was wet to the skin ; but that to a young Scotchman is a matter of little moment .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 98]: Although he had no intention of returning home for some time , and meant especially to avoid the dinner-table -- for , in the mood he was in , it seemed more than he could endure -- he yet felt the weakness to which we are subject as embodied beings , in a common enough form ; that , namely , of the necessity of knowing the precise portion of space which at the moment we fill ; a conviction of our identity not being sufficient to make us comfortable , without a knowledge of our locality .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 63]: So , looking all about him , and finding where the wood seemed thinnest , he went in that direction ; and soon , by forcing his way through obstacles of all salvage kinds , found himself in the high road , within a quarter of a mile of the country town next to Arnstead , removed from it about three miles .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 51]: This little town he knew pretty well ; and , beginning to feel exhausted , resolved to go to an inn there , dry his clothes , and then walk back in the moonlight ; for he felt sure the storm would be quite over in an hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 33]: The fatigue he now felt was proof enough in itself , that the inward storm had , for the time , raved itself off ; and now -- must it be confessed ?
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 12]: -- he wished very much for something to eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 20]: He was soon seated by a blazing fire , with a chop and a jug of ale before him .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 4]: AN EVENING LECTURE .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 9]: The Nightmare Shall call thee when it walks .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 2]: MIDDLETON .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 4]: -- The Witch .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 50]: The inn to which Hugh had betaken himself , though not the first in the town , was yet what is called a respectable house , and was possessed of a room of considerable size , in which the farmers of the neighbourhood were accustomed to hold their gatherings .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 45]: While eating his dinner , Hugh learned from the conversation around him -- for he sat in the kitchen for the sake of the fire -- that this room was being got ready for a lecture on Bilology , as the landlady called it .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 28]: Bills in red and blue had been posted all over the town ; and before he had finished his dinner , the audience had begun to arrive .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 48]: Partly from curiosity about a subject of which he knew nothing , and partly because it still rained , and , having got nearly dry , he did not care about a second wetting if he could help it , Hugh resolved to make one of them .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 37]: So he stood by the fire till he was informed that the lecturer had made his appearance , when he went up-stairs , paid his shilling , and was admitted to one of the front seats .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 21]: The room was tolerably lighted with gas ; and a platform had been constructed for the lecturer and his subjects .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 61]: When the place was about half-filled , he came from another room alone -- a little , thick-set , bull-necked man , with vulgar face and rusty black clothes ; and , mounting the platform , commenced his lecture ; if lecture it could be called , in which there seemed to be no order , and scarcely any sequence .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 32]: No attempt even at a theory , showed itself in the mass of what he called facts and scientific truths ; and he perpeturated the most awful blunders in his English .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 17]: It will not be desired that I should give any further account of such a lecture .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 24]: The lecturer himself seemed to depend chiefly for his success , upon the manifestations of his art which he proceeded to bring forward .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 32]: He called his familiar by the name of Willi-am , and a stunted , pale-faced , dull-looking youth started up from somewhere , and scrambled upon the platform beside his master .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 11]: Upon this tutored slave a number of experiments was performed .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 38]: He was first cast into whatever abnormal condition is necessary for the operations of biology , and then compelled to make a fool of himself by exhibiting actions the most inconsistent with his real circumstances and necessities .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 34]: But , aware that all this was open to the most palpable objection of collusion , the operator next invited any of the company that pleased , to submit themselves to his influences .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 25]: After a pause of a few moments , a stout country fellow , florid and healthy , got up and slouched to the platform .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 44]: Certainly , whatever might be the nature of the influence that was brought to bear , its operative power could not , with the least probability , be attributed to an over-activity of imagination in either of the subjects submitted to its exercise .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 53]: In the latter , as well as in the former case , the operator was eminently successful ; and the clown returned to his seat , looking remarkably foolish and conscious of disgrace -- a sufficient voucher to most present , that in this case at least there had been no collusion .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 28]: Several others volunteered their negative services ; but with no one of them did he succeed so well ; and in one case the failure was evident .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 43]: The lecturer pretended to account for this , in making some confused and unintelligible remarks about the state of the weather , the thunder-storm , electricity , & c. , of which things he evidently did not understand the best known laws .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 6]: `` The blundering idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 15]: growled , close to Hugh 's ear , a voice with a foreign accent .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 5]: He looked round sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 24]: A tall , powerful , eminently handsome man , with a face as foreign as his tone and accent , sat beside him .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 18]: `` I beg your pardon , '' he said to Hugh ; `` I thought aloud . ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 24]: `` I should like to know , if you would n't mind telling me , what you detect of the blunderer in him .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 9]: I am quite ignorant of these matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 35]: `` I have had many opportunities of observing them ; and I see at once that this man , though he has the natural power , is excessively ignorant of the whole subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 13]: This was all the answer he vouchsafed to Hugh 's modest inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 18]: Hugh had not yet learned that one will always fare better by concealing than by acknowledging ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 50]: The man , whatever his capacity , who honestly confesses even a partial ignorance , will instantly be treated as more or less incapable , by the ordinary man who has already gained a partial knowledge , or is capable of assuming a knowledge which he does not possess .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 7]: But , for God 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 18]: let the honest and modest man stick to his honesty and modesty , cost what they may .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 16]: Hugh was silent , and fixed his attention once more on what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 16]: But presently he became aware that the foreigner was scrutinizing him with the closest attention .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 33]: He knew this , somehow , without having looked round ; and the knowledge was accompanied with a feeling of discomfort that caused him to make a restless movement on his seat .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 21]: Presently he felt that the annoyance had ceased ; but not many minutes had passed , before it again commenced .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 58]: In order to relieve himself from a feeling which he could only compare to that which might be produced by the presence of the dead , he turned towards his neighbour so suddenly , that it seemed for a moment to embarrass him , his eyes being caught in the very act of devouring the stolen indulgence .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 24]: But the stranger recovered himself instantly with the question : `` Will you permit me to ask of what country you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 30]: Hugh thought he made the request only for the sake of covering his rudeness ; and so merely answered : `` Why , an Englishman , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 11]: yes ; it is not necessary to be told that .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 17]: But it seems to me , from your accent , that you are a Scotchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 6]: `` So I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 5]: `` A Highlander ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 8]: `` I was born in the Highlands .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 35]: But if you are very anxious to know my pedigree , I have no reason for concealing the fact that I am , by birth , half a Scotchman and half a Welchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 43]: The foreigner riveted his gaze , though but for the briefest moment sufficient to justify its being called a gaze , once more upon Hugh ; and then , with a slight bow , as of acquiescence , turned towards the lecturer .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 27]: When the lecture was over , and Hugh was walking away in the midst of the withdrawing audience , the stranger touched him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 22]: `` You said that you would like to know more of this science : will you come to my lodging ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 26]: `` With pleasure , '' Hugh answered ; though the look with which he accompanied the words , must have been one rather of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 12]: `` You are astonished that a stranger should invite you so .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 7]: you English always demand an introduction .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 5]: There is mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 10]: He handed Hugh a card : Herr von Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 10]: Hugh happened to be provided with one in exchange .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 43]: The two walked out of the inn , along the old High Street , full of gables and all the delightful irregularities of an old country-town , till they came to a court , down which Herr von Funkelstein led the way .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 56]: He let himself in with a pass-key at a low door , and then conducted Hugh , by a stair whose narrowness was equalled by its steepness , to a room , which , though not many yards above the level of the court , was yet next to the roof of the low house .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 11]: Hugh could see nothing till his conductor lighted a candle .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 18]: Then he found himself in a rather large room with a shaky floor and a low roof .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 30]: A chintz-curtained bed in one corner had the skin of a tiger thrown over it ; and a table in another had a pair of foils lying upon it .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 24]: The German -- for such he seemed to Hugh -- offered him a chair in the politest manner ; and Hugh sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 25]: `` I am only in lodgings here , '' said the host ; `` so you will forgive the poverty of my establishment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 16]: `` There is no occasion for forgiveness , I assure you , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 25]: `` You wished to know something of the subject with which that lecturer was befooling himself and the audience at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 10]: `` I shall be grateful for any enlightenment . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 20]: it is a subject for the study of a benevolent scholar , not for such a clown as that .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 23]: He jumps at no conclusions ; yet he shares the fate of one who does : he flounders in the mire between .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 19]: No man will make anything of it who has not the benefit of the human race at heart .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 12]: Humanity is the only safe guide in matters such as these .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 11]: This is a dangerous study indeed in unskilful hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 9]: Here a frightful caterwauling interrupted Herr von Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 13]: The room had a storm-window , of which the lattice stood open .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 39]: In front of it , on the roof , seen against a white house opposite , stood a demon of a cat , arched to half its length , with a tail expanded to double its natural thickness .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 9]: Its antagonist was invisible from where Hugh sat .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 57]: Von Funkelstein started up without making the slightest noise , trod as softly as a cat to the table , took up one of the foils , removed the button , and , creeping close to the window , made one rapid pass at the enemy , which vanished with a shriek of hatred and fear .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 20]: He then , replacing the button , laid the foil down , and resumed his seat and his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 26]: This , after dealing with generalities and commonplaces for some time , gave no sign of coming either to an end or to the point .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 22]: All the time he was watching Hugh -- at least so Hugh thought -- as if speculating on him in general .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 26]: Then appearing to have come to some conclusion , he gave his mind more to his talk , and encouraged Hugh to speak as well .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 9]: The conversation lasted for nearly half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 28]: At its close , Hugh felt that the stranger had touched upon a variety of interesting subjects , as one possessed of a minute knowledge of them .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 15]: But he did not feel that he had gained any insight from his conversation .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 23]: It seemed rather as if he had been giving him a number of psychological , social , literary , and scientific receipts .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 47]: During the course of the talk , his eye had appeared to rest on Hugh by a kind of compulsion ; as if by its own will it would have retired from the scrutiny , but the will of its owner was too strong for it .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 24]: It seemed , in relation to him , to be only a kind of tool , which he used for a particular purpose .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 44]: At length Funkelstein rose , and , marching across the room to a cupboard , brought out a bottle and glasses , saying , in the most by-the-bye way , as he went : `` Have you the second-sight , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 12]: `` Certainly not , as far as I am aware . ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 11]: the Welch do have it , do they not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 10]: yes , of course , '' answered Hugh laughing .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 26]: `` I should like to know , though , '' he added , `` whether they inherit the gift as Celts or as mountaineers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 10]: `` Will you take a glass of -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 13]: `` Of nothing , thank you , '' answered and interrupted Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 10]: `` It is time for me to be going .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 11]: Indeed , I fear I have stayed too long already .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 8]: Good night , Herr von Funkelstein . ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 13]: `` You will allow me the honour of returning your visit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 21]: Hugh felt he could do no less , although he had not the smallest desire to keep up the acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 7]: He wrote Arnstead on his card .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 14]: As he left the house , he stumbled over something in the court .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 13]: Looking down , he saw it was a cat , apparently dead .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 14]: `` Can it be the cat Herr Funkelstein made the pass at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 3]: thought he .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 23]: But presently he forgot all about it , in the visions of Euphra which filled his mind during his moonlight walk home .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 33]: It just occurred to him , however , before those visions had blotted everything else from his view , that he had learned simply nothing whatever about biology from his late host .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 32]: When he reached home , he was admitted by the butler , and retired to bed at once , where he slept soundly , for the first time for many nights .
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 35]: But , as he drew near his own room , he might have seen , though he saw not , a little white figure gliding away in the far distance of the long passage .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 26]: It was only Harry , who could not lie still in his bed , till he knew that his big brother was safe at home .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 4]: ANOTHER EVENING LECTURE .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 13]: This Eneas is come to Paradise Out of the swolowe of Hell .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 2]: CHAUCER .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 5]: -- Legend of Dido .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 25]: The next day , Hugh was determined to find or make an opportunity of speaking to Euphra ; and fortune seemed to favour him .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 16]: -- Or was it Euphra herself , in one or other of her inexplicable moods ?
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 30]: At all events , she had that morning allowed the ladies and her uncle to go without her ; and Hugh met her as he went to his study .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 11]: `` May I speak to you for one moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 10]: said he , hurriedly , and with trembling lips .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 30]: `` Yes , certainly , '' she replied with a smile , and a glance in his face as of wonder as to what could trouble him so much .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 18]: Then turning , and leading the way , she said : `` Come into my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 4]: He followed her .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 15]: She turned and shut the door , which he had left open behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 14]: He almost knelt to her ; but something held him back from that .
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 17]: `` Euphra , '' he said , `` what have I done to offend you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 4]: `` Offend me !
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 3]: Nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 11]: -- This was uttered in a perfect tone of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 24]: `` How is it that you avoid me as you do , and will not allow me one moment 's speech with you ?
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 8]: You are driving me to distraction . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 8]: `` Why , you foolish man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 27]: she answered , half playfully , pressing the palms of her little hands together , and looking up in his face , `` how can I ?
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 17]: Do n't you see how those two dear old ladies swallow me up in their faddles ?
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 6]: I wish they would go .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 13]: Then it would be all right again -- would n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 10]: But Hugh was not to be so easily satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 15]: `` Before they came , ever since that night -- '' `` Hush-sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 38]: she interrupted , putting her finger on his lips , and looking hurriedly round her with an air of fright , of which he could hardly judge whether it was real or assumed -- `` hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 13]: Comforted wondrously by the hushing finger , Hugh would yet understand more .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 39]: `` I am no baby , dear Euphra , '' he said , taking hold of the hand to which the finger belonged , and laying it on his mouth ; `` do not make one of me .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 17]: There is some mystery in all this -- at least something I do not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 11]: `` I will tell you all about it one day .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 38]: But , seriously , you must be careful how you behave to me ; for if my uncle should , but for one moment , entertain a suspicion -- good-bye to you -- perhaps good-bye to Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 18]: All my influence with him comes from his thinking that I like him better than anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 11]: So you must not make the poor old man jealous .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 33]: By the bye , '' she went on -- rapidly , as if she would turn the current of the conversation aside -- `` what a favourite you have grown with him !
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 13]: You should have heard him talk of you to the old ladies .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 8]: I might well be jealous of you .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 9]: There never was a tutor like his . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 26]: Hugh 's heart smote him that the praise of even this common man , proud of his own vanity , should be undeserved by him .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 27]: He was troubled , too , at the flippancy with which Euphra spoke ; yet not the less did he feel that he loved her passionately .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 23]: `` I daresay , '' he replied , `` he praised me as he would anything else that happened to be his .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 16]: Is n't that old bay horse of his the best hack in the county ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 5]: `` You naughty man !
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 8]: Are you going to be satirical ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: `` You claim that as your privilege , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 5]: `` Worse and worse !
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 7]: I will not talk to you .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 20]: But , seriously , for I must go -- bring your Italian to -- to -- '' She hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 9]: `` To the library -- why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 3]: suggested Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 16]: `` No-o , '' she answered , shaking her head , and looking quite solemn .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 10]: `` Well , will you come to my study ?
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 7]: Will that please you better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 15]: `` Yes , I will , '' she answered , with a definitive tone .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 6]: `` Good-bye , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 22]: She opened the door , and having looked out to see that no one was passing , told him to go .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 17]: As he went , he felt as if the oaken floor were elastic beneath his tread .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 23]: It was sometime after the household had retired , however , before Euphra made her appearance at the door of his study .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 24]: She seemed rather shy of entering , and hesitated , as if she felt she was doing something she ought not to do .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 32]: But as soon as she had entered , and the door was shut , she appeared to recover herself quite ; and they sat down at the table with their books .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 13]: They could not get on very well with their reading , however .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 31]: Hugh often forgot what he was about , in looking at her ; and she seemed nowise inclined to avert his gazes , or check the growth of his admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 37]: Rather abruptly , but apparently starting from some suggestion in the book , she said to him : `` By the bye , has Mr. Arnold ever said anything to you about the family jewels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 6]: `` Are there many ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 7]: `` Yes , a great many .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 29]: Mr. Arnold is very proud of them , as well as of the portraits ; so he treats them in the same way -- keeps them locked up .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 23]: Indeed he seldom allows them to see daylight , except it be as a mark of especial favour to some one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 9]: `` I should like much to see them .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 8]: I have always been curious about stones .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 10]: They are wonderful , mysterious things to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 14]: Euphra gave him a very peculiar , searching glance , as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 22]: `` Shall I , '' he continued , `` give him a hint that I should like to see them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 20]: `` By no means , '' answered Euphra , emphatically , `` except he should refer to them himself .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 15]: He is very jealous of his possessions -- his family possessions , I mean .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 4]: Poor old man !
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 14]: he has not much else to plume himself upon ; has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 10]: `` He is kind to you , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 12]: She looked at him as if she did not understand him .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 4]: What then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 11]: `` You ought not to be unkind to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 5]: `` You odd creature !
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 7]: I am not unkind to him .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 4]: I like him .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 10]: But we are not getting on with our reading .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 10]: What could have led me to talk about family-jewels ?
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 3]: I see .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 10]: What a strange thing the association of ideas is !
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 13]: There is not a very obvious connexion here ; is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 8]: One can not account for such things .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 12]: The links in the chain of ideas are sometimes slender enough .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 19]: Yet the slenderest is sufficient to enable the electric flash of thought to pass along the line . ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 7]: She seemed pondering for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 13]: `` That strikes me as a fine simile , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 10]: `` You ought to be a poet yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 5]: Hugh made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 16]: `` I daresay you have hundreds of poems in that old desk , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 11]: `` I think they might be counted by tens . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 8]: `` Do let me see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 9]: `` You would not care for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 8]: `` Would n't I , Hugh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 15]: `` I will , on one condition -- two conditions , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 6]: `` What are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 11]: `` One is , that you show me yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 4]: `` Mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 8]: `` Who told you I wrote verses ?
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 5]: That silly boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 12]: `` No -- I saw your verses before I saw you .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 4]: You remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 12]: `` It was very dishonourable in you to read them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 8]: `` I only saw they were verses .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 8]: I did not read a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 7]: `` I forgive you , then .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 20]: You must show me yours first , till I see whether I could venture to let you see mine .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 15]: If yours were very bad indeed , then I might risk showing mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 16]: And much more of this sort , with which I will not weary my readers .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 21]: It ended in Hugh 's taking from the old escritoire a bundle of papers , and handing them to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 17]: But the reader need not fear that I am going to print any of these verses .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 16]: I have more respect for my honest prose page than to break it up so .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 17]: Indeed , the whole of this interview might have been omitted , but for two circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 32]: One of them was , that in getting these papers , Hugh had to open a concealed portion of the escritoire , which his mathematical knowledge had enabled him to discover .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 14]: It had evidently not been opened for many years before he found it .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 20]: He had made use of it to hold the only treasures he had -- poor enough treasures , certainly !
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 25]: Not a loving note , not a lock of hair even had he -- nothing but the few cobwebs spun from his own brain .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 20]: It is true , we are rich or poor according to what we are , not what we have .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 13]: But what a man has produced , is not what he is .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 10]: He may even impoverish his true self by production .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 16]: When Euphra saw him open this place , she uttered a suppressed cry of astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 16]: said Hugh , `` you did not know of this hidie-hole , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 7]: `` Indeed , I did not .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 25]: I had used the desk myself , for this was a favourite room of mine before you came , but I never found that .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 3]: Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 5]: Let me look . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 22]: She put her hand on his shoulder and leaned over him , as he pointed out the way of opening it .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 9]: `` Did you find nothing in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 11]: she said , with a slight tremour in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 5]: `` Nothing whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 8]: `` There may be more places . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 12]: I have accounted for the whole bulk , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 5]: `` How strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 15]: `` But now you must give me my guerdon , '' said Hugh timidly .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 41]: The fact was , the poor youth had bargained , in a playful manner , and yet with an earnest , covetous heart , for one , the first kiss , in return for the poems she begged to see .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 7]: She turned her face towards him .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 26]: The second circumstance which makes the interview worth recording is , that , at this moment , three distinct knocks were heard on the window .
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 14]: They sprang asunder , and saw each other 's face pale as death .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 15]: In Euphra 's , the expression of fright was mingled with one of annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 15]: Hugh , though his heart trembled like a bird , leaped to the window .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 23]: Nothing was to be seen but the trees that `` stretched their dark arms '' within a few feet of the oriel .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 27]: Turning again towards Euphra , he found , to his mortification , that she had vanished -- and had left the packet of poems behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 30]: He replaced them in their old quarters in the escritoire ; and his vague dismay at the unaccountable noises , was drowned in the bitter waters of miserable humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 11]: He slept at last , from the exhaustion of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 29]: When he awoke , however , he tried to persuade himself that he had made far too much of the trifling circumstance of her leaving the verses behind .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 6]: For was she not terrified ?
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 17]: -- Why , then , did she leave him and go alone to her own room ?
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 24]: -- She must have felt that she ought not to be in his , at that hour , and therefore dared not stay .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 5]: -- Why dared not ?
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 13]: Did she think the house was haunted by a ghost of propriety ?
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 15]: What rational theory could he invent to account for the strange and repeated sounds ?
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 14]: -- He puzzled himself over it to the verge of absolute intellectual prostration .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 21]: He was generally the first in the breakfast-room ; that is , after Euphra , who was always the first .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 26]: She went up to him as he entered , and said , almost in a whisper : `` Have you got the poems for me ?
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 3]: Hugh hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 5]: She looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 9]: `` No , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 8]: -- `` You never wanted them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 17]: `` That is very unkind ; when you know I was frightened out of my wits .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 6]: Do give me them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 8]: `` They are not worth giving you .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: Besides , I have not got them .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 9]: I do n't carry them in my pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 6]: They are in the escritoire .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 8]: I could n't leave them lying about .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 5]: Never mind them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 20]: `` I have a right to them , '' she said , looking up at him slyly and shyly .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 17]: `` Well , I gave you them , and you did not think them worth keeping .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 9]: I kept my part of the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 4]: She looked annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 30]: `` Never mind , dear Euphra ; you shall have them , or anything else I have ; -- the brain that made them , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 17]: `` Was it only the brain that had to do with the making of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 13]: `` Perhaps the heart too ; but you have that already . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 8]: Her face flushed like a damask rose .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 13]: At that moment Mrs. Elton entered , and looked a little surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 37]: Euphra instantly said : `` I think it is rather too bad of you , Mr. Sutherland , to keep the poor boy so hard to his work , when you know he is not strong .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 31]: Mrs. Elton , I have been begging a holiday for poor Harry , to let him go with us to Wotton House ; but he has such a hard task-master !
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 8]: He will not hear of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 25]: The flush , which she could not get rid of all at once , was thus made to do duty as one of displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 16]: Mrs. Elton was thoroughly deceived , and united her entreaties to those of Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 17]: Hugh was compelled to join in the deception , and pretend to yield a slow consent .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 16]: Thus a holiday was extemporised for Harry , subject to the approbation of his father .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 34]: This was readily granted ; and Mr. Arnold , turning to Hugh , said : `` You will have nothing to do , Mr. Sutherland : had you not better join us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 17]: `` With pleasure , '' replied he ; `` but the carriage will be full . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 8]: `` You can take your horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 6]: `` Thank you very much .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 4]: I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 22]: The day was delightful ; one of those grey summer-days , that are far better for an excursion than bright ones .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 82]: In the best of spirits , mounted on a good horse , riding alongside of the carriage in which was the lady who was all womankind to him , and who , without taking much notice of him , yet contrived to throw him a glance now and then , Hugh would have been overflowingly happy , but for an unquiet , distressed feeling , which all the time made him aware of the presence of a sick conscience somewhere within .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 38]: Mr. Arnold was exceedingly pleasant , for he was much taken with the sweetness and modesty of Lady Emily , who , having no strong opinions upon anything , received those of Mr. Arnold with attentive submission .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 32]: He saw , or fancied he saw in her , a great resemblance to his deceased wife , to whom he had been as sincerely attached as his nature would allow .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 29]: In fact , Lady Emily advanced so rapidly in his good graces , that either Euphra was , or thought fit to appear , rather jealous of her .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 21]: She paid her every attention , however , and seemed to gratify Mr. Arnold by her care of the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 29]: She even joined in the entreaties which , on their way home , he made with evident earnestness , for an extension of their visit to a month .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 21]: Lady Emily was already so much better for the change , that Mrs. Elton made no objection to the proposal .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 22]: Euphra gave Hugh one look of misery , and , turning again , insisted with increased warmth on their immediate consent .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 11]: It was gained without much difficulty before they reached home .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 61]: Harry , too , was captivated by the gentle kindness of Lady Emily , and hardly took his eyes off her all the way ; while , on the other hand , his delicate little attentions had already gained the heart of good Mrs. Elton , who from the first had remarked and pitied the sad looks of the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 8]: A NEW VISITOR AND AN OLD ACQUAINTANCE .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 21]: He 's enough To bring a woman to confusion , More than a wiser man , or a far greater .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 2]: MIDDLETON .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 4]: -- The Witch .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 20]: When they reached the lodge , Lady Emily expressed a wish to walk up the avenue to the house .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 7]: To this Mr. Arnold gladly consented .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 23]: The carriage was sent round the back way ; and Hugh , dismounting , gave his horse to the footman in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 56]: As they drew near the house , the rest of the party having stopped to look at an old tree which was a favourite with its owner , Hugh and Harry were some yards in advance ; when the former spied , approaching them from the house , the distinguished figure of Herr von Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 42]: Saluting as they met , the visitor informed Hugh that he had just been leaving his card for him , and would call some other morning soon ; for , as he was rusticating , he had little to occupy him .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 31]: Hugh turned with him towards the rest of the party , who were now close at hand ; when Funkelstein exclaimed , in a tone of surprise , `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 5]: Miss Cameron here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 14]: and advanced with a profound obeisance , holding his hat in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 67]: Hugh thought he saw her look annoyed ; but she held out her hand to him , and , in a voice indicating -- still as it appeared to Hugh -- some reluctance , introduced him to her uncle , with the words : `` We met at Sir Edward Laston 's , when I was visiting Mrs. Elkingham , two years ago , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 12]: Mr. Arnold lifted his hat and bowed politely to the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 54]: Had Euphra informed him that , although a person of considerable influence in Sir Edward 's household , Herr von Funkelstein had his standing there only as Sir Edward 's private secretary , Mr. Arnold 's aversion to foreigners generally would not have been so scrupulously banished into the background of his behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 60]: Ordinary civilities passed between them , marked by an air of flattering deference on Funkelstein 's part , which might have been disagreeable to a man less uninterruptedly conscious of his own importance than Mr. Arnold ; and the new visitor turned once more , as if forgetful of his previous direction , and accompanied them towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 41]: Before they reached it he had , even in that short space , ingratiated himself so far with Mr. Arnold , that he asked him to stay and dine with them -- an invitation which was accepted with manifest pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 22]: `` Mr. Sutherland , '' said Mr. Arnold , `` will you show your friend anything worth note about the place ?
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 21]: He has kindly consented to dine with us ; and in the meantime I have some letters to write . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 8]: `` With pleasure , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 42]: But all this time he had been inwardly commenting on the appearance of his friend , as Mr. Arnold called him , with the jealousy of a youth in love ; for was not Funkelstein an old acquaintance of Miss Cameron ?
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 13]: What might not have passed between them in that old hidden time ?
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 15]: -- for love is jealous of the past as well as of the future .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 28]: Love , as well as metaphysics , has a lasting quarrel with time and space : the lower love fears them , while the higher defies them .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 19]: -- And he could not help seeing that Funkelstein was one to win favour in ladies ' eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 37]: Very regular features and a dark complexion were lighted up by eyes as black as Euphra 's , and capable of a wonderful play of light ; while his form was remarkable for strength and symmetry .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 12]: Hugh felt that in any company he would attract immediate attention .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 35]: His long dark beard , of which just the centre was removed to expose a finely-turned chin , blew over each shoulder as often as they met the wind in going round the house .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 39]: From what I have heard of him from other deponents besides Hugh , I should judge that he did well to conceal the lines of his mouth in a long moustache , which flowed into his bifurcated beard .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 21]: He had just enough of the foreign in his dress to add to the appearance of fashion which it bore .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 19]: As they walked , Hugh could not help observing an odd peculiarity in the carriage of his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 57]: It was , that , every few steps , he gave a backward and downward glance to the right , with a sweeping bend of his body , as if he were trying to get a view of the calf of his leg , or as if he fancied he felt something trailing at his foot .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 41]: So probable , from his motion , did the latter supposition seem , that Hugh changed sides to satisfy himself whether or not there was some dragging briar or straw annoying him ; but no follower was to be discovered .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 29]: `` You are a happy man , Mr. Sutherland , '' said the guest , `` to live under the same roof with that beautiful Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 5]: `` Am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 21]: thought Hugh ; but he only said , affecting some surprise : `` Do you think her so beautiful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 18]: Funkelstein 's eyes were fixed upon him , as if to see the effect of his remark .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 17]: Hugh felt them , and could not conform his face to the indifference of his words .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 28]: But his companion only answered indifferently : `` Well , I should say so ; but beauty is not , that is not beauty for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 18]: Whether or not there was poison in the fork of this remark , Hugh could only conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 5]: He made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 32]: As they walked about the precincts of the house , Funkelstein asked many questions of Hugh , which his entire ignorance of domestic architecture made it impossible for him to answer .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 50]: This seemed only to excite the questioner 's desire for information to a higher pitch ; and as if the very stones could reply to his demands , he examined the whole range of the various buildings constituting the house of Arnstead `` as he would draw it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 23]: `` Certainly , '' said he , `` there is at least variety enough in the style of this mass of material .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 8]: There is enough for one pyramid . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 17]: `` That would be rather at the expense of the variety , would it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 18]: said Hugh , in spiteful response to the inconsequence of the second member of Funkelstein 's remark .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 29]: But the latter was apparently too much absorbed in his continued inspection of the house , from every attainable point of near view , to heed the comment .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 13]: `` This they call the Ghost 's Walk , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 11]: about these old houses there are always such tales . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 10]: `` What sort of tales do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 10]: `` I mean of particular spots and their ghosts .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 8]: You must have heard many such ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 17]: `` No , not I. '' `` I think Germany is more prolific of such stories .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 7]: I could tell you plenty . ''
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 12]: `` But you do n't mean you believe such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 7]: `` To me it is equal .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 11]: I look at them entirely as objects of art . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 12]: `` That is a new view of a ghost to me .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 5]: An object of art ?
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 15]: I should have thought them considerably more suitable objects previous to their disembodiment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 5]: you do not understand .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 14]: You call art painting , do n't you -- or sculpture at most ?
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 10]: I give up sculpture certainly -- and painting too .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 15]: But do n't you think a ghost a very effective object in literature now ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 12]: Confess : do you not like a ghost-story very much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 12]: `` Yes , if it is a very good one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 5]: `` Hamlet now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 11]: we do n't speak of Shakspere 's plays as stories .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 35]: His characters are so real to us , that , in thinking of their development , we go back even to their fathers and mothers -- and sometimes even speculate about their future . ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 9]: `` You islanders are always in earnest somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 5]: So are we Germans .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 6]: We are all one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 20]: `` I hope you can be in earnest about dinner , then , for I hear the bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 11]: `` We must render ourselves in the drawing-room , then ?
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 12]: When they entered the drawing-room , they found Miss Cameron alone .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 26]: Funkelstein advanced , and addressed a few words to her in German , which Hugh 's limited acquaintance with the language prevented him from catching .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 71]: At the same moment , Mr. Arnold entered , and Funkelstein , turning to him immediately , proceeded , as if by way of apology for speaking in an unknown tongue , to interpret for Mr. Arnold 's benefit : `` I have just been telling Miss Cameron in the language of my country , how much better she looks than when I saw her at Sir Edward Lastons . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 18]: `` I know I was quite a scare-crow then , '' said Euphra , attempting to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 14]: `` And now you are quite a decoy-duck , eh , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 27]: said Mr. Arnold , laughing in reality at his own joke , which put him in great good-humour for the whole time of dinner and dessert .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 18]: `` Thank you , uncle , '' said Euphra , with a prettily pretended affectation of humility .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 20]: Then she added gaily : `` When did you rise on our Sussex horizon , Herr von Funkelstein ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 57]: I have been in the neighbourhood for a few days ; but I owe my meeting with you to one of those coincidences which , were they not so pleasant -- to me in this case , at least -- one would think could only result from the blundering of old Dame Nature over her knitting .
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 34]: If I had not had the good fortune to meet Mr. Sutherland the other evening , I should have remained in utter ignorance of your neighbourhood and my own felicity , Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 13]: Indeed , I called now to see him , not you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 14]: Hugh saw Mr. Arnold looking rather doubtful of the foreigner 's fine speeches .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 4]: Dinner was announced .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 25]: Funkelstein took Miss Cameron , Hugh Mrs. Elton , and Mr. Arnold followed with Lady Emily , who would never precede her older friend .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 13]: Hugh tried to talk to Mrs. Elton , but with meagre success .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 34]: He was suddenly a nobody , and felt more than he had felt for a long time what , in his present deteriorated moral state , he considered the degradation of his position .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 27]: A gulf seemed to have suddenly yawned between himself and Euphra , and the loudest voice of his despairing agony could not reach across that gulf .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 36]: An awful conviction awoke within him , that the woman he worshipped would scarcely receive his worship at the worth of incense now ; and yet in spirit he fell down grovelling before his idol .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 26]: The words `` euphrasy and rue '' kept ringing in his brain , coming over and over with an awful mingling of chime and toll .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 25]: When he thought about it afterwards , he seemed to have been a year in crossing the hall with Mrs. Elton on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 70]: But as if divining his thoughts -- just as they passed through the dining-room door , Euphra looked round at him , almost over Funkelstein 's shoulder , and , without putting into her face the least expression discernible by either of the others following , contrived to banish for the time all Hugh 's despair , and to convince him that he had nothing to fear from Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 10]: How it was done Hugh himself could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 8]: He could not even recall the look .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 27]: He only knew that he had been as miserable as one waking in his coffin , and that now he was out in the sunny air .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 20]: During dinner , Funkelstein paid no very particular attention to Euphrasia , but was remarkably polite to Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 38]: She seemed hardly to know how to receive his attentions , but to regard him as a strange animal , which she did not know how to treat , and of which she was a little afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 53]: Mrs. Elton , on the contrary , appeared to be delighted with his behaviour and conversation ; for , without showing the least originality , he yet had seen so much , and knew so well how to bring out what he had seen , that he was a most interesting companion .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 25]: Hugh took little share in the conversation beyond listening as well as he could , to prevent himself from gazing too much at Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 16]: `` Had Mr. Sutherland and you been old acquaintances then , Herr von Funkelstein ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 18]: asked Mr. Arnold , reverting to the conversation which had been interrupted by the announcement of dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 9]: We met quite accidentally , and introduced ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 16]: I believe a thunderstorm and a lecture on biology were the mediating parties between us .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 9]: Was it not so , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 10]: `` I beg your pardon , '' stammered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 16]: But Mr. Arnold interposed : `` A lecture on what , did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 5]: `` On biology . ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 5]: Mr. Arnold looked posed .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 30]: He did not like to say he did not know what the word meant ; for , like many more ignorant men , he thought such a confession humiliating .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 7]: Von Funkelstein hastened to his relief .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 17]: `` It would be rather surprising if you were acquainted with the subject , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 21]: I fear to explain it to you , lest both Mr. Sutherland and myself should sink irrecoverably in your estimation .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 13]: But young men want to know all that is going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 32]: Herr Funkelstein was not exactly what one would call a young man ; but , as he chose to do so himself , there was no one to dispute the classification .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 12]: of course , '' replied Mr. Arnold ; `` quite right .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 10]: What , then , pray , is biology ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 26]: `` A science , falsely so called , '' said Hugh , who , waking up a little , wanted to join in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: `` What does the word mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 4]: said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 12]: Von Funkelstein answered at once : `` The science of life .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 21]: But I must say , the name , as now applied , is no indication of the thing signified . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 15]: `` How , then , is a gentleman to know what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 23]: said Mr. Arnold , half pettishly , and forgetting that his knowledge had not extended even to the interpretation of the name .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 18]: `` It is one of the sciences , true or false , connected with animal magnetism . ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 4]: `` Bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 7]: exclaimed Mr. Arnold , rather rudely .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 18]: `` You would have said so , if you had heard the lecture , '' said Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 15]: The conversation had not taken this turn till quite late in the dining ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 15]: Euphra rose to go ; and Hugh remarked that her face was dreadfully pale .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 9]: But she walked steadily out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 15]: This interrupted the course of the talk , and the subject was not resumed .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 18]: Immediately after tea , which was served very soon , Funkelstein took his leave of the ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 26]: `` We shall be glad to see you often while in this neighbourhood , '' said Mr. Arnold , as he bade him good night .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 25]: `` I shall , without fail , do myself the honour of calling again soon , '' replied he , and bowed himself out .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 50]: Lady Emily , evidently relieved by his departure , rose , and , approaching Euphra , said , in a sweet coaxing tone , which even she could hardly have resisted : `` Dear Miss Cameron , you promised to sing , for me in particular , some evening .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 10]: May I claim the fulfilment of your promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 21]: Euphra had recovered her complexion , and she too seemed to Hugh to be relieved by the departure of Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 11]: `` Certainly , '' she answered , rising at once .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 7]: `` What shall I sing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 6]: Hugh was all ear now .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 9]: `` Something sacred , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 7]: Euphra hesitated , but not long .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 12]: `` Shall I sing Mozart 's Agnus Dei , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 7]: Lady Emily hesitated in her turn .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 7]: `` I should prefer something else .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 16]: I do n't approve of singing popish music , however beautiful it may be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 9]: `` Well , what shall it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 9]: `` Something of Handel or Mendelssohn , please .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 14]: Do you sing , ' I know that my Redeemer liveth ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 22]: `` I daresay I can sing it , '' replied Euphra , with some petulance ; and went to the piano .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 33]: This was a favourite air with Hugh ; and he placed himself so as to see the singer without being seen himself , and to lose no slightest modulation of her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 17]: But what was his disappointment to find that oratorio-music was just what Euphra was incapable of !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 16]: No doubt she sang it quite correctly ; but there was no religion in it .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 8]: Not a single tone worshipped or rejoiced .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 31]: The quality of sound necessary to express the feeling and thought of the composer was lacking : the palace of sound was all right constructed , but of wrong material .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 10]: Euphra , however , was quite unconscious of failure .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 45]: She did not care for the music ; but she attributed her lack of interest in it to the music itself , never dreaming that , in fact , she had never really heard it , having no inner ear for its deeper harmonies .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 36]: As soon as she had finished , Lady Emily thanked her , but did not praise her more than by saying : `` I wish I had a voice like yours , Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 17]: `` I daresay you have a better of your own , '' said Euphra , falsely .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 4]: Lady Emily laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 29]: `` It is the poorest little voice you ever heard ; yet I confess I am glad , for my own sake , that I have even that .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 11]: What should I do if I never heard Handel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 26]: Every simple mind has a little well of beauty somewhere in its precincts , which flows and warbles , even when the owner is unheedful .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 30]: The religion of Lady Emily had led her into a region far beyond the reach of her intellect , in which there sprang a constant fountain of sacred song .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: To it she owed her highest moods .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 8]: `` Then Handel is your musician ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 3]: said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 12]: `` You should not have put me to such a test .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 11]: It was very unfair of you , Lady Emily . ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: Lady Emily laughed , as if quite amused at the idea of having done Euphra any wrong .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 12]: Euphra added : `` You must sing now , Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 14]: You can not refuse , after the admission you have just made . ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 17]: `` I confess it is only fair ; but I warn you to expect nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 17]: She took her place at the piano , and sang -- He shall feed his flock .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 56]: Her health had improved so much during her sojourn at Arnstead , that , when she began to sing , the quantity of her voice surprised herself ; but after all , it was a poor voice ; and the execution , if clear of any great faults , made no other pretence to merit .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 25]: Yet she effected the end of the music , the very result which every musician would most desire , wherein Euphra had failed utterly .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 18]: This was worthy of note , and Hugh was not even yet too blind to perceive it .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 75]: Lady Emily , with very ordinary intellect , and paltry religious opinions , yet because she was good herself , and religious -- could , in the reproduction of the highest kind of music , greatly surpass the spirited , intellectual musician , whose voice was as superior to hers as a nightingale 's to a sparrow 's , and whose knowledge of music and musical power generally , surpassed hers beyond all comparison .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 19]: It must be allowed for Euphra , that she seemed to have gained some perception of the fact .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 42]: Perhaps she had seen signs of emotion in Hugh 's face , which he had shaded with his hand as Lady Emily sang ; or perhaps the singing produced in her a feeling which she had not had when singing herself .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 112]: All I know is , that the same night -- while Hugh was walking up and down his room , meditating on this defect of Euphra 's , and yet feeling that if she could sing only devil 's music , he must love her -- a tap came to the door which made him start with the suggestion of the former mysterious noises of a similar kind ; that he sprang to the door ; and that , instead of looking out on a vacant corridor , as he all but anticipated , he saw Euphra standing there in the dark -- who said in a whisper : `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 20]: you do not love me any longer , because Lady Emily can sing psalms better than I can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 10]: There was both pathos and spite in the speech .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 7]: `` Come in , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 15]: I am afraid I have been very naughty in coming here at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 5]: `` Do come in .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 11]: I want you to tell me something about Funkelstein . ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 10]: `` What do you want to know about him ?
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 8]: I suppose you are jealous of him .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 15]: you men can both be jealous and make jealous at the same moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 6]: A little broken sigh followed .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 14]: Hugh answered : `` I only want to know what he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 7]: some twentieth cousin of mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 9]: `` Mr. Arnold does not know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 2]: no .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 18]: It is so far off I ca n't count it , In fact I doubt it altogether .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 7]: It must date centuries back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 17]: `` His intimacy , then , is not to be accounted for by his relationship ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 2]: ah !
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 4]: I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 7]: Jealous of the poor count ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 4]: `` Count ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 4]: `` Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 5]: what does it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 22]: He does n't like to be called Count , because all foreigners are counts or barons , or something equally distinguished .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 10]: I ought n't to have let it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 7]: Tell me something about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 6]: `` He is a Bohemian .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 14]: I met him first , some years ago , on the continent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 16]: `` Then that was not your first meeting -- at Sir Edward Laston 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 7]: `` How candid she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 3]: thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 21]: `` He calls me his cousin ; but if he be mine , he is yet more Mr. Arnold 's .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 9]: But he does not want it mentioned yet .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 10]: I am sure I do n't know why . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 9]: `` Is he in love with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 7]: `` How can I tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 4]: she answered archly .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 7]: `` By his being very jealous ?
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 15]: Is that the way to know whether a man is in love with one ?
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 24]: But if he is in love with me , it does not follow that I am in love with him -- does it ?
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 2]: Confess .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 13]: Am I not very good to answer all your impertinent downright questions ?
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 19]: They are as point blank as the church-catechism ; -- mind , I do n't say as rude .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 15]: -- How can I be in love with two at -- a -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 6]: She seemed to cheek herself .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 13]: But Hugh had heard enough -- as she had intended he should .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 30]: She turned instantly , and sped -- surrounded by the `` low melodious thunder '' of her silken garments -- to her own door , where she vanished noiselessly .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 8]: `` What care I for oratorios ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 15]: said Hugh to himself , as he put the light out , towards morning .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 7]: Where was all this to end ?
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 7]: What goal had Hugh set himself ?
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 34]: Could he not go away , and achieve renown in one of many ways , and return fit , in the eyes of the world , to claim the hand of Miss Cameron ?
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 9]: But would he marry her if he could ?
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 7]: He would not answer the question .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 17]: He closed the ears of his heart to it , and tried to go to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 11]: He slept , and dreamed of Margaret in the storm .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 12]: A few days passed without anything occurring sufficiently marked for relation .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 10]: Euphra and he seemed satisfied without meeting in private .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 34]: Perhaps both were afraid of carrying it too far ; at least , too far to keep clear of the risk of discovery , seeing that danger was at present greater than usual .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 21]: Mr. Arnold continued to be thoroughly attentive to his guests , and became more and more devoted to Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 28]: There was no saying where it might end ; for he was not an old man yet , and Lady Emily appeared to have no special admirers .
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 24]: Arnstead was such an abode , and surrounded with such an estate , as few even of the nobility could call their own .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 26]: And a reminiscence of his first wife seemed to haunt all Mr. Arnold 's contemplations of Lady Emily , and all his attentions to her .
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 25]: These were delicate in the extreme , evidently bringing out the best life that yet remained in a heart that was almost a fossil .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 36]: Hugh made some fresh efforts to do his duty by Harry , and so far succeeded , that at least the boy made some progress -- evident enough to the moderate expectations of his father .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 35]: But what helped Harry as much as anything , was the motherly kindness , even tenderness , of good Mrs. Elton , who often had him to sit with her in her own room .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 15]: To her he generally fled for refuge , when he felt deserted and lonely .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 4]: MATERIALISM alias GHOST-HUNTING .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 22]: Wie der Mond sich leuchtend dränget Durch den dunkeln Wolkenflor , Also taucht aus dunkeln Zeiten Mir ein lichtes Bild hervor .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 28]: HEINRICH HEINE As the moon her face advances Through the darkened cloudy veil ; So , from darkened times arising , Dawns on me a vision pale .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 55]: In consequence of what Euphra had caused him to believe without saying it , Hugh felt more friendly towards his new acquaintance ; and happening -- on his side at least it did happen -- to meet him a few days after , walking in the neighbourhood , he joined him in a stroll .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 24]: Mr. Arnold met them on horseback , and invited Von Funkelstein to dine with them that evening , to which he willingly consented .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 30]: It was noticeable that no sooner was the count within the doors of Arnstead House , than he behaved with cordiality to every one of the company except Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 23]: With him he made no approach to familiarity of any kind , treating him , on the contrary , with studious politeness .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 41]: In the course of the dinner , Mr. Arnold said : `` It is curious , Herr von Funkelstein , how often , if you meet with something new to you , you fall in with it again almost immediately .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 20]: I found an article on Biology in the newspaper , the very day after our conversation on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 29]: But absurd as the whole thing is , it is quite surpassed by a letter in to-day 's Times about spirit-rapping and mediums , and what not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 27]: This observation of the host at once opened the whole question of those physico-psychological phenomena to which the name of spiritualism has been so absurdly applied .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 22]: Mr. Arnold was profound in his contempt of the whole system , if not very profound in his arguments against it .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 30]: Every one had something to remark in opposition to the notions which were so rapidly gaining ground in the country , except Funkelstein , who maintained a rigid silence .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 40]: This silence could not continue long without attracting the attention of the rest of the party ; upon which Mr. Arnold said : `` You have not given us your opinion on the subject , Herr von Funkelstein . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 31]: `` I have not , Mr. Arnold ; -- I should not like to encounter the opposition of so many fair adversaries , as well as of my host . ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 20]: `` We are in England , sir ; and every man is at liberty to say what he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 15]: For my part , I think it all absurd , if not improper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 12]: `` I would not willingly differ from you , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 52]: And I confess that a great deal that finds its way into the public prints , does seem very ridiculous indeed ; but I am bound , for truth 's sake , to say , that I have seen more than I can account for , in that kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 49]: There are strange stories connected with my own family , which , perhaps , incline me to believe in the supernatural ; and , indeed , without making the smallest pretence to the dignity of what they call a medium , I have myself had some curious experiences .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 12]: I fear I have some natural proclivity towards what you despise .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 48]: But I beg that my statement of my own feelings on the subject , may not interfere in the least with the prosecution of the present conversation ; for I am quite capable of drawing pleasure from listening to what I am unable to agree with . ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 38]: `` But let us hear your arguments , strengthened by your facts , in opposition to ours ; for it will be impossible to talk with a silent judge amongst us , '' Hugh ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 50]: `` I set up for no judge , Mr. Sutherland , I assure you ; and perhaps I shall do my opinions more justice by remaining silent , seeing I am conscious of utter inability to answer the a priori arguments which you in particular have brought against them .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 67]: All I would venture to say is , that an a priori argument may owe its force to a mistaken hypothesis with regard to the matter in question ; and that the true Baconian method , which is the glory of your English philosophy , would be to inquire first what the thing is , by recording observations and experiments made in its supposed direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 24]: `` At least Herr von Funkelstein has the best of the argument now , I am compelled to confess , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 8]: Funkelstein bowed stiffly , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 68]: `` You rouse our curiosity , '' said Mr. Arnold ; `` but I fear , after the free utterance which we have already given to our own judgments , in ignorance , of course , of your greater experience , you will not be inclined to make us wiser by communicating any of the said experience , however much we may desire to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 37]: Had he been speaking to one of less evident social standing than Funkelstein , Mr. Arnold , if dying with curiosity , would not have expressed the least wish to be made acquainted with his experiences .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 31]: He would have sat in apparent indifference , but in real anxiety that some one else would draw him out , and thus gratify his curiosity without endangering his dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 27]: `` I do not think , '' replied Funkelstein , `` that it is of any use to bring testimony to bear on such a matter .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 42]: I have seen -- to use the words of some one else , I forget whom , on a similar subject -- I have seen with my own eyes what I certainly should never have believed on the testimony of another .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 15]: Consequently , I have no right to expect that my testimony should be received .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 27]: Besides , I do not wish it to be received , although I confess I shrink from presenting it with a certainty of its being rejected .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 12]: I have no wish to make converts to my opinions . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 28]: `` Really , Herr von Funkelstein , at the risk of your considering me importunate , I would beg -- '' `` Excuse me , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 30]: The recital of some of the matters to which you refer , would not only be painful to myself , but would be agitating to the ladies present . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 29]: `` In that case , I have only to beg your pardon for pressing the matter -- I hope no further than to the verge of incivility . ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 14]: `` In no degree approaching it , I assure you , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 63]: In proof that I do not think so , I am ready , if you wish it -- although I rather dread the possible effects on the nerves of the ladies , especially as this is an old house -- to repeat , with the aid of those present , certain experiments which I have sometimes found perhaps only too successful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 10]: I do n't , '' said Euphra , faintly .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 15]: An expression of the opposite desire followed , however , from the other ladies .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 14]: Their curiosity seemed to strive with their fears , and to overcome them .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 21]: `` I hope we shall have nothing to do with it in any other way than merely as spectators ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 4]: said Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 7]: `` Nothing more than you please .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 10]: It is doubtful if you can even be spectators .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 7]: That remains to be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 11]: Lady Emily looked at her with surprise -- almost reproof .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 15]: `` I beg your pardon , my dear ; but it sounds so dreadful .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 6]: What can it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 23]: `` Let me entreat you , ladies , not to imagine that I am urging you to anything , '' said Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 11]: `` Not in the least , '' replied Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 7]: `` I was very foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 11]: And the old lady looked ashamed , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 15]: `` Then if you will allow me , I will make one small preparation .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 10]: Have you a tool-chest anywhere , Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 13]: `` There must be tools enough about the place , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 7]: I will ring for Atkins . ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 37]: `` I know where the tool chest is , '' said Hugh ; `` and , if you will allow me a suggestion , would it not be better the servants should know nothing about this ?
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 11]: There are some foolish stories afloat amongst them already . ''
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 16]: `` A very proper suggestion , Mr. Sutherland , '' said Mr. Arnold , graciously .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 12]: `` Will you find all that is wanted , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 8]: `` What tools do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 3]: asked Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 6]: `` Only a small drill .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 14]: Could you get me an earthenware plate -- not china -- too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 10]: `` I will manage that , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 13]: Hugh soon returned with the drill , and Euphra with the plate .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 76]: The Bohemian , with some difficulty , and the remark that the English ware was very hard , drilled a small hole in the rim of the plate -- a dinner-plate ; then begging an H B drawing-pencil from Miss Cameron , cut off a small piece , and fitted it into the hole , making it just long enough to touch the table with its point when the plate lay in its ordinary position .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 10]: `` Now I am ready , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 40]: `` But , '' he added , raising his head , and looking all round the room , as if a sudden thought had struck him -- `` I do not think this room will be quite satisfactory . ''
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 7]: They were now in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: `` Choose the room in the house that will suit you , '' said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 5]: `` The dining-room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 24]: `` Certainly not , '' answered Funkelstein , as he took from his watch-chain a small compass and laid it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 12]: `` Not the dining-room , nor the breakfast-room -- I think .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 10]: Let me see -- how is it situated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 21]: He went to the hall , as if to refresh his memory , and then looked again at the compass .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 8]: `` No , not the breakfast-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 17]: Hugh could not help thinking there was more or less of the charlatan about the man .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 5]: `` The library ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 4]: suggested Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 8]: They adjourned to the library to see .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 5]: The library would do .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 24]: After some further difficulty , they succeeded in procuring a large sheet of paper and fastening it down to the table by drawing-pins .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 41]: Only two candles were in the great room , and it was scarcely lighted at all by them ; yet Funkelstein requested that one of these should be extinguished , and the other removed to a table near the door .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 22]: He then said , solemnly : `` Let me request silence , absolute silence , and quiescence of thought even . ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 39]: After stillness had settled down with outspread wings of intensity , he resumed : `` Will any one , or , better , two of you , touch the plate as lightly as possible with your fingers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 7]: All hung back for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 6]: Then Mr. Arnold came forward .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 16]: `` I will , '' said he , and laid his fingers on the plate .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 10]: `` As lightly as possible , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 23]: If the plate moves , follow it with your fingers , but be sure not to push it in any direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 14]: `` I understand , '' said Mr. Arnold ; and silence fell again .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 17]: The Bohemian , after a pause , spoke once more , but in a foreign tongue .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 19]: The words sounded first like entreaty , then like command , and at last , almost like imprecation .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 4]: The ladies shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 8]: `` Any movement of the vehicle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 6]: said he to Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 19]: `` If by the vehicle you mean the plate , certainly not , '' said Mr. Arnold solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 30]: But the ladies were very glad of the pretext for attempting a laugh , in order to get rid of the oppression which they had felt for some time .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 5]: said Funkelstein , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 13]: -- `` Will no one else touch the plate , as well ?
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 7]: It will seldom move with one .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 5]: It does with me .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 19]: But I fear I might be suspected of treachery , if I offered to join Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 9]: `` Do not hint at such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 6]: You are beyond suspicion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 24]: What ground Mr. Arnold had for making such an assertion , was no better known to himself than to any one else present .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 22]: Von Funkelstein , without another word , put the fingers of one hand lightly on the plate beside Mr. Arnold 's .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 10]: The plate instantly began to move upon the paper .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 28]: The motion was a succession of small jerks at first ; but soon it tilted up a little , and moved upon a changing point of support .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 44]: Now it careered rapidly in wavy lines , sweeping back towards the other side , as often as it approached the extremity of the sheet , the men keeping their fingers in contact with it , but not appearing to influence its motion .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 5]: Gradually the motion ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 16]: Von Funkelstein withdrew his hand , and requested that the other candle should be lighted .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 8]: The paper was taken up and examined .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 16]: Nothing could be discovered upon it , but a labyrinth of wavy and sweepy lines .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 33]: Funkelstein pored over it for some minutes , and then confessed his inability to make a single letter out of it , still less words and sentences , as he had expected .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 19]: `` But , '' said he , `` we are at least so far successful : it moves .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 5]: Let us try again .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 6]: Who will try next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 31]: `` I will , '' said Hugh , who had refrained at first , partly from dislike to the whole affair , partly because he shrank from putting himself forward .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 8]: A new sheet of paper was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 5]: The candle was extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 8]: Hugh put his fingers on the plate .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 11]: In a second or two , it began to move .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 5]: `` A medium ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 3]: murmured Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 11]: He then spoke aloud some words unintelligible to the rest .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 31]: Whether from the peculiarity of his position and the consequent excitement of his imagination , or from some other cause , Hugh grew quite cold , and began to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 43]: The plate , which had been careering violently for a few moments , now went more slowly , making regular short motions and returns , at right angles to its chief direction , as if letters were being formed by the pencil .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 12]: Hugh shuddered , thinking he recognised the letters as they grew .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 4]: The writing ceased .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 5]: The candles were brought .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 6]: Yes ; there it was !
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 11]: -- not plain , but easily decipherable -- David Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 4]: Hugh felt sick .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 15]: Euphra , looking on beside him , whispered : `` What an odd name !
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 6]: Who can it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 37]: He made no reply Neither of the other ladies saw it ; for Mrs. Elton had discovered , the moment the second candle was lighted , that Lady Emily was either asleep or in a faint .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: She was soon all but satisfied that she was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 48]: Hugh 's opinion , gathered from what followed , was , that the Bohemian had not been so intent on the operations with the plate , as he had appeared to be ; and that he had been employing part of his energy in mesmerising Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 20]: Mrs. Elton , remembering that she had had quite a long walk that morning , was not much alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 35]: Unwilling to make a disturbance , she rang the bell very quietly , and , going to the door , asked the servant who answered it , to send her maid with some eau-de-cologne .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 35]: Meantime , the gentlemen had been too much absorbed to take any notice of her proceedings , and , after removing the one and extinguishing the other candle , had reverted to the plate .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 7]: -- Hugh was still the operator .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 9]: Von Funkelstein spoke again in an unknown tongue .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 8]: The plate began to move as before .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 25]: After only a second or two of preparatory gyration , Hugh felt that it was writing Turriepuffit , and shook from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 20]: Suddenly , in the middle of the word , the plate ceased its motion , and lay perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 25]: Hugh felt a kind of surprise come upon him , as if he waked from an unpleasant dream , and saw the sun shining .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 24]: The morbid excitement of his nervous system had suddenly ceased , and a healthful sense of strength and every-day life took its place .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 31]: Simultaneously with the stopping of the plate , and this new feeling which I have tried to describe , Hugh involuntarily raised his eyes towards the door of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 20]: In the all-but-darkness between him and the door , he saw a pale beautiful face -- a face only .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 24]: It was the face of Margaret Elginbrod ; not , however , such as he had used to see it -- but glorified .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 14]: That was the only word by which he could describe its new aspect .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 17]: A mist of darkness fell upon his brain , and the room swam round with him .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 30]: But he was saved from falling , or attracting attention to a weakness for which he could have made no excuse , by a sudden cry from Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 3]: `` See !
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 3]: see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 11]: she cried wildly , pointing towards one of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 19]: These looked across to another part of the house , one of the oldest , at some distance .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 19]: -- One of its windows , apparently on the first floor , shone with a faint bluish light .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 14]: All the company had hurried to the window at Lady Emily 's exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 12]: `` Who can be in that part of the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 6]: said Mr. Arnold , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 32]: `` It is Lady Euphrasia 's window , '' said Euphra , in a low voice , the tone of which suggested , somehow , that the speaker was very cold .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 11]: `` What do you mean by speaking like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 8]: said Mr. Arnold , forgetting his dignity .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 8]: `` Surely you are above being superstitious .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 11]: Is it possible the servants could be about any mischief ?
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 16]: I will discharge any one at once , that dares go there without permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 8]: The light disappeared , fading slowly out .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 33]: `` Indeed , the servants are all too much alarmed , after what took place last year , to go near that wing -- much less that room , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 15]: `` Besides , Mrs. Horton has all the keys in her own charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 10]: `` Go yourself and get me them , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 9]: I will see at once what this means .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 9]: Do n't say why you want them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 7]: `` Certainly not , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 6]: Hugh had recovered almost instantaneously .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 25]: Though full of amazement , he had yet his perceptive faculties sufficiently unimpaired to recognise the real source of the light in the window .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 35]: It seemed to him more like moonlight than anything else ; and he thought the others would have seen it to be such , but for the effect of Lady Emily 's sudden exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 13]: Perhaps she was under the influence of the Bohemian at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 17]: Certainly they were all in a tolerable condition for seeing whatever might be required of them .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 24]: True , there was no moon to be seen ; and if it was the moon , why did the light go out ?
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 10]: But he found afterwards that he had been right .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 66]: The house stood upon a rising ground ; and , every recurring cycle , the moon would shine , through a certain vista of trees and branches , upon Lady Euphrasia 's window ; provided there had been no growth of twigs to stop up the channel of the light , which was so narrow that in a few moments the moon had crossed it .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 18]: A gap in a hedge made by a bull that morning , had removed the last screen .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 23]: -- Lady Euphrasia 's window was so neglected and dusty , that it could reflect nothing more than a dim bluish shimmer .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 29]: `` Will you all accompany me , ladies and gentlemen , that you may see with your own eyes that there is nothing dangerous in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 4]: said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 22]: Of course Funkelstein was quite ready , and Hugh as well , although he felt at this moment ill-fitted for ghost-hunting .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 26]: The ladies hesitated ; but at last , more afraid of being left behind alone , than of going with the gentlemen , they consented .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 13]: Euphra brought the keys , and they commenced their march of investigation .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 40]: Up the grand staircase they went , Mr. Arnold first with the keys , Hugh next with Mrs. Elton and Lady Emily , and the Bohemian , considerably to Hugh 's dissatisfaction , bringing up the rear with Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 35]: -- This misarrangement did more than anything else could have done , to deaden for the time the distraction of feeling produced in Hugh 's mind by the events of the last few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 84]: Yet even now he seemed to be wandering through the old house in a dream , instead of following Mr. Arnold , whose presence might well have been sufficient to destroy any illusion , except such as a Chinese screen might superinduce ; for , possessed of far less imagination than a horse , he was incapable of any terrors , but such as had to do with robbers , or fire , or chartists -- which latter fear included both the former .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: He strode on securely , carrying a candle in one hand , and the keys in the other .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 10]: Each of the other gentlemen likewise bore a light .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 27]: They had to go through doors , some locked , some open , following a different route from that taken by Euphra on a former occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 8]: But Mr. Arnold found the keys troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 17]: He could not easily distinguish those he wanted , and was compelled to apply to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 14]: She left Funkelstein in consequence , and walked in front with her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 24]: Her former companion got beside Lady Emily , and as they could not well walk four abreast , she fell behind with him .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 14]: So Hugh got next to Euphra , behind her , and was comforted .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 29]: At length , by tortuous ways , across old rooms , and up and down abrupt little stairs , they reached the door of Lady Euphrasia 's room .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 30]: The key was found , and the door opened with some perturbation -- manifest on the part of the ladies , and concealed on the part of the men .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 6]: The place was quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 13]: They entered ; and Hugh was greatly struck with its strange antiquity .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 37]: Lady Euphrasia 's ghost had driven the last occupant out of it nearly a hundred years ago ; but most of the furniture was much older than that , having probably belonged to Lady Euphrasia herself .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 13]: The room remained just as the said last occupant had left it .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 19]: Even the bed-clothes remained , folded down , as if expecting their occupant for the last hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 29]: The fine linen had grown yellow ; and the rich counterpane lay like a churchyard after the resurrection , full of the open graves of the liberated moths .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 12]: On the wall hung the portrait of a nun in convent-attire .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 25]: `` Some have taken that for a second portrait of Lady Euphrasia , '' said Mr. Arnold , `` but it can not be .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 12]: -- Euphra , we will go back through the picture gallery .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 17]: -- I suspect it of originating the tradition that Lady Euphrasia became a nun at last .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 7]: I do not believe it myself .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 26]: The picture is certainly old enough to stand for her , but it does not seem to me in the least like the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 16]: It was a great room , with large recesses , and therefore irregular in form .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 20]: Old chairs , with remnants of enamel and gilding , and seats of faded damask , stood all about .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 10]: But the beauty of the chamber was its tapestry .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 33]: The walls were entirely covered with it , and the rich colours had not yet receded into the dull grey of the past , though their gorgeousness had become sombre with age .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 8]: The subject was the story of Samson .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 28]: `` Come and see this strange piece of furniture , '' said Euphra to Hugh , who had kept by her side since they entered this room .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 15]: She led him into one of the recesses , almost concealed by the bed-hangings .
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 20]: In it stood a cabinet of ebony , reaching nearly to the ceiling , curiously carved in high relief .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 25]: `` I wish I could show you the inside of it , '' she went on , `` but I can not now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 8]: This was said almost in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 9]: Hugh replied with only a look of thanks .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 21]: He gazed at the carving , on whose black surface his candle made little light , and threw no shadows .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 14]: `` You have looked at this before , Euphra , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 7]: `` Explain it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 28]: `` I have often tried to find out what it is , '' she answered ; `` but I never could quite satisfy myself about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 31]: She proceeded , however , to tell him what she fancied it might mean , speaking still in the low tone which seemed suitable to the awe of the place .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 27]: She got interested in showing him the relations of the different figures ; and he made several suggestions as to the possible intention of the artist .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 10]: More than one well-known subject was proposed and rejected .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 25]: Suddenly becoming aware of the sensation of silence , they looked up , and saw that theirs was the only light in the room .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 9]: They were left alone in the haunted chamber .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 21]: -- They looked at each other for one moment ; then said , with half-stifled voices : `` Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 4]: `` Hugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 8]: Euphra seemed half amused and half perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 8]: Hugh looked half perplexed and wholly pleased .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 20]: `` Come , come , '' said Euphra , recovering herself , and leading the way to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 12]: When they reached it , they found it closed and locked .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 9]: Euphra raised her hand to beat on it .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 4]: Hugh caught it .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 9]: `` You will drive Lady Emily into fits .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 11]: Did you not see how awfully pale she was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 18]: Euphra instantly lifted her hand again , as if she would just like to try that result .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 16]: But Hugh , who was in no haste for any result , held her back .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 28]: She struggled for a moment or two , but not very strenuously , and , desisting all at once , let her arms drop by her sides .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 8]: `` I fear it is too late .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 21]: This is a double door , and Mr. Arnold will have locked all the doors between this and the picture-gallery .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 5]: They are there now .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 6]: What shall we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 29]: She said this with an expression of comical despair , which would have made Hugh burst into laughter , had he not been too much pleased to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 20]: `` Never mind , '' he said , `` we will go on with our study of the cabinet .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 20]: They will soon find out that we are left behind , and come back to look for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 11]: `` Yes , but only fancy being found here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 10]: She laughed ; but the laugh did not succeed .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: It could not hide a real embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 7]: She pondered , and seemed irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 33]: Then with the words -- `` They will say we stayed behind on purpose , '' she moved her hand to the door , but again withdrew it , and stood irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 9]: `` Let us put out the light . ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 11]: said Hugh laughing , `` and make no answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 7]: `` Can you starve well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 5]: `` With you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 33]: She murmured something to herself ; then said aloud and hastily , as if she had made up her mind by the compulsion of circumstances : `` But this wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 11]: They are still looking at the portrait , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 3]: Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 21]: So saying , she went into another recess , and , lifting a curtain of tapestry , opened a door .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 8]: `` Come quick , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 18]: Hugh followed her down a short stair into a narrow passage , nowhere lighted from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 20]: The door went to behind them , as if some one had banged it in anger at their intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 13]: The passage smelt very musty , and was as quiet as death .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 14]: `` Not a word of this , Hugh , as you love me .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 7]: It may be useful yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 6]: `` Not a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 11]: They came through a sliding panel into an empty room .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 6]: Euphra closed it behind them .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 7]: `` Now shade your light . ''
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 4]: He did so .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 7]: She took him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 18]: A few more turns brought them in sight of the lights of the rest of the party .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 32]: As Euphra had conjectured , they were looking at the picture of Lady Euphrasia , Mr. Arnold prosing away to them , in proof that the nun could not be she .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 36]: They entered the gallery without being heard ; and parting a little way , one pretending to look at one picture , the other at another , crept gradually round till they joined the group .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 9]: It was a piece of most successful generalship .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 16]: Euphra was , doubtless , quite prepared with her story in case it should fail .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 15]: `` Dear Lady Emily , '' said she , `` how tired you look !
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 8]: Do let us go , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 5]: `` By all means .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 7]: Take my arm , Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 15]: Euphra , will you take the keys again , and lock the doors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 21]: Mrs. Elton had already taken Hugh 's arm , and was leading him away after Mr. Arnold and Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 18]: `` I will not leave you behind with the spectres , Miss Cameron , '' said Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 11]: `` Thank you ; they will not detain me long .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 9]: They do n't mind being locked up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 40]: It was some little time , however , before they presented themselves in the drawing-room , to which , and not to the library , the party had gone : they had had enough of horrors for that night .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 21]: Lest my readers should think they have had too many wonders at least , I will explain one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 10]: It was really Margaret Elginbrod whom Hugh had seen .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 14]: Mrs. Elton was the lady in whose service she had left her home .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 33]: It was nothing strange that they had not met , for Margaret knew he was in the same house , and had several times seen him , but had avoided meeting him .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 47]: Neither was it a wonderful coincidence that they should be in such close proximity ; for the college friend from whom Hugh had first heard of Mr. Arnold , was the son of the gentleman whom Mrs. Elton was visiting , when she first saw Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 22]: Margaret had obeyed her mistress 's summons to the drawing-room , and had entered while Hugh was stooping over the plate .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 41]: As the room was nearly dark , and she was dressed in black , her pale face alone caught the light and his eye as he looked up , and the giddiness which followed had prevented him from seeing more .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 18]: She left the room the next moment , while they were all looking out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 17]: Nor was it any exercise of his excited imagination that had presented her face as glorified .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 42]: She was now a woman ; and , there being no divine law against saying so , I say that she had grown a lady as well ; as indeed any one might have foreseen who was capable of foreseeing it .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 32]: Her whole nature had blossomed into a still , stately , lily-like beauty ; and the face that Hugh saw was indeed the realised idea of the former face of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 7]: But how did the plate move ?
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 11]: and whence came the writing of old David 's name ?
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 21]: I must , for the present , leave the whole matter to the speculative power of each of my readers .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 11]: But Margaret was in mourning : was David indeed dead ?
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 4]: He was dead .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 91]: -- Yet his name will stand as the name of my story for pages to come ; because , if he had not been in it , the story would never have been worth writing ; because the influence of that ploughman is the salt of the whole ; because a man 's life in the earth is not to be measured by the time he is visible upon it ; and because , when the story is wound up , it will be in the presence of his spirit .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 14]: Do I then believe that David himself did write that name of his ?
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 14]: Heaven forbid that any friend of mine should be able to believe it !
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 36]: Long before she saw him , Margaret had known , from what she heard among the servants , that Master Harry 's tutor could be no other than her own tutor of the old time .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 21]: By and by she learned a great deal about him from Harry 's talk with Mrs. Elton and Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 22]: But she did not give the least hint that she knew him , or betray the least desire to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 12]: Mrs. Elton was amusingly bewildered by the occurrences of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 47]: Her theories were something astounding ; and followed one another with such alarming rapidity , that had they been in themselves such as to imply the smallest exercise of the thinking faculty , she might well have been considered in danger of an attack of brain-fever .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 8]: As it was , none such supervened .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 9]: Lady Emily said nothing , but seemed unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 16]: As for Hugh , he simply could not tell what to make of the writing .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 31]: But he did not for a moment doubt that the vision he had seen was only a vision -- a home-made ghost , sent out from his own creative brain .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 37]: Still he felt that Margaret 's face , come whence it might , was a living reproof to him ; for he was losing his life in passion , sinking deeper in it day by day .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 6]: His powers were deserting him .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 15]: Poetry , usually supposed to be the attendant of love , had deserted him .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 35]: Only by fits could he see anything beautiful ; and then it was but in closest association of thought with the one image which was burning itself deeper and deeper into his mental sensorium .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 11]: Come what might , he could not tear it away .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 25]: It had become a part of himself -- of his inner life -- even while it seemed to be working the death of life .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 16]: Deeper and deeper it would burn , till it reached the innermost chamber of life .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 4]: Let it burn .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 10]: Yet he felt that he could not trust her .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 27]: Vague hopes he had , that , by trusting , she might be made trustworthy ; but he feared they were vain as well as vague .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 17]: And yet he would not cast them away , for he could not cast her away .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 6]: MORE MATERIALISM AND SOME SPIRITUALISM .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 19]: God wisheth none should wreck on a strange shelf : To Him man 's dearer than to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 3]: BEN Jonson .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 9]: -- The Forest : To Sir Robert Wroth .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 18]: At breakfast the following morning , the influences of the past day on the family were evident .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 12]: There was a good deal of excitement , alternated with listlessness .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 39]: The moral atmosphere seemed unhealthy ; and Harry , although he had , fortunately for him , had nothing to do with the manifestations of the previous evening , was affected by the condition of those around him .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 81]: Hugh was still careful enough of him to try to divert the conversation entirely from what he knew would have a very injurious effect upon him ; and Mr. Arnold , seeing the anxious way in which he glanced now and then at his pupil , and divining the reason , by the instinct of his affection , with far more than his usual acuteness , tried likewise to turn it aside , as often as it inclined that way .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 16]: Still a few words were let fall by the visitors , which made Harry stare .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 11]: Hugh took him away as soon as breakfast was over .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 27]: In the afternoon , Funkelstein called to inquire after the ladies ; and hoped he had no injury to their health to lay on his conscience .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 61]: Mr. Arnold , who had a full allowance of curiosity , its amount being frequently in an inverse ratio to that of higher intellectual gifts , begged him to spend the rest of the day with them ; but not to say a word of what had passed the day before , till after Harry had retired for the night .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 10]: Renewed conversation led to renewed experiments in the library .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 41]: Hugh , however , refused to have anything more to do with the plate-writing ; for he dreaded its influence on his physical nature , attributing , as I have said , the vision of Margaret to a cerebral affection .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 30]: And the plate did not seem to work satisfactorily with any one else , except Funkelstein , who , for his part , had no great wish to operate .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 35]: Recourse was had to a more vulgar method -- that of expectant solicitation of those noises whereby the prisoners in the aërial vaults are supposed capable of communicating with those in this earthly cell .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 38]: Certainly , raps were heard from some quarter or another ; and when the lights were extinguished , and the crescent moon only allowed to shine in the room , some commotion was discernible amongst the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 6]: Several light articles flew about .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 18]: A pen-wiper alighted on Euphra 's lap , and a sofa-pillow gently disarranged Mrs. Elton 's cap .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 44]: Most of the artillery , however , was directed against Lady Emily ; and she it was who saw , in a faint stream of moonlight , a female arm uplifted towards her , from under a table , with a threatening motion .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 11]: It was bare to the elbow , and draped above .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 21]: It showed first a clenched fist , and next an open hand , palm outwards , making a repellent gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 24]: Then the back of the hand was turned , and it motioned her away , as if she had been an importunate beggar .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 24]: But at this moment , one of the doors opened , and a dark figure passed through the room towards the opposite door .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 10]: Everything that could be called ghostly , ceased instantaneously .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 4]: The arm vanished .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: The company breathed more freely .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 39]: Lady Emily , who had been on the point of going into hysterics , recovered herself , and overcame the still lingering impulse : she felt as if she had awaked from a momentary aberration of the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 27]: Mr. Arnold proceeded to light the candles , saying , in a righteous tone : `` I think we have had enough of this nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 19]: When the candles were lighted , there was no one to be seen in the room besides themselves .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 23]: Several , Hugh amongst them , had observed the figure ; but all had taken it for part of the illusive phantasmagoria .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 25]: Hugh would have concluded it a variety of his vision of the former night ; but others had seen it as well as he .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 10]: There was no renewal of the experiments that night .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 11]: But all were in a very unhealthy state of excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 32]: Vague fear , vague wonder , and a certain indescribable oppression , had dimmed for the time all the clearer vision , and benumbed all the nobler faculties of the soul .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 7]: Lady Emily was affected the most .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 23]: Her eyes looked scared ; there was a bright spot on one cheek amidst deathly paleness ; and she seemed very unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 16]: Mrs. Elton became alarmed , and this brought her back to a more rational condition .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 9]: She persuaded Lady Emily to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: But the contagion spread ; and indistinct terrors were no longer confined to the upper portions of the family .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 18]: The bruit revived , which had broken out a year before -- that the house was haunted .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 97]: It was whispered that , the very night after these occurrences , the Ghost 's Walk had been in use as the name signified : a figure in death-garments had been seen gliding along the deserted avenue , by one of the maid-servants ; the truth of whose story was corroborated by the fact that , to support it , she did not hesitate to confess that she had escaped from the house , nearly at midnight , to meet one of the grooms in a part of the wood contiguous to the avenue in question .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 45]: Mr. Arnold instantly dismissed her -- not on the ground of the intrigue , he took care to let her know , although that was bad enough , but because she was a fool , and spread absurd and annoying reports about the house .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 53]: Mr. Arnold 's usual hatred of what he called superstition , was rendered yet more spiteful by the fact , that the occurrences of the week had had such an effect on his own mind , that he was mortally afraid lest he should himself sink into the same limbo of vanity .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 62]: The girl , however , was , or pretended to be , quite satisfied with her discharge , protesting she would not have staid for the world ; and as the groom , whose wages happened to have been paid the day before , took himself off the same evening , it may be hoped her satisfaction was not altogether counterfeit .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 24]: `` If all tales be true , '' said Mrs. Elton , `` Lady Euphrasia is where she ca n't get out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 10]: `` But if she repented before she died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: said Euphra , with a muffled scorn in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 15]: `` My dear Miss Cameron , do you call becoming a nun -- repentance ?
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 9]: We Protestants know very well what that means .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 10]: Besides , your uncle does not believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 21]: `` Have n't you found out yet , dear Mrs. Elton , what my uncle 's favourite phrase is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 5]: What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 8]: `` I do n't believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 6]: `` You naughty girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 20]: `` I 'm not naughty , '' answered Euphra , affecting to imitate the simplicity of a chidden child .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 12]: `` My uncle is so fond of casting doubt upon everything !
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 14]: If salvation goes by quantity , his faith wo n't save him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 11]: Euphra knew well enough that Mrs. Elton was no tell-tale .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 80]: The good lady had hopes of her from this moment , because she all but quoted Scripture to condemn her uncle ; the verdict corresponding with her own judgment of Mr. Arnold , founded on the clearest assertions of Scripture ; strengthened somewhat , it must be confessed , by the fact that the spirits , on the preceding evening but one , had rapped out the sentence : `` Without faith it is impossible to please him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 17]: Lady Emily was still in bed , but apparently more sick in mind than in body .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 33]: She said she had tossed about all the previous night without once falling asleep ; and her maid , who had slept in the dressing-room without waking once , corroborated the assertion .
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 19]: In the morning , Mrs. Elton , wishing to relieve the maid , sent Margaret to Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 51]: Margaret arranged the bedclothes and pillows , which were in a very uncomfortable condition , sat down behind the curtain ; and , knowing that it would please Lady Emily , began to sing , in what the French call a veiled voice , The Land o ' the Leal .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 58]: Now the air of this lovely song is the same as that of Scots wha hae ; but it is the pibroch of onset changed into the coronach of repose , singing of the land beyond the battle , of the entering in of those who have fought the good fight , and fallen in the field .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 8]: It is the silence after the thunder .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 11]: Before she had finished , Lady Emily was fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 45]: A sweet peaceful half smile lighted her troubled face graciously , like the sunshine that creeps out when it can , amidst the rain of an autumn day , saying , `` I am with you still , though we are all troubled . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 19]: Finding her thus at rest , Margaret left the room for a minute , to fetch some work .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 20]: When she returned , she found her tossing , and moaning , and apparently on the point of waking .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 26]: As soon as she sat down by her , her trouble diminished by degrees , till she lay in the same peaceful sleep as before .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 16]: In this state she continued for two or three hours , and awoke much refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 16]: She held out her little hand to Margaret , and said : `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 8]: What a sweet creature you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 19]: And Lady Emily lay and gazed in loving admiration at the face of the lady 's - maid .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 13]: `` Shall I send Sarah to you now , my lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 15]: said Margaret ; `` or would you like me to stay with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 14]: you , you , please -- if Mrs. Elton can spare you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 16]: `` She will only think of your comfort , I know , my lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 16]: `` That recalls me to my duty , and makes me think of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 14]: `` But your comfort will be more to her than anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 11]: `` In that case you must stay , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 8]: `` With pleasure , my lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 12]: Mrs. Elton entered , and quite confirmed what Margaret had said .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 18]: `` But , '' she added , `` it is time Lady Emily had something to eat .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 19]: Go to the cook , Margaret , and see if the beef-tea Miss Cameron ordered is ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 3]: Margaret went .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 40]: `` What a comfort it is , '' said Mrs. Elton , wishing to interest Lady Emily , `` that now-a-days , when infidelity is so rampant , such corroborations of Sacred Writ are springing up on all sides !
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 23]: There are the discoveries at Nineveh ; and now these Spiritual Manifestations , which bear witness so clearly to another world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 7]: But Lady Emily made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 15]: She began to toss about as before , and show signs of inexplicable discomfort .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 22]: Margaret had hardly been gone two minutes , when the invalid moaned out : `` What a time Margaret is gone !
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 8]: -- when will she be back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 13]: `` I am here , my love , '' said Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 8]: `` Yes , yes ; thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 6]: But I want Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 7]: `` She will be here presently .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 7]: Have patience , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 12]: `` Please , do n't let Miss Cameron come near me .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 20]: I am afraid I am very wicked , but I ca n't bear her to come near me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 15]: `` No , no , dear ; we will keep you to ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 15]: `` Is Mr. -- , the foreign gentleman , I mean -- below ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 5]: He is gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 5]: `` Are you sure ?
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 7]: I can hardly believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 8]: `` What do you mean , dear ?
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 8]: I am sure he is gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 6]: Lady Emily did not answer .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 3]: Margaret returned .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 10]: She took the beef-tea , and grew quiet again .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 15]: `` You must not leave her ladyship , Margaret , '' whispered her mistress .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 24]: `` She has taken it into her head to like no one but you , and you must just stay with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 6]: `` Very well , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 7]: I shall be most happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 6]: Mrs. Elton left the room .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 13]: Lady Emily said : `` Read something to me , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 7]: `` What shall I read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 6]: `` Anything you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 22]: Margaret got a Bible , and read to her one of her father 's favourite chapters , the fortieth of Isaiah .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 13]: `` I have no right to trust in God , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: `` Why , my lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 23]: `` Because I do not feel any faith in him ; and you know we can not be accepted without faith . ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 16]: `` That is to make God as changeable as we are , my lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 8]: `` But the Bible says so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 24]: `` I do n't think it does ; but if an angel from heaven said so , I would not believe it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 4]: `` Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 24]: `` My lady , I love God with all my heart , and I can not bear you should think so of him .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 46]: You might as well say that a mother would go away from her little child , lying moaning in the dark , because it could not see her , and was afraid to put its hand out into the dark to feel for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 17]: `` Then you think he does care for us , even when we are very wicked .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 9]: But he can not bear wicked people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 8]: `` Who dares to say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 3]: cried Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 45]: `` Has he not been making the world go on and on , with all the wickedness that is in it ; yes , making new babies to be born of thieves and murderers and sad women and all , for hundreds of years ?
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 7]: God help us , Lady Emily !
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 32]: If he can not bear wicked people , then this world is hell itself , and the Bible is all a lie , and the Saviour did never die for sinners .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 14]: It is only the holy Pharisees that ca n't bear wicked people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 11]: how happy I should be , if that were true !
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 8]: I should not be afraid now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 35]: `` You are not wicked , dear Lady Emily ; but if you were , God would bend over you , trying to get you back , like a father over his sick child .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: Will people never believe about the lost sheep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 6]: yes ; I believe that .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 12]: But then -- '' `` You ca n't trust it quite .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 18]: Trust in God , then , the very father of you -- and never mind the words .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 15]: You have been taught to turn the very words of God against himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 5]: Lady Emily was weeping .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 69]: `` Lady Emily , '' Margaret went on , `` if I felt my heart as hard as a stone ; if I did not love God , or man , or woman , or little child , I would yet say to God in my heart : ' O God , see how I trust thee , because thou art perfect , and not changeable like me .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 6]: I do not love thee .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 4]: I love nobody .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 8]: I am not even sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 45]: Thou seest how much I need thee to come close to me , to put thy arm round me , to say to me , my child ; for the worse my state , the greater my need of my father who loves me .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 10]: Come to me , and my day will dawn .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 12]: My beauty and my love will come back ; and oh !
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 9]: how I shall love thee , my God !
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 16]: and know that my love is thy love , my blessedness thy being . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 20]: As Margaret spoke , she seemed to have forgotten Lady Emily 's presence , and to be actually praying .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 32]: Those who can not receive such words from the lips of a lady 's - maid , must be reminded what her father was , and that she had lost him .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 21]: She had had advantages at least equal to those which David the Shepherd had -- and he wrote the Psalms .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 19]: She ended with : `` I do not even desire thee to come , yet come thou . ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 13]: She seemed to pray entirely as Lady Emily , not as Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 20]: When she had ceased , Lady Emily said , sobbing : `` You will not leave me , Margaret ?
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 9]: I will tell you why another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 12]: `` I will not leave you , my dear lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 7]: Margaret stooped and kissed her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 20]: Lady Emily threw her arms round her neck , and offered her mouth to be kissed by the maid .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 40]: In another minute she was fast asleep , with Margaret seated by her side , every now and then glancing up at her from her work , with a calm face , over which brooded the mist of tears .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 53]: That night , as Hugh paced up and down the floor of his study about midnight , he was awfully startled by the sudden opening of the door and the apparition of Harry in his nightshirt , pale as death , and scarcely able to articulate the words : `` The ghost !
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 4]: the ghost ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 17]: He took the poor boy in his arms , held him fast , and comforted him .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 13]: When he was a little soothed , `` Oh , Harry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 11]: he said , lightly , `` you 've been dreaming .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 6]: Where 's the ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 17]: `` In the Ghost 's Walk , '' cried Harry , almost shrieking anew with terror .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 10]: `` How do you know it is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 8]: `` I saw it from my window .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 6]: -- I could n't sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 18]: I got up and looked out -- I do n't know why -- and I saw it !
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 5]: I saw it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 11]: The words were followed by a long cry of terror .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 19]: `` Come and show it to me , '' said Hugh , wanting to make light of it .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 11]: `` No , no , Mr. Sutherland -- please not .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 10]: I could n't go back into that room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 13]: `` Very well , dear Harry ; you sha n't go back .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 9]: You shall sleep with me , to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 10]: thank you , thank you , dear Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 11]: You will love me again , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 6]: This touched Hugh 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: He could hardly refrain from tears .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 12]: His old love , buried before it was dead , revived .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 43]: He clasped the boy to his heart , and carried him to his own bed ; then , to comfort him , undressed and lay down beside him , without even going to look if he too might not see the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 24]: She had brought about one good thing at least that night ; though , I fear , she had no merit in it .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 13]: Lady Emily 's room likewise looked out upon the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 33]: Margaret heard the cry as she sat by the sleeping Emily ; and , not knowing whence it came , went , naturally enough , in her perplexity , to the window .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 24]: From it she could see distinctly , for it was clear moonlight : a white figure went gliding away along the deserted avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 47]: She immediately guessed what the cry had meant ; but as she had heard a door bang directly after -LRB- as Harry shut his behind him with a terrified instinct , to keep the awful window in -RRB- , she was not very uneasy about him .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 19]: She felt besides that she must remain where she was , according to her promise to Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 23]: But she resolved to be prepared for the possible recurrence of the same event , and accordingly revolved it in her mind .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 40]: She was sure that any report of it coming to Lady Emily 's ears , would greatly impede her recovery ; for she instinctively felt that her illness had something to do with the questionable occupations in the library .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 53]: She watched by her bedside all the night , slumbering at times , but roused in a moment by any restlessness of the patient ; when she found that , simply by laying her hand on hers , or kissing her forehead , she could restore her at once to quiet sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 5]: THE GHOST 'S WALK .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 2]: Thierry .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 8]: -- 'T is full of fearful shadows .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 2]: Ordella .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 23]: -- So is sleep , sir ; Or anything that 's merely ours , and mortal ; We were begotten gods else .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 25]: But those fears Feeling but once the fires of nobler thoughts , Fly , like the shapes of clouds we form , to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 4]: BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 5]: -- Thierry and Theodoret .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 9]: Margaret sat watching the waking of Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 31]: Knowing how much the first thought colours the feeling of the whole day , she wished that Lady Emily should at once be aware that she was by her side .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 18]: She opened her eyes , and a smile broke over her face when she perceived her nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 9]: But Margaret did not yet speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 33]: Every nurse should remember that waking ought always to be a gradual operation ; and , except in the most triumphant health , is never complete on the opening of the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 15]: `` Margaret , I am better , '' said Lady Emily , at last .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 10]: `` I am very glad , my lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 18]: `` I have been lying awake for some time , and I am sure I am better .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 15]: I do n't see strange-coloured figures floating about the room as I did yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 13]: Were you not out of the room a few minutes ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 10]: `` Just for one moment , my lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 5]: `` I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 7]: But I did not mind it .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 21]: Yesterday , when you left me , those figures grew ten times as many , the moment you were gone .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 13]: But you will stay with me to-day , too , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 7]: she added , with some anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 11]: `` I will , if you find you need me .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 27]: But I may be forced to leave you a little while this evening -- you must try to allow me this , dear Lady Emily . ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 6]: `` Of course I will .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 16]: I will be quite patient , I promise you , whatever comes to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 43]: When Harry woke , after a very troubled sleep , from which he had often started with sudden cries of terror , Hugh made him promise not to increase the confusion of the household , by speaking of what he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 19]: Harry promised at once , but begged in his turn that Hugh would not leave him all day .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 39]: It did not need the pale scared face of his pupil to enforce the request ; for Hugh was already anxious lest the fright the boy had had , should exercise a permanently deleterious effect on his constitution .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 10]: Therefore he hardly let him out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 22]: But although Harry kept his word , the cloud of perturbation gathered thicker in the kitchen and the servants ' hall .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 35]: Nothing came to the ears of their master and mistress ; but gloomy looks , sudden starts , and sidelong glances of fear , indicated the prevailing character of the feelings of the household .
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 32]: And although Lady Emily was not so ill , she had not yet taken a decided turn for the better , but appeared to suffer from some kind of low fever .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 34]: The medical man who was called in , confessed to Mrs. Elton , that as yet he could say nothing very decided about her condition , but recommended great quiet and careful nursing .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 22]: Margaret scarcely left her room , and the invalid showed far more than the ordinary degree of dependence upon her nurse .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 16]: In her relation to her , she was more like a child than an invalid .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 6]: About noon she was better .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 28]: She called Margaret and said to her : `` Margaret , dear , I should like to tell you one thing that annoys me very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 10]: `` What is it , dear Lady Emily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 6]: `` That man haunts me .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 19]: I can not bear the thought of him ; and yet I can not get rid of him .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 9]: I am sure he is a bad man .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 9]: Are you certain he is not here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 8]: `` Yes , indeed , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 12]: He has not been here since the day before yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 42]: `` And yet when you leave me for an instant , I always feel as if he were sitting in the very seat where you were the moment before , or just coming to the door and about to open it .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 13]: That is why I can not bear you to leave me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 25]: Margaret might have confessed to some slighter sensations of the same kind ; but they did not oppress her as they did Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 17]: `` God is nearer to you than any thought or feeling of yours , Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 5]: Do not be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 25]: If all the evil things in the universe were around us , they could not come inside the ring that he makes about us .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 20]: He always keeps a place for himself and his child , into which no other being can enter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 9]: how you must love God , Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 10]: `` Indeed I do love him , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 21]: If ever anything looks beautiful or lovely to me , then I know at once that God is that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 29]: `` But , then , what right have we to take the good of that , however true it is , when we are not beautiful ourselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 27]: `` That only makes God the more beautiful -- in that he will pour out the more of his beauty upon us to make us beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 18]: If we care for his glory , we shall be glad to believe all this about him .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 17]: But we are too anxious about feeling good ourselves , to rejoice in his perfect goodness .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 11]: I think we should find that enough , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 28]: For , if he be good , are not we his children , and sure of having it , not merely feeling it , some day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 11]: Here Margaret repeated a little poem of George Herbert 's .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 31]: She had found his poems amongst Mrs. Elton 's books , who , coming upon her absorbed in it one day , had made her a present of the volume .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 8]: Then indeed Margaret had found a friend .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 34]: The poem is called Dialogue : `` Sweetest Saviour , if my soul Were but worth the having -- '' `` Oh , what a comfort you are to me , Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 9]: Lady Emily said , after a short silence .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 8]: Where did you learn such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 24]: `` From my father , and from Jesus Christ , and from God himself , showing them to me in my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 68]: that is why , as often as you come into my room , even if I am very troubled , I feel as if the sun shone , and the wind blew , and the birds sang , and the tree-tops went waving in the wind , as they used to do before I was taken ill -- I mean before they thought I must go abroad .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 13]: You seem to make everything clear , and right , and plain .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 9]: I wish I were you , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 31]: `` If I were you , my lady , I would rather be what God chose to make me , than the most glorious creature that I could think of .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 32]: For to have been thought about -- born in God 's thoughts -- and then made by God , is the dearest , grandest , most precious thing in all thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 8]: Is it not , my lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 13]: `` It is , '' said Lady Emily , and was silent .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 7]: The shadows of evening came on .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 24]: As soon as it was dark , Margaret took her place at one of the windows hidden from Lady Emily by a bed-curtain .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 22]: She raised the blind , and pulled aside one curtain , to let her have a view of the trees outside .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 21]: She had placed the one candle so as not to shine either on the window or on her own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 5]: Lady Emily was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 16]: One hour and another passed , and still she sat there -- motionless , watching .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 25]: Margaret did not know , that at another window -- the one , indeed , next to her own -- stood a second watcher .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 16]: It was Hugh , in Harry 's room : Harry was asleep in Hugh 's .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 5]: He had no light .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 17]: He stood with his face close against the windowpane , on which the moon shone brightly .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 13]: All below him the woods were half dissolved away in the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 16]: The Ghost 's Walk lay full before him , like a tunnel through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 26]: He could see a great way down , by the light that fell into it , at various intervals , from between the boughs overhead .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 12]: He stood thus for a long time , gazing somewhat listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 19]: Suddenly he became all eyes , as he caught the white glimmer of something passing up the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 25]: He stole out of the room , down to the library by the back-stair , and so through the library window into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 24]: He reached the avenue sideways , at some distance from the house , and peeped from behind a tree , up and down .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 6]: At first he saw nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 35]: But , a moment after , while he was looking down the avenue , that is , away from the house , a veiled figure in white passed him noiselessly from the other direction .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 21]: From the way in which he was looking at the moment , it had passed him before he saw it .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 5]: It made no sound .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 33]: Only some early-fallen leaves rustled as they hurried away in uncertain eddies , startled by the sweep of its trailing garments , which yet were held up by hands hidden within them .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 4]: On it went .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 9]: Hugh 's eyes were fixed on its course .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 17]: He could not move , and his heart laboured so frightfully that he could hardly breathe .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 64]: The figure had not advanced far , however , before he heard a repressed cry of agony , and it sank to the earth , and vanished ; while from where it disappeared , down the path , came , silently too , turning neither to the right nor the left , a second figure , veiled in black from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 17]: `` It is the nun in Lady Euphrasia 's room , '' said Hugh to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 23]: This passed him too , and , walking slowly towards the house , disappeared somewhere , near the end of the avenue .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 31]: Turning once more , with reviving courage -- for his blood had begun to flow more equably -- Hugh ventured to approach the spot where the white figure had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 12]: He found nothing there but the shadow of a huge tree .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 28]: He walked through the avenue to the end , and then back to the house , but saw nothing ; though he often started at fancied appearances .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 10]: Sorely bewildered , he returned to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 29]: After speculating till thought was weary , he lay down beside Harry , whom he was thankful to find in a still repose , and fell fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 34]: Margaret lay on a couch in Lady Emily 's room , and slept likewise ; but she started wide awake at every moan of the invalid , who often moaned in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 4]: THE BAD MAN .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 30]: She kent he was nae gentle knight , That she had letten in ; For neither when he gaed nor cam ' , Kissed he her cheek or chin .
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 31]: He neither kissed her when he cam ' Nor clappit her when he gaed ; And in and out at her bower window , The moon shone like the gleed .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 2]: Glenkindie .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 5]: -- Old Scotch Ballad .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 93]: When Euphra recovered from the swoon into which she had fallen -- for I need hardly explain to my readers , that it was she who walked the Ghost 's Walk in white -- on seeing Margaret , whom , under the irresistible influences of the moonlight and a bad conscience , she took for the very being whom Euphra herself was personating -- when she recovered , I say , she found herself lying in the wood , with Funkelstein , whom she had gone to meet , standing beside her .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 19]: Her first words were of anger , as she tried to rise , and found she could not .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 15]: `` How long , Count Halkar , am I to be your slave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 9]: `` Till you have learned to submit . ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 10]: `` Have I not done all I can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 7]: `` You have not found it .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 26]: You are free from the moment you place that ring , belonging to me , in right of my family , into my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 26]: I do not believe that the man really was Count Halkar , although he had evidently persuaded Euphra that such was his name and title .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 71]: I think it much more probable that , in the course of picking up a mass of trifling information about various families of distinction , for which his position of secretary in several of their houses had afforded him special facilities , he had learned something about the Halkar family , and this particular ring , of which , for some reason or other , he wanted to possess himself .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 8]: `` What more can I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 21]: moaned Euphra , succeeding at length in raising herself to a sitting posture , and leaning thus against a tree .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 9]: `` I shall be found out some day .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 19]: I have been already seen wandering through the house at midnight , with the heart of a thief .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 8]: I hate you , Count Halkar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 10]: A low laugh was the count 's only reply .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 18]: `` And now Lady Euphrasia herself dogs my steps , to keep me from the ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 11]: She gave a low cry of agony at the remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 17]: `` Miss Cameron -- Euphra -- are you going to give way to such folly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 3]: `` Folly !
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 21]: Is it not worse folly to torture a poor girl as you do me -- all for a worthless ring ?
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 8]: What can you want with the ring ?
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 11]: I do not know that he has it even . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 4]: `` You lie .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 5]: You know he has .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 10]: You need not think to take me in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 5]: `` You base man !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 13]: You dare not give the lie to any but a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 7]: `` Because you are a coward .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 8]: You are afraid of Lady Euphrasia yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 4]: See there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 7]: Von Funkelstein glanced round him uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 13]: It was only the moonlight on the bark of a silver birch .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 10]: Conscious of having betrayed weakness , he grew spiteful .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 15]: `` If you do not behave to me better , I will compel you .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 4]: Rise up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 9]: After a moment 's hesitation , she rose .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 8]: `` Put your arms round me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 20]: She seemed to grow to the earth , and to drag herself from it , one foot after another .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 25]: But she came close up to the Bohemian , and put one arm half round him , looking to the earth all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 5]: `` Kiss me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 5]: `` Count Halkar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 22]: her voice sounded hollow and harsh , as if from a dead throat -- `` I will do what you please .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 5]: Only release me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 12]: `` Go then ; but mind you resist me no more .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 8]: I do not care for your kisses .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 6]: You were ready enough once .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 15]: But that idiot of a tutor has taken my place , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 10]: `` Would to God I had never seen you !
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 9]: -- never yielded to your influence over me !
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 14]: Swear that I shall be free if I find you the ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 7]: `` You find the ring first .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 5]: Why should I swear ?
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 5]: I can compel you .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 23]: You know you laid yourself out to entrap me first with your arts , and I only turned upon you with mine .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 7]: And you are in my power .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 18]: But you shall be free , notwithstanding ; and I will torture you till you free yourself .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 5]: Find the ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 3]: `` Cruel !
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 2]: cruel !
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 11]: You are doing all you can to ruin me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 15]: `` On the contrary , I am doing all I can to save myself .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 23]: If you had loved me as you allowed me to think once , I should never have made you my tool . ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 8]: `` You would all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 4]: `` Take care .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 6]: I am irritable to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 9]: For a few moments Euphra made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 9]: `` To what will you drive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 5]: she said at last .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 8]: `` I will not go too far .
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 11]: I should lose my power over you if I did .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 7]: I prefer to keep it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 5]: `` Inexorable man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 4]: Another despairing pause .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 8]: `` What am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 14]: But keep yourself ready to carry out any plan that I may propose .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 15]: Something will turn up , now that I have got into the house myself .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 8]: Leave me to find out the means .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 9]: I can expect no invention from your brains .
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 6]: You can go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 25]: Euphra turned without another word , and went ; murmuring , as if in excuse to herself : `` It is for my freedom .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 7]: It is for my freedom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 22]: Of course this account must have come originally from Euphra herself , for there was no one else to tell it .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 15]: She , at least , believed herself compelled to do what the man pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 11]: Some of my readers will put her down as insane .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 36]: She may have been ; but , for my part , I believe there is such a power of one being over another , though perhaps only in a rare contact of psychologically peculiar natures .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 7]: I have testimony enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 8]: She had yielded to his will once .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 29]: Had she not done so , he could not have compelled her ; but , having once yielded , she had not strength sufficient to free herself again .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 26]: Whether even he could free her , further than by merely abstaining from the exercise of the power he had gained , I doubt much .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 61]: It is evident that he had come to the neighbourhood of Arnstead for the sake of finding her , and exercising his power over her for his own ends ; that he had made her come to him once , if not oftener , before he met Hugh , and by means of his acquaintance , obtained admission into Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 43]: Once admitted , he had easily succeeded , by his efforts to please , in so far ingratiating himself with Mr. Arnold , that now the house-door stood open to him , and he had even his recognised seat at the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 4]: SPIRIT VERSUS MATERIALISM .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 30]: Next this marble venomed seat , Smeared with gums of glutinous heat , I touch with chaste palms moist and cold -- Now the spell hath lost his hold .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 2]: MILTON .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 3]: -- Comas .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 35]: Next morning Lady Emily felt better , and wanted to get up : but her eyes were still too bright , and her hands too hot ; and Margaret would not hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 34]: Fond as Lady Emily was in general of Mrs. Elton 's society , she did not care to have her with her now , and got tired of her when Margaret was absent .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 58]: They had taken care not to allow Miss Cameron to enter the room ; but to-day there was not much likelihood of her making the attempt , for she did not appear at breakfast , sending a message to her uncle that she had a bad headache , but hoped to take her place at the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 14]: During the day , Lady Emily was better , but restless by fits .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 18]: `` Were you not out of the room for a little while last night , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 6]: she said , rather suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 6]: `` Yes , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 12]: I told you I should have to go , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 27]: `` I remember I thought you had gone , but I was not in the least afraid , and that dreadful man never came near me .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 8]: I do not know when you returned .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 22]: Perhaps I had fallen asleep ; but when I thought about you next , there you were by my bedside . ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 17]: `` I shall not have to leave you to-night , '' was all Margaret 's answer .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 37]: As for Hugh , when first he woke , the extraordinary experiences of the previous night appeared to him to belong only to the night , and to have no real relation to the daylight world .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 31]: But a little reflection soon convinced him of the contrary ; and then he went through the duties of the day like one who had nothing to do with them .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 37]: The phantoms he had seen even occupied some of the thinking space formerly appropriated by the image of Euphra , though he knew to his concern that she was ill , and confined to her room .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 20]: He had heard the message sent to Mr. Arnold , however , and so kept hoping for the dinner-hour .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 8]: With it came Euphra , very pale .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 15]: Her eyes had an unsettled look , and there were dark hollows under them .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 35]: She would start and look sideways without any visible cause ; and was thus very different from her usual self -- ordinarily remarkable for self-possession , almost to coolness , of manner and speech .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 13]: Hugh saw it , and became both distressed and speculative in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 18]: It did not diminish his discomfort that , about the middle of dinner , Funkelstein was announced .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 14]: Was it , then , that Euphra had been tremulously expectant of him ?
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 16]: `` This is an unforeseen pleasure , Herr von Funkelstein , '' said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 20]: `` It is very good of you to call it a pleasure , Mr. Arnold , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 9]: `` Miss Cameron -- but , good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 6]: how ill you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 6]: `` Do n't be alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 8]: I have only caught the plague . ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 4]: `` Only ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 23]: was all Funkelstein said in reply ; yet Hugh thought he had no right to be so solicitous about Euphra 's health .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 32]: As the gentlemen sat at their wine , Mr. Arnold said : `` I am anxious to have one more trial of those strange things you have brought to our knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 10]: I have been thinking about them ever since . ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 32]: `` Of course I am at your service , Mr. Arnold ; but do n't you think , for the ladies ' sakes , we have had enough of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 24]: `` You are very considerate , Herr von Funkelstein ; but they need not be present if they do not like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 8]: `` Very well , Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 12]: They adjourned once more to the library instead of the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 18]: Hugh went and told Euphra , who was alone in the drawing-room , what they were about .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 17]: She declined going , but insisted on his leaving her , and joining the other gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 7]: Hugh left her with much reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 20]: `` Margaret , '' said Lady Emily , `` I am certain that man is in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 11]: `` He is , my lady , '' answered Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 17]: `` They are about some more of those horrid experiments , as they call them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 7]: `` I do not know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 30]: Mrs. Elton entering the room at the moment , Margaret said : `` Do you know , ma'am , whether the gentlemen are -- in the library again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 4]: I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 7]: We have had enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 10]: I will go and find out , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 17]: `` Will you take my place for a few minutes first , please , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 10]: Margaret had felt a growing oppression for some time .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 9]: She had scarcely left the sick-room that day .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 16]: `` Do n't leave me , dear Margaret , '' said Lady Emily , imploringly .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 10]: `` Only for a little while , my lady .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 14]: I shall be back in less than a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 11]: `` Very well , Margaret , '' she answered dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 13]: Margaret went out into the moonlight , and walked for ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 12]: She sought the more open parts , where the winds were .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 11]: She then returned to the sick-chamber , refreshed and strong .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 18]: `` Now I will go and see what the gentlemen are about , '' said Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 18]: The good lady did not like these proceedings , but she was irresistibly attracted by them notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 15]: Having gone to see for Lady Emily , she remained to see for herself .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 11]: After she had left , Lady Emily grew more uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 10]: Not even Margaret 's presence could make her comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 6]: Mrs. Elton did not return .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 4]: Many minutes elapsed .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 40]: Lady Emily said at last : `` Margaret , I am terrified at the idea of being left alone , I confess ; but not so terrified as at the idea of what is going on in that library .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 7]: Mrs. Elton will not come back .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 15]: Would you mind just running down to ask her to come to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 22]: `` I would go with pleasure , '' said Margaret ; `` but I do n't want to be seen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 10]: Margaret did not want to be seen by Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 20]: Lady Emily , with her dislike to Funkelstein , thought Margaret did not want to be seen by him .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 34]: `` You will find a black veil of mine , '' she said , `` in that wardrobe -- just throw it over your head , and hold a handkerchief to your face .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 13]: They will be so busy that they will never see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 17]: Margaret yielded to the request of Lady Emily , who herself arranged her head-dress for her .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 8]: Now I must go back a little .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 21]: -- When Mrs. Elton reached the room , she found it darkened , and the gentlemen seated at the table .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 11]: A running fire of knocks was going on all around .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: She sat down in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 25]: In a minute or two , she fancied she saw strange figures moving about , generally near the floor , and very imperfectly developed .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 18]: Sometimes only a hand , sometimes only a foot , shadowed itself out of the dim obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 29]: She tried to persuade herself that it was all done , somehow or other , by Funkelstein , yet she could not help watching with a curious dread .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 15]: She was not a very excitable woman , and her nerves were safe enough .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 46]: In a minute or two more , the table at which they were seated , began to move up and down with a kind of vertical oscillation , and several things in the room began to slide about , by short , apparently purposeless jerks .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 15]: Everything threatened to assume motion , and turn the library into a domestic chaos .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 13]: Mrs. Elton declared afterwards that several books were thrown about the room .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 11]: -- But suddenly everything was as still as the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 14]: Every chair and table was at rest , looking perfectly incapable of motion .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 21]: Mrs. Elton felt that she dared not say they had moved at all , so utterly ordinary was their appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 12]: Not a sound was to be heard from corner or ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 25]: After a moment 's silence , Mrs. Elton was quite restored to her sound mind , as she said , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 16]: `` Some adverse influence is at work , '' said Funkelstein , with some vexation .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 8]: `` What is in that closet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 15]: So saying he approached the door of the private staircase , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 25]: They saw him start aside , and a veiled dark figure pass him , cross the library , and go out by another door .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 16]: `` I have my suspicions , '' said Funkelstein , with a rather tremulous voice .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 9]: `` And your fears too , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 9]: Grant it now , '' said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 6]: `` Granted , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 8]: Let us go to the drawing-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 57]: Just as Margaret had reached the library door at the bottom of the private stair , either a puff of wind from an open loophole window , or some other cause , destroyed the arrangement of the veil , and made it fall quite over her face , She stopped for a moment to readjust it .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 12]: She had not quite succeeded , when Funkelstein opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 16]: Without an instant 's hesitation , she let the veil fall , and walked forward .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 17]: Mrs. Elton had gone to her own room , on her way to Lady Emily 's .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 20]: When she reached the latter , she found Margaret seated as she had left her , by the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 20]: Lady Emily said : `` I did not miss you , Margaret , half so much as I expected .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 11]: But , indeed , you were not many moments gone .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 9]: I do not care for that man now .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 10]: He ca n't hurt me , can he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 4]: `` Certainty not .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 15]: I hope he will give you no more trouble either , dear Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 27]: But if I might presume to advise you , I would say -- Get well as soon as you can , and leave this place . ''
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 5]: `` Why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 4]: You frighten me .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 9]: Mr. Arnold is very kind to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 15]: `` The place quite suits Lady Emily , I am sure , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 14]: `` But Lady Emily is not so well as when she came . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 18]: `` No , but that is not the fault of the place , '' said Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 14]: `` I am sure it is all that horrid man 's doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 12]: `` How else will you get rid of him , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 11]: What if he wants to get rid of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 16]: `` What harm can I be doing him -- a poor girl like me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 12]: But I fear there is something not right going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 14]: `` We will tell Mr. Arnold at once , '' said Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 10]: `` But what could you tell him , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 13]: Mr. Arnold is hardly one to listen to your maid 's suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 12]: Dear Lady Emily , you must get well and go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 15]: `` I will try , '' said Lady Emily , submissive as a child .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 17]: `` I think you will be able to get up for a little while tomorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 7]: A tap came to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 9]: It was Euphrasia , inquiring after Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 13]: `` Ask Miss Cameron to come in , '' said the invalid .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 3]: She entered .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 11]: Her manner was much changed -- was subdued and suffering .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 13]: `` Dear Miss Cameron , you and I ought to change places .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 15]: I am sorry to see you looking so ill , '' said Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 9]: `` I have had a headache all day .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: I shall be quite well to-morrow , thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 15]: `` I intend to be so too , '' said Lady Emily , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 15]: After some little talk , Euphra went , holding her hand to her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 23]: Margaret did not look up , all the time she was in the room , but went on busily with her needle .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 7]: That night was a peaceful one .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 3]: THE RING .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 13]: shining crystal , which Out of her womb a thousand rayons threw .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 6]: BELLAY : translated by Spenser .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 17]: The next day , Lady Emily was very nearly as well as she had proposed being .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 11]: She did not , however , make her appearance below .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 44]: Mr. Arnold , hearing at luncheon that she was out of bed , immediately sent up his compliments , with the request that he might be permitted to see her on his return from the neighbouring village , where he had some business .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 7]: To this Lady Emily gladly consented .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 49]: He sat with her a long time , talking about various things ; for the presence of the girl , reminding him of his young wife , brought out the best of the man , lying yet alive under the incrustation of self-importance , and its inevitable stupidity .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 27]: At length , subject of further conversation failing , `` I wonder what we can do to amuse you , Lady Emily , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 14]: `` Thank you , Mr. Arnold ; I am not at all dull .
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 65]: With my kind friend , Mrs. Elton , and -- '' She would have said Margaret , but became instinctively aware that the mention of her would make Mr. Arnold open his eyes , for he did not even know her name ; and that he would stare yet wider when he learned that the valued companion referred to was Mrs. Elton 's maid .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 33]: Mr. Arnold left the room , and presently returned with his arms filled with all the drawing-room books he could find , with grand bindings outside , and equally grand plates inside .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 45]: These he heaped on the table beside Lady Emily , who tried to look interested , but scarcely succeeded to Mr. Arnold 's satisfaction , for he presently said : `` You do n't seem to care much about these , dear Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 18]: I daresay you have looked at them all already , in this dull house of ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 9]: This was a wonderful admission from Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 21]: He pondered -- then exclaimed , as if he had just made a grand discovery : `` I have it !
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 9]: I know something that will interest you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 16]: `` Do not trouble yourself , pray , Mr. Arnold , '' said Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 10]: But he was already half way to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 14]: He went to his own room , and his own strong closet therein .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 49]: Returning towards the invalid 's quarters with an ebony box of considerable size , he found it rather heavy , and meeting Euphra by the way , requested her to take one of the silver handles , and help him to carry it to Lady Emily 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 18]: She started when she saw it , but merely said : `` With pleasure , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 40]: `` Now , Lady Emily , '' said he , as , setting down the box , he took out a curious antique enamelled key , `` we shall be able to amuse you for a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 22]: He opened the box , and displayed such a glitter and show as would have delighted the eyes of any lady .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 76]: All kinds of strange ornaments ; ancient watches -- one of them a death 's head in gold ; cameo necklaces ; pearls abundant ; diamonds , rubies , and all the colours of precious stones -- every one of them having some history , whether known to the owner or not ; gems that had flashed on many a fair finger and many a shining neck -- lay before Lady Emily 's delighted eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 26]: But Euphrasia 's eyes shone , as she gazed on them , with a very different expression from that which sparkled in Lady Emily 's .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 10]: They seemed to search them with fingers of lightning .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 16]: Mr. Arnold chose two or three , and gave Lady Emily her choice of them .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 10]: `` I could not think of depriving you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 21]: `` They are of no use to me , '' said Mr. Arnold , making light of the handsome offer .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 6]: `` You are too kind .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 8]: -- I should like this ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 10]: `` Take it then , dear Lady Emily . ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 20]: Euphrasia 's eyes were not on the speakers , nor was any envy to be seen in her face .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 10]: She still gazed at the jewels in the box .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 23]: The chosen gem was put aside ; and then , one after another , the various articles were taken out and examined .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 24]: At length , a large gold chain , set with emeralds , was lifted from where it lay coiled up in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 25]: A low cry , like a muffled moan , escaped from Euphrasia 's lips , and she turned her head away from the box .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 9]: `` What is the matter , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 4]: said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 15]: `` A sudden shoot of pain -- I beg your pardon , dear uncle .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 15]: I fear I am not quite so well yet as I thought I was .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 6]: How stupid of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 5]: `` Do sit down .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 14]: I fear the weight of the box was too much for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 9]: I want to see the pretty things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 9]: `` But you have seen them before . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 5]: `` No , uncle .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 14]: You promised to show them to me , but you never did . ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 15]: `` You see what I get by being ill , '' said Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 11]: The chain was examined , admired , and laid aside .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 20]: Where it had lain , they now observed , in the corner , a huge stone like a diamond .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 6]: `` What is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 8]: said Lady Emily , taking it up .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 3]: I see .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 5]: It is a ring .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 11]: But such a ring for size , I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 7]: Do look , Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 7]: For Miss Cameron was not looking .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 16]: She was leaning her head on her hand , and her face was ashy pale .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 7]: Lady Emily tried the ring on .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 23]: Any two of her fingers would go into the broad gold circlet , beyond which the stone projected far in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 19]: Indeed , the ring was attached to the stone , rather than the stone set in the ring .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 12]: `` That is a curious thing , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 4]: said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 19]: `` It is of no value in itself , I believe ; it is nothing but a crystal .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 43]: But it seems to have been always thought something of in the family ; -- I presume from its being evidently the very ring painted by Sir Peter Lely in that portrait of Lady Euphrasia which I showed you the other day .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 11]: It is a clumsy affair , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 34]: It might have occurred to Mr. Arnold , that such a thing must have been thought something of , before its owner would have chosen to wear it when sitting for her portrait .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 23]: Lady Emily was just going to lay it down , when she spied something that made her look at it more closely .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 11]: `` What curious engraving is this upon the gold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 13]: `` I do not know , indeed , '' answered Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 8]: `` I have never observed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 12]: `` Look at it , then -- all over the gold .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 16]: What at first looks only like chasing , is , I do believe , words .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 8]: The character looks to me like German .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 7]: I wish I could read it .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 8]: I am but a poor German scholar .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 12]: Do look at it , please , dear Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 23]: Euphra glanced slightly at it without touching it , and said : `` I am sure I could make nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 31]: -- But , '' she added , as if struck by a sudden thought , `` as Lady Emily seems interested in it -- suppose we send for Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 13]: I have no doubt he will be able to decipher it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 26]: She rose as if she would go for him herself ; but , apparently on second thoughts , went to the bell and rang it .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 21]: do not trouble yourself , '' interposed Lady Emily , in a tone that showed she would like it notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 16]: `` No trouble at all , '' answered Euphra and her uncle in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 25]: `` Jacob , '' said Mr. Arnold , `` take my compliments to Mr. Sutherland , and ask him to step this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 8]: The man went , and Hugh came .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 20]: `` There 's a puzzle for you , Mr. Sutherland , '' said Mr. Arnold , as he entered .
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 16]: `` Decipher that inscription , and gain the favour of Lady Emily for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 12]: As he spoke he put the ring in Hugh 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 6]: Hugh recognized it at once .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 12]: this is Lady Euphrasia 's wonderful ring , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 10]: Euphra cast on him one of her sudden glances .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 9]: `` What do you know about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 6]: said Mr. Arnold , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 9]: Euphra flashed at him once more , covertly .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 13]: `` I only know that this is the ring in her portrait .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 25]: Any one may see that it is a very wonderful ring indeed , by only looking at it , '' answered Hugh , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 24]: `` I hope it is not too wonderful for you to get at the mystery of it , though , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 4]: said Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 14]: `` Lady Emily is dying to understand the inscription , '' said Euphrasia .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 20]: By this time Hugh was turning it round and round , trying to get a beginning to the legend .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 9]: But in this he met with a difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 26]: The fact was , that the initial letter of the inscription could only be found by looking into the crystal held close to the eye .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 24]: The words seemed not altogether unknown to him , though the characters were a little strange , and the words themselves were undivided .
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 5]: The dinner bell rang .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 12]: how the time goes in your room , Lady Emily ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 15]: said Mr. Arnold , who was never known to keep dinner waiting a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 12]: `` Will you venture to go down with us to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 8]: `` I fear I must not to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 5]: To-morrow , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 10]: But do put up these beauties before you go .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 29]: I dare not touch them without you , and it is so much more pleasure seeing them , when I have you to tell me about them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 20]: `` Well , throw them in , '' said Mr. Arnold , pretending an indifference he did not feel .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 16]: `` The reality of dinner must not be postponed to the fancy of jewels . ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 29]: All this time Hugh had stood poring over the ring at the window , whither he had taken it for better light , as the shadows were falling .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: Euphra busied herself replacing everything in the box .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 11]: When all were in , she hastily shut the lid .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 7]: `` Well , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 4]: said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 23]: `` I seem on the point of making it out , Mr. Arnold , but I certainly have not succeeded yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 13]: `` Confess yourself vanquished , then , and come to dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 45]: `` I am very unwilling to give in , for I feel convinced that if I had leisure to copy the inscription as far as I can read it , I should , with the help of my dictionary , soon supply the rest .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 20]: I am very unwilling , as well , to lose a chance of the favour of Lady Emily . ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 11]: `` Yes , do read it , if you can .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 12]: I too am dying to hear it , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 11]: `` Will you trust me with it , Mr. Arnold ?
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 10]: I will take the greatest care of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 6]: `` Oh , certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 25]: replied Mr. Arnold -- with a little hesitation in his tone , however , of which Hugh was too eager to take any notice .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 24]: He carried it to his room immediately , and laid it beside his manuscript verses , in the hiding-place of the old escritoire .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 9]: He was in the drawing-room a moment after .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 9]: There he found Euphra and the Bohemian alone .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 26]: -- Von Funkelstein had , in an incredibly short space of time , established himself as Hausfreund , and came and went as he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 22]: -- They looked as if they had been interrupted in a hurried and earnest conversation -- their faces were so impassive .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 14]: Yet Euphra 's wore a considerably heightened colour -- a more articulate indication .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 11]: She could school her features , but not her complexion .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 3]: THE WAGER .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 36]: He ... stakes this ring ; And would so , had it been a carbuncle Of Ph bus ' wheel ; and might so safely , had it Been all the worth of his car .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 2]: Cymbeline .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 12]: Hugh , of course , had an immediate attack of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 51]: Wishing to show it in one quarter , and hide it in every other , he carefully abstained from looking once in the direction of Euphra ; while , throughout the dinner , he spoke to every one else as often as there was the smallest pretext for doing so .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 13]: To enable himself to keep this up , he drank wine freely .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 23]: As he was in general very moderate , by the time the ladies rose , it had begun to affect his brain .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 38]: It was not half so potent , however , in its influences , as the parting glance which Euphra succeeded at last , as she left the room , in sending through his eyes to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 18]: Hugh sat down to the table again , with a quieter tongue , but a busier brain .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 10]: He drank still , without thinking of the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 30]: A strong will kept him from showing any signs of intoxication , but he was certainly nearer to that state than he had ever been in his life before .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 14]: The Bohemian started the new subject which generally follows the ladies ' departure .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 18]: `` How long is it since Arnstead was first said to be haunted , Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 3]: `` Haunted !
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 4]: Herr von Funkelstein ?
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 42]: I am at a loss to understand you , '' replied Mr. Arnold , who resented any such allusion , being subversive of the honour of his house , almost as much as if it had been depreciative of his own .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 11]: I thought it was an open subject of remark . ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 16]: `` So it is , '' said Hugh ; `` every one knows that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 8]: Mr. Arnold was struck dumb with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 37]: Before he had recovered himself sufficiently to know what to say , the conversation between the other two had assumed a form to which his late experiences inclined him to listen with some degree of interest .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 21]: But , his pride sternly forbidding him to join in it , he sat sipping his wine in careless sublimity .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 10]: `` You have seen it yourself , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 4]: said the Bohemian .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 11]: `` I did not say that , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 17]: `` But I heard one of the maids say once -- when -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 15]: This hesitation of his witnessed against him afterwards , in Mr. Arnold 's judgment .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 7]: But he took no notice now .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 18]: -- Hugh ended tamely enough : `` Why , it is commonly reported amongst the servants . ''
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 6]: `` With a blue light ?
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 16]: -- Such as we saw that night from the library window , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 11]: `` I did not say that , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 15]: `` Besides , it was nothing of the sort you saw from the library .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 6]: It was only the moon .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 7]: But -- '' He paused again .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 13]: Von Funkelstein saw the condition he was in , and pressed him .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: `` You know something more , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 10]: Hugh hesitated again , but only for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 31]: `` Well , then , '' he said , `` I have seen the spectre myself , walking in her white grave-clothes , in the Ghost 's Avenue -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 4]: Funkelstein looked anxious .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 6]: `` Were you frightened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 4]: `` Frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 11]: repeated Hugh , in a tone of the greatest contempt .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 15]: `` I am of Don Juan 's opinion with regard to such gentry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 7]: `` What is that ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 19]: ` That soul and body , on the whole , Are odds against a disembodied soul . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 4]: cried the count .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 38]: `` You despise all these tales about Lady Euphrasia , wandering about the house with a death-candle in her hand , looking everywhere about as if she had lost something , and could n't find it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 2]: pooh !
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 8]: I wish I could meet her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 12]: `` Then you do n't believe a word of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 7]: `` I do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 23]: There would be less of courage than boasting in talking so , if I did not believe a word of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 8]: `` Then you do believe it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 31]: But Hugh was too much of a Scotchman to give a hasty opinion , or rather a direct answer -- even when half-tipsy ; especially when such was evidently desired .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 12]: He only shook and nodded his head at the same moment .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 14]: `` Do you really mean you would meet her if you could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 16]: `` Then , if all tales are true , you may , without much difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 27]: For the coachman told me only to-day , that you may see her light in the window of that room almost any night , towards midnight .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 106]: He told me , too -LRB- for I made quite a friend of him to-day , on purpose to hear his tales -RRB- , that one of the maids , who left the other day , told the groom -- and he told the coachman -- that she had once heard talking ; and , peeping through the key-hole of a door that led into that part of the old house , saw a figure , dressed exactly like the picture of Lady Euphrasia , wandering up and down , wringing her hands and beating her breast , as if she were in terrible trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 27]: She had a light in her hand which burned awfully blue , and her face was the face of a corpse , with pale-green spots . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 21]: `` You think to frighten me , Funkelstein , and make me tremble at what I said a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 5]: Instead of repeating that .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 20]: I say now : I will sleep in Lady Euphrasia 's room this night , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 12]: `` I lay you a hundred guineas you wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 4]: cried the Bohemian .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 4]: `` Done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 8]: said Hugh , offering him his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 16]: Funkelstein took it ; and so the bet was committed to the decision of courage .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 23]: `` Well , gentlemen , '' interposed Mr. Arnold at last , `` you might have left a corner for me somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 11]: Without my permission you will hardly settle your wager . ''
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 13]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Arnold , '' said Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 13]: `` We got rather excited over it , and forgot our manners .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 16]: But I am quite willing to give it up , if Mr. Sutherland will . ''
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 24]: `` Not I , '' said Hugh ; -- `` that is , of course , if Mr. Arnold has no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 5]: `` Of course not .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 21]: My house , ghost and all , is at your service , gentlemen , '' responded Mr. Arnold , rising .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 6]: They went to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 13]: Mr. Arnold , strange to say , was in a good humour .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 22]: He walked up to Mrs. Elton , and said : `` These wicked men have been betting , Mrs. Elton . ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 24]: `` I am surprised they should be so silly , '' said she , with a smile , taking it as a joke .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 9]: `` What have they been betting about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 9]: said Euphra , coming up to her uncle .
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 23]: `` Herr von Funkelstein has laid a hundred guineas that Mr. Sutherland will not sleep in Lady Euphrasia 's room to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 4]: Euphra turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 12]: `` By sleep I suppose you mean spend the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 5]: said Hugh to Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 13]: `` I can not be certain of sleeping , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 50]: `` Of course , I mean that , '' answered the other ; and , turning to Euphrasia , continued : `` I must say I consider it rather courageous of him to dare the spectre as he does , for he can not say he disbelieves in her .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 20]: But come and sing me one of the old songs , '' he added , in an under tone .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 48]: Euphra allowed him to lead her to the piano ; but instead of singing a song to him , she played some noisy music , through which he and she contrived to talk for some time , without being overheard ; after which he left the room .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 18]: Euphra then looked round to Hugh , and begged him with her eyes to come to her .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 12]: He could not resist , burning with jealousy as he was .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 14]: `` Are you sure you have nerve enough for this , Hugh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 6]: she said , still playing .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 25]: `` I have had nerve enough to sit still and look at you for the last half hour , '' answered Hugh , rudely .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 14]: She turned pale , and glanced up at him with a troubled look .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 26]: Then , without responding to his answer , said : `` I daresay the count is not over-anxious to hold you to your bet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 17]: `` Pray intercede for me with the count , madam , '' answered Hugh , sarcastically .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 15]: `` He would not wish the young fool to be frightened , I daresay .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 20]: But perhaps he wishes to have an interview with the ghost himself , and grudges me the privilege . ''
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 23]: She turned deadly pale this time , and gave him one terrified glance , but made no other reply to his words .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 5]: Still she played on .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 7]: `` You will arm yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 5]: `` Against a ghost ?
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 8]: Yes , with a stout heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 17]: `` But do n't forget the secret door through which we came that night , Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 6]: I distrust the count . ''
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 15]: The last words were spoken in a whisper , emphasized into almost a hiss .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 8]: `` Tell him I shall be armed .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 9]: I tell you I shall meet him bare-handed .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 7]: Betray me if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 12]: Hugh had taken his revenge , and now came the reaction .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 46]: He gazed at Euphra ; but instead of the injured look , which was the best he could hope to see , an expression of `` pity and ruth '' grew slowly in her face , making it more lovely than ever in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 25]: At last she seemed on the point of bursting into tears ; and , suddenly changing the music , she began playing a dead-march .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 8]: She kept her eyes on the keys .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 36]: Once more , only , she glanced round , to see whether Hugh was still by her side ; and he saw that her face was pale as death , and wet with silent tears .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 8]: He had never seen her weep before .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 15]: He would have fallen at her feet , had he been alone with her .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 15]: To hide his feelings , he left the room , and then the house .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 21]: He wandered into the Ghost 's Walk ; and , finding himself there , walked up and down in it .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 22]: This was certainly throwing the lady a bold challenge , seeing he was going to spend the night in her room .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 21]: The excitement into which jealousy had thrown him , had been suddenly checked by the sight of Euphra 's tears .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 58]: The reaction , too , after his partial intoxication , had already begun to set in ; to be accounted for partly by the fact that its source had been chiefly champagne , and partly by the other fact , that he had bound himself in honour , to dare a spectre in her own favourite haunt .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 25]: On the other hand , the sight of Euphra 's emotion had given him a far better courage than jealousy or wine could afford .
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 28]: Yet , after ten minutes passed in the shadows of the Ghost 's Walk , he would not have taken the bet at ten times its amount .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 20]: But to lose it now would have been a serious affair for him , the disgrace of failure unconsidered .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 42]: If he could have lost a hundred guineas , it would have been comparatively a slight matter ; but to lose a bet , and be utterly unable to pay it , would be disgraceful -- no better than positive cheating .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 10]: He had not thought of this at the time .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 23]: Nor , even now , was it more than a passing thought ; for he had not the smallest desire to recede .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 37]: The ambition of proving his courage to Euphra , and , far more , the strength just afforded him by the sight of her tears , were quite sufficient to carry him on to the ordeal .
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 16]: Whether they would carry him through it with dignity , he did not ask himself .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 10]: And , after all , would the ghost appear ?
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 49]: At the best , she might not come ; at the very worst , she would be but a ghost ; and he could say with Hamlet -- `` for my soul , what can it do to that , Being a thing as immortal as itself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 51]: But then , his jealousy having for the moment intermitted , Hugh was not able to say with Hamlet -- `` I do not set my life at a pin 's fee ; '' and that had much to do with Hamlet 's courage in the affair of the ghost .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 34]: He walked up and down the avenue , till , beginning to feel the night chilly , he began to feel the avenue eerie ; for cold is very antagonistic to physical courage .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 12]: But what refuge would he find in the ghost 's room ?
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 6]: He returned to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 13]: Von Funkelstein and Euphra were there alone , but in no proximity .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 5]: Mr. Arnold soon entered .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 14]: `` Shall I have the bed prepared for you , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 3]: said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 13]: `` Which of your maids will you persuade to that office ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 9]: said Mr. Arnold , with a facetious expression .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 18]: `` I must do it myself , '' answered Euphra , `` if Mr. Sutherland persists . ''
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 22]: Hugh saw , or thought he saw , the Bohemian dart an angry glance at Euphra , who shrank under it .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 19]: But before he could speak , Mr. Arnold rejoined : `` You can make a bed , then ?
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 12]: That is the housemaid 's phrase , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 11]: `` I can do anything another can , uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 3]: `` Bravo !
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 7]: Can you see the ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 41]: `` Yes , '' she answered , with a low lingering on the sibilant ; looking round , at the same time , with an expression that implied a hope that Hugh had heard it ; as indeed he had .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 4]: Euphra too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 11]: said Mr. Arnold , in a tone of gentle contempt .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 15]: `` Do not disturb the ghost 's bed for me , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 19]: `` It would be a pity to disarrange it , after it has lain so for an age .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 19]: Besides , I need not rouse the wrath of the poor spectre more than ca n't be helped .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 16]: If I must sleep in her room , I need not sleep in her bed .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 8]: I will lie on the old couch .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 12]: Herr von Funkelstein , what proof shall I give you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 15]: `` Your word , Mr. Sutherland , '' replied Funkelstein , with a bow .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 9]: At what hour must I be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 6]: By eleven I should think .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 5]: any time before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 11]: That 's the ghost 's own , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 12]: It is now -- let me see -- almost ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 52]: `` Then I will go at once , '' said Hugh , thinking it better to meet the gradual approach of the phantom-hour in the room itself , than to walk there through the desolate house , and enter the room just as the fear would be gathering thickest within it .
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 40]: Besides , he was afraid that his courage might have broken down a little by that time , and that he would not be able to conceal entirely the anticipative dread , whose inroad he had reason to apprehend .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 17]: `` I have one good cup of tea yet , Mr. Sutherland , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 19]: `` Will you not strengthen your nerves with that , before we lead you to the tomb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 12]: `` Then she will go with me , '' thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 11]: `` I will , thank you , Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 15]: He approached the table at which she stood pouring out the cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 20]: She said , low and hurriedly , without raising her head : `` Do n't go , dear Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 9]: You do n't know what may happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 7]: `` I will go , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 8]: Not even you shall prevent me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 15]: `` I will pay the wager for you -- lend you the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 4]: `` Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 7]: -- The tone implied many things .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 4]: Mr. Arnold approached .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 4]: Other conversation followed .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 16]: As half-past ten chimed from the clock on the chimney-piece , Hugh rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 36]: `` I will just get a book from my room , '' he said ; `` and then perhaps Herr von Funkelstein will be kind enough to see me make a beginning at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 5]: `` Certainly I will .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 15]: And I advise you to let the book be Edgar Poe 's Tales . ''
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 13]: I shall need all the courage I have , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 7]: I shall find you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 13]: Hugh went to his room , and washed his face and hands .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 22]: Before doing so , he pulled off his finger a ring of considerable value , which had belonged to his father .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 24]: As he was leaving the room to return to the company , he remembered that he had left the ring on the washhand-stand .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 38]: He generally left it there at night ; but now he bethought himself that , as he was not going to sleep in the room , it might be as well to place it in the escritoire .
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 22]: He opened the secret place , and laid the diamond beside his poems and the crystal ring belonging to Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 26]: This done , he took up his book again , and , returning to the drawing-room , found the whole party prepared to accompany him .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: Mr. Arnold had the keys .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 13]: Von Funkelstein and he went first , and Hugh followed with Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 24]: `` We will not contribute to your discomfiture by locking the doors on the way , Mr. Sutherland , '' said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 23]: `` That is , you will not compel me to win the wager in spite of my fears , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 19]: `` But you will let the ghost loose on the household , '' said the Bohemian , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 13]: `` I will be responsible for that , '' replied Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 8]: Euphra dropped a little behind with Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 10]: `` Remember the secret passage , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 18]: `` You can get out when you will , whether they lock the door , or not .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 10]: Do n't carry it too far , Hugh . ''
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 8]: `` The ghost you mean , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 14]: -- I do n't think I shall , '' said Hugh , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 12]: But as he laughed , an involuntary shudder passed through him .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 10]: `` Have I stepped over my own grave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 3]: thought he .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 8]: They reached the room , and entered .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 38]: Hugh would have begged them to lock him in , had he not felt that his knowledge of the secret door , would , although he intended no use of it , render such a proposal dishonourable .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 22]: They gave him the key of the door , to lock it on the inside , and bade him good night .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 46]: They were just leaving him , when Hugh on whom a new light had broken at last , in the gradual restoration of his faculties , said to the Bohemian : `` One word with you , Herr von Funkelstein , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 30]: Funkelstein followed him into the room ; when Hugh half-closing the door , said : `` I trust to your sympathy , as gentleman , not to misunderstand me .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 14]: I wagered a hundred guineas with you in the heat of after-dinner talk .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 11]: I am not at present worth a hundred shillings . ''
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 57]: began Funkelstein , with a sneer , `` if you wish to get off on that ground -- '' `` Herr von Funkelstein , '' interrupted Hugh , in a very decided tone , `` I pointed to your sympathy as a gentleman , as the ground on which I had hoped to meet you now .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 19]: If you have difficulty in finding that ground , another may be found to-morrow without much seeking . ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 27]: Hugh paused for a moment after making this grand speech ; but Funkelstein did not seem to understand him : he stood in a waiting attitude .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 69]: Hugh therefore went on : `` Meantime , what I wanted to say is this : -- I have just left a ring in my room , which , though in value considerably below the sum mentioned between us , may yet be a pledge of my good faith , in as far as it is of infinitely more value to me than can be reckoned in money .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 25]: It was the property of one who by birth , and perhaps by social position as well , was Herr von Funkelstein 's equal .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 13]: The ring is a diamond , and belonged to my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 18]: Von Funkelstein merely replied : `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Sutherland , for misunderstanding you .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 8]: The ring is quite an equivalent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 13]: And making him a respectful bow , he turned and left him .
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 4]: THE LADY EUPHRASIA .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 15]: The black jades of swart night trot foggy rings ` Bout heaven 's brow .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 7]: 'T is now stark dead night .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 3]: JOHN MARSTON .
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 8]: -- Second Part of Antonio and Mellida .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 38]: As soon as Hugh was alone , his first action was to lock the door by which he had entered ; his next to take the key from the lock , and put it in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 44]: He then looked if there were any other fastenings , and finding an old tarnished brass bolt as well , succeeded in making it do its duty for the first time that century , which required some persuasion , as may be supposed .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 8]: He then turned towards the other door .
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 37]: As he crossed the room , he found four candles , a decanter of port , and some biscuits , on a table -- placed there , no doubt , by the kind hands of Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 12]: He vowed to himself that he would not touch the wine .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 15]: `` I have had enough of that for one night , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 22]: But he lighted the candles ; and then saw that the couch was provided with plenty of wraps for the night .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 20]: One of them -- he recognised to his delight -- was a Cameron tartan , often worn by Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 17]: He buried his face in it for a moment , and drew from it fresh courage .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 20]: He then went into the furthest recess , lifted the tapestry , and proceeded to fasten the concealed door .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 14]: But , to his discomfiture , he could find no fastening upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 21]: `` No doubt , '' thought he , `` it does fasten , in some secret way or other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 6]: But he could discover none .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 34]: There was no mark of bolt or socket to show whence one had been removed , nor sign of friction to indicate that the door had ever been made secure in such fashion .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 6]: It closed with a spring .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 18]: `` Then , '' said Hugh , apostrophising the door , `` I must watch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 56]: As , however , it was not yet near the time when ghosts are to be expected , and as he felt very tired , he drank one glass of the wine , and throwing himself on the couch , drew Euphra 's shawl over him , opened his book , and began to read .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 14]: But the words soon vanished in a bewildering dance , and he slept .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 27]: He started awake in that agony of fear in which I suppose most people have awaked in the night , once or twice in their lives .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 8]: He felt that he was not alone .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 30]: But the feeling seemed , when he recalled it , to have been altogether different from that with which we recognise the presence of the most unwelcome bodily visitor .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 12]: The whole of his nervous skeleton seemed to shudder and contract .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 19]: Every sense was intensified to the acme of its acuteness ; while the powers of volition were inoperative .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 7]: He could not move a finger .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 20]: The moment in which he first saw the object I am about to describe , he could not recall .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 30]: The impression made seemed to have been too strong for the object receiving it , destroying thus its own traces , as an overheated brand-iron would in dry timber .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 20]: Or it may be that , after such a pre-sensation , the cause of it could not surprise him .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 72]: He saw , a few paces off , bending as if looking down upon him , a face which , if described as he described it , would be pronounced as far past the most liberal boundary-line of art , as itself had passed beyond that degree of change at which a human countenance is fit for the upper world no longer , and must be hidden away out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 22]: The lips were dark , and drawn back from the closed teeth , which were white as those of a skull .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 25]: There were spots -- in fact , the face corresponded exactly to the description given by Funkelstein of the reported ghost of Lady Euphrasia .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 13]: The dress was point for point correspondent to that in the picture .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 59]: Had the portrait of Lady Euphrasia been hanging on the wall above , instead of the portrait of the unknown nun , Hugh would have thought , as far as dress was concerned , that it had come alive , and stepped from its frame -- except for one thing : there was no ring on the thumb .
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 39]: It was wonderful to himself afterwards , that he should have observed all these particulars ; but the fact was , that they rather burnt themselves in upon his brain , than were taken notice of by him .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 19]: They returned upon him afterwards by degrees , as one becomes sensible of the pain of a wound .
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 8]: But there was one sign of life .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 50]: Though the eyes were closed , tears flowed from them ; and seemed to have worn channels for their constant flow down this face of death , which ought to have been lying still in the grave , returning to its dust , and was weeping above ground instead .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 23]: The figure stood for a moment , as one who would gaze , could she but open her heavy , death-rusted eyelids .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 12]: Then , as if in hopeless defeat , she turned away .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 40]: And then , to crown the horror literally as well as figuratively , Hugh saw that her hair sparkled and gleamed goldenly , as the hair of a saint might , if the aureole were combed down into it .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 66]: She moved towards the door with a fettered pace , such as one might attribute to the dead if they walked ; -- to the dead body , I say , not to the living ghost ; to that which has lain in the prison-hold , till the joints are decayed with the grave-damps , and the muscles are stiff with more than deathly cold .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 26]: She dragged one limb after the other slowly and , to appearance , painfully , as she moved towards the door which Hugh had locked .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 33]: When she had gone half-way to the door , Hugh , lying as he was on a couch , could see her feet , for her dress did not reach the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 59]: They were bare , as the feet of the dead ought to be , which are about to tread softly in the realm of Hades , But how stained and mouldy and iron-spotted , as if the rain had been soaking through the spongy coffin , did the dress show beside the pure whiteness of those exquisite feet !
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 10]: Not a sign of the tomb was upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 45]: Small , living , delicately formed , Hugh , could he have forgot the face they bore above , might have envied the floor which in their nakedness they seemed to caress , so lingeringly did they move from it in their noiseless progress .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 14]: She reached the door , put out her hand , and touched it .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 10]: Hugh saw it open outwards and let her through .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 12]: Nor did this strike him as in the smallest degree marvellous .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 11]: It closed again behind her , noiseless as her footfalls .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 20]: The moment she vanished , the power of motion returned to him , and Hugh sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 6]: He leaped to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 17]: With trembling hand he inserted the key , and the lock creaked as he turned it .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 60]: In proof of his being in tolerable possession of his faculties at the moment , and that what he was relating to me actually occurred , he told me that he remembered at once that he had heard that peculiar creak , a few moments before Euphra and he discovered that they were left alone in this very chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 8]: He had never thought of it before .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 22]: Still the door would not open : it was bolted as well , and the bolt was very stiff to withdraw .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 6]: But at length he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 23]: When he reached the passage outside , he thought he saw the glimmer of a light , perhaps in the picture-gallery beyond .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 7]: Towards this he groped his way .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 48]: -- He could never account for the fact , that he left the candles burning in the room behind him and went forward into the darkness , except by supposing that his wits had gone astray , in consequence of the shock the apparition had occasioned them .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 28]: -- When he reached the gallery , there was no light there ; but somewhere in the distance he saw , or fancied , a faint shimmer .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 14]: The impulse to go towards it was too strong to be disputed with .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 8]: He advanced with outstretched arms , groping .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 29]: After a few steps , he had lost all idea of where he was , or how he ought to proceed in order to reach any known quarter .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 5]: The light had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 3]: He stood .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 14]: -- Was that a stealthy step he heard beside him in the dark ?
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 15]: He had no time to speculate , for the next moment he fell senseless .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 3]: NEXT MORNING .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 36]: Darkness is fled : look , infant morn hath drawn Bright silver curtains ` bout the couch of night ; And now Aurora 's horse trots azure rings , Breathing fair light about the firmament .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 6]: Stand ; what 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 3]: JOHN MARSTON .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 8]: -- Second Part of Antonio and Mellida .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 18]: When he came to himself , it was with a slow flowing of the tide of consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 4]: His head ached .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 6]: Had he fallen down stairs ?
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 16]: -- or had he struck his head against some projection , and so stunned himself ?
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 17]: The last he remembered was -- standing quite still in the dark , and hearing something .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 6]: Had he been knocked down ?
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 5]: He could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 5]: -- Where was he ?
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 9]: Could the ghost have been all a dream ?
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 13]: and this headache be nature 's revenge upon last night 's wine ?
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 26]: -- For he lay on the couch in the haunted chamber , and on his bosom lay the book over which he had dropped asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 10]: Mingled with all this doubt , there was another .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 26]: For he remembered that , when consciousness first returned , he felt as if he had seen Euphra 's face bending down close over his .
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 6]: -- Could it be possible ?
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 11]: Had Euphra herself come to see how he had fared ?
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 18]: -- The room lay in the grey light of the dawn , but Euphra was nowhere visible .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 10]: Could she have vanished ashamed through the secret door ?
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 42]: Or had she been only a phantasy , a projection outwards of the form that dwelt in his brain ; a phenomenon often occurring when the last of sleeping and the first of waking are indistinguishably blended in a vague consciousness ?
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 10]: But if it was so , then the ghost ?
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 5]: -- what of it ?
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 21]: Had not his brain , by the events of the preceding evening , been similarly prepared with regard to it ?
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 42]: Was it not more likely , after all , that she too was the offspring of his own imagination -- the power that makes images -- especially when considered , that she exactly corresponded to the description given by the Bohemian ?
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 17]: -- But had he not observed many points at which the Count had not even hinted ?
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 70]: -- Still , it was as natural to expect that an excited imagination should supply the details of a wholly imaginary spectacle , as that , given the idea of Euphra 's presence , it should present the detail of her countenance ; for the creation of that which is not , belongs as much to the realm of the imagination , as the reproduction of that which is .
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 57]: It seemed very strange to Hugh himself , that he should be able thus to theorize , before even he had raised himself from the couch on which , perhaps , after all , he had lain without moving , throughout that terrible night , swarming with the horrors of the dead that would not sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 34]: But the long unconsciousness , in which he had himself visited the regions of death , seemed to have restored him , in spite of his aching head , to perfect mental equilibrium .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 16]: Or , at least , his brain was quiet enough to let his mind work .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 8]: Still , he felt very ghastly within .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 13]: He raised himself on his elbow , and looked into the room .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 21]: Everything was the same as it had been the night before , only with an altered aspect in the dawn-light .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 31]: The dawn has a peculiar terror of its own , sometimes perhaps even more real in character , but very different from the terrors of the night and of candle-light .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 52]: The room looked as if no ghost could have passed through its still old musty atmosphere , so perfectly reposeful did it appear ; and yet it seemed as if some umbra , some temporary and now cast-off body of the ghost , must be lying or lingering somewhere about it .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 13]: He rose , and peeped into the recess where the cabinet stood .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 11]: Nothing was there but the well remembered carving and blackness .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 30]: Having once yielded to the impulse , he could not keep from peering every moment , now into one , and now into another of the many hidden corners .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 40]: The next suggesting itself for examination , was always one he could not see from where he stood : -- after all , even in the daylight , there might be some dead thing there -- who could tell ?
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 32]: But he remained manfully at his post till the sun rose ; till bell after bell rang from the turret ; till , in short , Funkelstein came to fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 11]: `` Good morning , Mr. Sutherland , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 7]: `` How have you slept ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 17]: `` Like a -- somnambulist , '' answered Hugh , choosing the word for its intensity .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 12]: `` I slept so sound that I woke quite early . ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 8]: `` I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 20]: But it is nearly time for breakfast , for which ceremony I am myself hardly in trim yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 13]: So saying , Funkelstein turned , and walked away with some precipitation .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 27]: What occasioned Hugh a little surprise ; was , that he did not ask him one question more as to how he had passed the night .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 18]: He had , of course , slept in the house , seeing he presented himself in deshabille .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 34]: Hugh hastened to his own room , where , under the anti-ghostial influences of the bath , he made up his mind not to say a word about the apparition to any one .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 14]: `` Well , Mr. Sutherland , how have you spent the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 7]: said Mr. Arnold , greeting him .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 29]: `` I slept with profound stupidity , '' answered Hugh ; `` a stupidity , in fact , quite worthy of the folly of the preceding wager . ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 28]: This was true , as relating to the time during which he had slept , but was , of course , false in the impression it gave .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 9]: exclaimed Mr. Arnold , with an unwonted impulsiveness .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 20]: `` The best mood , I consider , in which to meet such creations of other people 's brains !
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 12]: And you positively passed a pleasant night in the awful chamber ?
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 7]: That is something to tell Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 7]: But she is not down yet .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 30]: You have restored the character of my house , Mr. Sutherland ; and next to his own character , a man ought to care for that of his house .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 10]: I am greatly in your debt , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 24]: At this moment , Euphra 's maid brought the message , that her mistress was sorry she was unable to appear at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 6]: Mrs. Elton took her place .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 23]: `` The day is so warm and still , Mr. Arnold , that I think Lady Emily might have a drive to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 14]: Perhaps Miss Cameron may be able to join us by that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 17]: `` I can not think what is the matter with Euphra , '' said Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 12]: `` She never used to be affected in this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 10]: `` Should you not seek some medical opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 4]: said Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 10]: `` These constant headaches must indicate something wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 19]: The constant headache had occurred just once before , since Mrs. Elton had formed one of the family .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 12]: After a pause , Mr. Arnold reverted to the former subject .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 12]: `` You are most welcome to the carriage , Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 18]: I am sorry I can not accompany you myself ; but I must go to town to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 12]: You can take Mr. Sutherland with you , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 8]: He will take care of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 11]: `` I shall be most happy , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 12]: `` So shall we all , '' responded Mrs. Elton kindly .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 19]: `` Thank you , Mr. Arnold ; though I am sorry you ca n't go with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 10]: `` What hour shall I order the carriage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 7]: `` About one , I think .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 11]: Will Herr von Funkelstein favour us with his company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 19]: `` I am sorry , '' replied Funkelstein ; `` but I too must leave for London to-day .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 13]: Shall I have the pleasure of accompanying you , Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 13]: `` With all my heart , if you can leave so early .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 12]: I must go at once to catch the express train . ''
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 10]: `` I shall be ready in ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 5]: `` Very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 13]: `` Pray , Mrs. Elton , make my adieus to Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 10]: I am concerned to hear of her indisposition . ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 4]: `` With pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 7]: I am going to her now .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 30]: As soon as Mrs. Elton left the breakfast-room , Mr. Arnold rose , saying : `` I will walk round to the stable , and order the carriage myself .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 24]: I shall then be able , through your means , Mr. Sutherland , to put a stop to these absurd rumours in person .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 51]: Not that I mean to say anything direct , as if I placed any importance upon it ; but , the coachman being an old servant , I shall be able through him , to send the report of your courage and its result , all over the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 10]: This was a very gracious explanation of his measures .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 17]: As he concluded it , he left the room , without allowing time for a reply .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 35]: Hugh had not expected such an immediate consequence of his policy , and felt rather uncomfortable ; but he soon consoled himself by thinking , `` At least it will do no harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 14]: While Mr. Arnold was speaking , Funkelstein had been writing at a side-table .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 15]: He now handed Hugh a cheque on a London banking-house for a hundred guineas .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 54]: Hugh , in his innocence , could not help feeling ashamed of gaining such a sum by such means ; for betting , like tobacco-smoking , needs a special training before it can be carried out quite comfortably , especially by the winner , if he be at all of a generous nature .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 25]: But he felt that to show the least reluctance would place him at great disadvantage with a man of the world like the count .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 49]: He therefore thanked him slightly , and thrust the cheque into his trowsers-pocket , as if a greater sum of money than he had ever handled before were nothing more for him to win , than the count would choose it to be considered for him to lose .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 8]: He thought with himself : `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 17]: well , I need not make use of it ; '' and repaired to the school-room .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 16]: Here he found Harry waiting for him , looking tolerably well , and tolerably happy .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 64]: This was a great relief to Hugh , for he had not seen him at the breakfast-table -- Harry having risen early and breakfasted before ; and he had felt very uneasy lest the boy should have missed him in the night -LRB- for they were still bed-fellows -RRB- , and should in consequence have had one of his dreadful attacks of fear .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 11]: -- It was evident that this had not taken place .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 3]: AN ACCIDENT .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 12]: There 's a special providence in the fall of a sparrow .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 2]: Hamlet .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 29]: When Mrs. Elton left the breakfast table , she went straight to Miss Cameron 's room to inquire after her , expecting to find her maid with her .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 13]: But when she knocked at the door , there was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 18]: She went therefore to her own room , and sent her maid to find Euphra 's maid .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 3]: She came .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 13]: `` Is your mistress going to get up to-day , Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 4]: asked Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 8]: `` I do n't know , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 7]: She has not rung yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 12]: `` Have you not been to see how she is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 6]: `` No , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 14]: `` How was it you brought that message at breakfast , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 9]: Jane looked confused , and did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 4]: `` Jane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 10]: said Mrs. Elton , in a tone of objurgation .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 16]: `` Well , ma'am , she told me to say so , '' answered Jane .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 8]: `` How did she tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 4]: Jane paused again .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 47]: `` Through the door , ma'am , '' she answered at length ; and then muttered , that they would make her tell lies by asking her questions she could n't answer ; and she wished she was out of the house , that she did .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 14]: Mrs. Elton heard this , and , of course , felt considerably puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 19]: `` Will you go now , please , and inquire after your mistress , with my compliments ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 8]: `` I dare n't , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 4]: `` Dare n't !
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 31]: `` Well , ma'am , there is something about my mistress -- '' Here she stopped abruptly ; but as Mrs. Elton stood expectant , she tried to go on .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 19]: All she could add , however , was -- `` No , ma'am ; I dare n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 13]: `` But there is no harm in going to her room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 7]: `` Oh , no , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 29]: I go to her room , summer and winter , at seven o'clock every morning , '' answered Jane , apparently glad to be able to say something .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 11]: `` Why wo n't you go now , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 19]: `` Why -- why -- because she told me -- '' Here the girl stammered and turned pale .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 24]: At length she forced out the words -- `` She wo n't let me tell you why , '' and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 9]: `` Wo n't let you tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 16]: repeated Mrs. Elton , beginning to think the girl must be out of her mind .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 39]: Jane looked hurriedly over her shoulder , as if she expected to see her mistress standing behind her , and then said , almost defiantly : `` No , she wo n't ; and I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 27]: With these words , she hurried out of the room , while Mrs. Elton turned with baffled bewilderment to seek counsel from the face of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 12]: As to what all this meant , I am in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 19]: I have recorded it as Margaret told it to Hugh afterwards -- because it seems to indicate something .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 31]: It shows evidently enough , that if Euphra had more than a usual influence over servants in general , she had a great deal more over this maid in particular .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 16]: Was this in virtue of a power similar to that of Count Halkar over herself ?
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 26]: And was this , or something very different , or both combined , the art which he had accused her of first exercising upon him ?
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 34]: Might the fact that her defeat had resulted in such absolute subjection , be connected with her possession of a power similar to his , which she had matched with his in vain ?
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 8]: Of course I only suggest these questions .
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 6]: I can not answer them .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 30]: At one o'clock , the carriage came round to the door ; and Hugh , in the hope of seeing Euphra alone , was the first in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 22]: Mrs. Elton and Lady Emily presently came , and proceeded to take their places , without seeming to expect Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 27]: Hugh helped them into the carriage ; but , instead of getting in , lingered , hoping that Euphra was yet going to make her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 20]: `` I fear Miss Cameron is unable to join us , '' said Mrs. Elton , divining his delay .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 13]: `` Shall I run up-stairs , and knock at her door ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 32]: `` Do , '' said Mrs. Elton , who , after the unsatisfactory conversation she had held with her maid , had felt both uneasy and curious , all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 22]: Hugh bounded up-stairs ; but , just as he was going to knock , the door opened , and Euphra appeared .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 4]: `` Dear Euphra !
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 6]: how ill you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 3]: exclaimed Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 18]: She was pale as death , and dark under the eyes ; and had evidently been weeping .
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 3]: hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 3]: she answered .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 7]: It is only a bad headache .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 9]: Do n't take any notice of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 8]: `` The carriage is at the door .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 8]: Will you not come with us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 5]: `` With whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 8]: `` Lady Emily and Mrs. Elton . ''
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 8]: `` I am sick of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 8]: `` I am going , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 6]: `` Stay with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 5]: `` I must go .
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 9]: I promised to take care of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 5]: `` Oh , nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 6]: What should happen to them ?
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 5]: Stay with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 5]: I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 6]: I wish I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 12]: `` Then I must go with you , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 6]: Yet her tone expressed annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 9]: thank you , '' cried Hugh in delight .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 4]: `` Make haste .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 12]: I will run down , and tell them to wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 18]: He bounded away , and told the ladies that Euphra would join them in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 27]: But Euphra was cool enough to inflict on them quite twenty minutes of waiting ; by which time she was able to behave with tolerable propriety .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 23]: When she did appear at last , she was closely veiled , and stepped into the carriage without once showing her face .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 26]: But she made a very pretty apology for the delay she had occasioned ; which was certainly due , seeing it had been perfectly intentional .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 18]: She made room for Hugh ; he took his place beside her ; and away they drove .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 15]: Euphra scarcely spoke ; but begged indulgence , on the ground of her headache .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 17]: Lady Emily enjoyed the drive very much , and said a great many pleasant little nothings .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 10]: `` Would you like a glass of milk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 15]: said Mrs. Elton to her , as they passed a farm-house on the estate .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 12]: `` I should -- very much , '' answered Lady Emily .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 16]: The carriage was stopped , and the servant sent to beg a glass of milk .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 30]: Euphra , who , from riding backward with a headache , had been feeling very uncomfortable for some time , wished to get out while the carriage was waiting .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 8]: Hugh jumped out , and assisted her .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 40]: She walked a little way , leaning on his arm , up to the house , where she had a glass of water ; after which she said she felt better , and returned with him to the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 32]: In getting in again , either from the carelessness or the weakness occasioned by suffering , her foot slipped from the step , and she fell with a cry of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 41]: Hugh caught her as she fell ; and she would not have been much injured , had not the horses started and sprung forward at the moment , so that the hind wheel of the carriage passed over her ankle .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 13]: Hugh , raising her in his arms , found she was insensible .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 11]: He laid her down upon the grass by the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 12]: Water was procured , but she showed no sign of recovering .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 7]: -- What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 12]: Mrs. Elton thought she had better be carried to the farm-house .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 11]: Hugh judged it better to take her home at once .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 12]: To this , after a little argument , Mrs. Elton agreed .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 20]: They lifted her into the carriage , and made what arrangements they best could to allow her to recline .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 26]: Blood was flowing from her foot ; and it was so much swollen that it was impossible to guess at the amount of the injury .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 55]: The foot was already twice the size of the other , in which Hugh for the first time recognised such a delicacy of form , as , to his fastidious eye and already ensnared heart , would have been perfectly enchanting , but for the agony he suffered from the injury to the other .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 39]: Yet he could not help the thought crossing his mind , that her habit of never lifting her dress was a very strange one , and that it must have had something to do with the present accident .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 43]: I can not account for this habit , but on one of two suppositions ; that of an affected delicacy , or that of the desire that the beauty of her feet should have its full power , from being rarely seen .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 23]: But it was dreadful to think how far the effects of this accident might permanently injure the beauty of one of them .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 23]: Hugh would have walked home that she might have more room , but he knew he could be useful when they arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 28]: He seated himself so as to support the injured foot , and prevent , in some measure , the torturing effects of the motion of the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 27]: When they had gone about half-way , she opened her eyes feebly , glanced at him , and closed them again with a moan of pain .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 19]: He carried her in his arms up to her own room , and laid her on a couch .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 11]: She thanked him by a pitiful attempt at a smile .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 11]: He mounted his horse , and galloped for a surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 25]: The injury was a serious one ; but until the swelling could be a little reduced , it was impossible to tell how serious .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 18]: The surgeon , however , feared that some of the bones of the ankle might be crushed .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 13]: The ankle seemed to be dislocated , and the suffering was frightful .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 15]: She endured it well , however -- so far as absolute silence constitutes endurance .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 6]: Hugh 's misery was extreme .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 28]: The surgeon had required his assistance ; but a suitable nurse soon arrived , and there was no pretext for his further presence in the sick chamber .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 6]: He wandered about the grounds .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 8]: Harry haunted his steps like a spaniel .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 21]: The poor boy felt it much ; and the suffering abstraction of Hugh sealed up his chief well of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 16]: At length he went to Mrs. Elton , who did her best to console him .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 19]: By the surgeon 's express orders , every one but the nurse was excluded from Euphra 's room .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 3]: MORE TROUBLES .
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 19]: Come on and do your best To fright me with your sprites : you 're powerful at it .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 17]: You smell this business with a sense as cold As is a dead man 's nose .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 5]: A Winter 's Tale .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 34]: When Mr. Arnold came home to dinner , and heard of the accident , his first feeling , as is the case with weak men , was one of mingled annoyance and anger .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 19]: Hugh was the chief object of it ; for had he not committed the ladies to his care ?
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 22]: And the economy of his house being partially disarranged by it , had he not a good right to be angry ?
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 29]: His second feeling was one of concern for his niece , which was greatly increased when he found that she was not in a state to see him .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 57]: Still , nothing must interfere with the order of things ; and when Hugh went into the drawing-room at the usual hour , he found Mr. Arnold standing there in tail coat and white neck-cloth , looking as if he had just arrived at a friend 's house , to make one of a stupid party .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 30]: And the party which sat down to dinner was certainly dreary enough , consisting only , besides the host himself , of Mrs. Elton , Hugh , and Harry .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 22]: Lady Emily had had exertion enough for the day , and had besides shared in the shock of Euphra 's misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 18]: Mr. Arnold was considerably out of humour , and ready to pounce upon any object of complaint .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 39]: He would have attacked Hugh with a pompous speech on the subject of his carelessness , but he was rather afraid of his tutor now ; -- so certainly will the stronger get the upper hand in time .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 12]: He did not even refer to the subject of the accident .
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 20]: Therefore , although it filled the minds of all at table , it was scarcely more than alluded to .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 71]: But having nothing at hand to find fault with more suitable , he laid hold of the first wise remark volunteered by good Mrs. Elton ; whereupon an amusing pas de deux immediately followed ; for it could not be called a duel , inasmuch as each antagonist kept skipping harmlessly about the other , exploding theological crackers , firmly believed by the discharger to be no less than bomb-shells .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 6]: At length Mrs. Elton withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 24]: `` By the way , Mr. Sutherland , '' said Mr. Arnold , `` have you succeeded in deciphering that curious inscription yet ?
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 15]: I do n't like the ring to remain long out of my own keeping .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 11]: It is quite an heirloom , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 14]: Hugh was forced to confess that he had never thought of it again .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 9]: `` Shall I fetch it at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 3]: added he .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 7]: no , '' replied Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 10]: `` I should really like to understand the inscription .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 7]: To-morrow will do perfectly well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 6]: They went to the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 4]: Everything was wretched .
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 25]: However many ghosts might be in the house , it seemed to Hugh that there was no soul in it except in one room .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 15]: The wind sighed fitfully , and the rain fell in slow , soundless showers .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 11]: Mr. Arnold felt the vacant oppression as well as Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 32]: Mrs Elton having gone to Lady Emily 's room , he proposed back gammon ; and on that surpassing game , the gentlemen expended the best part of two dreary hours .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 46]: When Hugh reached his room he was too tired and spiritless for any intellectual effort ; and , instead of trying to decipher the ring , went to bed , and slept as if there were never a ghost or a woman in the universe .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 36]: His first proceeding , after breakfast next day , was to get together his German books ; and his next to take out the ring , which was to be subjected to their analytical influences .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 12]: He went to his desk , and opened the secret place .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 5]: There he stood fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 6]: -- The ring was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 15]: His packet of papers was there , rather crumpled : the ring was nowhere .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 6]: What had become of it ?
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 10]: It was not long before a conclusion suggested itself .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 8]: It flashed upon him all at once .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 14]: `` The ghost has got it , '' he said , half aloud .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 10]: `` It is shining now on her dead finger .
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 5]: It was Lady Euphrasia .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 7]: She was going for it then .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 10]: It was n't on her thumb when she went .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 28]: She came back with it , shining through the dark -- stepped over me , perhaps , as I lay on the floor in her way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 9]: He shivered , like one in an ague-fit .
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 44]: Again and again , with that frenzied , mechanical motion , which , like the eyes of a ghost , has `` no speculation '' in it , he searched the receptacle , although it freely confessed its emptiness to any asking eye .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 14]: Then he stood gazing , and his heart seemed to stand still likewise .
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 17]: But a new thought stung him , turning him almost sick with a sense of loss .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 22]: Suddenly and frantically he dived his hand into the place yet again , useless as he knew the search to be .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 11]: He took up his papers , and scattered them loose .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 14]: It was all unavailing : his father 's ring was gone as well .
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 40]: He sank on a chair for a moment ; but , instantly recovering , found himself , before he was quite aware of his own resolution , halfway down stairs , on his way to Mr. Arnold 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 4]: It was empty .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 6]: He rang for his servant .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 16]: Mr. Arnold had gone away on horseback , and would not be home till dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 7]: Counsel from Mrs. Elton was hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 8]: Help from Euphra he could not ask .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 7]: He returned to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 8]: There he found Harry waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 9]: His neglected pupil was now his only comforter .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 8]: Such are the revenges of divine goodness .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 4]: `` Harry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 10]: he said , `` I have been robbed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 4]: `` Robbed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 6]: cried Harry , starting up .
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 16]: `` Never mind , Mr. Sutherland ; my papa 's a justice of the peace .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 9]: He 'll catch the thief for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 13]: `` But it 's your papa 's ring that they 've stolen .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 16]: He lent it to me , and what if he should not believe me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 8]: `` Not believe you , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 6]: But he must believe you .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 22]: I will tell him all about it ; and he knows I never told him a lie in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 13]: `` But you do n't know anything about it , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 12]: `` But you will tell me , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 16]: Hugh could not help smiling with pleasure at the confidence his pupil placed in him .
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 21]: He had not much fear about being believed , but , at the best , it was an unpleasant occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 20]: The loss of his own ring not only added to his vexation , but to his perplexity as well .
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 8]: What could she want with his ring ?
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 31]: Could she have carried with her such a passion for jewels , as to come from the grave to appropriate those of others as well as to reclaim her own ?
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 12]: Was this her comfort in Hades , ` poor ghost ' ?
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 23]: Would it be better to tell Mr. Arnold of the loss of both rings , or should he mention the crystal only ?
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 65]: He came to the conclusion that it would only exasperate him the more , and perhaps turn suspicion upon himself , if he communicated the fact that he too was a loser , and to such an extent ; for Hugh 's ring was worth twenty of the other , and was certainly as sacred as Mr. Arnold 's , if not so ancient .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 7]: He would bear it in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 18]: If the one could not be found , there could certainly be no hope of the other .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 9]: Punctual as the clock , Mr. Arnold returned .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 34]: It did not prejudice him in favour of the reporter of bad tidings , that he begged a word with him before dinner , when that was on the point of being served .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 29]: It was , indeed , exceeding impolitic ; but Hugh would have felt like an impostor , had he sat down to the table before making his confession .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 22]: `` Mr. Arnold , I am sorry to say I have been robbed , and in your house , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 5]: `` In my house ?
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 9]: Of what , pray , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 28]: Mr. Arnold had taken the information as some weak men take any kind of information referring to themselves or their belongings -- namely , as an insult .
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 9]: He drew himself up , and lowered portentously .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 9]: `` Of your ring , Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 8]: `` Of -- my -- ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 20]: And he looked at his ring-finger , as if he could not understand the import of Hugh 's words .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 14]: `` Of the ring you lent me to decipher , '' explained Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 13]: `` Do you suppose I do not understand you , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 15]: A ring which has been in the family for two hundred years at least !
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 4]: Robbed of it ?
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 4]: In my house ?
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 10]: You must have been disgracefully careless , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 6]: You have lost it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 35]: `` Mr. Arnold , '' said Hugh , with dignity , `` I am above using such a subterfuge , even if it were not certain to throw suspicion where it was undeserved . ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 13]: Mr. Arnold was a gentleman , as far as his self-importance allowed .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 18]: He did not apologize for what he had said , but he changed his manner at once .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 9]: `` I am quite bewildered , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 14]: It is a very annoying piece of news -- for many reasons . ''
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 23]: `` I can show you where I laid it -- in the safest corner in my room , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 7]: `` Of course , of course .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 7]: It is enough you say so .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 9]: We must not keep the dinner waiting now .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 18]: But after dinner I shall have all the servants up , and investigate the matter thoroughly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 38]: `` So , '' thought Hugh with himself , `` some one will be made a felon of , because the cursed dead go stalking about this infernal house at midnight , gathering their own old baubles .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 7]: No , that will not do .
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 18]: I must at least tell Mr. Arnold what I know of the doings of the night . ''
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 35]: So Mr. Arnold must still wait for his dinner ; or rather , which was really of more consequence in the eyes of Mr. Arnold , the dinner must be kept waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 41]: For order and custom were two of Mr. Arnold 's divinities ; and the economy of his whole nature was apt to be disturbed by any interruption of their laws , such as the postponement of dinner for ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 31]: He was walking towards the door , and turned with some additional annoyance when Hugh addressed him again : `` One moment , Mr. Arnold , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 7]: Mr. Arnold merely turned and waited .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 28]: `` I fear I shall in some degree forfeit your good opinion by what I am about to say , but I must run the risk . ''
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 5]: Mr. Arnold still waited .
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 16]: `` There is more about the disappearance of the ring than I can understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 9]: `` Or I either , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 24]: `` But I must tell you what happened to myself , the night that I kept watch in Lady Euphrasia 's room . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 8]: `` You said you slept soundly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 11]: `` So I did , part of the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 11]: `` Then you kept back part of the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 5]: `` I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 8]: `` Was that worthy of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 11]: `` I thought it best : I doubted myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 12]: `` What has caused you to change your mind now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 8]: `` This event about the ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 9]: `` What has that to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 14]: How do you even know that it was taken on that night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 25]: `` I do not know ; for till this morning I had not opened the place where it lay : I only suspect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 19]: `` I am a magistrate , Mr. Sutherland : I would rather not be prejudiced by suspicions . ''
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 18]: `` The person to whom my suspicions refer , is beyond your jurisdiction , Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 8]: `` I do not understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 7]: `` I will explain myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 18]: Hugh gave Mr. Arnold a hurried yet circumstantial sketch of the apparition he believed he had seen .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 11]: `` What am I to judge from all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 8]: asked he , coldly , almost contemptuously .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 52]: `` I have told you the facts ; of course I must leave the conclusions to yourself , Mr. Arnold ; but I confess , for my part , that any disbelief I had in apparitions is almost entirely removed since -- '' `` Since you dreamed you saw one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 12]: `` Since the disappearance of the ring , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 4]: `` Bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 7]: exclaimed Mr. Arnold , with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 11]: `` Can a ghost fetch and carry like a spaniel ?
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 17]: Mr. Sutherland , I am ashamed to have such a reasoner for tutor to my son .
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 16]: Come to dinner , and do not let me hear another word of this folly .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 12]: I beg you will not mention it to any one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 36]: `` I have been silent hitherto , Mr. Arnold ; but circumstances , such as the commitment of any one on the charge of stealing the ring , might compel me to mention the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 16]: It would be for the jury to determine whether it was relevant or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 39]: It was evident that Mr. Arnold was more annoyed at the imputation against the nocturnal habits of his house , than at the loss of the ring , or even its possible theft by one of his servants .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 46]: He looked at Hugh for a moment as if he would break into a furious rage ; then his look gradually changed into one of suspicion , and , turning without another word , he led the way to the dining-room , followed by Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 43]: To have a ghost held in his face in this fashion , one bred in his own house , too , when he had positively declared his absolute contempt for every legend of the sort , was more than man could bear .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 38]: He sat down to dinner in gloomy silence , breaking it only as often as he was compelled to do the duties of a host , which he performed with a greater loftiness of ceremony than usual .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 12]: There was no summoning of the servants after dinner , however .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 7]: Hugh 's warning had been effectual .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 13]: Nor was the subject once more alluded to in Hugh 's hearing .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 29]: No doubt Mr. Arnold felt that something ought to be done ; but I presume he could never make up his mind what that something ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 22]: Whether any reasons for not prosecuting the inquiry had occurred to him upon further reflection , I am unable to tell .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 28]: One thing is certain ; that from this time he ceased to behave to Hugh with that growing cordiality which he had shown him for weeks past .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 44]: It was no great loss to Hugh ; but he felt it ; and all the more , because he could not help associating it with that look of suspicion , the remains of which were still discernible on Mr. Arnold 's face .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 35]: Although he could not determine the exact direction of Mr. Arnold 's suspicions , he felt that they bore upon something associated with the crystal ring , and the story of the phantom lady .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 13]: Consequently , there was little more of comfort for him at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 39]: Mr. Arnold , however , did not reveal his change of feeling so much by neglect as by ceremony , which , sooner than anything else , builds a wall of separation between those who meet every day .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 33]: For the oftener they meet , the thicker and the faster are the bricks and mortar of cold politeness , evidently avoided insults , and subjected manifestations of dislike , laid together .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 7]: A BIRD 'S - EYE VIEW .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 34]: O , cocks are crowing a merry midnight , I wot the wild-fowls are boding day ; Give me my faith and troth again , And let me fare me on my way .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 32]: Sae painfully she clam the wa ' , She clam the wa ' up after him ; Hosen nor shoon upon her feet , She hadna time to put them on .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 3]: Scotch Ballad .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 4]: -- Clerk Saunders .
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 4]: Dreary days passed .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 19]: The reports of Euphra were as favourable as the nature of the injury had left room to expect .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 18]: Still they were but reports : Hugh could not see her , and the days passed drearily .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 41]: He heard that the swelling was reduced , and that the ankle was found not to be dislocated , but that the bones were considerably injured , and that the final effect upon the use of the parts was doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 10]: The pretty foot lay aching in Hugh 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 27]: When Harry went to bed , he used to walk out and loiter about the grounds , full of anxious fears and no less anxious hopes .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 44]: If the night was at all obscure , he would pass , as often as he dared , under Euphra 's window ; for all he could have of her now was a few rays from the same light that lighted her chamber .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 48]: Then he would steal away down the main avenue , and thence watch the same light , whose beams , in that strange play which the intellect will keep up in spite of -- yet in association with -- the heart , made a photo-materialist of him .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 68]: For he would now no longer believe in the pulsations of an ethereal medium ; but -- that the very material rays which enlightened Euphra 's face , whether she waked or slept , stole and filtered through the blind and the gathered shadows , and entered in bodily essence into the mysterious convolutions of his brain , where his soul and heart sought and found them .
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 42]: When a week had passed , she was so far recovered as to be able to see Mr. Arnold ; from whom Hugh heard , in a somewhat reproachful tone , that she was but the wreck of her former self .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 16]: It was all that Hugh could do to restrain the natural outbreak of his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 17]: A fortnight passed , and she saw Mrs. Elton and Lady Emily for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 32]: They would have left before , but had yielded to Mr. Arnold 's entreaty , and were staying till Euphra should be at least able to be carried from her room .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 36]: One day , when the visitors were out with Mr. Arnold , Jane brought a message to Hugh , requesting him to walk into Miss Cameron 's room , for she wanted to see him .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 22]: Hugh felt his heart flutter as if doubting whether to stop at once , or to dash through its confining bars .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 7]: He rose and followed the maid .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 8]: He stood over Euphra pale and speechless .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 35]: She lay before him wasted and wan ; her eyes twice their former size , but with half their former light ; her fingers long and transparent ; and her voice low and feeble .
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 21]: She had just raised herself with difficulty to a sitting posture , and the effort had left her more weary .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 4]: `` Hugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 5]: she said , kindly .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 5]: `` Dear Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 12]: he answered , kissing the little hand he held in his .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 17]: She looked at him for a little while , and the tears rose in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 11]: `` Hugh , I am a cripple for life . ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 7]: `` God forbid , Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 6]: was all he could reply .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 6]: She shook her head mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 39]: Then a strange , wild look came in her eyes , and grew till it seemed from them to overflow and cover her whole face with a troubled expression , which increased to a look of dull agony .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 10]: `` What is the matter , dear Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 6]: said Hugh , in alarm .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 8]: `` Is your foot very painful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 5]: She made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 8]: She was looking fixedly at his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 7]: `` Shall I call Jane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 5]: She shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 9]: `` Can I do nothing for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 10]: `` No , '' she answered , almost angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 8]: `` Shall I go , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 5]: `` Yes -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 3]: Go . ''
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 6]: He left the room instantly .
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 15]: But a sharp though stifled cry of despair drew him back at a bound .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 4]: Euphra had fainted .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 17]: He rang the bell for Jane ; and lingered till he saw signs of returning consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 5]: What could this mean ?
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 12]: He was more perplexed with her than ever he had been .
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 16]: Cunning love , however , soon found a way of explaining it -- A way ?
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 11]: -- Twenty ways -- not one of them the way .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 25]: Next day , Lady Emily brought him a message from Euphra -- not to distress himself about her ; it was not his fault .
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 41]: This message the bearer of it understood to refer to the original accident , as the sender of it intended she should : the receiver interpreted it of the occurrence of the day before , as the sender likewise intended .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 4]: It comforted him .
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 35]: It had become almost a habit with Hugh , to ascend the oak tree in the evening , and sit alone , sometimes for hours , in the nest he had built for Harry .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 22]: One time he took a book with him ; another he went without ; and now and then Harry accompanied him .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 97]: But I have already said , that often after tea , when the house became oppressive to him from the longing to see Euphra , he would wander out alone ; when , even in the shadows of the coming night , he would sometimes climb the nest , and there sit , hearing all that the leaves whispered about the sleeping birds , without listening to a word of it , or trying to interpret it by the kindred sounds of his own inner world , and the tree-talk that went on there in secret .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 21]: For the divinity of that inner world had abandoned it for the present , in pursuit of an earthly maiden .
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 12]: So its birds were silent , and its trees trembled not .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 61]: An aging moon was feeling her path somewhere through the heavens ; but a thin veil of cloud was spread like a tent under the hyaline dome where she walked ; so that , instead of a white moon , there was a great white cloud to enlighten the earth , -- a cloud soaked full of her pale rays .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 6]: Hugh sat in the oak-nest .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 10]: He knew not how long he had been there .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 43]: Light after light was extinguished in the house , and still he sat there brooding , dreaming , in that state of mind in which to the good , good things come of themselves , and to the evil , evil things .
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 26]: The nearness of the Ghost 's Walk did not trouble him , for he was too much concerned about Euphra to fear ghost or demon .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 13]: His mind heeded them not , and so was beyond their influence .
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 12]: But while he sat , he became aware of human voices .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 28]: He looked out from his leafy screen , and saw once more , at the end of the Ghost 's Walk , a form clothed in white .
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 7]: But there were voices of two .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 10]: He sent his soul into his ears to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 22]: A horrible , incredible , impossible idea forced itself upon him -- that the tones were those of Euphra and Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 14]: The one voice was weak and complaining ; the other firm and strong .
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 27]: `` It must be some horrible ghost that imitates her , '' he said to himself ; for he was nearly crazy at the very suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 18]: He would see nearer , if only to get rid of that frightful insinuation of the tempter .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 6]: He descended the tree noiselessly .
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 11]: He lost sight of the figure as he did so .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 11]: He drew near the place where he had seen it .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 12]: But there was no sound of voices now to guide him .
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 23]: As he came within sight of the spot , he saw the white figure in the arms of another , a man .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 8]: Her head was lying on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 23]: A moment after , she was lifted in those arms and borne towards the house , -- down the Ghost 's Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 13]: A burning agony to be satisfied of his doubts seized on Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 36]: He fled like a deer to the house by another path ; tried , in his suspicion , the library window ; found it open , and was at Euphra 's door in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 4]: Here he hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 5]: She must be inside .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 7]: How dare he knock or enter ?
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 10]: If she was there , she would be asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 6]: He would not wake her .
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 7]: There was no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 13]: He would risk anything , to be rid of this horrible doubt .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 6]: He gently opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 5]: The night-light was burning .
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 13]: He thought , at first , that Euphra was in the bed .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 11]: He felt like a thief , but he stole nearer .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 5]: She was not there .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 7]: She was not on the couch .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 7]: She was not in the room .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 8]: Jane was fast asleep in the dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 4]: It was enough .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 3]: He withdrew .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 22]: He would watch at his door to see her return , for she must pass his door to reach her own .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 8]: He waited a time that seemed hours .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 45]: At length -- horrible , far more horrible to him than the vision of the ghost -- Euphra crept past him , appearing in the darkness to crawl along the wall against which she supported herself , and scarcely suppressing her groans of pain .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 13]: She reached her own room , and entering , closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 5]: Hugh was nearly mad .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 15]: He rushed down the stair to the library , and out into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 7]: Why or whither he knew not .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 9]: Suddenly he received a blow on the head .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 12]: It did not stun him , but he staggered under it .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 7]: Had he run against a tree ?
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 13]: There was the dim bulk of a man disappearing through the boles .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 5]: He darted after him .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 13]: The man heard his footsteps , stopped , and waited in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 17]: As Hugh came up to him , he made a thrust at him with some weapon .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 5]: He missed his aim .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 11]: The weapon passed through his coat and under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 22]: The next moment , Hugh had wrenched the sword-stick from him , thrown it away , and grappled with -- Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 18]: But strong as Hugh was , the Bohemian was as strong , and the contest was doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 51]: Strange as it may seem -- in the midst of it , while each held the other unable to move , the conviction flashed upon Hugh 's mind , that , whoever might have taken Lady Euphrasia 's ring , he was grappling with the thief of his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 10]: `` Give me my ring , '' gasped he .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 12]: An imprecation of a sufficiently emphatic character was the only reply .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 18]: The Bohemian got one hand loose , and Hugh heard a sound like the breaking of glass .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 35]: Before he could gain any advantage -- for his antagonist seemed for the moment to have concentrated all his force in the other hand -- a wet handkerchief was held firmly to his face .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 19]: His fierceness died away ; he was lapt in the vapour of dreams ; and his senses departed .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 4]: HUGH 'S AWAKING .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 3]: But ah !
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 69]: believe me , there is more than so , That works such wonders in the minds of men ; I , that have often proved , too well it know ; And whoso list the like assays to ken , Shall find by trial , and confess it then , That beauty is not , as fond men misdeem , An outward show of things that only seem !
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 65]: But ye , fair dames , the world 's dear ornaments , And lively images of heaven 's light , Let not your beams with such disparagements Be dimmed , and your bright glory darkened quite ; But , mindful still of your first country 's sight , Do still preserve your first informed grace , Whose shadow yet shines in your beauteous face .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 2]: SPENSER .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 7]: -- Hymn in Honour of Beauty .
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 28]: When Hugh came to himself , he was lying , in the first grey of the dawn , amidst the dews and vapours of the morning woods .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 7]: He rose and looked around him .
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 11]: The Ghost 's Walk lay in long silence before him .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 10]: Here and there a little bird moved and peeped .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 15]: The glory of a new day was climbing up the eastern coast of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 19]: It would be a day of late summer , crowned with flame , and throbbing with ripening life .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 25]: But for him the spirit was gone out of the world , and it was nought but a mass of blind , heartless forces .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 65]: Possibly , had he overheard the conversation , the motions only of which he had overseen the preceding night , he would , although equally perplexed , have thought more gently of Euphra ; but , in the mood into which even then he must have been thrown , his deeper feelings towards her could hardly have been different from what they were now .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 32]: Although he had often felt that Euphra was not very good , not a suspicion had crossed his mind as to what he would have called the purity of her nature .
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 35]: Like many youths , even of character inferior to his own , he had the loftiest notions of feminine grace , and unspottedness in thought and feeling , not to say action and aim .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 54]: Now he found that he had loved a woman who would creep from her chamber , at the cost of great suffering , and almost at the risk of her life , to meet , in the night and the woods , a man no better than an assassin -- probably a thief .
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 42]: Had he been more versed in the ways of women , or in the probabilities of things , he would have judged that the very extravagance of the action demanded a deeper explanation than what seemed to lie on the surface .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 24]: Yet , although he judged Euphra very hardly upon those grounds , would he have judged her differently had he actually known all ?
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 9]: About this I am left to conjecture alone .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 18]: But the effect on Hugh was different from what the ordinary reader of human nature might anticipate .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 27]: Instead of being torn in pieces by storms of jealousy , all the summer growths of his love were chilled by an absolute frost of death .
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 11]: A kind of annihilation sank upon the image of Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 7]: There had been no such Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 11]: She had been but a creation of his own brain .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 26]: It was not so much that he ceased to love , as that the being beloved -- not died , but -- ceased to exist .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 32]: There were moments in which he seemed to love her still with a wild outcry of passion ; but the frenzy soon vanished in the selfish feeling of his own loss .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 16]: His love was not a high one -- not such as thine , my Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 41]: Thine was love indeed ; though its tale is too good to tell , simply because it is too good to be believed ; and we do men a wrong sometimes when we tell them more than they can receive .
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 39]: Thought , Speculation , Suggestion , crowded upon each other , till at length his mind sank passive , and served only as the lists in which the antagonist thoughts fought a confused battle without herald or umpire .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 24]: But it is amazing to think how soon he began to look back upon his former fascination with a kind of wondering unbelief .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 20]: This bespoke the strength of Hugh 's ideal sense , as well as the weakness of his actual love .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 32]: He could hardly even recall the feelings with which , on some well-remembered occasion , he had regarded her , and which then it had seemed impossible he should ever forget .
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 27]: Had he discovered the cloven foot of a demon under those trailing garments -- he could hardly have ceased to love her more suddenly or entirely .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 13]: But there is an aching that is worse to bear than pain .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 25]: I trust my reader will not judge very hardly of Hugh , because of the change which had thus suddenly passed upon his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 51]: He felt now just as he had felt on waking in the morning and finding that he had been in love with a dream-lady all the night : it had been very delightful , and it was sad that it was all gone , and could come back no more .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 38]: But the wonder to me is , not that some loves will not stand the test of absence , but that , their nature being what it is , they should outlast one week of familiar intercourse .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 18]: He mourned bitterly over the loss of those feelings , for they had been precious to him .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 6]: But could he help it ?
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 23]: Indeed he could not ; for his love had been fascination ; and the fascination having ceased , the love was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 34]: I believe some of my readers will not need this apology for Hugh ; but will rather admire the facility with which he rose above a misplaced passion , and dismissed its object .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 5]: So do not I .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 8]: It came of his having never loved .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 52]: Had he really loved Euphra , herself , her own self , the living woman who looked at him out of those eyes , out of that face , such pity would have blended with the love as would have made it greater , and permitted no indignation to overwhelm it .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 14]: As it was , he was utterly passive and helpless in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 51]: The fault lay in the original weakness that submitted to be so fascinated ; that gave in to it , notwithstanding the vague expostulations of his better nature , and the consciousness that he was neglecting his duty to Harry , in order to please Euphra and enjoy her society .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 45]: Had he persisted in doing his duty , it would at least have kept his mind more healthy , lessened the absorption of his passion , and given him opportunities of reflection , and moments of true perception as to what he was about .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 18]: But now the spell was broken at once , and the poor girl had lost a worshipper .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 27]: The golden image with the feet of clay might arise in a prophet 's dream , but it could never abide in such a lover 's .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 6]: Her glance was powerless now .
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 10]: Alas , for the withering of such a dream !
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 20]: Perhaps she deserved nothing else ; but our deserts , when we get them , are sad enough sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 12]: All that day he walked as in a dream of loss .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 22]: As for the person whom he had used to call Euphra , she was removed to a vast distance from him .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 8]: An absolutely impassable gulf lay between them .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 5]: She sent for him .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 11]: He went to her filled with a sense of insensibility .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 10]: She was much worse , and suffering great pain .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 48]: Hugh saw at once that she knew that all was over between them , and that he had seen her pass his door , or had been in her room , for he had left her door a little open , and she had left it shut .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 69]: One pathetic , most pitiful glance of deprecating entreaty she fixed upon him , as after a few moments of speechless waiting , he turned to leave the room -- which would have remained deathless in his heart , but that he interpreted it to mean : `` Do n't tell ; '' so he got rid of it at once by the grant of its supposed request .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 8]: She made no effort to detain him .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 45]: She turned her face away , and , hard-hearted , he heard her sob , not as if her heart would break -- that is little -- but like an immortal woman in immortal agony , and he did not turn to comfort her .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 11]: Perhaps it was better -- how could he comfort her ?
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 44]: Some kinds of comfort -- the only kinds which poor mortals sometimes have to give -- are like the food on which the patient and the disease live together ; and some griefs are soonest got rid of by letting them burn out .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 18]: All the fire-engines in creation can only prolong the time , and increase the sense of burning .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 27]: There is but one cure : the fellow-feeling of the human God , which converts the agony itself into the creative fire of a higher life .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 19]: As for Von Funkelstein , Hugh comforted himself with the conviction that they were destined to meet again .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 26]: The day went on , as days will go , unstayed , unhastened by the human souls , through which they glide silent and awful .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 47]: After such lessons as he was able to get through with Harry , -- who , feeling that his tutor did not want him , left the room as soon as they were over -- he threw himself on the couch , and tried to think .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 6]: But think he could not .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 12]: Thoughts passed through him , but he did not think them .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 8]: He was powerless in regard to them .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 17]: They came and went of their own will : he could neither say come nor go .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 18]: Tired at length of the couch , he got up and paced about the room for hours .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 17]: When he came to himself a little , he found that the sun was nearly setting .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 34]: Through the top of a beech-tree taller than the rest , it sent a golden light , full of the floating shadows of leaves and branches , upon the wall of his room .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 48]: But there was no beauty for him in the going down of the sun ; no glory in the golden light ; no message from dream-land in the flitting and blending and parting , the constantly dissolving yet ever remaining play of the lovely and wonderful shadow-leaves .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 24]: The sun sank below the beech-top , and was hidden behind a cloud of green leaves , thick as the wood was deep .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 11]: A grey light instead of a golden filled the room .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 8]: The change had no interest for him .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 41]: The pain of a lost passion tormented him -- the aching that came of the falling together of the ethereal walls of his soul , about the space where there had been and where there was no longer a world .
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 32]: A young bird flew against the window , and fluttered its wings two or three times , vainly seeking to overcome the unseen obstacle which the glass presented to its flight .
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 5]: Hugh started and shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 29]: Then first he knew , in the influence of the signs of the approaching darkness , how much his nerves had suffered from the change that had passed .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 6]: He took refuge with Harry .
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 27]: His pupil was now to be his consoler ; who in his turn would fare henceforth the better , for the decay of Hugh 's pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 30]: The poor boy was filled with delight at having his big brother all to himself again ; and worked harder than ever to make the best of his privileges .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 44]: For Hugh , it was wonderful how soon his peace of mind began to return after he gave himself to his duty , and how soon the clouds of disappointment descended below the far horizon , leaving the air clear above and around .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 34]: Painful thoughts about Euphra would still present themselves ; but instead of becoming more gentle and sorrowful as the days went on , they grew more and more severe and unjust and angry .
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 32]: He even entertained doubts whether she did not know all about the theft of both rings , for to her only had he discovered the secret place in the old desk .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 19]: If she was capable of what he believed , why should she not be capable of anything else ?
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 9]: It seemed to him most simple and credible .
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 12]: An impure woman might just as well be a thief too .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 9]: -- I am only describing Hugh 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 26]: But along with these feelings and thoughts , of mingled good and bad , came one feeling which he needed more than any -- repentance .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 72]: Seated alone upon a fallen tree one day , the face of poor Harry came back to him , as he saw it first , poring over Polexander in the library ; and , full of the joy of life himself , notwithstanding his past troubles , strong as a sunrise , and hopeful as a Prometheus , the quivering perplexity of that sickly little face smote him with a pang .
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 11]: `` What might I not have done for the boy !
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 29]: He , too , was in the hands of the enchantress , and , instead of freeing him , I became her slave to enchain him further . ''
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 95]: Yet , even in this , he did Euphra injustice ; for he had come to the conclusion that she had laid her plans with the intention of keeping the boy a dwarf , by giving him only food for babes , and not good food either , withholding from him every stimulus to mental digestion and consequent hunger ; and that she had objects of her own in doing so -- one perhaps , to keep herself necessary to the boy as she was to the father , and so secure the future .
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 14]: But poor Euphra 's own nature and true education had been sadly neglected .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 24]: A fine knowledge of music and Italian , and the development of a sensuous sympathy with nature , could hardly be called education .
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 26]: It was not certainly such a development of her own nature as would enable her to sympathise with the necessities of a boy 's nature .
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 46]: Perhaps the worst that could justly be said of her behaviour to Harry was , that , with a strong inclination to despotism , and some feeling of loneliness , she had exercised the one upon him in order to alleviate the other in herself .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 51]: Upon him , therefore , she expended a certain , or rather an uncertain kind of affection , which , if it might have been more fittingly spent upon a lapdog , and was worth but little , might yet have become worth everything , had she been moderately good .
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 12]: Hugh did not see Euphra again for more than a fortnight .
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 2]: CHANGES .
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 11]: Hey , and the rue grows bonny wi ' thyme !
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 13]: And the thyme it is withered , and rue is in prime .
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 11]: Refrain of an old Scotch song , altered by BURNS .
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 31]: He hath wronged me ; indeed he hath ; -- at a word , he hath ; -- believe me ; Robert Shallow , Esquire , saith he is wronged .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 5]: Merry Wives of Windsor .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 18]: At length , one evening , entering the drawing-room before dinner , Hugh found Euphra there alone .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 14]: He bowed with embarrassment , and uttered some commonplace congratulation on her recovery .
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 7]: She answered him gently and coldly .
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 11]: Her whole air and appearance were signs of acute suffering .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 34]: She did not make the slightest approach to their former familiarity , but she spoke without any embarrassment , like one who had given herself up , and was , therefore , indifferent .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 36]: Hugh could not help feeling as if she knew every thought that was passing in his mind , and , having withdrawn herself from him , was watching him with a cold , ghostly interest .
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 26]: She took his arm to go into the dining-room , and actually leaned upon it , as , indeed , she was compelled to do .
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 10]: Her uncle was delighted to see her once more .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 14]: Mrs. Elton addressed her with kindness , and Lady Emily with sweet cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 10]: She herself seemed to care for nobody and nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 20]: As soon as dinner was over , she sent for her maid , and withdrew to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 21]: It was a great relief to Hugh to feel that he was no longer in danger of encountering her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 18]: Gradually she recovered strength , though it was again some days before she appeared at the dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 35]: The distance between Hugh and her seemed to increase instead of diminish , till at length he scarcely dared to offer her the smallest civility , lest she should despise him as a hypocrite .
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 17]: The further she removed herself from him , the more he felt inclined to respect her .
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 29]: By common consent they avoided , as much as before , any behaviour that might attract attention ; though the effort was of a very different nature now .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 13]: It was wretched enough , no doubt , for both of them .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 10]: The time drew near for Lady Emily 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 13]: `` What are your plans for the winter , Mrs. Elton ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 7]: said Mr. Arnold , one day .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 13]: `` I intend spending the winter in London , '' she answered .
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 13]: `` Then you are not going with Lady Emily to Madeira ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 13]: Her father and one of her sisters are going with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 24]: `` I have a great mind to spend the winter abroad myself ; but the difficulty is what to do with Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 11]: `` Could you not leave him with Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 9]: I do not choose to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 8]: `` Then let him come to me .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 20]: I shall have all my little establishment up , and there will be plenty of room for Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 6]: `` A very kind offer .
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 9]: I may possibly avail myself of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 12]: `` I fear we could hardly accommodate his tutor , though .
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 8]: But that will be very easily arranged .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 13]: He could sleep out of the house , could he not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 8]: `` Give yourself no trouble about that .
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 14]: I wish Harry to have masters for the various branches he will study .
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 26]: It will teach him more of men and the world generally , and prevent his being too much influenced by one style of thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 11]: `` But Mr. Sutherland is a very good tutor . ''
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 3]: Very . ''
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 25]: To this there could be no reply but a question ; and Mr. Arnold 's manner not inviting one , the conversation was dropped .
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 17]: Euphra gradually resumed her duties in the house , as far as great lameness would permit .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 12]: She continued to show a quiet and dignified reserve towards Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 20]: She made no attempts to fascinate him , and never avoided his look when it chanced to meet hers .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 21]: But although there was no reproach any more than fascination in her eyes , Hugh 's always fell before hers .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 22]: She walked softly like Ahab , as if , now that Hugh knew , she , too , was ever conscious .
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 21]: Her behaviour to Mrs. Elton and Lady Emily was likewise improved , but apparently only from an increase of indifference .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 19]: When the time came , and they departed , she did not even appear to be much relieved .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 21]: Once she asked Hugh to help her with a passage of Dante , but betrayed no memory of the past .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 20]: His pleased haste to assist her , showed that he at least , if fancy-free , was not memory-clear .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 20]: She thanked him very gently and truly , took up her book like a school-girl , and limped away .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 7]: Hugh was smitten to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 11]: `` If I could but do something for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 11]: thought he ; but there was nothing to be done .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 24]: Although she had deserved it , somehow her behaviour made him feel as if he had wronged her in ceasing to love her .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 18]: One day , in the end of September , Mr. Arnold and Hugh were alone after breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 18]: Mr. Arnold spoke : `` Mr. Sutherland , I have altered my plans with regard to Harry .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 11]: I wish him to spend the winter in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 5]: Hugh listened and waited .
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 28]: Mr. Arnold went on , after a slight pause : `` There I wish him to reap such advantages as are to be gained in the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 25]: He has improved wonderfully under your instruction ; and is now , I think , to be benefited principally by a variety of teachers .
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 20]: I therefore intend that he shall have masters for the different branches which it is desirable he should study .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 19]: Consequently I shall be compelled to deny him your services , valuable as they have hitherto been . ''
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 22]: `` Very well , Mr. Arnold , '' said Mr. Sutherland , with the indifference of one who feels himself ill-used .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 11]: `` When shall I take my leave of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 14]: `` Not before the middle of the next month , at the earliest .
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 14]: But I will write you a cheque for your salary at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 25]: So saying , Mr. Arnold left the room for a moment , and returning , handed Hugh a cheque for a year 's salary .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 34]: Hugh glanced at it , and offering it again to Mr. Arnold , said : `` No , Mr. Arnold ; I can claim scarcely more than half a year 's salary . ''
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 32]: `` Mr. Sutherland , your engagement was at so much a year ; and if I prevent you from fulfilling your part of it , I am bound to fulfil mine .
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 9]: Indeed , you might claim further provision . ''
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 10]: `` You are very kind , Mr. Arnold . ''
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 13]: `` Only just , '' rejoined Mr. Arnold , with conscious dignity .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 21]: `` I am under great obligation to you for the way in which you have devoted yourself to Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 8]: Hugh 's conscience gave him a pang .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 8]: Is anything more painful than undeserved praise ?
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 14]: `` I have hardly done my duty by him , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 20]: `` I can only say that the boy is wonderfully altered for the better , and I thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 17]: I am obliged to you : oblige me by putting the cheque in your pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 31]: Hugh persisted no longer in his refusal ; and indeed it had been far more a feeling of pride than of justice that made him decline accepting it at first .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 27]: Nor was there any generosity in Mr. Arnold 's cheque ; for Hugh , as he admitted , might have claimed board and lodging as well .
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 40]: But Mr. Arnold was one of the ordinarily honourable , who , with perfect characters for uprightness , always contrive to err on the safe side of the purse , and the doubtful side of a severely interpreted obligation .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 23]: Such people , in so doing , not unfrequently secure for themselves , at the same time , the reputation of generosity .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 30]: Hugh could not doubt that his dismissal was somehow or other connected with the loss of the ring ; but he would not stoop to inquire into the matter .
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 35]: He hoped that time would set all right ; and , in fact , felt considerable indifference to the opinion of Mr. Arnold , or of any one in the house , except Harry .
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 49]: The boy burst into tears when informed of his father 's decision with regard to his winter studies , and could only be consoled by the hope which Hugh held out to him -- certainly upon a very slight foundation -- that they might meet sometimes in London .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 45]: For the little time that remained , Hugh devoted himself unceasingly to his pupil ; not merely studying with him , but walking , riding , reading stories , and going through all sorts of exercises for the strengthening of his person and constitution .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 11]: The best results followed both for Harry and his tutor .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 2]: EXPLANATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 54]: I have done nothing good to win belief , My life hath been so faithless ; all the creatures Made for heaven 's honours , have their ends , and good ones ; All but ... false women ... When they die , like tales Ill-told , and unbelieved , they pass away .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 23]: I will redeem one minute of my age , Or , like another Niobe , I 'll weep Till I am water .
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 4]: BEAUMONT AND FLETCHER .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 6]: -- The Maid 's Tragedy .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 19]: The days passed quickly by ; and the last evening that Hugh was to spend at Arnstead arrived .
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 5]: He wandered out alone .
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 19]: He had been with Harry all day , and now he wished for a few moments of solitude .
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 7]: It was a lovely autumn evening .
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 9]: He went into the woods behind the house .
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 61]: The leaves were still thick upon the trees , but most of them had changed to gold , and brown , and red ; and the sweet faint odours of those that had fallen , and lay thick underfoot , ascended like a voice from the grave , saying : `` Here dwelleth some sadness , but no despair . ''
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 18]: As he strolled about among them , the whole history of his past life arose before him .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 40]: This often happens before any change in our history , and is surest to take place at the approach of the greatest change of all , when we are about to pass into the unknown , whence we came .
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 15]: In this mood , it was natural that his sins should rise before him .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 10]: They came as the shadows of his best pleasures .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 61]: For now , in looking back , he could fix on no period of his history , around which the aureole , which glorifies the sacred things of the past , had gathered in so golden a hue , as around the memory of the holy cottage , the temple in which abode David , and Janet , and Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 22]: All the story glided past , as the necromantic Will called up the sleeping dead in the mausoleum of the brain .
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 119]: And that solemn , kingly , gracious old man , who had been to him a father , he had forgotten ; the homely tenderness which , from fear of its own force , concealed itself behind a humorous roughness of manner , he had -- no , not despised -- but forgotten , too ; and if the dim pearly loveliness of the trustful , grateful maiden had not been quite forgotten , yet she too had been neglected , had died , as it were , and been buried in the churchyard of the past , where the grass grows long over the graves , and the moss soon begins to fill up the chiselled records .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 4]: He was ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 18]: He dared not allow to himself that he was unloving ; but he must confess himself ungrateful .
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 13]: Musing sorrowfully and self-reproachfully , he came to the Ghost 's Avenue .
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 23]: Up and down its aisle he walked , a fit place for remembering the past , and the sins of the present .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 43]: Yielding himself to what thoughts might arise , the strange sight he had seen here on that moonlit night , of two silent wandering figures -- or could it be that they were one and the same , suddenly changed in hue ?
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 5]: -- returned upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 34]: This vision had been so speedily followed by the second and more alarming apparition of Lady Euphrasia , that he had hardly had time to speculate on what the former could have been .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 55]: He was meditating upon all these strange events , and remarking to himself that , since his midnight encounter with Lady Euphrasia , the house had been as quiet as a church-yard at noon , when all suddenly , he saw before him , at some little distance , a dark figure approaching him .
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 26]: His heart seemed to bound into his throat and choke him , as he said to himself : `` It is the nun again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 11]: But the next moment he saw that it was Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 31]: I do not know which he would have preferred not meeting alone , and in the deepening twilight : Euphra , too , had become like a ghost to him .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 25]: His first impulse was to turn aside into the wood , but she had seen him , and was evidently going to address him .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 7]: He therefore advanced to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 10]: She spoke first , approaching him with painful steps .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 11]: `` I have been looking for you , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 15]: I wanted very much to have a little conversation with you before you go .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 6]: Will you allow me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 7]: Hugh felt like a culprit directly .
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 33]: Euphra 's manner was quite collected and kind ; yet through it all a consciousness showed itself , that the relation which had once existed between them had passed away for ever .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 16]: In her voice there was something like the tone of wind blowing through a ruin .
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 11]: `` I shall be most happy , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 4]: She smiled sadly .
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 8]: A great change had passed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 15]: `` I am going to be quite open with you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 23]: `` I am perfectly aware , as well as you are , that the boyish fancy you had for me is gone .
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 5]: Do not be offended .
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 13]: You are manly enough , but your love for me was boyish .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 11]: Most first loves are childish , quite irrespective of age .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 10]: I do not blame you in the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 22]: This seemed to Hugh rather a strange style to assume , if all was true that his own eyes had reported .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 19]: She went on : `` Nor must you think it has cost me much to lose it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 14]: Hugh felt hurt , at which no one who understands will be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 20]: `` But I can not afford to lose you , the only friend I have , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 13]: Hugh turned towards her with a face full of manhood and truth .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 21]: `` You shall not lose me , Euphra , if you will be honest to yourself and to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 5]: I can trust you .
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 6]: I will be honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 27]: At that moment , without the revival of a trace of his former feelings , Hugh felt nearer to her than he had ever felt before .
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 18]: Now there seemed to be truth between them , the only medium through which beings can unite .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 14]: `` I fear I have wronged you much , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 10]: `` I do not mean some time ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 4]: Here she hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 14]: -- `` I fear I am the cause of your leaving Arnstead . ''
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 5]: `` You , Euphra ?
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 6]: You must be mistaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 5]: `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 19]: But I am compelled to make an unwilling disclosure of a secret -- a sad secret about myself .
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 12]: Do not hate me quite -- I am a somnambulist . ''
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 24]: She hid her face in her hands , as if the night which had now closed around them did not hide her enough .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 5]: Hugh did not reply .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 20]: Absorbed in the interest which both herself and her confession aroused in him , he could only listen eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 24]: She went on , after a moment 's pause : `` I did not think at first that I had taken the ring .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 5]: I thought another had .
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 18]: But last night , and not till then , I discovered that I was the culprit . ''
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 5]: `` That requires explanation .
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 20]: I have no recollection of the events of the previous night when I have been walking in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 20]: Indeed , the utter absence of a sense of dreaming always makes me suspect that I have been wandering .
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 31]: But sometimes I have a vivid dream , which I know , though I can give no proof of it , to be a reproduction of some previous somnambulic experience .
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 13]: Do not ask me to recall the horrors I dreamed last night .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 9]: I am sure I took the ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 11]: `` Then you dreamed what you did with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 16]: `` Yes , I gave it to -- '' Here her voice sank and ceased .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 6]: Hugh would not urge her .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 10]: `` Have you mentioned this to Mr. Arnold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 10]: I do not think it would do any good .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 14]: But I will , if you wish it , '' she added submissively .
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 7]: Just as you think best . ''
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 8]: `` I could not tell him everything .
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 7]: I can not tell you everything .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 14]: If I did , Mr. Arnold would turn me out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 11]: I am a very unhappy girl , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 25]: From the tone of these words , Hugh could not for a moment suppose that Euphra had any remaining design of fascination in them .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 43]: `` Perhaps he might want to keep you , if I told him all ; but I do not think , after the way he has behaved to you , that you could stay with him , for he would never apologize .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 20]: It is very selfish of me ; but indeed I have not the courage to confess to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 11]: `` I assure you nothing could make me remain now .
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 9]: But what can I do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 45]: `` Only let me depend upon you , in case I should need your help ; or -- '' Here Euphra stopped suddenly , and caught hold of Hugh 's left hand , which he had lifted to brush an insect from his face .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 7]: `` Where is your ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 10]: she said , in a tone of suppressed anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 5]: `` Gone , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 5]: My father 's ring !
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 9]: It was lying beside Lady Euphrasia 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 10]: Euphra 's face was again hidden in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 9]: She sobbed and moaned like one in despair .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 30]: When she grew a little calmer , she said : `` I am sure I did not take your ring , dear Hugh -- I am not a thief .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 41]: I had a kind of right to the other , and he said it ought to have been his , for his real name was Count von Halkar -- the same name as Lady Euphrasia 's before she was married .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 9]: He took it , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 18]: `` It was he that knocked me down in the dark that night then , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 4]: `` Did he ?
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 8]: I shall have to tell you all .
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 10]: -- That wretch has a terrible power over me .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 5]: I loved him once .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 21]: But I refused to take the ring from your desk , because I knew it would get you into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 15]: He threw me into a somnambulic sleep , and sent me for the ring .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 11]: But I should have remembered if I had taken yours .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 17]: Even in my sleep , I do n't think he could have made me do that .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 16]: You may know I speak the truth , when I am telling my own disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 26]: He promised to set me free if I would get the ring ; but he has not done it ; and he will not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 5]: Sobs again interrupted her .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 9]: `` I was afraid your ring was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 24]: I do n't know why I thought so , except that you had n't it on , when you came to see me .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 17]: Or perhaps it was because I am sometimes forced to think what that wretch is thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 14]: He made me go to him that night you saw me , Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 31]: But I was so ill , I do n't think I should have been able , but that I could not rest till I had asked him about your ring .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 9]: He said he knew nothing about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 12]: `` I am sure be has it , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 16]: And he related to Euphra the struggle he had had with Funkelstein and its result .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 3]: She shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 18]: `` I have been a devil to you , Hugh ; I have betrayed you to him .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 8]: You will never see your ring again .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 5]: Here , take mine .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 25]: It is not so good as yours , but for the sake of the old way you thought of me , take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 13]: `` No , no , Euphra ; Mr. Arnold would miss it .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 29]: Besides , you know it would not be my father 's ring , and it was not for the value of the diamond I cared most about it .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 13]: And I am not sure that I shall not find it again .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 19]: I am going up to London , where I shall fall in with him , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 8]: `` But do take care of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 5]: He has no conscience .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 14]: God knows , I have had little , but he has none . ''
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 26]: `` I know he has none ; but a conscience is not a bad auxiliary , and there I shall have some advantage of him .
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 14]: But what could he want that ring of Lady Euphrasia 's for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 6]: He never told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 8]: `` It was not worth much . ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 6]: `` Next to nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 12]: `` I shall be surer to find that than my own .
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 22]: And I will find it , if I can , that Mr. Arnold may believe I was not to blame . ''
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 3]: `` Do .
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 5]: But be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 5]: `` Do n't fear .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 6]: I will be careful . ''
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 29]: She held out her hand , as if to take leave of him , but withdrew it again with the sudden cry : `` What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 17]: I thought he had left me to myself , till that night in the library . ''
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 8]: She held down her head in silence .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 22]: Then she said , slowly , in a tone of agony : `` I am a slave , body and soul .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 4]: -- Hugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 22]: she added , passionately , and looking up in his face , `` do you think there is a God ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 15]: Her eyes glimmered with the faint reflex from gathered tears , that silently overflowed .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 13]: And now Hugh 's own poverty struck him with grief and humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 27]: Here was a soul seeking God , and he had no right to say that there was a God , for he knew nothing about him .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 21]: He had been told so ; but what could that far-off witness do for the need of a desolate heart ?
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 10]: She had been told so a million of times .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 9]: He could not say that he knew it .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 8]: That was what she wanted and needed .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 14]: He was honest , and so replied : `` I do not know .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 5]: I hope so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 40]: He felt that she was already beyond him ; for she had begun to cry into the vague , seemingly heartless void , and say : `` Is there a God somewhere to hear me when I cry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 18]: And with all the teaching he had had , he had no word of comfort to give .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 11]: Yes , he had : he had known David Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 35]: Before he had shaped his thought , she said : `` I think , if there were a God , he would help me ; for I am nothing but a poor slave now .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 10]: I have hardly a will of my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 10]: The sigh she heaved told of a hopeless oppression .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 35]: `` The best man , and the wisest , and the noblest I ever knew , '' said Hugh , `` believed in God with his whole heart and soul and strength and mind .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 23]: In fact , he cared for nothing but God ; or rather , he cared for everything because it belonged to God .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 17]: He was never afraid of anything , never vexed at anything , never troubled about anything .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 7]: He was a good man . ''
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 32]: Hugh was surprised at the light which broke upon the character of David , as he held it before his mind 's eye , in order to describe it to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 9]: He seemed never to have understood him before .
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 6]: I wish I knew him .
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 14]: I would go to that man , and ask him to save me .
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 6]: Where does he live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 3]: `` Alas !
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 17]: I do not know whether he is alive or dead -- the more to my shame .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 17]: But he lives , if he lives , far away in the north of Scotland . ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 3]: She paused .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 6]: I could not go there .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 7]: I will write to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 19]: Hugh could not discourage her , though he doubted whether a real communication could be established between them .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 19]: `` I will write down his address for you , when I go in , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 10]: `` But what can he save you from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 11]: `` From no God , '' she answered , solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 28]: `` If there is no God , then I am sure that there is a devil , and that he has got me in his power . ''
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 19]: Hugh felt her shudder , for she was leaning on his arm , she was still so lame .
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 6]: She continued : `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 15]: if I had a God , he would right me , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 5]: Hugh could not reply .
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 3]: `` Good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 9]: I feel pretty sure we shall meet again .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 13]: My presentiments are generally true , '' said Euphra , at length .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 18]: Hugh kissed her hand with far more real devotion than he had ever kissed it with before .
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 15]: She left him , and hastened to the house ` with feeble speed . '
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 7]: He was sorry she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 34]: He walked up and down for some time , meditating on the strange girl and her strange words ; till , hearing the dinner bell , he too must hasten in to dress .
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 14]: Euphra met him at the dinner-table without any change of her late manner .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 11]: Mr. Arnold wished him good night more kindly than usual .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 19]: When he went up to his room , he found that Harry had already cried himself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 2]: DEPARTURE .
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 42]: I fancy deemed fit guide to lead my way , And as I deemed I did pursue her track ; Wit lost his aim , and will was fancy 's prey ; The rebel won , the ruler went to wrack .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 24]: But now sith fancy did with folly end , Wit , bought with loss -- will , taught by wit , will mend .
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 2]: SOUTHWELL .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 5]: -- David 's Peccavi .
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 15]: After dinner , Hugh wandered over the well-known places , to bid them good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 41]: Then he went up to his room , and , with the vanity of a young author , took his poems out of the fatal old desk ; wrote : `` Take them , please , such as they are .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 19]: Let me be your friend ; '' inclosed them with the writing , and addressed them to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 18]: By the time he saw them again , they were so much waste paper in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 9]: But what were his plans for the future ?
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 10]: First of all , he would go to London .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 7]: There he would do many things .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 7]: He would try to find Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 4]: He would write .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 19]: He would make acquaintance with London life ; for had he not plenty of money in his pocket ?
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 9]: And who could live more thriftily than he ?
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 25]: -- During his last session at Aberdeen , he had given some private lessons , and so contrived to eke out his small means .
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 18]: These were wretchedly paid for , namely , not quite at the rate of sevenpence-halfpenny a lesson !
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 13]: but still that was something , where more could not be had .
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 20]: -- Now he would try to do the same in London , where he would be much better paid .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 23]: Or perhaps he might get a situation in a school for a short time , if he were driven to ultimate necessity .
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 25]: At all events , he would see London , and look about him for a little while , before he settled to anything definite .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 15]: With this hopeful prospect before him , he next morning bade adieu to Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 10]: I will not describe the parting with poor Harry .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 21]: The boy seemed ready to break his heart , and Hugh himself had enough to do to refrain from tears .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 13]: One of the grooms drove him to the railway in the dog-cart .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 12]: As they came near the station , Hugh gave him half-a-crown .
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 11]: Enlivened by the gift , the man began to talk .
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 15]: `` He 's a rum customer , that ere gemman with the foring name .
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 12]: The colour of his puss I could n't swear to now .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 20]: Never saw sixpence o ' his ` n. My opinion is , master had better look arter his spoons .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 11]: And for missus -- well , it 's a pity !
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 13]: He 's a rum un , as I say , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 13]: The man here nodded several times , half compassionately , half importantly .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 10]: Hugh did not choose to inquire what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 29]: They reached the station , and in a few minutes he was shooting along towards London , that social vortex , which draws everything towards its central tumult .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 45]: But there is a central repose beyond the motions of the world ; and through the turmoil of London , Hugh was journeying towards that wide stillness -- that silence of the soul , which is not desolate , but rich with unutterable harmonies .

Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 14]: Fog , and drizzle , and smoke , and stench composed the atmosphere .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 10]: He got out in a drift of human atoms .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 45]: Leaving his luggage at the office , he set out on foot to explore -- in fact , to go and look for his future , which , even when he met it , he would not be able to recognise with any certainty .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 29]: The first form in which he was interested to find it embodied , was that of lodgings ; but where even to look , he did not know .
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 46]: He had been in London for a few days in the spring on his way to Arnstead , so he was not utterly ignorant of the anatomy of the monster city ; but his little knowledge could not be of much service to him now .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 71]: And how different it was from the London of spring , which had lingered in his memory and imagination ; when , transformed by the `` heavenly alchemy '' of the piercing sunbeams that slanted across the streets from chimney-tops to opposite basements , the dust and smoke showed great inclined planes of light , up whose steep slopes one longed to climb to the fountain glory whence they flowed !
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 60]: Now the streets , from garret to cellar , seemed like huge kennels of muddy , moist , filthy air , down through which settled the heavier particles of smoke and rain upon the miserable human beings who crawled below in the deposit , like shrimps in the tide , or whitebait at the bottom of the muddy Thames .
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 13]: He had to wade through deep thin mud even on the pavements .
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 35]: Everybody looked depressed , and hurried by with a cowed look ; as if conscious that the rain and general misery were a plague drawn down on the city by his own individual crime .
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 9]: Nobody seemed to care for anybody or anything .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 16]: thought Hugh ; `` what a place this must be for one without money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 9]: It looked like a chaos of human nomads .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 69]: And yet , in reality , the whole mass was so bound together , interwoven , and matted , by the crossing and inter-twisting threads of interest , mutual help , and relationship of every kind , that Hugh soon found how hard it was to get within the mass at all , so as to be in any degree partaker of the benefits it shared within itself .
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 26]: He did not wish to get lodgings in the outskirts , for he thought that would remove him from every centre of action or employment .
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 7]: But he saw no lodgings anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 33]: Growing tired and hungry , he went at length into an eating-house , which he thought looked cheap ; and proceeded to dine upon a cinder , which had been a steak .
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 32]: He tried to delude himself into the idea that it was a steak still , by withdrawing his attention from it , and fixing it upon a newspaper two days old .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 11]: Finding nothing of interest , he dallied with the advertisements .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 18]: He soon came upon a column from which single gentlemen appeared to be in request as lodgers .
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 47]: Looking over these advertisements , which had more interest for him at the moment than all home and foreign news , battles and murders included , he drew a map from his pocket , and began to try to find out some of the localities indicated .
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 10]: Most of them were in or towards the suburbs .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 36]: At last he spied one in a certain square , which , after long and diligent search , and with the assistance of the girl who waited on him , he found on his map .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 27]: It was in the neighbourhood of Holborn , and , from the place it occupied in the map , seemed central enough for his vague purposes .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 11]: Above all , the terms were said to be moderate .
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 23]: But no description of the character of the lodgings was given , else Hugh would not have ventured to look at them .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 40]: What he wanted was something of the same sort as he had had in Aberdeen -- a single room , or a room and bed-room , for which he should have to pay only a few shillings a week .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 15]: Refreshed by his dinner , wretched as it was , he set out again .
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 44]: To his great joy , the rain was over , and an afternoon sun was trying , with some slight measure of success , to pierce the clouds of the London atmosphere : it had already succeeded with the clouds of the terrene .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 16]: He soon found his way into Holborn , and thence into the square in question .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 25]: It looked to him very attractive ; for it was quietness itself , and had no thoroughfare , except across one of its corners .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 18]: True , it was invaded by the universal roar -- for what place in London is not ?
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 21]: -- but it contributed little or nothing of its own manufacture to the general production of sound in the metropolis .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 15]: The centre was occupied by grass and trees , inclosed within an iron railing .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 16]: All the leaves were withered , and many had dropped already on the pavement below .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 15]: In the middle stood the statue of a queen , of days gone by .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 42]: The tide of fashion had rolled away far to the west , and yielded a free passage to the inroads of commerce , and of the general struggle for ignoble existence , upon this once favoured island in its fluctuating waters .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 45]: Old windows , flush with the external walls , whence had glanced fair eyes to which fashion was even dearer than beauty , now displayed Lodgings to Let between knitted curtains , from which all idea of drapery had been expelled by severe starching .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 33]: Amongst these he soon found the house he sought , and shrunk from its important size and bright equipments ; but , summoning courage , thought it better to ring the bell .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 62]: A withered old lady , in just the same stage of decay as the square , and adorned after the same fashion as the house , came to the door , cast a doubtful look at Hugh , and when he had stated his object , asked him , in a hard , keen , unmodulated voice , to walk in .
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 35]: He followed her , and found himself in a dining-room , which to him , judging by his purse , and not by what he had been used to of late , seemed sumptuous .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 16]: He said at once : `` It is needless for me to trouble you further .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 10]: I see your rooms will not suit me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 6]: The old lady looked annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 11]: `` Will you see the drawing-room apartments , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 5]: she said , crustily .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 10]: It would be giving you quite unnecessary trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 15]: `` My apartments have always given satisfaction , I assure you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 11]: `` Indeed , I have no reason to doubt it .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 25]: I wish I could afford to take them , '' said Hugh , thinking it better to be open than to hurt her feelings .
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 10]: `` I am sure I should be very comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 14]: But a poor -- '' He did not know what to call himself .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 4]: `` O-oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 4]: said the landlady .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 10]: Then , after a pause -- `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 2]: interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 21]: `` Well , I was a tutor last , but I do n't know what I may be next . ''
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 6]: She kept looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 12]: Once or twice she looked at him from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 6]: `` You are respectable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 11]: `` I hope so , '' said Hugh , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 6]: -- this time not interrogatively .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 9]: `` How many rooms would you like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 6]: `` The fewer the better .
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 14]: Half a one , if there were nobody in the other half . ''
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 13]: -- and you would n't give much trouble , I daresay . ''
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 12]: `` Only for coals and water to wash and drink . ''
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 10]: `` And you would n't dine at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 21]: `` No -- nor anywhere else , '' said Hugh ; but the second and larger clause was sotto voce .
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 9]: `` And you would n't smoke in-doors ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 14]: `` And you would wipe your boots clean before you went up-stairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 6]: `` Yes , certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 15]: Hugh was beginning to be exceedingly amused , but he kept his gravity wonderfully .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 7]: `` Have you any money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 8]: `` Yes ; plenty for the meantime .
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 16]: But when I shall get more , I do n't know , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 36]: `` Well , I 've a room at the top of the house , which I 'll make comfortable for you ; and you may stay as long as you like to behave yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 8]: `` But what is the rent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 9]: `` Four shillings a week -- to you .
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 8]: Would you like to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 8]: `` Yes , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 22]: She conducted him up to the third floor , and showed him a good-sized room , rather bare , but clean .
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 10]: `` This will do delightfully , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 16]: `` I will make it a little more comfortable for you , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 6]: `` Thank you very much .
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 10]: Shall I pay you a month in advance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 14]: `` No , no , '' she answered , with a grim smile .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 13]: `` I might want to get rid of you , you know .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 12]: It must be a week 's warning , no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 5]: I have no objection .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 8]: I will go and fetch my luggage .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 10]: I suppose I may come in at once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 15]: `` The sooner the better , young man , in a place like London .
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 12]: The sooner you come home the better pleased I shall be .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 4]: There now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 15]: So saying , she walked solemnly down-stairs before him , and let him out .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 22]: Hugh hurried away to fetch his luggage , delighted that he had so soon succeeded in finding just what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 31]: As he went , he speculated on the nature of his landlady , trying to account for her odd rough manner , and the real kindness of her rude words .
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 91]: He came to the conclusion that she was naturally kind to profusion , and that this kindness had , some time or other , perhaps repeatedly , been taken shameful advantage of ; that at last she had come to the resolution to defend herself by means of a general misanthropy , and supposed that she had succeeded , when she had got no further than to have so often imitated the tone of her own behaviour when at its crossest , as to have made it habitual by repetition .
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 12]: In all probability some unknown sympathy had drawn her to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 18]: She might have had a son about his age , who had run away thirty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 37]: Or rather , for she seemed an old maid , she had been jilted some time by a youth about the same size as Hugh ; and therefore she loved him the moment she saw him .
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 9]: Or , in short , a thousand things .
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 12]: Certainly seldom have lodgings been let so oddly or so cheaply .
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 22]: But some impulse or other of the whimsical old human heart , which will have its way , was satisfied therein .
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 48]: When he returned in a couple of hours , with his boxes on the top of a cab , the door was opened , before he knocked , by a tidy maid , who , without being the least like her mistress , yet resembled her excessively .
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 76]: She helped him to carry his boxes up-stairs ; and when he reached his room , he found a fire burning cheerily , a muffin down before it , a tea-kettle singing on the hob , and the tea-tray set upon a nice white cloth on a table right in front of the fire , with an old-fashioned high-backed easy-chair by its side -- the very chair to go to sleep in over a novel .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 24]: The old lady soon made her appearance , with the teapot in one hand , and a plate of butter in the other .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 7]: thank you , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 6]: `` This is comfortable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 29]: She answered only by compressing her lips till her mouth vanished altogether , and nodding her head as much as to say : `` I know it is .
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 7]: I intended it should be . ''
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 18]: She then poured water into the teapot , set it down by the fire , and vanished .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 34]: Hugh sat down in the easy-chair , and resolved to be comfortable , at least till he had had his tea ; after which he would think what he was to do next .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 23]: A knock at the door -- and his landlady entered , laid a penny newspaper on the table , and went away .
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 11]: This was just what he wanted to complete his comfort .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 15]: He took it up , and read while he consumed his bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 26]: When he had had enough of tea and newspaper , he said to himself : `` Now , what am I to do next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 24]: It is a happy thing for us that this is really all we have to concern ourselves about -- what to do next .
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 8]: No man can do the second thing .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 6]: He can do the first .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 24]: If he omits it , the wheels of the social Juggernaut roll over him , and leave him more or less crushed behind .
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 39]: If he does it , he keeps in front , and finds room to do the next again ; and so he is sure to arrive at something , for the onward march will carry him with it .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 30]: There is no saying to what perfection of success a man may come , who begins with what he can do , and uses the means at his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 20]: He makes a vortex of action , however slight , towards which all the means instantly begin to gravitate .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 35]: Let a man but lay hold of something -- anything , and he is in the high road to success -- though it may be very long before he can walk comfortably in it .
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 19]: -- It is true the success may be measured out according to a standard very different from his .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 19]: But in Hugh 's case , the difficulty was to grasp anything -- to make a beginning anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 32]: He knew nobody ; and the globe of society seemed like a mass of adamant , on which he could not gain the slightest hold , or make the slightest impression .
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 7]: Who would introduce him to pupils ?
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 2]: Nobody .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 16]: He had the testimonials of his professors ; but who would ask to see them ?
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 8]: -- His eye fell on the paper .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 4]: He would advertise .
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 5]: LETTERS FOR THE POST .
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 20]: Nothing but drought and dearth , but bush and brake , Which way soe'er I look , I see .
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 19]: Some may dream merrily , but when they wake , They dress themselves , and come to thee .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 3]: GEORGE HERBERT .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 3]: -- Home .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 48]: He got his writing materials , and wrote to the effect , that a graduate of a Scotch university was prepared to give private lessons in the classics and mathematics , or even in any of the inferior branches of education , & c. , & c .
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 10]: This he would take to the Times next day .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 18]: As soon as he had done this , Duty lifted up her head , and called him .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 9]: He obeyed , and wrote to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 19]: Duty called again ; and he wrote , though with much trepidation and humiliation , to David Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 6]: It was a good beginning .
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 16]: He had commenced his London life in doing what he knew he ought to do .
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 28]: His trepidation in writing to David , arose in part , it must be confessed , from the strange result of one of the experiments at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 5]: This was his letter .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 13]: But he sat and meditated a long time before he began it .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 47]: `` MY DEAR FRIEND , -- If I did not think you would forgive me , I should feel , now that I have once allowed my mind to rest upon my conduct to you , as if I could never hold up my head again .
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 27]: After much occupation of thought and feeling with other things , a season of silence has come , and my sins look me in the face .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 28]: First of them all is my neglect of you , to whom I owe more than to any man else , except , perhaps , my father .
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 8]: Forgive me , for forgiveness ' sake .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 15]: You know it takes a long time for a child to know its mother .
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 29]: It takes everything as a matter of course , till suddenly one day it lifts up its eyes , and knows that a face is looking at it .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 22]: I have been like the child towards you ; but I am beginning to feel what you have been to me .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 6]: I want to be good .
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 10]: I am very lonely now in great noisy London .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 12]: Write to me , if you please , and comfort me .
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 9]: I wish I were as good as you .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 8]: Then everything would go right with me .
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 13]: Do not suppose that I am in great trouble of any kind .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 14]: As yet I am very comfortable , as far as external circumstances go .
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 10]: But I have a kind of aching inside me .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 11]: Something is not right , and I want your help .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 7]: You will know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 6]: What am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 17]: Please to remember me in the kindest , most grateful manner to Mrs. Elginbrod and Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 23]: It is more than I deserve , but I hope they have not forgotten me as I have seemed to forget them .
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 19]: `` I am , my dear Mr. Elginbrod , `` Your old friend , `` HUGH SUTHERLAND . ''
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 26]: I may as well insert here another letter , which arrived at Turriepuffit , likewise addressed to David , some six weeks after the foregoing .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 32]: They were both taken to Janet , of course : `` SIR , -- I have heard from one who knows you , that you believe -- really believe in God .
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 8]: That is why I write to you .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 18]: It may seem very strange in me to do so , but how can I help it ?
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 18]: I am a very unhappy woman , for I am in the power of a bad man .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 36]: I can not explain it all to you , and I will not attempt it ; for sometimes I almost think I am out of my mind , and that it is all a delusion .
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 4]: But , alas !
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 16]: delusion or not , it is a dreadful reality to me in all its consequences .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 63]: It is of such a nature that no one can help me -- but God , if there be a God ; and if you can make me believe that there is a God , I shall not need to be persuaded that he will help me ; for I will besiege him with prayers night and day to set me free .
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 17]: And even if I am out of my mind , who can help me but him ?
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 36]: is it not when we are driven to despair , when there is no more help anywhere , that we look around for some power of good that can put right all that is wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 10]: Tell me , dear sir , what to do .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 15]: Tell me that there certainly is a God ; else I shall die raving .
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 11]: He said you knew about him better than anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 16]: `` I am , honoured Sir , `` Your obedient servant , `` EUPHRASIA CAMERON .
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 25]: `` Arnstead , Surrey , & c. , & c. '' David 's answer to this letter , would have been something worth having .
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 22]: But I think it would have been all summed up in one word : Try and see : call and listen .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 9]: But what could Janet do with such letters ?
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 14]: She did the only thing she could : she sent them to Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 19]: Hugh found it no great hardship to go to bed in the same room in which he sat .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 44]: The bed looked peculiarly inviting ; for , strange to tell , it was actually hung with the same pattern of old-fashioned chintz , as the bed which had been his from his earliest recollection , till he left his father 's house .
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 33]: How could he mistake the trees , growing with tufts to the ground , or the great birds which he used to think were crows , notwithstanding their red and yellow plumage ?
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 11]: It was all over red , brown , and yellow .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 36]: He could remember , and reconstruct the very faces , distorted and awful , which , in the delirium of childish sicknesses , he used to discover in the foliage and stems of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 12]: It made the whole place seem to him homely and kind .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 27]: When he got tired , he knelt by his bedside , which he had not done for a long time , and then went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 2]: Hardship !
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 57]: It was very pleasant to see the dying fire , and his books about and his papers ; and to dream , half-asleep and half-awake , that the house-fairies were stealing out to gambol for a little in the fire-lighted silence of the room as he slept , and to vanish as the embers turned black .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 13]: He had not been so happy for a long time as now .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 13]: The writing of that letter had removed a load from his heart .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 73]: True , we can never be at peace till we have performed the highest duty of all -- till we have arisen , and gone to our Father ; but the performance of smaller duties , yes , even of the smallest , will do more to give us temporary repose , will act more as healthful anodynes , than the greatest joys that can come to us from any other quarter .
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 57]: He soon fell asleep , and dreamed that he was a little child lost in a snow-storm ; and that just as the snow had reached above his head , and he was beginning to be smothered , a great hand caught hold of him by the arm and lifted him out ; and , lo !
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 55]: the storm had ceased , and the stars were sparkling overhead like diamonds that had been drinking the light of the sun all day ; and he saw that it was David , as strong as ever , who had rescued him , the little child , and was leading him home to Janet .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 34]: But he got sleepy and faint upon the way , which was long and cold ; and then David lifted him up and carried him in his bosom , and he fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 24]: When he woke , and , opening his eyes , looked up to him who bore him , it was David no longer .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 43]: The face was that which was marred more than any man 's , because the soul within had loved more ; it was the face of the Son of Man , and he was carrying him like a lamb in his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 51]: He gazed more and more as they travelled through the cold night ; and the joy of lying in the embrace of that man , grew and grew , till it became too strong for the bonds of sleep ; and he awoke in the fog of a London morning .
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 2]: ENDEAVOURS .
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 28]: And , even should misfortunes come , -- I , here wha sit , hae met wi ' some , An 's thankfu ' for them yet .
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 31]: They gie the wit of age to youth ; They let us ken oursel ' ; They mak ' us see the naked truth , The real guid and ill .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 29]: Tho ' losses , and crosses , Be lessons right severe , There 's wit there , ye 'll get there , Ye 'll find nae other where .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 2]: BURNS .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 22]: Hugh took his advertisement to the Times office , and paid what seemed to him an awful amount for its insertion .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 34]: Then he wandered about London till the middle of the day , when he went into a baker 's shop , and bought two penny loaves , which he put in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 25]: Having found his way to the British Museum , he devoured them at his leisure as he walked through the Grecian and Roman saloons .
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 26]: `` What is the use of good health , '' he said to himself , `` if a man can not live upon bread ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 31]: Porridge and oatmeal cakes would have pleased him as well ; but that food for horses is not so easily procured in London , and costs more than the other .
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 43]: A cousin of his had lived in Edinburgh for six months upon eighteen-pence a week in that way , and had slept the greater part of the time upon the floor , training himself for the hardships of a soldier 's life .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 74]: And he could not forget the college youth whom his comrades had considered mean , till they learned that , out of his poor bursary of fourteen pounds a session , and what he could make besides by private teaching at the rate previously mentioned or even less , he helped his parents to educate a younger brother ; and , in order to do so , lived himself upon oatmeal and potatoes .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 16]: But they did not find this out till after he was dead , poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 6]: He could not stand it .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 33]: I ought at the same time to mention , that Hugh rarely made use of a crossing on a muddy day , without finding a half-penny somewhere about him for the sweeper .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 30]: He would rather walk through oceans of mud , than cross at the natural place when he had no coppers -- especially if he had patent leather boots on .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 15]: After he had eaten his bread , he went home to get some water .
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 49]: Then , as he had nothing else to do , he sat down in his room , and began to manufacture a story , thinking it just possible it might be accepted by one or other of the pseudo-literary publications with which London is inundated in hebdomadal floods .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 59]: He found spinning almost as easy as if he had been a spider , for he had a ready invention , and a natural gift of speech ; so that , in a few days , he had finished a story , quite as good as most of those that appear in the better sort of weekly publications .
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 31]: This , in his modesty , he sent to one of the inferior sort , and heard nothing more of it than if he had flung it into the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 6]: Possibly he flew too low .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 10]: He tried again , but with no better success .
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 17]: His ambition grew with his disappointments , or perhaps rather with the exercise of his faculties .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 15]: Before many days had passed he made up his mind to try a novel .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 13]: For three months he worked at this six hours a day regularly .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 37]: When material failed him , from the exhaustion consequent upon uninterrupted production , he would recreate himself by lying fallow for an hour or two , or walking out in a mood for merely passive observation .
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 4]: But this anticipates .
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 23]: His advertisement did not produce a single inquiry , and he shrunk from spending more money in such an apparently unprofitable appliance .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 18]: Day after day went by , and no voice reached him from the unknown world of labour .
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 40]: He went at last to several stationers ' shops in the neighbourhood , bought some necessary articles , and took these opportunities of asking if they knew of any one in want of such assistance as he could give .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 27]: But unpleasant as he felt it to make such inquiries , he soon found that to most people it was equally unpleasant to reply to them .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 34]: There seemed to be something disreputable in having to answer such questions , to judge from the constrained , indifferent , and sometimes , though not often , surly answers which he received .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 23]: `` Can it be , '' thought Hugh , `` as disgraceful to ask for work as to ask for bread ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 47]: If he had had a thousand a year , and had wanted a situation of another thousand , it would have been quite commendable ; but to try to elude cold and hunger by inquiring after paltry shillings ' worths of hard labour , was despicable .
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 16]: So he placed the more hope upon his novel , and worked at that diligently .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 16]: But he did not find it quite so easy as he had at first expected .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 23]: No one finds anything either so easy or so difficult as , in opposite moods , he had expected to find it .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 13]: Everything is possible ; but without labour and failure nothing is achievable .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 33]: The labour , however , comes naturally , and experience grows without agonizing transitions ; while the failure generally points , in its detected cause , to the way of future success .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 4]: He worked on .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 10]: He did not , however , forget the ring .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 28]: Frequent were his meditations , in the pauses of his story , and when walking in the streets , as to the best means of recovering it .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 21]: I should rather say any means than best ; for it was not yet a question of choice and degrees .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 34]: The count could not but have known that the ring was of no money value ; therefore it was not likely that he had stolen it in order to part with it again .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 26]: Consequently it would be of no use to advertise it , or to search for it in the pawnbrokers ' or second-hand jewellers ' shops .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 18]: To find the crystal , it was clear as itself that he must first find the count .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 3]: But how ?
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 8]: -- He could think of no plan .
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 18]: Any alarm would place the count on the defensive , and the jewel at once beyond reach .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 26]: Besides , he wished to keep the whole matter quiet , and gain his object without his or any other name coming before the public .
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 29]: Therefore he would not venture to apply to the police , though doubtless they would be able to discover the man , if he were anywhere in London .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 11]: He surmised that in all probability they knew him already .
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 24]: But he could not come to any conclusion as to the object he must have had in view in securing such a trifle .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 101]: Hugh had all but forgotten the count 's cheque for a hundred guineas ; for , in the first place , he had never intended presenting it -- the repugnance which some minds feel to using money which they have neither received by gift nor acquired by honest earning , being at least equal to the pleasure other minds feel in gaining it without the expense of either labour or obligation ; and in the second place , since he knew more about the drawer , he had felt sure that it would be of no use to present it .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 21]: To make this latter conviction a certainty , he did present it , and found that there were no effects .
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 6]: A LETTER FROM THE POST .
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 2]: Hipolito .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 6]: Is your wife then departed ?
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 2]: Orlando .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 28]: She 's an old dweller in those high countries , yet not from me : here , she 's here ; a good couple are seldom parted .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 3]: -- DEKKER .
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 6]: What wonderful things letters are !
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 26]: In trembling and hope the fingers unclasp , and the folded sheet drops into -- no , not the post-office letter-box -- but into space .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 25]: I have read a story somewhere of a poor child that dropped a letter into the post-office , addressed to Jesus Christ in Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 12]: And it reached him , and the child had her answer .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 30]: For was it not Christ present in the good man or woman -- I forget the particulars of the story -- who sent the child the help she needed ?
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 22]: There was no necessity for him to answer in person , as in the case of Abgarus , king of Edessa .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 9]: Out of space from somewhere comes the answer .
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 76]: Such letters as those given in a previous chapter , are each a spirit-cry sent out , like a Noah 's dove , into the abyss ; and the spirit turns its ear , where its mouth had been turned before , and leans listening for the spirit-echo -- the echo with a soul in it -- the answering voice which out of the abyss will enter by the gate now turned to receive it .
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 6]: Whose will be the voice ?
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 6]: What will be the sense ?
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 19]: What chords on the harp of life have been struck afar off by the arrow-words of the letter ?
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 13]: What tones will they send back to the longing , hungering ear ?
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 25]: The mouth hath spoken , that the fainting ear may be filled by the return of its words through the alembic of another soul .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 30]: One cause of great uneasiness to Hugh was , that , for some time after a reply might have been expected , he received no answer from David Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 87]: At length , however , a letter arrived , upon the hand-writing of which he speculated in vain , perplexed with a resemblance in it to some writing that he knew ; and when he opened it , he found the following answer to his own : `` DEAR MR. SUTHERLAND , -- Your letter to my father has been sent to me by my mother , for what you will feel to be the sad reason , that he is no more in this world .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 30]: But I can not say it is so very sad to me to think that he is gone home , where my mother and I will soon join him .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 6]: True love can wait well .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 20]: Nor indeed , dear Mr. Sutherland , must you be too much troubled that your letter never reached him .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 32]: My father was like God in this , that he always forgave anything the moment there was anything to forgive ; for when else could there be such a good time ?
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 19]: -- although , of course , the person forgiven could not know it till he asked for forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 88]: But , dear Mr. Sutherland , if you could see me smiling as I write , and could yet see how earnest my heart is in writing it , I would venture to say that , in virtue of my knowing my father as I do -- for I am sure I know his very soul , as near as human love could know it -- I forgive you , in his name , for anything and everything with which you reproach yourself in regard to him .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 6]: how much I owe you !
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 11]: And how much he used to say he owed you !
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 12]: We shall thank you one day , when we all meet .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 18]: `` I am , dear Mr. Sutherland , `` Your grateful scholar , `` MARGARET ELGINBROD . ''
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 72]: Hugh burst into tears on reading this letter , -- with no overpowering sense of his own sin , for he felt that he was forgiven ; but with a sudden insight into the beauty and grandeur of the man whom he had neglected , and the wondrous loveliness which he had transmitted from the feminine part of his nature to the wholly feminine and therefore delicately powerful nature of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 95]: The vision he had beheld in the library at Arnstead , about which , as well as about many other things that had happened to him there , he could form no theory capable of embracing all the facts -- this vision returned to his mind 's eye , and he felt that the glorified face he had beheld must surely have been Margaret 's , whether he had seen it in the body or out of the body : such a face alone seemed to him worthy of the writer of this letter .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 37]: Purposely or not , there was no address given in it ; and to his surprise , when he examined the envelope with the utmost care , he could discover no postmark but the London one .
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 13]: The date-stamp likewise showed that it must have been posted in London .
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 29]: `` So , '' said he to himself , `` in my quest of a devil , I may cross the track of an angel , who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 8]: But how can she be here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 11]: To this of course he had no answer at hand .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 4]: CHAPTER V. BEGINNINGS .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 29]: Since a man is bound no farther to himself than to do wisely , chance is only to trouble them that stand upon chance -- SIR PHILIP SIDNEY .
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 4]: -- The Arcadia .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 21]: Meantime a feeble star , but sparkling some rays of comfort , began to shine upon Hugh 's wintry prospects .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 9]: The star arose in a grocer 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 27]: For one day his landlady , whose grim attentions had been increasing rather than diminishing , addressed him suddenly as she was removing his breakfast apparatus .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 30]: This was a very extraordinary event , for she seldom addressed him it all ; and replied , when he addressed her , only in the briefest manner possible .
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 12]: `` Have you got any pupils yet , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 9]: `` No -- I am sorry to say .
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 15]: But how did you come to know I wanted any , Miss Talbot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 12]: `` You should n't have secrets at home , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 17]: I like to know what concerns my own family , and I generally find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 9]: `` You saw my advertisement , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 17]: To this suggestion Miss Talbot made no other answer than the usual compression of her lips .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 16]: `` You would n't be above teaching a tradesman 's son to begin with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 6]: I should be very happy .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 9]: Do you know of such a pupil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 33]: `` Well , I ca n't exactly say I do know or I do n't know ; but I happened to mention to my grocer round the corner that you wanted pupils .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 44]: Do n't suppose , Mr. Sutherland , that I 'm in the way of talking about any young men of mine ; but it -- '' `` Not for a moment , '' interrupted Hugh ; and Miss Talbot resumed , evidently gratified .
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 27]: `` Well , if you would n't mind stepping round the corner , I should n't wonder if you might make an arrangement with Mr. Appleditch .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 12]: He said you might call upon him if you liked . ''
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 26]: Hugh jumped up , and got his hat at once ; received the few necessary directions from Miss Talbot , and soon found the shop .
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 28]: There were a good many poor people in it , buying sugar , and soap , & c. ; and one lady apparently giving a large order .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 24]: A young man came to Hugh , and bent over the counter in a recipient position , like a live point of interrogation .
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 8]: Hugh answered -- `` Mr. Appleditch . ''
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 11]: `` Mr. Appleditch will be disengaged in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 7]: Will you take a seat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 35]: The grocer was occupied with the lady and her order ; but as soon as she departed , he approached Hugh behind the rampart , and stood towards him in the usual retail attitude .
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 7]: `` My name is Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 4]: `` Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 24]: said Mr. Appleditch ; `` I think I 've ` eard the name somewheres , but I do n't know the face . ''
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 15]: `` Miss Talbot mentioned me to you , I understand , Mr. Appleditch . ''
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 2]: ah !
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 3]: I remember .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 5]: I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 10]: Will you step this way , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 26]: Hugh followed him through a sort of draw-bridge which he lifted in the counter , into a little appendix at the back of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 22]: Mr. Appleditch was a meek-looking man , with large eyes , plump pasty cheeks , and a thin little person . ''
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 9]: ` Ow de do , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 17]: said he , holding out his hand , as soon as they had reached this retreat .
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 28]: `` Thank you -- quite well ; '' answered Sutherland , shaking hands with him as well as he could , the contact not being altogether pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 12]: `` So you want pupils , do you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 13]: well you see , sir , pupils is scarce at this season .
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 12]: They ai n't to be bought in every shop -- ha !
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 3]: ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 8]: -LRB- The laugh was very mild . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 29]: `` But I think Mrs. Appleditch could find you one , if you could agree with her about the charge , you know , and all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 6]: `` How old is he ?
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 7]: A boy , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 9]: `` Well , you 're right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 5]: It is a boy .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 6]: Not very old , though .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 19]: My Samuel is just ten , but a wonderful forward boy for his years -- bless him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 11]: `` And what would you wish him to learn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 8]: Latin and Greek , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 9]: We intend bringing him up for the ministry .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 11]: -- I hope your opinions are decided , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 8]: `` On some points , they are .
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 13]: But I do not know to what you refer , exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 9]: `` I mean theological opinions , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 14]: `` But I shall not have to teach your little boy theology . ''
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 6]: `` Certainly not , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 31]: That department belongs to his mother and I. Unworthy vessels , sir ; mere earthen vessels ; but filled with the grace of God , I hope , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 42]: The grocer parted his hands , which he had been rubbing together during this conversation , and lifted them upwards from the wrists , like the fins of a seal ; then , dropping them , fell to rubbing them again .
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 5]: `` I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 26]: Well -- you know the best way will be for me -- not knowing your opinions -- to avoid everything of a religious kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 22]: but it should be line upon line , you know ; here a little , and there a little , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 21]: As the bow is bent , you know -- the -- hoop is made , you know , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 45]: Here Mr. Appleditch stepped to the door suddenly , and peeped out , as if he feared he was wanted ; but presently returning , he continued : `` But time 's a precious gift , sir , and we must not waste it .
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 48]: So , if you 'll do us the honour , sir , to dine with us next Lord 's day -- we may call it a work of necessity , you know -- you will see the little Samuel , and -- and -- Mrs. Appleditch . ''
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 7]: `` I shall be very happy .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 9]: What is your address , Mr. Appleditch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 19]: `` You had better come to Salem Chapel , Dervish town , and we can go home together .
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 5]: Service commences at eleven .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 9]: Mrs. Appleditch will be glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 7]: Ask for Mr. Appleditch 's pew .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 6]: Goo-ood morning , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 21]: Hugh took his leave , half inclined to send an excuse before the day arrived , and decline the connection .
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 19]: But his principle was , to take whatever offered , and thus make way for the next thing .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 16]: Besides , he thus avoided the responsibility of choice , from which he always shrunk .
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 10]: He returned to his novel ; but , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 17]: the inventive faculty point-blank refused to work under the weight of such a Sunday in prospect .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 30]: He wandered out , quite dispirited ; but , before long , to take his revenge upon circumstances , resolved at least to have a dinner out of them .
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 28]: So he went to a chop house , had a chop and a glass of ale , and was astonished to find how much he enjoyed them .
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 30]: In fact , abstinence gave his very plain dinner more than all the charms of a feast -- a fact of which Hugh has not been the only discoverer .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 17]: He studied Punch all the time he ate , and rose with his spirits perfectly restored .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 21]: `` Now I am in for it , '' said he , `` I will be extravagant for once . ''
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 76]: So he went and bought a cigar , which he spun out into three miles of smoke , as he wandered through Shoreditch , and Houndsditch , and Petticoat-lane , gazing at the faces of his brothers and sisters ; which faces having been so many years wrapt in a fog both moral and physical , now looked out of it as if they were only the condensed nuclei of the same fog and filth .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 30]: As he was returning through Whitechapel , he passed a man on the pavement , whose appearance was so remarkable that he could not help looking back after him .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 26]: When he reflected about it , he thought that it must have been a certain indescribable resemblance to David Elginbrod that had so attracted him .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 6]: The man was very tall .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 2]: Six-foot .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 23]: Hugh felt dwarfed beside him ; for he had to look right up , as he passed , to see his face .
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 9]: He was dressed in loose , shabby black .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 14]: He had high and otherwise very marked features , and a dark complexion .
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 20]: A general carelessness of demeanour was strangely combined with an expression of reposeful strength and quiet concentration of will .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 40]: At how much of this conclusion Hugh arrived after knowing more of him , I can not tell ; but such was the description he gave of him as he saw him first : and it was thoroughly correct .
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 33]: His countenance always seemed to me -LRB- for I knew him well -RRB- to represent a nature ever bent in one direction , but never in haste , because never in doubt .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 61]: To carry his extravagance and dissipation still further , Hugh now betook himself to the pit of the Olympic Theatre ; and no one could have laughed more heartily , or cried more helplessly , that night , than he ; for he gave himself wholly up to the influences of the ruler of the hour , the admirable Robson .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 45]: But what was his surprise when , standing up at the close of the first act , and looking around and above him , he saw , unmistakeably , the same remarkable countenance looking down upon him from the front row of the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 39]: He continued his circuit of observation , trying to discover the face of Funkelstein in the boxes or circles ; but involuntarily he turned his gaze back to the strange countenance , which still seemed bent towards his .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 16]: The curtain rose , and during the second act he forgot all about everything else .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 24]: At its close he glanced up to the gallery again , and there was the face still , and still looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 21]: At the close of the third act it had vanished , and he saw nothing more of it that evening .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 20]: When the after-piece was over , for he sat it out , he walked quietly home , much refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 15]: He had needed some relaxation , after many days of close and continuous labour .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 21]: But awfully solemn was the face of good Miss Talbot , as she opened the door for him at midnight .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 30]: Hugh took especial pains with his boots and the door-mat , but it was of no use : the austerity of her countenance would not relax in the least .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 34]: So he took his candle and walked up-stairs to his room , saying only as he went -- being unable to think of anything else : `` Good night , Miss Talbot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 12]: But no response proceeded from the offended divinity of the place .
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 27]: He went to bed , somewhat distressed at the behaviour of Miss Talbot , for he had a weakness for being on good terms with everybody .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 30]: But he resolved to have it out with her next morning ; and so fell asleep and dreamed of the strange man who had watched him at the theatre .
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 9]: He rose next morning at the usual time .
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 28]: But his breakfast was delayed half an hour ; and when it came , the maid waited upon him , and not her mistress , as usual .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 30]: When he had finished , and she returned to take away the ruins , he asked her to say to her mistress that he wanted to speak to her .
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 37]: She brought back a message , which she delivered with some difficulty , and evidently under compulsion -- that if Mr. Sutherland wanted to speak to her , he would find her in the back parlour .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 26]: Hugh went down instantly , and found Miss Talbot in a doubly frozen condition , her face absolutely blue with physical and mental cold combined .
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 7]: She waited for him to speak .
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 18]: Hugh began : `` Miss Talbot , it seems something is wrong between you and me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 12]: `` Is it because I was rather late last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 8]: `` Rather late , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 6]: Miss Talbot showed no excitement .
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 19]: With her , the thermometer , in place of rising under the influence of irritation , steadily sank .
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 17]: `` I can not make myself a prisoner on parole , you know , Miss Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 8]: You must leave me my liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 4]: Take your liberty .
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 10]: You 'll go the way of all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 12]: It 's no use trying to save any of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 20]: `` But I 'm not aware that I am in any particular want of saving , Miss Talbot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 5]: `` There it is !
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 18]: -- Well , till a sinner is called and awakened , of course it 's no use .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 12]: So I 'll just do the best I can for you .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 13]: Who can tell when the Spirit may be poured from on high ?
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 29]: But it 's very sad to me , Mr. Sutherland , to see an amiable young man like you going the way of transgressors , which is hard .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 10]: I am sorry for you , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 31]: Though the ice was not gone yet , it had begun to melt under the influences of Hugh 's good-temper , and Miss Talbot 's sympathy with his threatening fate .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 56]: Conscience , too , had something to do with the change ; for , much as one of her temperament must have disliked making such a confession , she ended by adding , after a pause : `` And very sorry , Mr. Sutherland , that I showed you any bad temper last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 4]: Poor Miss Talbot !
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 24]: Hugh saw that she was genuinely troubled about him , and resolved to offend but seldom , while he was under her roof .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 20]: `` Perhaps , when you know me longer , you will find I am steadier than you think . ''
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 7]: `` Well , it may be .
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 11]: But steadiness wo n't make a Christian of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 38]: `` It may make a tolerable lodger of me , though , '' answered Hugh ; `` and you would n't turn me into the street because I am steady and nothing more , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 10]: `` I said I was sorry , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 9]: Do you wish me to say more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 7]: `` Bless your kind heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 7]: `` I was only joking . ''
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 18]: He held out his hand to Miss Talbot , and her eyes glistened as she took it .
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 10]: She pressed it kindly , and abandoned it instantly .
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 9]: So all was right between them once more .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 17]: `` Who knows , '' murmured Miss Talbot , `` but the Lord may save him ?
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 11]: He 's surely not far from the kingdom of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 12]: I 'll do all I can to make him comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 5]: A SUNDAY 'S DINNER .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 45]: Some books are lies frae end to end , And some great lies were never penned : Even ministers , they hae been kenned , In holy rapture , Great lies and nonsense baith to vend , And nail ' t wi ' Scripture .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 2]: BURNS .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 21]: To the great discomposure of Hugh , Sunday was inevitable , and he had to set out for Salem Chapel .
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 40]: He found it a neat little Noah 's Ark of a place , built in the shape of a cathedral , and consequently sharing in the general disadvantages to which dwarfs of all kinds are subjected , absurdity included .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 9]: He was shown to Mr. Appleditch 's pew .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 27]: That worthy man received him in sleek black clothes , with white neck-cloth , and Sunday face composed of an absurd mixture of stupidity and sanctity .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 66]: He stood up , and Mrs. Appleditch stood up , and Master Appleditch stood up , and Hugh saw that the ceremony of the place required that he should force his way between the front of the pew and the person of each of the human beings occupying it , till he reached the top , where there was room for him to sit down .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 9]: No other recognition was taken till after service .
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 23]: Meantime the minister ascended the pulpit stair , with all the solemnity of one of the self-elect , and a priest besides .
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 26]: He was just old enough for the intermittent attacks of self-importance to which all youth is exposed , to have in his case become chronic .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 29]: He stood up and worshipped his creator aloud , after a manner which seemed to say in every tone : `` Behold I am he that worshippeth Thee !
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 6]: How mighty art Thou ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 31]: Then he read the Bible in a quarrelsome sort of way , as if he were a bantam , and every verse were a crow of defiance to the sinner .
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 42]: Then they sang a hymn in a fashion which brought dear old Scotland to Hugh 's mind , which has the sweetest songs in its cottages , and the worst singing in its churches , of any country in the world .
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 74]: But it was almost equalled here ; the chief cause of its badness being the absence of a modest self-restraint , and consequent tempering of the tones , on the part of the singers ; so that the result was what Hugh could describe only as scraichin .1 I was once present at the worship of some being who is supposed by negroes to love drums and cymbals , and all clangorous noises .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 18]: The resemblance , according to Hugh 's description , could not have been a very distant one .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 44]: And yet I doubt not that some thoughts of worshipping love mingled with the noise ; and perhaps the harmony of these with the spheric melodies , sounded the sweeter to the angels , from the earthly discord in which they were lapped .
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 5]: Then came the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 10]: The text was the story of the good Samaritan .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 60]: Some idea , if not of the sermon , yet of the value of it , may be formed from the fact , that the first thing to be considered , or , in other words , the first head was , `` The culpable imprudence of the man in going from Jerusalem to Jericho without an escort . ''
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 49]: It was in truth a strange , grotesque , and somewhat awful medley -- not unlike a dance of death , in which the painter has given here a lovely face , and there a beautiful arm or an exquisite foot , to the wild-prancing and exultant skeletons .
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 65]: But the parts of the sermon corresponding to the beautiful face or arm or foot , were but the fragments of Scripture , shining like gold amidst the worthless ore of the man 's own production -- worthless , save as gravel or chaff or husks have worth , in a world where dilution , and not always concentration , is necessary for healthfulness .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 19]: But there are Indians who eat clay , and thrive on it more or less , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 13]: The power of assimilation which a growing nature must possess is astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 33]: It will find its food , its real Sunday dinner , in the midst of a whole cartload of refuse ; and it will do the whole week 's work on it .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 46]: On no other supposition would it be possible to account for the earnest face of Miss Talbot , which Hugh espied turned up to the preacher , as if his face were the very star in the east , shining to guide the chosen kings .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 48]: It was well for Hugh 's power of endurance , that he had heard much the same thing in Scotland , and the same thing better dressed , and less grotesque , but more lifeless , and at heart as ill-mannered , in the church of Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 58]: Just before concluding the service , the pastor made an announcement in the following terms : `` After the close of the present service , I shall be found in the adjoining vestry by all persons desirous of communicating with me on the state of their souls , or of being admitted to the privileges of church-fellowship .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 38]: Brethren , we have this treasure in earthen vessels , and so long as this vessel lasts '' -- here he struck his chest so that it resounded -- `` it shall be faithfully and liberally dispensed .
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 5]: Let us pray . ''
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 41]: After the prayer , he spread abroad his arms and hands as if he would clasp the world in his embrace , and pronounced the benediction in a style of arrogance that the pope himself would have been ashamed of .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 30]: The service being thus concluded , the organ absolutely blasted the congregation out of the chapel , so did it storm and rave with a fervour anything but divine .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 18]: My readers must not suppose that I give this chapel as the type of orthodox dissenting chapels .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 15]: I give it only as an approximate specimen of a large class of them .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 39]: The religious life which these communities once possessed , still lingers in those of many country districts and small towns , but is , I fear , all but gone from those of the cities and larger towns .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 41]: What of it remains in these , has its chief manifestation in the fungous growth of such chapels as the one I have described , the congregations themselves taking this for a sure indication of the prosperity of the body .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 40]: How much even of the kind of prosperity which they ought to indicate , is in reality at the foundation of these appearances , I would recommend those to judge who are versed in the mysteries of chapel-building societies .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 129]: As to Hugh , whether it was that the whole was suggestive of Egyptian bondage , or that his own mood was , at the time , of the least comfortable sort , I will not pretend to determine ; but he assured me that he felt all the time , as if , instead of being in a chapel built of bricks harmoniously arranged , as by the lyre of Amphion , he were wandering in the waste , wretched field whence these bricks had been dug , of all places on the earth 's surface the most miserable , assailed by the nauseous odours , which have not character enough to be described , and only remind one of the colours on a snake 's back .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 24]: When they reached the open air , Mr. Appleditch introduced Hugh to Mrs. Appleditch , on the steps in front of the chapel .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 10]: `` This is Mr. Sutherland , Mrs. Appleditch . ''
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 12]: Hugh lifted his hat , and Mrs. Appleditch made a courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 27]: She was a very tall woman -- a head beyond her husband , extremely thin , with sharp nose , hollow cheeks , and good eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 33]: In fact , she was partly pretty , and might have been pleasant-looking , but for a large , thin-lipped , vampire-like mouth , and a general expression of greed and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 14]: She was meant for a lady , and had made herself a money-maggot .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 25]: She was richly and plainly dressed ; and until she began to be at her ease , might have passed for an unpleasant lady .
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 52]: Master Appleditch , the future pastor , was a fat boy , dressed like a dwarf , in a frock coat and man 's hat , with a face in which the meanness and keenness strove for mastery , and between them kept down the appearance of stupidity consequent on fatness .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 35]: They walked home in silence , Mr. and Mrs. Appleditch apparently pondering either upon the spiritual food they had just received , or the corporeal food for which they were about to be thankful .
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 10]: Their house was one of many in a crescent .
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 36]: Not content with his sign in town , the grocer had a large brass plate on his door , with Appleditch engraved upon it in capitals : it saved them always looking at the numbers .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 17]: The boy ran on before , and assailed this door with a succession of explosive knocks .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 24]: As soon as it was opened , in he rushed , bawling : `` Peter , Peter , here 's the new apprentice !
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 17]: Papa 's brought him home to dinner , because he was at chapel this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 20]: Then in a lower tone -- `` I mean to have a ride on his back this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 6]: The father and mother laughed .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 14]: A solemn priggish little voice answered : `` Oh , no , Johnny .
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 9]: Do n't you know what day this is ?
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 6]: This is the Sabbath-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 6]: `` The dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 4]: sighed his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 14]: `` That boy is too good to live , '' responded the father .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 16]: Hugh was shown into the dining-room , where the table was already laid for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 10]: It was evident that the Appleditches were well-to-do people .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 18]: The room was full of what is called handsome furniture , in a high state of polish .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 24]: Over the chimney-piece hung the portrait of a preacher in gown and bands , the most prominent of whose features were his cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 25]: In a few minutes the host and hostess entered , followed by a pale-faced little boy , the owner of the voice of reproof .
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 22]: `` Come here , Peetie , '' said his mother , `` and tell Mr. Sutherland what you have got . ''
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 23]: She referred to some toy -- no , not toy , for it was the Sabbath -- to some book , probably .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 26]: Peetie answered in a solemn voice , mouthing every vowel : `` I 've got five bags of gold in the Bank of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 5]: `` Poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 9]: said his mother , with a scornful giggle .
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 16]: `` You would n't have much to reckon on , if that were all . ''
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 10]: Two or three gaily dressed riflemen passed the window .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 34]: The poor fellows , unable to bear the look of their Sunday clothes , if they had any , after being used to their uniform , had come out in all its magnificence .
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 35]: said Mr. Appleditch , `` that 's all very well in a state of nature ; but when a man is once born into a state of grace , Mr. Sutherland -- ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 19]: `` Really , '' responded Mrs. Appleditch , `` the worldliness of the lower classes is quite awful .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 13]: But they are spared for a day of wrath , poor things !
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 20]: I am sure that accident on the railway last Sabbath , might have been a warning to them all .
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 26]: After that they ca n't say there is not a God that ruleth in the earth , and taketh vengeance for his broken Sabbaths . ''
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 4]: `` Mr. -- .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 23]: I do n't know your name , '' said Peter , whose age Hugh had just been trying in vain to conjecture .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 9]: `` Mr. Sutherland , '' said the mother .
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 11]: `` Mr. Slubberman , are you a converted character ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 3]: resumed Peter .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 12]: `` Why do you ask me that , Master Peter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 7]: said Hugh , trying to smile .
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 36]: `` I think you look good , but mamma says she do n't think you are , because you say Sunday instead of Sabbath , and she always finds people who do are worldly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 23]: Mrs. Appleditch turned red -- not blushed , and said , quickly : `` Peter should n't repeat everything he hears . ''
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 8]: `` No more I do , ma .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 32]: I have n't told what you said about -- '' Here his mother caught him up , and carried him out of the room , saying : `` You naughty boy !
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 7]: You shall go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , I sha n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 6]: `` Yes , you shall .
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 12]: Here , Jane , take this naughty boy to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 6]: `` I 'll scream . ''
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 5]: `` Will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 7]: `` Yes , I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 22]: And such a yell was there Of sudden and portentous birth , As if ... ten cats were being cooked alive .
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 2]: well !
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 2]: well !
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 3]: my Peetie !
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 15]: He sha n't go to bed , if he 'll be a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 6]: Will he be good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 10]: `` May I stay up to supper , then ?
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 4]: May I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 12]: `` Yes , yes ; anything to stop such dreadful screaming .
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 10]: You are very naughty -- very naughty indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 5]: I 'm not naughty .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 6]: I 'll scream again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 13]: Go and get your pinafore on , and come down to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 7]: Anything rather than a scream . ''
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 36]: I am sick of all this , and doubt if it is worth printing ; but it amused me very much one night as Hugh related it over a bottle of Chablis and a pipe .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 63]: He certainly did not represent Mrs. Appleditch in a very favourable light on the whole ; but he took care to say that there was a certain liberality about the table , and a kind of heartiness in her way of pressing him to have more than he could possibly eat , which contrasted strangely with her behaviour afterwards in money matters .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 14]: There are many people who can be liberal in almost anything but money .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 13]: They seem to say , `` Take anything but my purse . ''
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 20]: Miss Talbot told him afterwards , that this same lady was quite active amongst the poor of her district .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 67]: She made it a rule never to give money , or at least never more than sixpence ; but she turned scraps of victuals and cast-off clothes to the best account ; and , if she did not make friends with the mammon of unrighteousness , she yet kept an eye on the eternal habitations in the distribution of the crumbs that fell from her table .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 55]: Poor Mr. Appleditch , on the other hand , often embezzled a shilling or a half-crown from the till , for the use of a poor member of the same church -- meaning by church , the individual community to which he belonged ; but of this , Mrs. Appleditch was carefully kept ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 43]: After dinner was over , and the children had been sent away , which was effected without a greater amount of difficulty than , from the anticipative precautions adopted , appeared to be lawful and ordinary , Mr. Appleditch proceeded to business .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 16]: `` Now , Mr. Sutherland , what do you think of Johnnie , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 23]: `` It is impossible for me to say yet ; but I am quite willing to teach him if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 12]: `` He 's a forward boy , '' said his mother .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 41]: `` Not a doubt of it , '' responded Hugh ; for he remembered the boy asking him , across the table : `` Is n't our Mr. Lixom '' -- -LRB- the pastor -RRB- -- `` a oner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 12]: `` And very eager and retentive , '' said his father .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 29]: Hugh had seen the little glutton paint both cheeks to the eyes with damson tart , and render more than a quantity proportionate to the colouring , invisible .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 34]: `` Yes , he is eager , and retentive , too , I daresay , '' he said ; `` but much will depend on whether he has a turn for study . ''
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 10]: `` Well , you will find that out to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 10]: I think you will be surprised , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 12]: `` At what hour would you like me to come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 11]: `` Stop , Mr. Appleditch , '' interposed his wife .
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 25]: `` You have said nothing yet about terms ; and that is of some importance , considering the rent and taxes we pay . ''
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 15]: `` Well , my love , what do you feel inclined to give ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 12]: `` How much do you charge a lesson , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 38]: Only let me remind you , sir , that he is a very little boy , although stout , and that you can not expect to put much Greek and Latin into him for some time yet .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 22]: Besides , we want you to come every day , which ought to be considered in the rate of charge . ''
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 10]: `` Of course it ought , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 12]: `` How much do you say , then , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 11]: `` I should be content with half-a-crown a lesson . ''
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 7]: `` I daresay you would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 7]: replied the lady , with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 3]: `` Half-a-crown !
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 10]: That 's -- six half-crowns is -- fifteen shillings .
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 11]: Fifteen shillings a week for that mite of a boy !
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 14]: Mr. Sutherland , you ought to be ashamed of yourself , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 35]: `` You forget , Mrs. Appleditch , that it is as much trouble to me to teach one little boy -- yes , a great deal more than to teach twenty grown men . ''
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 11]: `` You ought to be ashamed of yourself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 19]: You a Christian man , and talk of trouble in teaching such a little cherub as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 27]: `` But do pray remember the distance I have to come , and that it will take nearly four hours of my time every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 9]: `` Then you can get lodgings nearer . ''
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 11]: `` But I could not get any so cheap . ''
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 12]: `` Then you can the better afford to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 18]: And she threw herself back in her chair , as if she had struck the decisive blow .
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 21]: Mr. Appleditch remarked , gently : `` It is good for your health to walk the distance , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 18]: Mrs. Appleditch resumed : `` I wo n't give a farthing more than one shilling a lesson .
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 5]: There , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 19]: `` Very well , '' said Hugh , rising ; `` then I must wish you good day .
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 12]: We need not waste more time in talking about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 18]: `` Surely you are not going to make any use of your time on a Sunday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 6]: said the grocer , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 11]: `` Do n't be in a hurry , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 12]: We tradespeople like to make the best bargain we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 10]: `` Mr. Appleditch , I am ashamed of you .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 6]: You always will be vulgar .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 8]: You always smell of the shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 12]: `` Well , my dear , how can I help it ?
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 11]: The sugar and soft-soap will smell , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 9]: `` Mr. Appleditch , you disgust me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 3]: `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 2]: dear !
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 6]: I am sorry for that .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 18]: -- Suppose we say to Mr. Sutherland -- '' `` Now , you leave that to me .
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 44]: I 'll tell you what , Mr. Sutherland -- I 'll give you eighteenpence a lesson , and your dinner on the Sabbath ; that is , if you sit under Mr. Lixom in our pew , and walk home with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 9]: `` That I must decline '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 10]: `` I must have my Sundays for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 5]: Mrs. Appleditch was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 22]: She had coveted the additional importance which the visible possession of a live tutor would secure her at `` Salem . ''
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 7]: Mr. Sutherland , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 28]: `` And I must trust my child , with an immortal soul in his inside , to one who wants the Lord 's only day for himself !
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 8]: -- for himself , Mr. Sutherland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 12]: Hugh made no answer , because he had none to make .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 15]: Again Mrs. Appleditch resumed : `` Shall it be a bargain , Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 17]: Eighteen-pence a lesson -- that 's nine shillings a week -- and begin to morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 16]: Hugh 's heart sunk within him , not so much with disappointment as with disgust .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 21]: But to a man who is making nothing , the prospect of earning ever so little , is irresistibly attractive .
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 16]: Even on a shilling a day , he could keep hunger at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 8]: And a beginning is half the battle .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 3]: He resolved .
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 13]: `` Let it be a bargain , then , Mrs. Appleditch . ''
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 34]: The lady immediately brightened up , and at once put on her company-manners again , behaving to him with great politeness , and a sneer that would not be hid away under it .
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 37]: From this Hugh suspected that she had made a better bargain than she had hoped ; but the discovery was now too late , even if he could have brought himself to take advantage of it .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 13]: He hated bargain-making as heartily as the grocer 's wife loved it .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 9]: He very soon rose to take his leave .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 18]: said Mrs. Appleditch to her husband , `` but Mr. Sutherland has not seen the drawing-room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 26]: Hugh wondered what there could be remarkable about the drawing-room ; but he soon found that it was the pride of Mrs. Appleditch 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 24]: She abstained from all use of it except upon great occasions -- when parties of her friends came to drink tea with her .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 21]: She made a point , however , of showing it to everybody who entered the house for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 25]: So Hugh was led up-stairs , to undergo the operation of being shown the drawing-room , and being expected to be astonished at it .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 8]: I asked him what it was like .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 17]: He answered : `` It was just what it ought to be -- rich and ugly .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 43]: Mr. Appleditch , in his deacon 's uniform , hung over the fire , and Mrs. Appleditch , in her wedding-dress , over the piano ; for there was a piano , and she could play psalm-tunes on it with one finger .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 23]: The round table in the middle of the room had books in gilded red and blue covers symmetrically arranged all round it .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 8]: This is all I can recollect . ''
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 32]: Having feasted his eyes on the magnificence thus discovered to him , he walked home , more depressed at the prospect of his new employment than he could have believed possible .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 49]: On his way he turned aside into the Regent 's Park , where the sight of the people enjoying themselves -- for it was a fine day for the season -- partially dispelled the sense of living corruption and premature burial which he had experienced all day long .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 188]: He kept as far off from the rank of open-air preachers as possible , and really was able to thank God that all the world did not keep Scotch Sabbath -- a day neither Mosaic , nor Jewish , nor Christian : not Mosaic , inasmuch as it kills the very essence of the fourth commandment , which is Rest , transmuting it into what the chemists would call a mechanical mixture of service and inertia ; not Jewish , inasmuch as it is ten times more severe , and formal , and full of negations , than that of the Sabbatarian Jews reproved by the Saviour for their idolatry of the day ; and unchristian , inasmuch as it insists , beyond appeal , on the observance of times and seasons , abolished , as far as law is concerned , by the word of the chief of the apostles ; and elevates into an especial test of piety a custom not even mentioned by the founders of christianity at all -- that , namely , of accounting this day more holy than all the rest .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 11]: These last are but outside reasons for calling it unchristian .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 17]: There are far deeper and more important ones , which can not well be produced here .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 66]: It is not Hugh , however , who is to be considered accountable for all this , but the historian of his fortunes , between whom and the vision of a Lord 's Day indeed , there arises too often the nightmare-memory of a Scotch Saabbath -- between which and its cousin , the English Sunday , there is too much of a family likeness .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 69]: The grand men and women whom I have known in Scotland , seem to me , as I look back , to move about in the mists of a Scotch Sabbath , like a company of way-worn angels in the Limbo of Vanity , in which there is no air whereupon to smite their sounding wings , that they may rise into the sunlight of God 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 3]: SUNDAY EVENING .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 88]: Now resteth in my memory but this point , which indeed is the chief to you of all others ; which is the choice of what men you are to direct yourself to ; for it is certain no vessel can leave a worse taste in the liquor it contains , than a wrong teacher infects an unskilful hearer with that which hardly will ever out ... But you may say , `` How shall I get excellent men to take pains to speak with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 14]: Truly , in few words , either by much expense or much humbleness .
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 10]: Letter of Sir Philip Sidney to his brother Robert .
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 77]: How many things which , at the first moment , strike us as curious coincidences , afterwards become so operative on our lives , and so interwoven with the whole web of their histories , that instead of appearing any more as strange accidents , they assume the shape of unavoidable necessities , of homely , ordinary , lawful occurrences , as much in their own place as any shaft or pinion of a great machine !
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 10]: It was dusk before Hugh turned his steps homeward .
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 15]: He wandered along , thinking of Euphra and the Count and the stolen rings .
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 10]: He greatly desired to clear himself to Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 61]: He saw that the nature of the ring tended to justify Mr. Arnold 's suspicions ; for a man who would not steal for money 's worth , might yet steal for value of another sort , addressing itself to some peculiar weakness ; and Mr. Arnold might have met with instances of this nature in his position as magistrate .
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 18]: He greatly desired , likewise , for Euphra 's sake , to have Funkelstein in his power .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 40]: His own ring was beyond recovery ; but if , by its means , he could hold such a lash over him as would terrify him from again exercising his villanous influences on her , he would be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 14]: While plunged in this contemplation , he came upon two policemen talking together .
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 13]: He recognized one of them as a Scotchman , from his speech .
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 32]: It occurred to him at once to ask his advice , in a modified manner ; and a moment 's reflection convinced him that it would at least do no harm .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 5]: He would do it .
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 18]: It was one of those resolutions at which one arrives by an arrow flight of the intellect .
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 23]: `` You are a countryman of mine , I think , '' said he , as soon as the two had parted .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 18]: `` If ye 're a Scotchman , sir -- may be ay , may be no . ''
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 9]: `` Whaur come ye frae , man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 6]: `` Ou , Aberdeen-awa . ''
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 7]: `` It 's mine ain calf-country .
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 10]: An ' what do they ca ' ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 9]: `` They ca ' me John MacPherson . ''
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 7]: `` My name 's Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 5]: `` Eh , man !
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 8]: It 's my ain mither 's name .
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 14]: Gie 's a grup o ' yer han ' , Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 6]: -- Eh , man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 10]: he repeated , shaking Hugh 's hand with vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 23]: `` I have no doubt , '' said Hugh , relapsing into English , `` that we are some cousins or other .
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 19]: It 's very lucky for me to find a relative , for I wanted some -- advice . ''
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 19]: He took care to say advice , which a Scotchman is generally prepared to bestow of his best .
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 22]: Had it been sixpence , the cousinship would have required elaborate proof , before the treaty could have made further progress .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 11]: `` I 'm fully at your service , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 9]: `` When will you be off duty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 7]: `` At nine o'clock preceesely . ''
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 14]: `` Come to No. 13 , -- Square , and ask for me .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 6]: It 's not far . ''
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 16]: `` Wi ' pleesir , sir , ` gin ` twar twise as far . ''
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 62]: Hugh would not have ventured to ask him to his house on Sunday night , when no refreshments could be procured , had he not remembered a small pig -LRB- Anglicé stone bottle -RRB- of real mountain dew , which he had carried with him when he went to Arnstead , and which had lain unopened in one of his boxes .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 26]: Miss Talbot received her lodger with more show of pleasure than usual , for he came lapped in the odour of the deacon 's sanctity .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 19]: But she was considerably alarmed and beyond measure shocked when the policeman called and requested to see him .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 10]: Sally had rushed in to her mistress in dismay .
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 12]: `` Please 'm , there 's a pleaceman wants Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 4]: lor 'm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 21]: `` Well , go and let Mr. Sutherland know , you stupid girl , '' answered her mistress , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 4]: lor 'm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 17]: was all Sally 's reply , as she vanished to bear the awful tidings to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 21]: `` He ca n't have been housebreaking already , '' said Miss Talbot to herself , as she confessed afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 9]: `` But it may be forgery or embezzlement .
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 16]: I told the poor deluded young man that the way of transgressors was hard . ''
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 26]: `` Please , sir , you 're wanted , sir , '' said Sally , out of breath , and pale as her Sunday apron .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 6]: `` Who wants me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 3]: asked Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 19]: `` Please , sir , the pleaceman , sir , '' answered Sally , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 28]: Hugh was perfectly bewildered by the girl 's behaviour , and said in a tone of surprise : `` Well , show him up , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 3]: `` Ooh !
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 56]: sir , '' said Sally , with a Plutonic sigh , and began to undo the hooks of her dress ; `` if you would n't mind , sir , just put on my frock and apron , and take a jug in your hand , an ' the pleaceman 'll never look at you .
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 14]: I 'll take care of everything till you come back , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 7]: And again she burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 23]: Sally was a great reader of the Family Herald , and knew that this was an orthodox plan of rescuing a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 35]: The kindness of her anxiety moderated the expression of Hugh 's amusement ; and having convinced her that he was in no danger , he easily prevailed upon her to bring the policeman upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 53]: Over a tumbler of toddy , the weaker ingredients of which were procured by Sally 's glad connivance , with a lingering idea of propitiation , and a gentle hint that Missus must n't know -- the two Scotchmen , seated at opposite corners of the fire , had a long chat .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 22]: They began about the old country , and the places and people they both knew , and both did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 23]: If they had met on the shores of the central lake of Africa , they could scarcely have been more couthy together .
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 13]: At length Hugh referred to the object of his application to MacPherson .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 21]: `` What plan would you have me pursue , John , to get hold of a man in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 10]: `` I could manage that for ye , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 12]: I ken maist the haill mengie o ' the detaictives . ''
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 28]: `` But you see , unfortunately , I do n't wish , for particular reasons , that the police should have anything to do with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 3]: `` Ay !
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 2]: ay !
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 2]: Hm !
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 2]: Hm !
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 4]: I see brawly .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 12]: Ye 'll be efter a stray sheep , nae doot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 15]: Hugh did not reply ; so leaving him to form any conclusion he pleased .
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 25]: `` Ye see , '' MacPherson continued , `` it 's no that easy to a body that 's no up to the trade .
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 15]: Hae ye ony clue like , to set ye spierin ' upo ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 6]: `` Not the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 6]: The man pondered a while .
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 12]: `` I hae ` t , '' he exclaimed at last .
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 14]: `` What a fule I was no to think o ' that afore !
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 65]: Gi n't be a puir bit yow-lammie like , ` at ye 're efter , I 'll tell ye what : there 's ae man , a countryman o ' our ain , an ' a gentleman forbye , that 'll do mair for ye in that way , nor a ' the detaictives thegither ; an ' that 's Robert Falconer , Esquire .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 7]: -- I ken him weel . ''
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 10]: `` But I do n't , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 10]: `` But I 'll introduce ye till ` im .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 14]: He bides close at han ' here ; roun ' twa corners jist .
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 30]: An ' I 'm thinkin ' he 'll be at hame the noo ; for I saw him gaein that get , afore ye cam ' up to me .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 22]: An ' the suner we gang , the better ; for he 's no aye to be gotten hand o ' .
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 2]: Fegs !
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 9]: he may be in Shoreditch or this . ''
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 11]: `` But will he not consider it an intrusion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 13]: `` Na , na ; there 's no fear o ' that .
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 36]: He 's ony man 's an ' ilka woman 's freen -- so be he can do them a guid turn ; but he 's no for drinkin ' and daffin ' an ' that .
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 15]: Come awa ' , Maister Sutherlan ' , he 's yer verra man . ''
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 10]: Thus urged , Hugh rose and accompanied the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 22]: He took him round rather more than two corners ; but within five minutes they stood at Mr. Falconer 's door .
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 3]: John rang .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 24]: The door opened without visible service , and they ascended to the first floor , which was enclosed something after the Scotch fashion .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 9]: Here a respectable looking woman awaited their ascent .
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 11]: `` Is Mr. Falconer at hom ' , mem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 5]: said Hugh 's guide .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 15]: `` He is ; but I think he 's just going out again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 25]: `` Will ye tell him , mem , ` at hoo John MacPherson , the policeman , would like sair to see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 18]: `` I will , '' she answered ; and went in , leaving them at the door .
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 67]: She returned in a moment , and , inviting them to enter , ushered them into a large bare room , in which there was just light enough for Hugh to recognize , to his astonishment , the unmistakeable figure of the man whom he had met in Whitechapel , and whom he had afterwards seen apparently watching him from the gallery of the Olympic Theatre .
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 8]: `` How are you , MacPherson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 11]: said a deep powerful voice , out of the gloom .
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 11]: `` Verra weel , I thank ye , Mr. Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 9]: Hoo are ye yersel ' , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 8]: `` Very well too , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 6]: Who is with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 40]: `` It 's a gentleman , sir , by the name o ' Mr. Sutherlan ' , wha wants your help , sir , aboot somebody or ither ` at he 's enteresstit in , wha 's disappeared . ''
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 29]: Falconer advanced , and , bowing to Hugh said , very graciously : `` I shall be most happy to serve Mr. Sutherland , if in my power .
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 16]: Our friend MacPherson has rather too exalted an idea of my capabilities , however . ''
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 31]: `` Weel , Maister Falconer , I only jist spier at yersel ' , whether or no ye was ever dung wi ' onything ye took in han ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 7]: Falconer made no reply to this .
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 17]: There was the story of a whole life in his silence -- past and to come .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 17]: He merely said : `` You can leave the gentleman with me , then , John .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 8]: I 'll take care of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 9]: `` No fear o ' that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 4]: Deil a bit !
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 14]: though a ' the policemen i ' Lonnon war efter ` im . ''
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 12]: `` I 'm much obliged to you for bringing him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 13]: `` The obligation 's mine sir -- an ' the gentleman 's .
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 5]: Good nicht , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 7]: Good nicht , Mr. Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 13]: Ye 'll ken whaur to fin ' me gin ye want me .
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 9]: Yon 's my beat for anither fortnicht . ''
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 17]: `` And you know my quarters , '' said Hugh , shaking him by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 9]: `` I am greatly obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 7]: `` Not a bit , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 12]: Or gin ye war , ye sud be hertily welcome . ''
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 14]: `` Bring candles , Mrs. Ashton , '' Falconer called from the door .
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 31]: Then , turning to Hugh , `` Sit down , Mr. Sutherland , '' he said , `` if you can find a chair that is not illegally occupied already .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 9]: Perhaps we had better wait for the candles .
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 9]: What a pleasant day we have had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 42]: `` Then you have been more pleasantly occupied than I have , '' thought Hugh , to whose mind returned the images of the Appleditch family and its drawing-room , followed by the anticipation of the distasteful duties of the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 15]: But he only said : `` It has been a most pleasant day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 10]: `` I spent it strangely , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 7]: Here the candles were brought in .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 12]: The two men looked at each other full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 10]: Hugh saw that he had not been in error .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 8]: The same remarkable countenance was before him .
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 3]: Falconer smiled .
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 10]: `` We have met before , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 8]: `` We have , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 21]: `` I had a conviction we should be better acquainted , but I did not expect it so soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 9]: `` Are you a clairvoyant , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 7]: `` Not in the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 16]: `` Or , perhaps , being a Scotchman , you have the second sight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 9]: `` I am hardly Celt enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 35]: But I am a sort of a seer , after all -- from an instinct of the spiritual relations of things , I hope ; not in the least from the nervo-material side . ''
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 8]: `` I think I understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 7]: `` Are you at leisure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 4]: `` Entirely . ''
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 9]: `` Had we not better walk , then ?
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 25]: I have to go as far as Somers Town -- no great way ; and we can talk as well walking as sitting . ''
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 10]: `` With pleasure , '' answered Hugh , rising .
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 9]: `` Will you take anything before you go ?
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 5]: A glass of port ?
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 11]: It is the only wine I happen to have . ''
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 8]: `` Not a drop , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 9]: I seldom taste anything stronger than water . ''
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 5]: `` I like that .
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 9]: But I like a glass of port too .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 4]: Come then . ''
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 42]: And Falconer rose -- and a great rising it was ; for , as I have said , he was two or three inches taller than Hugh , and much broader across the shoulders ; and Hugh was no stripling now .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 40]: He could not help thinking again of his old friend , David Elginbrod , to whom he had to look up to find the living eyes of him , just as now he looked up to find Falconer 's .
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 14]: But there was a great difference between those organs in the two men .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 47]: David 's had been of an ordinary size , pure keen blue , sparkling out of cerulean depths of peace and hope , full of lambent gleams when he was loving any one , and ever ready to be dimmed with the mists of rising emotion .
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 57]: All that Hugh could yet discover of Falconer 's eyes was , that they were large , and black as night , and set so far back in his head , that each gleamed out of its caverned arch like the reversed torch of the Greek Genius of Death , just before going out in night .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 16]: Either the frontal sinus was very large , or his observant faculties were peculiarly developed .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 12]: They went out , and walked for some distance in silence .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 23]: Hugh ventured to say at length : `` You said you had spent the day strangely : May I ask how ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 12]: `` In a condemned cell in Newgate , '' answered Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 26]: `` I am not in the habit of going to such places , but the man wanted to see me , and I went . ''
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 24]: As Falconer said no more , and as Hugh was afraid of showing anything like vulgar curiosity , this thread of conversation broke .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 14]: Nothing worth recording passed until they entered a narrow court in Somers Town .
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 8]: `` Are you afraid of infection ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 3]: Falconer said .
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 18]: `` Not in the least , if there be any reason for exposing myself to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 5]: `` That is right .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 14]: -- And I need not ask if you are in good health . ''
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 8]: `` I am in perfect health . ''
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 20]: `` Then I need not mind asking you to wait for me till I come out of this house .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 7]: There is typhus in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 7]: `` I will wait with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 14]: I will go with you if I can be of any use . ''
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 6]: `` There is no occasion .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 9]: It is not your business this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 12]: So saying , Falconer opened the door , and walked in .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 23]: Said Hugh to himself : `` I must tell this man the whole story ; and with it all my own . ''
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 22]: In a few minutes Falconer rejoined him , looking solemn , but with a kind of relieved expression on his face .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 11]: `` The poor fellow is gone , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 34]: `` What a thing it must be , Mr. Sutherland , for a man to break out of the choke-damp of a typhus fever into the clear air of the life beyond ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' said Hugh ; adding , after a slight hesitation , `` if he be at all prepared for the change . ''
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 35]: `` Where a change belongs to the natural order of things , '' said Falconer , `` and arrives inevitably at some hour , there must always be more or less preparedness for it .
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 17]: Besides , I think a man is generally prepared for a breath of fresh air . ''
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 18]: Hugh did not reply , for he felt that he did not fully comprehend his new acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 19]: But he had a strong suspicion that it was because he moved in a higher region than himself .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 75]: `` If you will still accompany me , '' resumed Falconer , who had not yet adverted to Hugh 's object in seeking his acquaintance , `` you will , I think , be soon compelled to believe that , at whatever time death may arrive , or in whatever condition the man may be at the time , it comes as the best and only good that can at that moment reach him .
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 36]: We are , perhaps , too much in the habit of thinking of death as the culmination of disease , which , regarded only in itself , is an evil , and a terrible evil .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 42]: But I think rather of death as the first pulse of the new strength , shaking itself free from the old mouldy remnants of earth-garments , that it may begin in freedom the new life that grows out of the old .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 7]: The caterpillar dies into the butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 32]: Who knows but disease may be the coming , the keener life , breaking into this , and beginning to destroy like fire the inferior modes or garments of the present ?
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 37]: And then disease would be but the sign of the salvation of fire ; of the agony of the greater life to lift us to itself , out of that wherein we are failing and sinning .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 11]: And so we praise the consuming fire of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 14]: `` But surely all can not fare alike in the new life . ''
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 5]: `` Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 5]: According to the condition .
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 39]: But what would be hell to one , will be quietness , and hope , and progress to another ; because he has left worse behind him , and in this the life asserts itself , and is .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 20]: -- But perhaps you are not interested in such subjects , Mr. Sutherland , and I weary you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 19]: `` If I have not been interested in them hitherto , I am ready to become so now .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 7]: Let me go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 5]: `` With pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 37]: As I have attempted to tell a great deal about Robert Falconer and his pursuits elsewhere , I will not here relate the particulars of their walk through some of the most wretched parts of London .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 59]: Suffice it to say that , if Hugh , as he walked home , was not yet prepared to receive and understand the half of what Falconer had said about death , and had not yet that faith in God that gives as perfect a peace for the future of our brothers and sisters , who , alas !
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 58]: have as yet been fed with husks , as for that of ourselves , who have eaten bread of the finest of the wheat , and have been but a little thankful , -- he yet felt at least that it was a blessed thing that these men and women would all die -- must all die .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 31]: That spectre from which men shrink , as if it would take from them the last shivering remnant of existence , he turned to for some consolation even for them .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 82]: He was prepared to believe that they could not be going to worse in the end , though some of the rich and respectable and educated might have to receive their evil things first in the other world ; and he was ready to understand that great saying of Schiller -- full of a faith evident enough to him who can look far enough into the saying : `` Death can not be an evil , for it is universal . ''
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 2]: EUPHRA .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 2]: Samson .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 25]: O that torment should not be confined To the body 's wounds and sores , But must secret passage find To the inmost mind .
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 22]: Dire inflammation , which no cooling herb Or medicinal liquor can asswage , Nor breath of vernal air from snowy Alp .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 31]: Sleep hath forsook and given me o'er To death 's benumming opium as my only cure , Thence faintings , swoonings of despair , And sense of heaven 's desertion .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 2]: MILTON .
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 4]: -- Samson Agonistes .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 22]: Hitherto I have chiefly followed the history of my hero , if hero in any sense he can yet be called .
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 26]: Now I must leave him for a while , and take up the story of the rest of the few persons concerned in my tale .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 13]: Lady Emily had gone to Madeira , and Mr. Arnold had followed .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 16]: Mrs. Elton and Harry , and Margaret , of course , had gone to London .
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 7]: Euphra was left alone at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 11]: A great alteration had taken place in this strange girl .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 17]: The servants were positively afraid of her now , from the butler down to the kitchen-maid .
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 21]: She used to go into violent fits of passion , in which the mere flash of her eyes was overpowering .
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 55]: These outbreaks would be followed almost instantaneously by seasons of the deepest dejection , in which she would confine herself to her room for hours , or , lame as she was , wander about the house and the Ghost 's Walk , herself pale as a ghost , and looking meagre and wretched .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 41]: Also , she became subject to frequent fainting fits , the first of which took place the night before Hugh 's departure , after she had returned to the house from her interview with him in the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 5]: She was evidently miserable .
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 27]: For this misery we know that there were very sufficient reasons , without taking into account the fact that she had no one to fascinate now .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 17]: Her continued lameness , which her restlessness aggravated , likewise gave her great cause for anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 73]: But I presume that , even during the early part of her confinement , her mind had been thrown back upon itself , in that consciousness which often arises in loneliness and suffering ; and that even then she had begun to feel that her own self was a worse tyrant than the count , and made her a more wretched slave than any exercise of his unlawful power could make her .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 26]: Some natures will endure an immense amount of misery before they feel compelled to look there for help , whence all help and healing comes .
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 121]: They can not believe that there is verily an unseen mysterious power , till the world and all that is in it has vanished in the smoke of despair ; till cause and effect is nothing to the intellect , and possible glories have faded from the imagination ; then , deprived of all that made life pleasant or hopeful , the immortal essence , lonely and wretched and unable to cease , looks up with its now unfettered and wakened instinct , to the source of its own life -- to the possible God who , notwithstanding all the improbabilities of his existence , may yet perhaps be , and may yet perhaps hear his wretched creature that calls .
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 40]: In this loneliness of despair , life must find The Life ; for joy is gone , and life is all that is left : it is compelled to seek its source , its root , its eternal life .
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 8]: This alone remains as a possible thing .
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 25]: Strange condition of despair into which the Spirit of God drives a man -- a condition in which the Best alone is the Possible !
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 8]: Other simpler natures look up at once .
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 30]: Even before the first pang has passed away , as by a holy instinct of celestial childhood , they lift their eyes to the heavens whence cometh their aid .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 7]: Of this class Euphra was not .
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 6]: She belonged to the former .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 19]: And yet even she had begun to look upward , for the waters had closed above her head .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 17]: She betook herself to the one man of whom she had heard as knowing about God .
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 8]: She wrote , but no answer came .
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 12]: Days and days passed away , and there was no reply .
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 4]: just so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 6]: she said , in bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 18]: `` And if I cried to God for ever , I should hear no word of reply .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 20]: If he be , he sits apart , and leaves the weak to be the prey of the bad .
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 5]: What cares he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 37]: Yet , as she spoke , she rose , and , by a sudden impulse , threw herself on the floor , and cried for the first time : `` O God , help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 6]: Was there voice or hearing ?
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 31]: She rose at least with a little hope , and with the feeling that if she could cry to him , it might be that he could listen to her .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 27]: It seemed natural to pray ; it seemed to come of itself : that could not be except it was first natural for God to hear .
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 25]: The foundation of her own action must be in him who made her ; for her call could be only a response after all .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 6]: The time passed wearily by .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 30]: Dim , slow November days came on , with the fall of the last brown shred of those clouds of living green that had floated betwixt earth and heaven .
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 37]: Through the bare boughs of the overarching avenue of the Ghost 's Walk , themselves living skeletons , she could now look straight up to the blue sky , which had been there all the time .
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 43]: And she had begun to look up to a higher heaven , through the bare skeleton shapes of life ; for the foliage of joy had wholly vanished -- shall we say in order that the children of the spring might come ?
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 25]: -- certainly in order first that the blue sky of a deeper peace might reflect itself in the hitherto darkened waters of her soul .
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 20]: Perhaps some of my readers may think that she had enough to repent of to keep her from weariness .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 32]: She had plenty to repent of , no doubt ; but repentance , between the paroxysms of its bitterness , is a very dreary and November-like state of the spiritual weather .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 46]: For its foggy mornings and cheerless noons can not believe in the sun of spring , soon to ripen into the sun of summer ; and its best time is the night , that shuts out the world and weeps its fill of slow tears .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 13]: But she was not altogether so blameworthy as she may have appeared .
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 8]: Her affectations had not been altogether false .
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 17]: She valued , and in a measure possessed , the feelings for which she sought credit .
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 20]: She had a genuine enjoyment of nature , though after a sensuous , Keats-like fashion , not a Wordsworthian .
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 23]: It was the body , rather than the soul , of nature that she loved -- its beauty rather than its truth .
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 34]: Had her love of nature been of the deepest , she would have turned aside to conceal her emotions rather than have held them up as allurements in the eyes of her companion .
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 37]: But as no body and no beauty can exist without soul and truth , she who loves the former must at least be capable of loving the deeper essence to which they owe their very existence .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 19]: This view of her character is borne out by her love of music and her liking for Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 4]: Both were genuine .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 29]: Had the latter been either more or less genuine than it was , the task of fascination would have been more difficult , and its success less complete .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 51]: Whether her own feelings became further involved than she had calculated upon , I can not tell ; but surely it says something for her , in any case , that she desired to retain Hugh as her friend , instead of hating him because he had been her lover .
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 10]: How glad she would have been of Harry now !
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 11]: The days crawled one after the other like weary snakes .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 57]: She tried to read the New Testament : It was to her like a mouldy chamber of worm-eaten parchments , whose windows had not been opened to the sun or the wind for centuries ; and in which the dust of the decaying leaves choked the few beams that found their way through the age-blinded panes .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 16]: This state of things could not have lasted long ; for Euphra would have died .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 81]: It lasted , however , until she felt that she had been leading a false , worthless life ; that she had been casting from her every day the few remaining fragments of truth and reality that yet kept her nature from falling in a heap of helpless ruin ; that she had never been a true friend to any one ; that she was of no value -- fit for no one 's admiration , no one 's love .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 45]: She must leave her former self , like a dead body , behind her , and rise into a purer air of life and reality , else she would perish with that everlasting death which is the disease and corruption of the soul itself .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 28]: To those who know anything of such experiences , it will not be surprising that such feelings as these should be alternated with fierce bursts of passion .
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 15]: The old self then started up with feverish energy , and writhed for life .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 26]: Never any one tried to be better , without , for a time , seeming to himself , perhaps to others , to be worse .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 62]: For the suffering of the spirit weakens the brain itself , and the whole physical nature groans under it ; while the energy spent in the effort to awake , and arise from the dust , leaves the regions previously guarded by prudence naked to the wild inroads of the sudden destroying impulses born of suffering , self-sickness , and hatred .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 47]: As in the delirious patient , they would dash to the earth whatever comes first within reach , as if the thing first perceived , and so -LRB- by perception alone -RRB- brought into contact with the suffering , were the cause of all the distress .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 8]: One day a letter arrived for her .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 11]: She had had no letter from any one for weeks .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 14]: Yet , when she saw the direction , she flung it from her .
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 20]: It was from Mrs. Elton , whom she disliked , because she found her utterly uninteresting and very stupid .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 13]: Poor Mrs. Elton laid no claim to the contraries of these epithets .
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 21]: But in proportion as she abjured thought , she claimed speech , both by word of mouth and by letter .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 6]: There was nothing in it .
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 33]: She considered reason as an awful enemy to the soul , and obnoxious to God , especially when applied to find out what he means when he addresses us as reasonable creatures .
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 3]: But speech ?
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 7]: There was no harm in that .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 49]: Perhaps it was some latent conviction that this power of speech was the chief distinction between herself and the lower animals , that made her use it so freely , and at the same time open her purse so liberally to the Hospital for Orphan Dogs and Cats .
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 34]: Had it not been for her own dire necessity , the fact that Mrs. Elton was religious would have been enough to convince Euphra that there could not possibly be anything in religion .
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 63]: The letter lay unopened till next day -- a fact easy to account for , improbable as it may seem ; for besides writing as largely as she talked , and less amusingly because more correctly , Mrs. Elton wrote such an indistinct though punctiliously neat hand , that the reading of a letter of hers involved no small amount of labour .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 33]: But the sun shining out next morning , Euphra took courage to read it , while drinking her coffee , although she could not expect to make that ceremony more pleasant thereby .
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 37]: It contained an invitation to visit Mrs. Elton at her house in -- Street , Hyde Park , with the assurance that , now that everything was arranged , they had plenty of room for her .
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 26]: Mrs. Elton was sure she must be lonely at Arnstead ; and Mrs. Horton could , no doubt , be trusted -- and so on .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 50]: Had this letter arrived a few weeks earlier , Euphra would have infused into her answer a skilful concoction of delicate contempt ; not for the amusement of knowing that Mrs. Elton would never discover a trace of it , but simply for a relief to her own dislike .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 54]: Now she would have written a plain letter , containing as brief and as true an excuse as she could find , had it not been , that , inclosed in Mrs. Elton 's note she found another , which ran thus : `` DEAR EUPHRA , -- Do come and see us .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 10]: I do not like London at all without you .
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 16]: There are no happy days here like those we had at Arnstead with Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 10]: Mrs. Elton and Margaret are very kind to me .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 7]: But I wish you would come .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 6]: Do , do , do .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 3]: Please do .
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 10]: `` Your affectionate cousin , `` HARRY ARNOLD . ''
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 6]: `` The dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 21]: said Euphra , with a gush of pure and grateful affection ; `` I will go and see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 20]: Harry had begun to work with his masters , and was doing his best , which was very good .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 42]: If his heart was not so much in it as when he was studying with his big brother , he gained a great benefit from the increase of exercise to his will , in the doing of what was less pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 44]: Ever since Hugh had given his faculties a right direction , and aided him by healthful manly sympathy , he had been making up for the period during which childhood had been protracted into boyhood ; and now he was making rapid progress .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 13]: When Euphra arrived , Harry rushed to the hall to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 12]: She took him in her arms , and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 6]: Her tears drew forth his .
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 19]: He stroked her pale face , and said : `` Dear Euphra , how ill you look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 11]: `` I shall soon be better now , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 21]: `` I was afraid you did not love me , Euphra ; but now I am sure you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 5]: `` Indeed I do .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 17]: I am very sorry for everything that made you think I did not love you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 6]: It was all my fancy .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 8]: Now we shall be very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 5]: And so Harry was .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 36]: And Euphra , through means of Harry , began to gain a little of what is better than most kinds of happiness , because it is nearest to the best happiness -- I mean peace .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 30]: This foretaste of rest came to her from the devotedness with which she now applied herself to aid the intellect , which she had unconsciously repressed and stunted before .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 51]: She took Harry 's books when he had gone to bed ; and read over all his lessons , that she might be able to assist him in preparing them ; venturing thus into some regions of labour into which ladies are too seldom conducted by those who instruct them .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 8]: This produced in her quite new experiences .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 19]: One of these was , that in proportion as she laboured for Harry , hope grew for herself .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 43]: It was likewise of the greatest immediate benefit that the intervals of thought , instead of lying vacant to melancholy , or the vapours that sprung from the foregoing strife of the spiritual elements , should be occupied by healthy mental exercise .
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 13]: Still , however , she was subject to great vicissitudes of feeling .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 40]: A kind of peevishness , to which she had formerly been a stranger , was but too ready to appear , even when she was most anxious , in her converse with Harry , to behave well to him .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 10]: But the pure forgiveness of the boy was wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 64]: Instead of plaguing himself to find out the cause of her behaviour , or resenting it in the least , he only laboured , by increased attention and submission , to remove it ; and seemed perfectly satisfied when it was followed by a kind word , which to him was repentance , apology , amends , and betterment , all in one .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 17]: When he had thus driven away the evil spirit , there was Euphra her own self .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 46]: So perfectly did she see , and so thoroughly appreciate this kindness and love of Harry , that he began to look to her like an angel of forgiveness come to live a boy 's life , that he might do an angel 's work .
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 6]: Her health continued very poor .
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 15]: She suffered constantly from more or less headache , and at times from faintings .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 13]: But she had not for some time discovered any signs of somnambulism .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 9]: Of this peculiarity her friends were entirely ignorant .
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 21]: The occasions , indeed , on which it had manifested itself to an excessive degree , had been but few .
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 4]: THE NEW PUPILS .
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 10]: Think you a little din can daunt mine ears ?
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 10]: Have I not in my time heard lions roar ?
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 32]: And do you tell me of a woman 's tongue , That gives not half so great a blow to hear , As will a chestnut in a farmer 's fire ?
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 2]: Tush !
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 2]: tush !
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 5]: fear boys with bugs .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 5]: Taming of the Shrew .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 53]: During the whole of his first interview with Falconer , which lasted so long that he had been glad to make a bed of Falconer 's sofa , Hugh never once referred to the object for which he had accepted MacPherson 's proffered introduction ; nor did Falconer ask him any questions .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 46]: Hugh was too much interested and saddened by the scenes through which Falconer led him , not to shrink from speaking of anything less important ; and with Falconer it was a rule , a principle almost , never to expedite utterance of any sort .
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 35]: In the morning , feeling a little good-natured anxiety as to his landlady 's reception of him , Hugh made some allusion to it , as he sat at his new friend 's breakfast-table .
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 12]: Falconer said : `` What is your landlady 's name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 5]: `` Miss Talbot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 4]: little Miss Talbot ?
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 16]: You are in good quarters -- too good to lose , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 12]: Just say to Miss Talbot that you were with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 8]: `` You know her , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 8]: `` You seem to know everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 16]: `` If I have spoken to a person once , I never forget him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 9]: `` That seems to me very strange . ''
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 6]: `` It is simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 27]: The secret of it is , that , as far as I can help it , I never have any merely business relations with any one .
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 15]: I try always not to forget that there is a deeper relation between us .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 33]: I commonly succeed worst in a drawing-room ; yet even there , for the time we are together , I try to recognise the present humanity , however much distorted or concealed .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 38]: The consequence is , I never forget anybody ; and I generally find that others remember me -- at least those with whom I have had any real relations , springing from my need or from theirs .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 60]: The man who mends a broken chair for you , or a rent in your coat , renders you a human service ; and , in virtue of that , comes nearer to your inner self , than nine-tenths of the ladies and gentlemen whom you meet only in what is called society , are likely to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 11]: `` But do you not find it awkward sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 30]: I am never ashamed of knowing any one ; and as I never assume a familiarity that does not exist , I never find it assumed towards me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 23]: Hugh found the advantage of Falconer 's sociology when he mentioned to Miss Talbot that he had been his guest that night .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 19]: `` You should have sent us word , Mr. Sutherland , '' was all Miss Talbot 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 15]: `` I could not do so before you must have been all in bed .
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 12]: I was sorry , but I could hardly help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 8]: Miss Talbot turned away into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 47]: The only other indication of her feeling in the matter was , that she sent him up a cup of delicious chocolate for his lunch , before he set out for Mr. Appleditch 's , where she had heard at the shop that he was going .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 61]: My reader must not be left to fear that I am about to give a detailed account of Hugh 's plans with these unpleasant little immortals , whose earthly nature sprang from a pair whose religion consisted chiefly in negations , and whose main duty seemed to be to make money in small sums , and spend it in smaller .
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 37]: When he arrived at Buccleuch Crescent , he was shown into the dining-room , into which the boys were separately dragged , to receive the first instalment of the mental legacy left them by their ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 37]: But the legacy-duty was so heavy that they would gladly have declined paying it , even with the loss of the legacy itself ; and Hugh was dismayed at the impossibility of interesting them in anything .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 10]: He tried telling them stories even , without success .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 35]: They stared at him , it is true ; but whether there was more speculation in the open mouths , or in the fishy , overfed eyes , he found it impossible to determine .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 47]: He could not help feeling the riddle of Providence in regard to the birth of these , much harder to read than that involved in the case of some of the little thieves whose acquaintance he had made , when with Falconer , the evening before .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 43]: But he did his best ; and before the time had expired -- two hours , namely , -- he had found out , to his satisfaction , that the elder had a turn for sums , and the younger for drawing .
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 23]: So he made use of these predilections to bribe them to the exercise of their intellect upon less-favoured branches of human accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 19]: He found the plan operate as well as it could have been expected to operate upon such material .
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 20]: But one or two little incidents , relating to his intercourse with Mrs. Appleditch , I must not omit .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 37]: Though a mother 's love is more ready to purify itself than most other loves -- yet there is a class of mothers , whose love is only an extended , scarcely an expanded , selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 39]: Mrs. Appleditch did not in the least love her children because they were children , and children committed to her care by the Father of all children ; but she loved them dearly because they were her children .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 18]: One day Hugh gave Master Appleditch a smart slap across the fingers , as the ultimate resource .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 9]: The child screamed as he well knew how .
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 7]: His mother burst into the room .
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 8]: `` Johnny , hold your tongue ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 9]: `` Teacher 's been and hurt me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 8]: `` Hold your tongue , I say .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 7]: My head 's like to split .
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 11]: Get out of the room , you little ruffian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 24]: She seized him by the shoulders , and turned him out , administering a box on his ear that made the room ring .
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 17]: Then turning to Hugh , `` Mr. Sutherland , how dare you strike my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 8]: `` He required it , Mrs. Appleditch .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 6]: I did him no harm .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 10]: He will mind what I say another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 8]: `` I will not have him touched .
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 4]: It 's disgraceful .
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 6]: To strike a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 31]: She belonged to that class of humane parents who consider it cruel to inflict any corporal suffering upon children , except they do it themselves , and in a passion .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 83]: Johnnie behaved better after this , however ; and the only revenge Mrs. Appleditch took for this interference with the dignity of her eldest born , and , consequently , with her own as his mother , was , that -- with the view , probably , of impressing upon Hugh a due sense of the menial position he occupied in her family -- she always paid him his fee of one shilling and sixpence every day before he left the house .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 14]: Once or twice she contrived accidentally that the sixpence should be in coppers .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 18]: Hugh was too much of a philosopher , however , to mind this from such a woman .
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 40]: I am afraid he rather enjoyed her spite ; for he felt it did not touch him , seeing it could not be less honourable to be paid by the day than by the quarter or by the year .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 21]: Certainly the coppers were an annoyance ; but if the coppers could be carried , the annoyance could be borne .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 32]: The real disgust in the affair was , that he had to meet and speak with a woman every day , for whom he could feel nothing but contempt and aversion .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 33]: Hugh was not yet able to mingle with these feelings any of the leaven of that charity which they need most of all who are contemptible in the eye of their fellows .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 17]: Contempt is murder committed by the intellect , as hatred is murder committed by the heart .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 19]: Charity having life in itself , is the opposite and destroyer of contempt as well as of hatred .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 10]: After this , nothing went amiss for some time .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 21]: But it was very dreary work to teach such boys -- for the younger came in for the odd sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 17]: Slow , stupid , resistance appeared to be the only principle of their behaviour towards him .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 22]: They scorned the man whom their mother despised and valued for the self-same reason , namely , that he was cheap .
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 24]: They would have defied him had they dared , but he managed to establish an authority over them -- and to increase it .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 15]: Still , he could not rouse them to any real interest in their studies .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 18]: Indeed , they were as near being little beasts as it was possible for children to be .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 21]: Their eyes grew dull at a story-book , but greedily bright at the sight of bull 's eyes or toffee .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 15]: It was the same day after day , till he was sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 15]: No doubt they made some progress , but it was scarcely perceptible to him .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 22]: Through fog and fair , through frost and snow , through wind and rain , he trudged to that wretched house .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 37]: No one minds the weather -- no young Scotchman , at least -- where any pleasure waits the close of the struggle : to fight his way to misery was more than he could well endure .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 9]: But his deliverance was nearer than he expected .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 10]: It was not to come just yet , however .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 51]: All went on with frightful sameness , till sundry doubtful symptoms of an alteration in the personal appearance of Hugh having accumulated at last into a mass of evidence , forced the conviction upon the mind of the grocer 's wife , that her tutor was actually growing a beard .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 6]: Could she believe her eyes ?
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 6]: She said she could not .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 64]: But she acted on their testimony notwithstanding ; and one day suddenly addressing Hugh , said , in her usual cold , thin , cutting fashion of speech : `` Mr. Sutherland , I am astonished and grieved that you , a teacher of babes , who should set an example to them , should disguise yourself in such an outlandish figure . ''
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 10]: `` What do you mean , Mrs. Appleditch ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 37]: asked Hugh , who , though he had made up his mind to follow the example of Falconer , yet felt uncomfortable enough , during the transition period , to know quite well what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 8]: `` What do I mean , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 17]: It is a shame for a man to let his beard grow like a monkey . ''
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 15]: `` But a monkey has n't a beard , '' retorted Hugh , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 11]: `` Man is the only animal who has one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 24]: This assertion , if not quite correct , was approximately so , and went much nearer the truth than Mrs. Appleditch 's argument .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 24]: `` It 's no joking matter , Mr. Sutherland , with my two darlings growing up to be ministers of the gospel . ''
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 5]: both of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 3]: thought Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 21]: But he said : `` Well , but you know , Mrs. Appleditch , the Apostles themselves wore beards . ''
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 8]: `` Yes , when they were Jews .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 16]: But who would have believed them if they had preached the gospel like old clothesmen ?
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 13]: No , no , Mr. Sutherland , I see through all that .
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 10]: My own uncle was a preacher of the word .
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 12]: -- As soon as the Apostles became Christians , they shaved .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 7]: It was the sign of Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 13]: The Apostle Paul himself says that cleanliness is next to godliness . ''
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 10]: Hugh restrained his laughter , and shifted his ground .
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 13]: `` But there is nothing dirty about them , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 4]: `` Not dirty ?
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 10]: Now really , Mr. Sutherland , you provoke me .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 20]: Nothing dirty in long hair all round your mouth , and going into it every spoonful you take ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 13]: `` But it can be kept properly trimmed , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 11]: `` But who 's to trust you to do that ?
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 17]: No , no , Mr. Sutherland ; you must not make a guy of yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 7]: Hugh laughed , and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 16]: Of course his beard would go on growing , for he could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 7]: So did Mrs. Appleditch 's wrath .
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 4]: CHAPTER X. CONSULTATIONS .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 8]: Wo keine Götter sind , walten Gespenster .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 2]: NOVALIS .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 3]: -- Christenheit .
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 8]: Where gods are not , spectres rule .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 8]: Ein Charakter ist ein vollkommen gebildeter Wille .
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 2]: NOVALIS .
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 4]: -- Moralische Ansichten .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 8]: A character is a perfectly formed will .
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 12]: It was not long before Hugh repeated his visit to Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 6]: He was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 13]: He went again and again , but still failed in finding him .
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 31]: The day after the third failure , however , he received a note from Falconer , mentioning an hour at which he would be at home on the following evening .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 3]: Hugh went .
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 6]: Falconer was waiting for him .
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 6]: `` I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 10]: I am out so much , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 17]: `` I ought to have taken the opportunity when I had it , '' replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 8]: `` I want to ask your help .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 14]: May I begin at the beginning , and tell you all the story ?
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 9]: or must I epitomize and curtail it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 8]: `` Be as diffuse as you please .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 9]: I shall understand the thing the better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 25]: So Hugh began , and told the whole of his history , in as far as it bore upon the story of the crystal .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 36]: He ended with the words : `` I trust , Mr. Falconer , you will not think that it is from a love of talking that I have said so much about this affair . ''
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 6]: It is a remarkable story .
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 8]: I will think what can be done .
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 10]: Meantime I will keep my eyes and ears open .
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 6]: I may find the fellow .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 8]: Tell me what he is like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 13]: Hugh gave as minute a description of the count as he could .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 12]: `` I think I see the man , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 11]: `` I am pretty sure I shall recognise him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 14]: `` Have you any idea what he could want with the ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 49]: `` It is one of the curious coincidences which are always happening , '' answered Falconer , `` that a newspaper of this very day would have enabled me , without any previous knowledge of similar facts , to give a probably correct suggestion as to his object .
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 8]: But you can judge for yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 29]: So saying , Falconer went to a side-table , heaped up with books and papers , maps , and instruments of various kinds , apparently in triumphant confusion .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 60]: Without a moment 's hesitation , notwithstanding , he selected the paper he wanted , and handed it to Hugh , who read in it a letter to the editor , of which the following is a portion : -- `` I have for over thirty years been in the habit of investigating the question by means of crystals .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 59]: And since 18 -- , I have possessed the celebrated crystal , once belonging to Lady Blessington , in which very many persons , both children and adults , have seen visions of the spirits of the deceased , or of beings claiming to be such , and of numerous angels and other beings of the spiritual world .
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 13]: These have in all cases supported the purest and most liberal Christianity .
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 53]: The faculty of seeing in the crystal I have found to exist in about one person in ten among adults , and in nearly nine in every ten among children ; many of whom appear to lose the faculty as they grow to adult age , unless they practise it continually . ''
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 22]: `` Is it possible , '' said Hugh , pausing , `` that this can be a veritable paper of to-day ?
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 9]: Are there people to believe such things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 21]: `` There are more fools in the world , Mr. Sutherland , than there are crystals in its mountains . ''
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 5]: Hugh resumed his reading .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 95]: He came at length to this passage : `` The spirits -- which I feel certain they are -- which appear , do not hesitate to inform us on all possible subjects which may tend to improve our morals , and confirm our faith in the Christian doctrines ... The character they give of the class of spirits who are in the habit of communicating with mortals by rapping and such proceedings , is such that it behoves all Christian people to be on their guard against error and delusion through their means . ''
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 7]: Hugh had read this passage aloud .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 13]: `` Is not that a comfort , now , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 3]: said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 30]: `` For in all the reports which I have seen of the religious instruction communicated in that highly articulate manner , Calvinism , high and low , has predominated .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 11]: I strongly suspect the crystal phantoms of Arminianism , though .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 17]: Fancy the old disputes of infant Christendom perpetuated amongst the paltry ghosts of another realm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 65]: `` But , '' said Hugh , `` I do not quite see how this is to help me , as to the count 's object in securing the ring ; for certainly , however deficient he may be in such knowledge , he is not likely to have committed the theft for the sake of instruction in the doctrines of the sects . ''
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 17]: But such a crystal might be put to other , not to say better , uses .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 26]: Besides , Lady Blessington 's crystal might be a pious crystal ; and the other which belonged to Lady -- '' `` Lady Euphrasia . ''
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 12]: `` To Lady Euphrasia , might be a worldly crystal altogether .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 20]: This might reveal demons and their counsels , while that was haunted by theological angels and evangelical ghosts . ''
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 3]: I see .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 26]: I should have thought , however , that the count had been too much of a man of the world to believe such things . ''
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 11]: `` He might find his account in it , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 15]: But no amount of world-wisdom can set a man above the inroads of superstition .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 21]: In fact , there is but one thing that can free a man from superstition , and that is belief .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 5]: All history proves it .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 10]: The most sceptical have ever been the most credulous .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 16]: This is one of the best arguments for the existence of something to believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 23]: `` You remind me of a passage in my story which I omitted , as irrelevant to the matter in hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 7]: `` Do let me have it .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 9]: It can not fail to interest me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 16]: Hugh gave a complete account of the experiments they had made with the careering plate .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 39]: Now the writing of the name of David Elginbrod was the most remarkable phenomenon of the whole , and Hugh was compelled , in responding to the natural interest of Falconer , to give a description of David .
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 33]: This led to a sketch of his own sojourn at Turriepuffit ; in which the character of David came out far more plainly than it could have come out in any description .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 33]: When he had finished , Falconer broke out , as if he had been hitherto restraining his wrath with difficulty : `` And that was the man the creatures dared to personate !
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 8]: I hate the whole thing , Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 8]: It is full of impudence and irreverence .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 32]: Perhaps the wretched beings may want another thousand years ' damnation , because of the injury done to their character by the homage of men who ought to know better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 9]: `` I do not quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 44]: `` I mean , that you ought to believe as easily that such a man as you describe is laughing with the devil and his angels , as that he wrote a copy at the order of a charlatan , or worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 9]: `` But it could hardly be deception . ''
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 4]: `` Not deception ?
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 14]: A man like him could not get through them without being recognised . ''
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand you .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 4]: By whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 35]: `` By swarms of low miserable creatures that so lament the loss of their beggarly bodies that they would brood upon them in the shape of flesh-flies , rather than forsake the putrifying remnants .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 23]: After that , chair or table or anything that they can come into contact with , possesses quite sufficient organization for such .
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 23]: Do n't you remember that once , rather than have no body to go into , they crept into the very swine ?
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 10]: There was a fine passion for self-embodiment and sympathy !
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 14]: But the swine themselves could not stand it , and preferred drowning . ''
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 13]: `` Then you do think there was something supernatural in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 6]: `` Nothing in the least .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 23]: It required no supernatural powers to be aware that a great man was dead , and that you had known him well .
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 34]: It annoys me , Sutherland , that able men , ay , and good men too , should consult with ghosts whose only possible superiority consists in their being out of the body .
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 9]: Why should they be the wiser for that ?
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 38]: I should as soon expect to gain wisdom by taking off my clothes , and to lose it by getting into bed ; or to rise into the seventh heaven of spirituality by having my hair cut .
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 10]: An impudent forgery of that good man 's name !
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 19]: If I were you , Sutherland , I would have nothing to do with such a low set .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 9]: They are the canaille of the other world .
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 18]: It 's of no use to lay hold on their skirts , for they ca n't fly .
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 18]: They 're just like the vultures -- easy to catch , because they 're full of garbage .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 15]: I doubt if they have more intellect left than just enough to lie with .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 17]: -- I have been compelled to think a good deal about these things of late . ''
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 60]: Falconer put a good many questions to Hugh , about Euphra and her relation to the count ; and such was the confidence with which he had inspired him , that Hugh felt at perfect liberty to answer them all fully , not avoiding even the exposure of his own feelings , where that was involved by the story .
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 19]: `` Now , '' said Falconer , `` I have material out of which to construct a theory .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 54]: The count is at present like a law of nature concerning which a prudent question is the first half of the answer , as Lord Bacon says ; and you can put no question without having first formed a theory , however slight or temporary ; for otherwise no question will suggest itself .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 31]: But , in the meantime , as I said before , I will make inquiry upon the theory that he is somewhere in London , although I doubt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 17]: `` Then I will not occupy your time any longer at present , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 23]: `` Could you say , without fettering yourself in the least , when I might be able to see you again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 5]: `` Let me see .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 8]: I will make an appointment with you .
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 13]: -- Next Sunday ; here ; at ten o'clock in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 7]: Make a note of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 10]: `` There is no fear of my forgetting it .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 16]: My consolations are not so numerous that I can afford to forget my sole pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 31]: You , I should think , have more need to make a note of it than I , though I am quite willing to be forgotten , if necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 11]: `` I never forget my engagements , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 11]: They parted , and Hugh went home to his novel .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 4]: QUESTIONS AND DREAMS .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 23]: On a certain time the Lady St. Mary had commanded the Lord Jesus to fetch her some water out of the well .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 22]: And when he had gone to fetch the water , the pitcher , when it was brought up full , brake .
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 22]: But Jesus , spreading his mantle , gathered up the water again , and brought it in that to his mother .
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 14]: -- The First -LRB- apocryphal -RRB- Gospel of the INFANCY of JESUS CHRIST .
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 28]: Mrs. Elton read prayers morning and evening ; -- very elaborate compositions , which would have instructed the apostles themselves in many things they had never anticipated .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 34]: But , unfortunately , Mrs. Elton must likewise read certain remarks , in the form of a homily , intended to impress the scripture which preceded it upon the minds of the listeners .
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 35]: Between the mortar of the homilist 's faith , and the dull blows of the pestle of his arrogance , the fair form of truth was ground into the powder of pious small talk .
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 12]: This result was not pleasant either to Harry or to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 61]: Euphra , with her life threatening to go to ruin about her , was crying out for him who made the soul of man , `` who loved us into being , `` 2 and who alone can renew the life of his children ; and in such words as those a scoffing demon seemed to mock at her needs .
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 18]: Harry had the natural dislike of all childlike natures to everything formal , exclusive , and unjust .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 46]: But , having received nothing of what is commonly called a religious training , this advantage resulted from his new experiences in Mrs. Elton 's family , that a good direction was given to his thoughts by the dislike which he felt to such utterances .
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 110]: More than this : a horror fell upon him lest these things should be true ; lest the mighty All of nature should be only a mechanism , without expression and without beauty ; lest the God who made us should be like us only in this , that he too was selfish and mean and proud ; lest his ideas should resemble those that inhabit the brain of a retired money-maker , or of an arbitrary monarch claiming a divine right -- instead of towering as the heavens over the earth , above the loftiest moods of highest poet , most generous child , or most devoted mother .
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 37]: I do not mean that these thoughts took these shapes in Harry 's mind ; but that his feelings were such as might have been condensed into such thoughts , had his intellect been more mature .
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 54]: One morning , the passage of scripture which Mrs. Elton read was the story of the young man who came to Jesus , and went away sorrowful , because the Lord thought so well of him , and loved him so heartily , that he wanted to set him free from his riches .
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 65]: A great portion of the homily was occupied with proving that the evangelist could not possibly mean that Jesus loved the young man in any pregnant sense of the word ; but merely meant that Jesus `` felt kindly disposed towards him '' -- felt a poor little human interest in him , in fact , and did not love him divinely at all .
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 14]: Harry 's face was in a flame all the time she was reading .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 23]: When the service was over -- and a bond service it was for Euphra and him -- they left the room together .
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 18]: As soon as the door was shut , he burst out : `` I say , Euphra !
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 6]: Was n't that a shame ?
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 9]: They would have Jesus as bad as themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 19]: We shall have somebody writing a book next to prove that after all Jesus was a Pharisee . ''
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 24]: `` Never mind , '' said the heart-sore , sceptical Euphra ; `` never mind , Harry ; it 's all nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 9]: `` No , it 's not all nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 7]: Jesus did love the young man .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 15]: I believe the story itself before all the Doctors of Divinity in the world .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 17]: He loves all of us , he does -- with all his heart , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 24]: `` I hope so , '' was all she could reply ; but she was comforted by Harry 's vehement confession of faith .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 25]: Euphra was so far softened , or perhaps weakened , by suffering , that she yielded many things which would have seemed impossible before .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 25]: One of these was that she went to church with Mrs. Elton , where that lady hoped she would get good to her soul .
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 8]: Harry of course was not left behind .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 50]: The church she frequented was a fashionable one , with a vicar more fashionable still ; for had he left that church , more than half his congregation , which consisted mostly of ladies , would have left it also , and followed him to the ends of London .
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 60]: He was a middle-aged man , with a rubicund countenance , and a gentle familiarity of manner , that was exceedingly pleasing to the fashionable sheep who , conscious that they had wandered from the fold , were waiting with exemplary patience for the barouches and mail-phaetons of the skies to carry them back without the trouble of walking .
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 4]: Alas for them !
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 14]: they have to learn that the chariots of heaven are chariots of fire .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 29]: The Sunday morning following the conversation I have just recorded , the clergyman 's sermon was devoted to the illustration of the greatness and condescension of the Saviour .
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 103]: After a certain amount of tame excitement expended upon the consideration of his power and kingdom , one passage was wound up in this fashion : `` Yes , my friends , even her most gracious Majesty , Queen Victoria , the ruler over millions diverse in speech and in hue , to whom we all look up with humble submission , and whom we acknowledge as our sovereign lady -- even she , great as she is , adds by her homage a jewel to his crown ; and , hailing him as her Lord , bows and renders him worship !
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 35]: Yet this is he who comes down to visit , yea , dwells with his own elect , his chosen ones , whom he has led back to the fold of his grace . ''
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 29]: For some reason , known to himself , Falconer had taken Hugh , who had gone to him according to appointment that morning , to this same church .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 25]: As they came out , Hugh said : `` Mr. -- is quite proud of the honour done his master by the queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 37]: `` I do not think , '' answered Falconer , `` that his master will think so much of it ; for he once had his feet washed by a woman that was a sinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 93]: The homily which Mrs. Elton read at prayers that evening , bore upon the same subject nominally as the chapter that preceded it -- that of election ; a doctrine which in the Bible asserts the fact of God 's choosing certain persons for the specific purpose of receiving first , and so communicating the gifts of his grace to the whole world ; but which , in the homily referred to , was taken to mean the choice of certain persons for ultimate salvation , to the exclusion of the rest .
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 47]: They were sitting in silence after the close , when Harry started up suddenly , saying : `` I do n't want God to love me , if he does not love everybody ; '' and , bursting into tears , hurried out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 9]: Mrs. Elton was awfully shocked at his wickedness .
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 18]: Euphra , hastened after him ; but he would not return , and went supperless to bed .
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 9]: Euphra , however , carried him some supper .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 15]: He sat up in bed and ate it with the tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 38]: She kissed him , and bade him good night ; when , just as she was leaving the room , he broke out with : `` But only think , Euphra , if it should be true !
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 9]: I would rather not have been made . ''
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 45]: `` It is not true , '' said Euphra , in whom a faint glimmer of faith in God awoke for the sake of the boy whom she loved -- awoke to comfort him , when it would not open its eyes for herself .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 21]: `` No , Harry dear , if there is a God at all , he is not like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 50]: `` No , he ca n't be , '' said Harry , vehemently , and with the brightness of a sudden thought ; `` for if he were like that , he would n't be a God worth being ; and that could n't be , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 16]: Euphra knelt by her bedside , and prayed more hopefully than for many days before .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 19]: She prayed that God would let her know that he was not an idol of man 's invention .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 25]: Till friendly sleep came , and untied the knot of care , both Euphra and Harry lay troubled with things too great for them .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 17]: Even in their sleep , the care would gather again , and body itself into dreams .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 244]: The first thought that visited Harry when he awoke , was the memory of his dream : that he died and went to heaven ; that heaven was a great church just like the one Mrs. Elton went to , only larger ; that the pews were filled with angels , so crowded together that they had to tuck up their wings very close indeed -- and Harry could not help wondering what they wanted them for ; that they were all singing psalms ; that the pulpit by a little change had been converted into a throne , on which sat God the Father , looking very solemn and severe ; that Jesus was seated in the reading-desk , looking very sad ; and that the Holy Ghost sat on the clerk 's desk , in the shape of a white dove ; that a cherub , whose face reminded him very much of a policeman he knew , took him by the shoulder for trying to pluck a splendid green feather out of an archangel 's wing , and led him up to the throne , where God shook his head at him in such a dreadful way , that he was terrified , and then stretched out his hand to lay hold on him ; that he shrieked with fear ; and that Jesus put out his hand and lifted him into the reading-desk , and hid him down below .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 47]: And there Harry lay , feeling so safe , stroking and kissing the feet that had been weary and wounded for him , till , in the growing delight of the thought that he actually held those feet , he came awake and remembered it all .
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 14]: Truly it was a childish dream , but not without its own significance .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 108]: For surely the only refuge from heathenish representations of God under Christian forms , the only refuge from man 's blinding and paralysing theories , from the dead wooden shapes substituted for the living forms of human love and hope and aspiration , from the interpretations which render scripture as dry as a speech in Chancery -- surely the one refuge from all these awful evils is the Son of man ; for no misrepresentation and no misconception can destroy the beauty of that face which the marring of sorrow has elevated into the region of reality , beyond the marring of irreverent speculation and scholastic definition .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 38]: From the God of man 's painting , we turn to the man of God 's being , and he leads us to the true God , the radiation of whose glory we first see in him .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 20]: Happy is that man who has a glimpse of this , even in a dream such as Harry 's !
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 21]: -- a dream in other respects childish and incongruous , but not more absurd than the instruction whence it sprung .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 8]: But the troubles returned with the day .
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 4]: Prayers revived them .
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 7]: He sought Euphra in her room .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 17]: `` They say I must repent and be sorry for my sins , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 43]: `` I have been trying very hard ; but I ca n't think of any , except once that I gave Gog '' -LRB- his Welsh pony -RRB- `` such a beating because he would go where I did n't want him .
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 30]: But he 's forgotten it long ago ; and I gave him two feeds of corn after it , and so somehow I ca n't feel very sorry now .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 10]: -- But that 's not what I mind most .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 23]: It always seems to me it would be so much grander of God to say : ` Come along , never mind .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 6]: I 'll make you good .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 17]: I ca n't wait till you are good ; I love you so much . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 23]: His own words were too much for Harry , and he burst into tears at the thought of God being so kind .
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 12]: Euphra , instead of trying to comfort him , cried too .
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 25]: Thus they continued for some time , Harry with his head on her knees , and she kindly fondling it with her distressed hands .
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 20]: Harry was the first to recover ; for his was the April time , when rain clears the heavens .
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 18]: All at once he sprung to his feet , and exclaimed : `` Only think , Euphra !
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 20]: What if , after all , I should find out that God is as kind as you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 7]: How Euphra 's heart smote her !
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 20]: `` Dear Harry , '' answered she , `` God must be a great deal kinder than I am .
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 11]: I have not been kind to you at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 8]: `` Do n't say that , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 14]: I shall be quite content if God is as kind as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 5]: `` Oh , Harry !
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 15]: I hope God is like what I dreamed about my mother last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 13]: `` Tell me what you dreamed about her , dear Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 23]: `` I dreamed that I was a little child -- '' `` Were you a little girl when your mother died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes ; such a tiny !
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 8]: But I can just remember her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 9]: `` Tell me your dream , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 25]: `` I dreamed that I was a little girl , out all alone on a wild mountain-moor , tripping and stumbling on my night-gown .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 7]: And the wind was so cold !
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 34]: And , somehow or other , the wind was an enemy to me , and it followed and caught me , and whirled and tossed me about , and then ran away again .
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 19]: Then I hastened on , and the thorns went into my feet , and the stones cut them .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 16]: And I heard the blood from them trickling down the hill-side as I walked . ''
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 17]: `` Then they would be like the feet I saw in my dream last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 7]: `` Whose feet were they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 6]: `` Jesus ' feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 7]: `` Tell me about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 12]: `` You must finish yours first , please , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 11]: So Euphra went on : `` I got dreadfully lame .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 36]: And the wind ran after me , and caught me again , and took me in his great blue ghostly arms , and shook me about , and then dropped me again to go on .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 32]: But it was very hard to go on , and I could n't stop ; and there was no use in stopping , for the wind was everywhere in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 54]: Then suddenly I saw before me a great cataract , all in white , falling flash from a precipice ; and I thought with myself , ' I will go into the cataract , and it will beat my life out , and then the wind will not get me any more . '
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 19]: So I hastened towards it , but the wind caught me many times before I got near it .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 21]: At last I reached it , and threw myself down into the basin it had hollowed out of the rocks .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 23]: But as I was falling , something caught me gently , and held me fast , and it was not the wind .
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 8]: I opened my eyes , and behold !
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 55]: I was in my mother 's arms , and she was clasping me to her breast ; for what I had taken for a cataract falling into a gulf , was only my mother , with her white grave-clothes floating all about her , standing up in her grave , to look after me .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 27]: ` It was time you came home , my darling , ' she said , and stooped down into her grave with me in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 3]: And oh !
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 26]: I was so happy ; and her bosom was not cold , or her arms hard , and she carried me just like a baby .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 66]: And when she stooped down , then a door opened somewhere in the grave , I could not find out where exactly -- and in a moment after , we were sitting together in a summer grove , with the tree-tops steeped in sunshine , and waving about in a quiet loving wind -- oh , how different from the one that chased me home !
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 11]: -- and we underneath in the shadow of the trees .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 16]: And then I said , ` Mother , I 've hurt my feet . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 14]: `` Did you call her mother when you were a little girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 3]: interposed Harry .
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 7]: `` No , '' answered Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 21]: `` I called her mamma , like other children ; but in my dreams I always call her mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 8]: `` And what did she say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 9]: `` She said -- ` Poor child ! '
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 34]: -- and held my feet to her bosom ; and after that , when I looked at them , the bleeding was all gone , and I was not lame any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 7]: Euphra , paused with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 5]: `` Oh , Harry !
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 9]: I do not like to be lame . ''
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 5]: `` What more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 9]: said Harry , intent only on the dream .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 13]: then I was so happy , that I woke up directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 5]: `` What a pity !
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 8]: But if it should come true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 11]: `` How could it come true , dear Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 24]: `` Why , this world is sometimes cold , and the road is hard -- you know what I mean , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 7]: `` Yes , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 10]: `` I wish I could dream dreams like that !
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 7]: How clever you must be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 10]: `` But you dream dreams , too , Harry .
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 5]: Tell me yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 23]: `` Oh , no , I never dream dreams ; the dreams dream me , '' answered Harry , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 21]: Then he told his dream , to which Euphra listened with an interest uninjured by the grotesqueness of its fancy .
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 8]: Each interpreted the other 's with reverence .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 11]: They ceased talking ; and sat silent for a while .
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 45]: Then Harry , putting his arms round Euphra 's neck , and his lips close to her ear , whispered : `` Perhaps God will say my darling to you some day , Euphra ; just as your mother did in your dream . ''
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 4]: She was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 16]: Harry looked round into her face , and saw that the tears were flowing fast .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 12]: At that instant , a gentle knock came to the door .
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 7]: Euphra could not reply to it .
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 4]: It was repeated .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 15]: After another moment 's delay , the door opened , and Margaret walked in .
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 5]: A SUNDAY WITH FALCONER .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 29]: How happy is he born and taught , That serveth not another 's will ; Whose armour is his honest thought , And simple truth his utmost skill .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 34]: This man is freed from servile bands Of hope to rise or fear to fall : Lord of himself , though not of lands , And , having nothing , yet hath all .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 4]: SIR HENRY WOTTON .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 25]: It was not often that Falconer went to church ; but he seemed to have some design in going oftener than usual at present .
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 29]: The Sunday after the one last mentioned , he went as well , though not to the same church , and calling for Hugh took him with him .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 37]: What they found there , and the conversation following thereupon , I will try to relate , because , although they do not immediately affect my outward story , they greatly influenced Hugh 's real history .
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 21]: They heard the Morning Service and the Litany read in an ordinary manner , though somewhat more devoutly than usual .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 23]: Then , from the communion-table , rose a voice vibrating with solemn emotion , like the voice of Abraham pleading for Sodom .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 7]: It thrilled through Hugh 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 36]: The sermon which followed affected him no less , although , when he came out , he confessed to Falconer that he had only caught flying glimpses of its meaning , scope , and drift .
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 46]: `` I seldom go to church , '' said Falconer ; `` but when I do , I come here : and always feel that I am in the presence of one of the holy servants of God 's great temple not made with hands .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 6]: I heartily trust that man .
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 9]: He is what he seems to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 9]: `` They say he is awfully heterodox . ''
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 5]: `` They do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 20]: `` How then can he remain in the church , if he is as honest as you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 16]: `` In this way , as I humbly venture to think , '' Falconer answered .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 29]: `` He looks upon the formulæ of the church as utterances of living truth -- vital embodiments -- to be regarded as one ought to regard human faces .
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 66]: In these human faces , others may see this or that inferior expression , may find out the mean and the small and the incomplete : he looks for and finds the ideal ; the grand , sacred , God-meant meaning ; and by that he holds as the meaning of the human countenances , for it is the meaning of him who made them .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 56]: So with the confession of the Church of England : he believes that not man only , but God also , and God first and chief , had to do with the making of it ; and therefore he looks in it for the Eternal and the Divine , and he finds what he seeks .
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 56]: And as no words can avoid bearing in them the possibility of a variety of interpretations , he would exclude whatever the words might mean , or , regarded merely as words , do mean , in a narrow exposition : he thinks it would be dishonest to take the low meaning as the meaning .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 29]: To return to the faces : he passes by moods and tempers , and beholds the main character -- that on whose surface the temporal and transient floats .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 61]: Both in faces and in formulæ he loves the divine substance , with his true , manly , brave heart ; and as for the faults in both -- for man , too , has his share in both -- I believe he is ready to die by them , if only in so doing he might die for them .
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 41]: -- I had a vision of him this morning as I sat and listened to his voice , which always seems to me to come immediately from his heart , as if his heart spoke with lips of its own .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 7]: Shall I tell you my vision ?
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 25]: -- `` I saw a crowd -- priests and laymen -- speeding , hurrying , darting away , up a steep , crumbling height .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 13]: Mitres , hoods , and hats rolled behind them to the bottom .
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 42]: Every one for himself , with hands and feet they scramble and flee , to save their souls from the fires of hell which come rolling in along the hollow below with the forward ` pointing spires ' of billowy flame .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 35]: But beneath , right in the course of the fire , stands one man upon a little rock which goes down to the centre of the great world , and faces the approaching flames .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 26]: He stands bareheaded , his eyes bright with faith in God , and the mighty mouth that utters his truth , fixed in holy defiance .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 16]: His denial comes from no fear , or weak dislike to that which is painful .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 10]: On neither side will he tell lies for peace .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 10]: He is ready to be lost for his fellow-men .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 12]: In the name of God he rebukes the flames of hell .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 77]: The fugitives pause on the top , look back , call him lying prophet , and shout evil opprobrious names at the man who counts not his own life dear to him , who has forgotten his own soul in his sacred devotion to men , who fills up what is left behind of the sufferings of Christ , for his body 's sake -- for the human race , of which he is the head .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 63]: Be sure that , come what may of the rest , let the flames of hell ebb or flow , that man is safe , for he is delivered already from the only devil that can make hell itself a torture , the devil of selfishness -- the only one that can possess a man and make himself his own living hell .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 22]: He is out of all that region of things , and already dwelling in the secret place of the Almighty . ''
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 8]: `` Go on , go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 62]: `` He trusts in God so absolutely , that he leaves his salvation to him -- utterly , fearlessly ; and , forgetting it , as being no concern of his , sets himself to do the work that God has given him to do , even as his Lord did before him , counting that alone worthy of his care .
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 12]: Let God 's will be done , and all is well .
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 13]: If God 's will be done , he can not fare ill .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 9]: To him , God is all in all .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 28]: If it be possible to separate such things , it is the glory of God , even more than the salvation of men , that he seeks .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 14]: He will not have it that his Father in heaven is not perfect .
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 112]: He believes entirely that God loves , yea , is love ; and , therefore , that hell itself must be subservient to that love , and but an embodiment of it ; that the grand work of Justice is to make way for a Love which will give to every man that which is right and ten times more , even if it should be by means of awful suffering -- a suffering which the Love of the Father will not shun , either for himself or his children , but will eagerly meet for their sakes , that he may give them all that is in his heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 18]: `` Surely you speak your own opinions in describing thus warmly the faith of the preacher . ''
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 4]: `` I do .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 8]: He is accountable for nothing I say .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 20]: All I assert is , that this is how I seem to myself to succeed in understanding him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 14]: `` How is it that so many good people call him heterodox ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 7]: `` I do not mind that .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 29]: I am annoyed only when good-hearted people , with small natures and cultivated intellects , patronise him , and talk forgivingly of his warm heart and unsound judgment .
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 17]: To these , theology must be like a map -- with plenty of lines in it .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 26]: They can not trust their house on the high table-land of his theology , because they can not see the outlines bounding the said table-land .
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 8]: It is not small enough for them .
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 7]: They can not take it in .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 24]: Such can hardly be satisfied with the creation , one would think , seeing there is no line of division anywhere in it .
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 11]: They would take care there should be no mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 10]: `` Does God draw no lines , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 33]: `` When he does , they are pure lines , without breadth , and consequently invisible to mortal eyes ; not Chinese walls of separation , such as these definers would construct .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 12]: Such minds are à priori incapable of theorising upon his theories .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 40]: Or , to alter the figure , they will discover a thousand faults in his drawing , but they can never behold the figure constructed by his lines , and containing the faults which they believe they discover . ''
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 17]: `` But can those theories in religion be correct which are so hard to see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 10]: `` They are only hard to certain natures . ''
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 10]: `` But those natures are above the average . ''
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 13]: `` Yes , in intellect and its cultivation -- nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 8]: `` You have granted them heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 12]: `` Not much ; but what there is , good . ''
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 10]: `` That is allowing a great deal , though .
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 15]: Is it not hard then to say that such can not understand him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 12]: They will get to heaven , which is all they want .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 16]: And they will understand him one day , which is more than they pray for .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 39]: Till they have done being anxious about their own salvation , we must forgive them that they can contemplate with calmness the damnation of a universe , and believe that God is yet more indifferent than they . ''
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 20]: `` But do they not bring the charges likewise against you , of being unable to understand them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 25]: And so it must remain , till the Spirit of God decide the matter , which I presume must take place by slow degrees .
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 25]: For this decision can only consist in the enlightenment of souls to see the truth ; and therefore has to do with individuals only .
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 10]: There is no triumph for the Truth but that .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 20]: She knows no glorying over the vanquished , for in her victory the vanquished is already of the vanquishers .
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 26]: Till then , the Right must be content to be called the Wrong , and -- which is far harder -- to seem the Wrong .
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 30]: There is no spiritual victory gained by a verbal conquest ; or by any kind of torture , even should the rack employed be that of the purest logic .
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 49]: Nay more : so long as the wicked themselves remain impenitent , there is mourning in heaven ; and when there is no longer any hope over one last remaining sinner , heaven itself must confess its defeat , heap upon that sinner what plagues you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 13]: Hugh pondered , and continued pondering till they reached Falconer 's chambers .
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 6]: At the door Hugh paused .
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 8]: `` Will you not come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 9]: `` I fear I shall become troublesome . ''
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 6]: `` No fear of that .
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 16]: I promise to get rid of you as soon as I find you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 13]: Just let me know when you have had enough of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 3]: They entered .
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 51]: Mrs. Ashton , who , unlike her class , was never missing when wanted , got them some bread and cheese ; and Falconer 's Fortunatus-purse of a cellar -- the bottom of his cupboard -- supplied its usual bottle of port ; to which fare the friends sat down .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 56]: The conversation , like a bird descending in spirals , settled at last upon the subject which had more or less occupied Hugh 's thoughts ever since his unsatisfactory conversation with Funkelstein , at their first meeting ; and still more since he had learned that this man himself exercised an unlawful influence over Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 38]: He begged Falconer , if he had any theory comprehending such things , to let him know what kind of a relation it was , in which Miss Cameron stood to Funkelstein , or Count von Halkar .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 18]: `` I have had occasion to think a good deal about those things , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 38]: `` The first thing evident is , that Miss Cameron is peculiarly constituted , belonging to a class which is , however , larger than is commonly supposed , circumstances rarely combining to bring out its peculiarities .
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 61]: In those who constitute this class , the nervous element , either from preponderating , or from not being in healthy and harmonious combination with the more material element , manifests itself beyond its ordinary sphere of operation , and so occasions results unlike the usual phenomena of life , though , of course , in accordance with natural laws .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 44]: To use a simile : it is , in such cases , as if all the nerves of the human body came crowding to the surface , and there exposed themselves to a thousand influences , from which they would otherwise be preserved .
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 16]: Of course I am not attempting to explain , only to suggest a conceivable hypothesis .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 25]: Upon such constitutions , it would not be surprising that certain other constitutions , similar , yet differing , should exercise a peculiar influence .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 29]: You are , I dare say , more or less familiar with the main features of mesmerism and its allies , among which is what is called biology .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 19]: I presume it is on such constitutions as I have supposed , that those powers are chiefly operative .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 45]: Miss Cameron has , at some time or other in her history , submitted herself to the influences of this Count Halkar ; and he has thus gained a most dangerous authority over her , which he has exercised for his own ends . ''
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 17]: `` She more than implied as much in the last conversation I had with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 8]: `` So his will became her law .
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 18]: There is in the world of mind a something corresponding to physical force in the material world .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 12]: -- I can not avoid just touching upon a higher analogy .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 28]: The kingdom of heaven is not come , even when God 's will is our law : it is come when God 's will is our will .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 29]: While God 's will is our law , we are but a kind of noble slaves ; when his will is our will , we are free children .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 37]: Nothing in nature is free enough to be a symbol for the state of those who act immediately from the essence of their hidden life , and the recognition of God 's will as that essence .
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 14]: But , as I said , this belongs to a far higher region .
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 19]: I only wanted to touch on the relation of the freedoms -- physical , mental , and spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 28]: To return to the point in hand : I recognise in the story a clear evidence of strife and partial victory in the affair of the ring .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 36]: The count -- we will call him by the name he gives himself -- had evidently been anxious for years to possess himself of this ring : the probable reasons we have already talked of .
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 48]: He had laid his injunctions on his slave to find it for him ; and she , perhaps at first nothing loath , perhaps loving the man as well as submitting to him , had for a long time attempted to find it , but had failed .
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 42]: The count , probably doubting her sincerity , and hoping , at all events , to urge her search , followed her to Arnstead , where it is very likely he had been before , although he had avoided Mr. Arnold .
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 26]: Judging it advantageous to get into the house , in order to make observations , he employed his chance meeting with you to that result .
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 20]: But , before this , he had watched Miss Cameron 's familiarity with you -- was jealous and tyrannical .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 25]: Hence the variations of her conduct to you ; for when his power was upon her , she could not do as she pleased .
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 28]: But she must have had a real regard for you ; for she evidently refused to get you into trouble by taking the ring from your custody .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 15]: But my surprise is that the fellow limited himself to that one jewel . ''
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 26]: `` You may soon be relieved from that surprise , '' answered Hugh : `` he took a valuable diamond of mine as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 4]: `` The rascal !
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 16]: We may catch him , but you are not likely to find your diamond again .
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 8]: Still , there is some possibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 16]: `` How do you know she was not willing to take it from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 26]: `` Because , by her own account , he had to destroy her power of volition entirely , before he could make her do it .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 9]: He threw her into a mesmeric sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 14]: `` I should like to understand his power over her a little better .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 34]: In such cases of biology -- how they came to abuse the word , I should like to know -- '' `` Just as they call table-rapping , & c. , spiritualism . ''
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 17]: `` I suppose his relation to her must be classed amongst phenomena of that sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 4]: `` Certainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 15]: `` Well , tell me , does the influence outlast the mesmeric condition ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 18]: `` If by mesmeric condition you mean any state evidently approaching to that of sleep -- undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 14]: It is , in many cases , quite independent of such a condition .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 17]: Perhaps the degree of willing submission at first , may have something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 15]: But mesmeric influence , whatever it may mean , is entirely independent of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 14]: That is an accident accompanying it , perhaps sometimes indicating its culmination . ''
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 14]: `` Does the person so influenced act with or against his will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 13]: `` That is a most difficult question , involving others equally difficult .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 41]: My own impression is , that the patient -- for patient in a very serious sense he is -- acts with his inclination , and often with his will ; but in many cases with his inclination against his will .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 13]: This is a very important distinction in morals , but often overlooked .
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 15]: When a man is acting with his inclination , his will is in abeyance .
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 35]: In our present imperfect condition , it seems to me that the absolute will has no opportunity of pure action , of operating entirely as itself , except when working in opposition to inclination .
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 59]: But to return : the power of the biologist appears to me to lie in this -- he is able , by some mysterious sympathy , to produce in the mind of the patient such forceful impulses to do whatever he wills , that they are in fact irresistible to almost all who are obnoxious to his influence .
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 23]: The will requires an especial training and a distinct development , before it is capable of acting with any degree of freedom .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 48]: The men who have undergone this are very few indeed ; and no one whose will is not educated as well , can , if subjected to the influences of biology , resist the impulses roused in his passive brain by the active brain of the operator .
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 7]: This at least is my impression .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 15]: `` Other things no doubt combined to increase the influence in the present case .
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 11]: She liked him , perhaps more than liked him once .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 14]: She was partially committed to his schemes ; and she was easily mesmerised .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 14]: It would seem , besides , that she was naturally disposed to somnambulism .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 13]: This is a remarkable co-existence of distinct developments of the same peculiarity .
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 38]: In this latter condition , even if in others she were able to resist him , she would be quite helpless ; for all the thoughts that passed through her brain would owe their origin to his .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 11]: -- Imagine being forced to think another man 's thoughts !
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 6]: That would be possession indeed !
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 18]: And this is not far removed from the old stories about the demons entering into a man .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 50]: -- He would be ruler over the whole intellectual life that passed in her during the time ; and which to her , as far as the ideas suggested belonged to the outward world , would appear an outer life , passing all round her , not in her .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 43]: She would , in fact , be a creature of his imagination for the time , as much as any character invented , and sent through varied circumstances , feelings , and actions , by the mind of the poet or novelist .
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 5]: Look at the facts .
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 18]: She warned you to beware of the count that night before you went into the haunted bed-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 16]: Even when she entered it , by your own account -- '' `` Entered it ?
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 13]: Then you do think it was Euphra who personated the ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 7]: `` I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 5]: She was sleep-walking . ''
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 11]: `` But so different -- such a death-like look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 9]: `` All that was easy enough to manage .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 8]: She refused to obey him at first .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 4]: He mesmerized her .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 15]: It very likely went farther than he expected ; and he succeeded too well .
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 25]: Experienced , no doubt , in disguises , he dressed her as like the dead Lady Euphrasia as he could , following her picture .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 13]: Perhaps she possessed such a disguise , and had used it before .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 12]: He thus protected her from suspicion , and himself from implication .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 13]: -- What was the colour of the hair in the picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 4]: `` Golden . ''
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 10]: `` Hence the sparkle of gold-dust in her hair .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 6]: The count managed it all .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 11]: He willed that she should go , and she went .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 11]: Her disguise was certain safety , should she be seen .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 22]: You would suspect the ghost and no one else if she appeared to you , and you lost the ring after .
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 21]: But even in this state she yielded against her better inclination , for she was weeping when you saw her .
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 7]: But she could not help it .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 39]: While you lay on the couch in the haunted chamber , where he carried you , the awful death-ghost was busy in your room , was opening your desk , fingering your papers , and stealing your ring .
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 8]: It is rather a frightful idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 12]: `` She did not take my ring , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 8]: He followed her , and took it .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 17]: -- But she could not have come in at either door -- '' `` Could not ?
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 10]: Did she not go out at one of them ?
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 22]: Besides , I do not doubt that such a room as that had private communication with the open air as well .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 10]: I should much like to examine the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 14]: `` But how could she have gone through the bolted door then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 27]: `` That door may have been set in another , larger by half the frame or so , and opening with a spring and concealed hinges .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 7]: There is no difficulty about that .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 14]: There are such places to be found now and then in old houses .
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 26]: But , indeed , if you will excuse me , I do not consider your testimony , on every minute particular , quite satisfactory . ''
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 6]: asked Hugh , rather offended .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 30]: `` First , because of the state of excitement you must have been in ; and next , because I doubt the wine that was left in your room .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 18]: The count no doubt knew enough of drugs to put a few ghostly horrors into the decanter .
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 5]: But poor Miss Cameron !
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 11]: The horrors he has put into her mind and life !
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 14]: It is a sad fate -- all but a sentence of insanity . ''
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 6]: Hugh sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 5]: `` By heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 11]: he cried , `` I will strangle the knave . ''
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 6]: `` Stop , stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 3]: said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 4]: `` No revenge !
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 39]: Leave him to the sleeping divinity within him , which will awake one day , and complete the hell that he is now building for himself -- for the very fire of hell is the divine in it .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 8]: Your work is to set Euphra free .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 19]: If you did strangle him , how do you know if that would free her from him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 3]: `` Horrible !
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 9]: -- Have you no news of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 5]: `` None whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 12]: `` What , then , can I do for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 10]: `` You must teach her to foil him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 8]: `` How am I to do that ?
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 20]: Even if I knew how , I can not see her , I can not speak to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 10]: `` I have a great faith in opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 9]: `` But how should she foil him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 20]: `` She must pray to God to redeem her fettered will -- to strengthen her will to redeem herself .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 32]: She must resist the count , should he again claim her submission -LRB- as , for her sake , I hope he will -RRB- , as she would the devil himself .
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 4]: She must overcome .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 9]: Then she will be free -- not before .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 8]: This will be very hard to do .
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 15]: His power has been excessive and peculiar , and her submission long and complete .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 14]: Even if he left her alone , she would not therefore be free .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 23]: She must defy him ; break his bonds ; oppose his will ; assert her freedom ; and defeat him utterly . ''
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 5]: who will help her ?
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 5]: I have no power .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 17]: Even if I were with her , I could not help her in such a struggle .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 7]: I wish David were not dead .
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 5]: He was the man .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 9]: -- You could now , Mr. Falconer . ''
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 33]: Except I knew her , had known her for some time , and had a strong hold of all her nature , I could not , would not try to help her .
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 19]: If Providence brought this about , I would do my best ; but otherwise I would not interfere .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 25]: But if she pray to God , he will give her whatever help she needs , and in the best way , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 24]: `` I think it would be some comfort to her if we could find the ring -- the crystal , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 17]: `` It would be more , I think , if we could find the diamond . ''
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 8]: `` How can we find either ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 8]: `` We must find the count first .
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 10]: I have not given that up , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 18]: I will tell you what I should like to do , if I knew the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 51]: `` Get her to come to London , and make herself as public as possible : go to operas and balls , and theatres ; be presented at court ; take a stall at every bazaar , and sell charity puff-balls -- get as much into the papers as possible .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 24]: ` The lovely , accomplished , fascinating Miss Cameron , & c. , & c. ' '' `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 9]: `` I will tell you what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 54]: The count has forsaken her now ; but as soon as he heard that she was somebody , that she was followed and admired , his vanity would be roused , his old sense of property in her would revive , and he would begin once more to draw her into his toils .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 34]: What the result would be , it is impossible to foretell ; but it would at least give us a chance of catching him , and her a chance of resisting him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 17]: `` I do n't think , however , that she would venture on that course herself .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 11]: I should not dare to propose it to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 18]: It was only an invention , to deceive myself with the fancy that I was doing something .
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 16]: There would be many objections to such a plan , even if it were practicable .
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 20]: I must still try to find him , and if fresh endeavours should fail , devise fresher still . ''
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 11]: `` Thank you a thousand times , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 14]: `` It is too good of you to take so much trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 10]: `` It is my business , '' answered Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 10]: `` Is there not a soul in trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 10]: Hugh went home , full of his new friend .
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 32]: With the clue he had given him , he was able to follow all the windings of Euphra 's behaviour , and to account for almost everything that had taken place .
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 54]: It was quite painful to him to feel that he could be of no immediate service to her ; but he could hardly doubt that , before long , Falconer would , in his wisdom and experience , excogitate some mode of procedure in which he might be able to take a part .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 37]: He sat down to his novel , which had been making but little progress for some time ; for it is hard to write a novel when one is living in the midst of a romance .
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 15]: But the romance , at this time , was not very close to him .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 13]: It had a past and a possible future , but no present .
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 15]: That same future , however , might at any moment dawn into the present .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 43]: In the meantime , teaching the Latin grammar and the English alphabet to young aspirants after the honours of the ministry , was not work inimical to invention , from either the exhaustion of its excitement or the absorption of its interest .
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 6]: THE LADY 'S - MAID .
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 32]: Her yellow hair , beyond compare , Comes trinkling down her swan-white neck ; And her two eyes , like stars in skies , Would keep a sinking ship frae wreck .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 28]: Mally 's meek , Mally 's sweet , Mally 's modest and discreet ; Mally 's rare , Mally 's fair , Mally 's every way complete .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 2]: BURNS .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 7]: What arms for innocence but innocence .
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 3]: GILES FLETCHER .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 24]: Margaret had sought Euphra 's room , with the intention of restoring to her the letter which she had written to David Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 26]: Janet had let it lie for some time before she sent it to Margaret ; and Euphra had given up all expectation of an answer .
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 29]: Hopes of ministration filled Margaret 's heart ; but she expected , from what she knew of her , that anger would be Miss Cameron 's first feeling .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 51]: Therefore , when she heard no answer to her application for admission , and had concluded , in consequence , that Euphra was not in the room , she resolved to leave the letter where it would meet her eye , and thus prepare the way for a future conversation .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 28]: When she saw Euphra and Harry , she would have retired immediately ; but Euphra , annoyed by her entrance , was now quite able to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 4]: she said angrily .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 14]: `` This is your letter , Miss Cameron , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 10]: said Margaret , advancing with it in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 41]: Euphra took it , glanced at the direction , pushed Harry away from her , started up in a passion , and let loose the whole gathered irritability of contempt , weariness , disappointment , and suffering , upon Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 16]: Her dark eyes flashed with rage , and her sallow cheek glowed like a peach .
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 13]: `` What right have you , pray , to handle my letters ?
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 6]: How did you get this ?
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 6]: It has never been posted !
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 5]: And open , too .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 3]: I declare !
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 8]: I suppose you have read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 27]: Margaret was afraid of exciting more wrath before she had an opportunity of explaining ; but Euphra gave her no time to think of a reply .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 10]: `` You have read it , you shameless woman !
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 21]: Why do n't you lie , like the rest of your tribe , and keep me from dying with indignation ?
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 3]: Impudent prying !
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 15]: My maid never posted it , and you have found it and read it !
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 14]: Pray , did you hope to find a secret worth a bribe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 11]: She advanced on Margaret till within a foot of her .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 10]: `` Why do n't you answer , you hussy ?
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 9]: I will go this instant to your mistress .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 8]: You or I leave the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 15]: Margaret had stood all this time quietly , waiting for an opportunity to speak .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 17]: Her face was very pale , but perfectly still , and her eyes did not quail .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 10]: She had not in the least lost her self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 22]: She would not say at once that she had read the letter , because that would instantly rouse the tornado again .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 18]: `` You do not know my name , Miss Cameron ; of course you could not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 4]: `` Your name !
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 7]: What is that to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 20]: `` That , '' said Margaret , pointing to the letter , `` is my father 's name . ''
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 14]: Euphra looked at her own direction again , and then looked at Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 18]: She was so bewildered , that if she had any thoughts , she did not know them .
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 10]: Margaret went on : `` My father is dead .
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 9]: My mother sent the letter to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 12]: `` Then you have had the impertinence to read it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 10]: `` It was my duty to read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 3]: `` Duty !
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 8]: What business had you with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 24]: Euphra felt ashamed of the letter as soon as she found that she had applied to a man whose daughter was a servant .
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 26]: Margaret answered : `` I could at least reply to it so far , that the writer should not think my father had neglected it .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 16]: I did not know who it was from till I came to the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 17]: Euphra turned her back on her , with the words : `` You may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 12]: Margaret walked out of the room with an unconscious stately gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 8]: `` Come back , '' cried Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 3]: Margaret obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 17]: `` Of course you will tell all your fellow-servants the contents of this foolish letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 35]: Margaret 's face flushed , and her eye flashed , at the first words of this speech ; but the last words made her forget the first , and to them only she replied .
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 2]: Clasping .
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 17]: her hands , she said : `` Dear Miss Cameron , do not call it foolish .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 12]: For God 's sake , do not call it foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 7]: `` What is it to you ?
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 14]: Do you think I am going to make a confidante of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 6]: Margaret again left the room .
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 22]: Notwithstanding that she had made no answer to her insult , Euphra felt satisfied that her letter was safe from profanation .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 70]: No sooner was Margaret out of sight , than , with the reaction common to violent tempers , which in this case resulted the sooner , from the exhaustion produced in a worn frame by the violence of the outburst , Euphra sat down , in a hopeless , unresting way , upon the chair from which she had just risen , and began weeping more bitterly than before .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 40]: She was not only exhausted , but ashamed ; and to these feelings was added a far greater sense of disappointment than she could have believed possible , at the frustration of the hope of help from David Elginbrod .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 32]: True , this hope had been small ; but where there is only one hope , its death is equally bitter , whether it be a great or a little hope .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 31]: And there is often no power of reaction , in a mind which has been gradually reduced to one little faint hope , when that hope goes out in darkness .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 18]: There is a recoil which is very helpful , from the blow that kills a great hope .
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 22]: All this time Harry had been looking on , in a kind of paralysed condition , pale with perplexity and distress .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 33]: He now came up to Euphra , and , trying to pull her hand gently from her face , said : `` What is it all about , Euphra , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 9]: I have been very naughty , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 8]: `` But what is it all about ?
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 7]: May I read the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 11]: `` If you like , '' answered Euphra , listlessly .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 8]: Harry read the letter with quivering features .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 26]: Then , laying it down on the table with a reverential slowness , went to Euphra , put his arms round her and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 15]: `` Dear , dear Euphra , I did not know you were so unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 7]: I will find God for you .
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 14]: But first I will -- what shall I do to the bad man ?
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 4]: Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 14]: I will -- '' Harry finished the sentence by setting his teeth hard .
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 12]: you ca n't do anything for me , Harry , dear .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 13]: Only mind you do n't say anything about it to any one .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 11]: Put the letter in the fire there for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 22]: `` No -- that I wo n't , '' said Harry , taking up the letter , and holding it tight .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 13]: `` It is a beautiful letter , and it does me good .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 27]: Do n't you think , though it is not sent to God himself , he may read it , and take it for a prayer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 9]: `` I wish he would , Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 28]: `` But it was very wrong of you , Euphra , dear , to speak as you did to the daughter of such a good man . ''
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 7]: `` Yes , it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 18]: `` But then , you see , you got angry before you knew who she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 16]: `` But I should n't have got angry before I knew all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 22]: `` Well , you have only to say you are sorry , and Margaret wo n't think anything more about it .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 8]: Oh , she is so good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 29]: Euphra recoiled from making confession of wrong to a lady 's maid ; and , perhaps , she was a little jealous of Harry 's admiration of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 32]: For Euphra had not yet cast off all her old habits of mind , and one of them was the desire to be first with every one whom she cared for .
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 32]: She had got rid of a worse , which was , a necessity of being first in every company , whether she cared for the persons composing it , or not .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 33]: Mental suffering had driven the latter far enough from her ; though it would return worse than ever , if her mind were not filled with truth in the place of ambition .
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 10]: So she did not respond to what Harry said .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 17]: Indeed , she did not speak again , except to beg him to leave her alone .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 10]: She did not make her appearance again that day .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 52]: But at night , when the household was retiring , she rose from the bed on which she had been lying half-unconscious , and going to the door , opened it a little way , that she might hear when Margaret should pass from Mrs. Elton 's room towards her own .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 29]: She waited for some time ; but judging , at length , that she must have passed without her knowledge , she went and knocked at her door .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 14]: Margaret opened it a little , after a moment 's delay , half-undressed .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 9]: `` May I come in , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 12]: `` Pray , do , Miss Cameron , '' answered Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 7]: And she opened the door quite .
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 22]: Her cap was off , and her rich dark hair fell on her shoulders , and streamed thence to her waist .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 7]: Her under-clothing was white as snow .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 9]: `` What a lovely skin she has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 11]: thought Euphra , comparing it with her own tawny complexion .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 60]: She felt , for the first time , that Margaret was beautiful -- yes , more : that whatever her gown might be , her form and her skin -LRB- give me a prettier word , kind reader , for a beautiful fact , and I will gladly use it -RRB- were those of one of nature 's ladies .
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 19]: She was soon to find that her intellect and spirit were those of one of God 's ladies .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 19]: `` I am very sorry , Margaret , that I spoke to you as I did today . ''
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 8]: `` Never mind it , Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 8]: We can not help being angry sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 11]: And you had great provocation under the mistake you made .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 13]: I was only sorry because I knew it would trouble you afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 9]: Please do n't think of it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 9]: `` You are very kind , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 27]: `` I regretted my father 's death , for the first time , after reading your letter , for I knew he could have helped you .
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 15]: But it was very foolish of me , for God is not dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 14]: Margaret smiled as she said this , looking full in Euphra 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 14]: It was a smile of meaning unfathomable , and it quite overcame Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 50]: She had never liked Margaret before ; for , from not very obscure psychological causes , she had never felt comfortable in her presence , especially after she had encountered the nun in the Ghost 's Walk , though she had had no suspicion that the nun was Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 37]: A great many of our dislikes , both to persons and things , arise from a feeling of discomfort associated with them , perhaps only accidentally present in our minds the first time we met them .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 6]: But this vanished entirely now .
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 13]: `` Do you , then , know God too , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' answered Margaret , simply and solemnly .
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 9]: `` Will you tell me about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 18]: `` I can at least tell you about my father , and what he taught me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 6]: thank you , thank you !
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 9]: Do tell me about him -- now . ''
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 8]: `` Not now , dear Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 14]: It is late , and you are too unwell to stay up longer .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 8]: Let me help you to bed to-night .
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 7]: I will be your maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 25]: As she spoke , Margaret proceeded to put on her dress again , that she might go with Euphra , who had no attendant .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 28]: She had parted with Jane , and did not care , in her present mood , to have a woman about her , especially a new one .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 5]: `` No , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 13]: You have enough to do without adding me to your troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 10]: `` Please , do let me , Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 9]: It will be a great pleasure to me .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 8]: I have hardly anything to call work .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 15]: You should see how I used to work when I was at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 10]: Euphra still objected , but Margaret 's entreaty prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 7]: She followed Euphra to her room .
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 18]: There she served her like a ministering angel ; brushed her hair -- oh , so gently !
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 9]: smoothing it out as if she loved it .
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 15]: There was health in the touch of her hands , because there was love .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 43]: She undressed her ; covered her in bed as if she had been a child ; made up the fire to last as long as possible ; bade her good night ; and was leaving the room , when Euphra called her .
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 6]: Margaret returned to the bed-side .
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 10]: `` Kiss me , Margaret , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 14]: Margaret stooped , kissed her forehead and her lips , and left her .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 6]: Euphra cried herself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 15]: They were the first tears she had ever shed that were not painful tears .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 10]: She slept as she had not slept for months .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 124]: In order to understand this change in Euphrasia 's behaviour to Margaret -- in order , in fact , to represent it to our minds as at all credible -- we must remember that she had been trying to do right for some time ; that Margaret , as the daughter of David , seemed the only attainable source of the knowledge she sought ; that long illness had greatly weakened her obstinacy ; that her soul hungered , without knowing it , for love ; and that she was naturally gifted with a strong will , the position in which she stood in relation to the count proving only that it was not strong enough , and not that it was weak .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 19]: Such a character must , for any good , be ruled by itself , and not by circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 45]: To have been overcome in the process of time by the persistent goodness of Margaret , might have been the blessed fate of a weaker and worse woman ; but if Euphra did not overcome herself , there was no hope of further victory .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 35]: If Margaret could even wither the power of her oppressor , it would be but to transfer the lordship from a bad man to a good woman ; and that would not be enough .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 6]: It would not be freedom .
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 31]: And indeed , the aid that Margaret had to give her , could only be bestowed on one who already had freedom enough to act in some degree from duty .
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 11]: She knew she ought to go and apologize to Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 3]: She went .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 24]: In Margaret 's presence , and in such a mood , she was subjected at once to the holy enchantment of her loving-kindness .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 11]: She had never received any tenderness from a woman before .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 17]: Perhaps she had never been in the right mood to profit by it if she had .
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 10]: Nor had she ever before seen what Margaret was .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 25]: It was only when service -- divine service -- flowed from her in full outgoing , that she reached the height of her loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 7]: Then her whole form was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 29]: So was it interpenetrated by , and respondent to , the uprising soul within , that it radiated thought and feeling as if it had been all spirit .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 10]: This beauty rose to its best in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 36]: When she was ministering to any one in need , her eyes seemed to worship the object of her faithfulness , as if all the time she felt that she was doing it unto Him .
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 5]: Her deeds were devotion .
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 9]: She was the receiver and not the giver .
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 26]: Before this , Euphra had seen only the still waiting face ; and , as I have said , she had been repelled by it .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 29]: Once within the sphere of the radiation of her attraction , she was drawn towards her , as towards the haven of her peace : she loved her .
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 29]: To this , at length , had her struggle with herself in the silence of her own room , and her meditations on her couch , conducted her .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 13]: Shall we say that these alone had been and were leading her ?
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 16]: Or that to all these there was a hidden root , and an informing spirit ?
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 50]: Who would not rather believe that his thoughts come from an infinite , self-sphered , self-constituting thought , than that they rise somehow out of a blank abyss of darkness , and are only thought when he thinks them , which thinking he can not pre-determine or even foresee ?
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 16]: When Euphra woke , her first breath was like a deep draught of spiritual water .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 19]: She felt as if some sorrow had passed from her , and some gladness come in its stead .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 13]: She thought and thought , and found that the gladness was Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 24]: She had scarcely made the discovery , when the door gently opened , and Margaret peeped in to see if she were awake .
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 7]: `` May I come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 8]: `` Yes , please , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 8]: `` How do you feel to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 10]: `` Oh , so much better , dear Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 8]: Your kindness will make me well . ''
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 6]: `` I am so glad !
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 13]: Do lie still awhile , and I will bring you some breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 16]: Mrs. Elton will be so pleased to find you let me wait on you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 29]: `` She asked me , Margaret , if you should ; but I was too miserable -- and too naughty , for I did not like you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 17]: `` I knew that ; but I felt sure you would not dislike me always . ''
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 10]: `` Because I could not help loving you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 8]: `` Why did you love me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 9]: `` I will tell you half the reason .
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 7]: -- Because you looked unhappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 8]: `` What was the other half ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 15]: `` That I can not -- I mean I will not tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 4]: `` Never ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 4]: `` Perhaps never .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 6]: But I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 5]: -- Not now . ''
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 9]: `` Then I must not ask you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 6]: `` No -- please . ''
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 9]: `` Very well , I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 9]: I will go and get your breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 7]: `` What can she mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 5]: said Euphra to herself .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 8]: But she would never have found out .
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 3]: DAVID ELGINBROD .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 6]: He being dead yet speaketh .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 4]: HEB. , xi .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 15]: In all ` he ' did Some figure of the golden times was hid .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 3]: DR. DONNE .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 18]: From this time , Margaret waited upon Euphra , as if she had been her own maid .
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 20]: Nor had Mrs. Elton any cause of complaint , for Margaret was always at hand when she was wanted .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 10]: Indeed , her mistress was full of her praises .
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 4]: Euphra said little .
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 18]: Many and long were the conversations between the two girls , when all but themselves were asleep .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 22]: Sometimes Harry made one of the company ; but they could always send him away when they wished to be alone .
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 19]: And now the teaching for which Euphra had longed , sprang in a fountain at her own door .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 21]: It had been nigh her long , and she had not known it , for its hour had not come .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 23]: Now she drank as only the thirsty drink , -- as they drink whose very souls are fainting within them for drought .
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 8]: But how did Margaret embody her lessons ?
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 24]: The second night , she came to Euphra 's room , and said : `` Shall I tell you about my father to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 6]: Are , you able ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 4]: Euphra was delighted .
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 11]: It was what she had been hoping for all day .
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 5]: `` Do tell me .
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 8]: I long to hear about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 61]: So they sat down ; and Margaret began to talk about her childhood ; the cottage she lived in ; the fir-wood all around it ; the work she used to do ; -- her side , in short , of the story which , in the commencement of this book , I have partly related from Hugh 's side .
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 18]: Summer and winter , spring-time and harvest , storm and sunshine , all came into the tale .
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 35]: Her mother came into it often ; and often too , though not so often , the grand form of her father appeared , remained for a little while , and then passed away .
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 36]: Every time Euphra saw him thus in the mirror of Margaret 's memory , she saw him more clearly than before : she felt as if , soon , she should know him quite well .
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 33]: Sometimes she asked a question or two ; but generally she allowed Margaret 's words to flow unchecked ; for she painted her pictures better when the colours did not dry between .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 18]: They talked on , or rather , Margaret talked and Euphra listened , far into the night .
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 18]: At length , Margaret stopped suddenly , for she became aware that a long time had passed .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 23]: Looking at the clock on the chimney-piece , she said : `` I have done wrong to keep you up so late .
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 9]: Come -- I must get you to bed .
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 20]: You are an invalid , you know , and I am your nurse as well as your maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 10]: `` You will come to-morrow night , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 7]: `` Yes , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 13]: `` Then I will go to bed like a good child . ''
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 13]: Margaret undressed her , and left her to the healing of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 16]: The next night she spoke again of her father , and what he taught her .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 48]: Euphra had thought much about him ; and at every fresh touch which the story gave to the portrait , she knew him better ; till at last , even when circumstances not mentioned before came up , she seemed to have known them from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 10]: `` What was your father like , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 23]: Margaret described him very nearly as I have done , from Hugh 's account , in the former part of the story .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 6]: Euphra said : `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 2]: yes .
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 10]: That is almost exactly as I had fancied him .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 6]: Is it not strange ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 13]: `` It is very natural , I think , '' answered Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 12]: `` I seem now to have known him for years . ''
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 35]: But what is most worthy of record is , that ever as the picture of David grew on the vision of Euphra , the idea of God was growing unawares upon her inward sight .
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 12]: She was learning more and more about God all the time .
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 14]: The sight of human excellence awoke a faint Ideal of the divine perfection .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 35]: Faith came of itself , and abode , and grew ; for it needs but a vision of the Divine , and faith in God is straightway born in the soul that beholds it .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 8]: Thus , faith and sight are one .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 31]: The being of her father in heaven was no more strange and far off from her , when she had seen such a father on earth as Margaret 's was .
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 20]: It was not alone David 's faith that begot hers , but the man himself was a faith-begetting presence .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 9]: He was the evidence of God with them .
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 19]: -- Thus he , being dead , yet spoke , and the departed man was a present power .
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 10]: Euphra began to read the story of the Gospel .
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 4]: So did Harry .
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 21]: They found much on which to desire enlightenment ; and they always applied to Margaret for the light they needed .
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 11]: It was long before she ventured to say I think .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 63]: She always said : `` My father used to say -- '' or `` I think my father would have said -- '' It was not until Euphra was in great trouble some time after this , and required the immediate consolation of personal testimony , that Margaret spoke as from herself ; and then she spoke with positive assurance of faith .
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 22]: She did not then even say I think , but , I am sure ; I know ; I have seen .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 26]: Many interviews of this sort did not take place between them before Euphra , in her turn , began to confide her history to Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 33]: It was a strangely different one -- full of outward event and physical trouble ; but , till it approached the last stages , wonderfully barren as to inward production or development .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 16]: It was a history of Euphra 's circumstances and peculiarities , not of Euphra herself .
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 11]: Till of late , she had scarcely had any history .
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 33]: Margaret 's , on the contrary , was a true history ; for , with much of the monotonous in circumstance , it described individual growth , and the change of progress .
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 29]: Where there is no change there can be no history ; and as all change is either growth or decay , all history must describe progress or retrogression .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 40]: The former had now begun for Euphra as well ; and it was one proof of it that she told Margaret all I have already recorded for my readers , at least as far as it bore against herself .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 46]: How much more she told her I am unable to say ; but after she had told it , Euphra was still more humble towards Margaret , and Margaret more tender , more full of service , if possible , and more devoted to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 4]: MARGARET 'S SECRET .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 19]: Love is not love Which alters when it alteration finds , Or bends with the remover to remove .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 2]: SHAKSPERE .
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 4]: -- Sonnet cxvi .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 21]: Margaret could not proceed very far in the story of her life , without making some reference to Hugh Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 8]: But she carefully avoided mentioning his name .
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 23]: Perhaps no one less calm , and free from the operation of excitement , could have been so successful in suppressing it .
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 23]: said Euphra , one day , `` your history is a little like mine there ; a tutor comes into them both .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 11]: Did you not fall dreadfully in love with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 8]: `` I loved him very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 7]: `` Where is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 8]: `` In London , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 8]: `` Do you never see him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 18]: `` Have you never seen him since he left your home -- with the curious name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 10]: `` Yes ; but not spoken to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 4]: Margaret was silent .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 12]: Euphra knew her well enough now not to repeat the question .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 14]: `` I should have been in love with him , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 4]: Margaret only smiled .
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 15]: Another day , Euphra said : `` What a good boy that Harry is !
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 5]: And so clever too .
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 12]: Margaret , I have behaved like the devil to that boy .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 16]: I wanted to have him all to myself , and so kept him a child .
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 9]: Need I confess all my ugliest sins ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 11]: `` Not to me , certainly , dear Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 17]: Tell God to look into your heart , and take them all out of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 4]: `` I will .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 3]: I do .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 30]: -- I even enticed Mr. Sutherland away from him to me , when he was the only real friend he had , that I might have them both . ''
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 15]: `` But you have done your best to make up for it since . ''
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 7]: `` I have tried a little .
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 10]: I can not say I have done my best .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 9]: I have been so peevish and irritable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 9]: `` You could not quite help that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 10]: `` How kind you are to excuse me so !
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 11]: It makes me so much stronger to try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 33]: `` My father used to say that God was always finding every excuse for us that could be found ; every true one , you know ; not one false one . ''
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 7]: `` That does comfort one . ''
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 18]: After a pause , Euphra resumed : `` Mr. Sutherland did me some good , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 9]: `` I do not wonder at that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 20]: `` He made me think less about Count Halkar ; and that was something , for he haunted me .
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 11]: I did not know then how very wicked he was .
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 6]: I did love him once .
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 9]: Oh , how I hate him now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 15]: And she started up and paced the room like a tigress in its cage .
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 18]: Margaret did not judge this the occasion to read her a lecture on the duty of forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 16]: She had enough to do to keep from hating the man herself , I suspect .
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 11]: But she tried to turn her thoughts into another channel .
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 12]: `` Mr. Sutherland loved you very much , Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 15]: `` He loved me once , '' said poor Euphra , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 6]: `` I saw he did .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 11]: That was why I began to love you too . ''
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 12]: Margaret had at last unwittingly opened the door of her secret .
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 10]: She had told the other reason for loving Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 13]: But , naturally enough , Euphra could not understand what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 37]: Perhaps some of my readers , understanding Margaret 's words perfectly , and their reference too , may be so far from understanding Margaret herself , as to turn upon me and say : `` Impossible !
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 12]: You can not have understood her or any other woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 9]: `` What do you mean , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 7]: Margaret both blushed and laughed outright .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 30]: `` I must confess it , '' said she , at once ; `` it can not hurt him now : my tutor and yours are the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 4]: `` Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 4]: `` True . ''
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 15]: `` And you never spoke all the time you were both at Arnstead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 4]: `` Not once .
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 10]: He never knew I was in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 4]: `` How strange !
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 8]: And you saw he loved me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 8]: `` And you were not jealous ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 7]: `` I did not say that .
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 28]: But I soon found that the only way to escape from my jealousy , if the feeling I had was jealousy , was to love you too .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 4]: I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 5]: `` You beautiful creature !
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 10]: But you could not have loved him much . ''
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 12]: `` I loved him enough to love you for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 8]: But why did he stop loving you ?
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 15]: I fear I shall not be able to love him so much now . ''
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 9]: `` He could not help it , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 5]: I deserved it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 8]: Euphra hid her face in her hands .
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 12]: `` He could not have really loved you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 45]: `` Which is better to believe , Margaret , '' said Euphra , uncovering her face , which two tears were lingering down , and looking up at her -- `` that he never loved me , or that he stopped loving me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 9]: `` For his sake , the first . ''
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 10]: `` And for my sake , the second ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 5]: `` That depends . ''
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 5]: `` So it does .
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 10]: He must have found plenty of faults in me .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 17]: But I was not so bad as he thought me when he stopped loving me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 21]: Margaret 's answer was one of her loving smiles , in which her eyes had more share than her lips .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 24]: It would have been unendurable to Euphra , a little while before , to find that she had a rival in a servant .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 10]: Now she scarcely regarded that aspect of her position .
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 22]: But she looked doubtfully at Margaret , and then said : `` How is it that you take it so quietly ?
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 12]: -- for your love must have been very different from mine .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 34]: Indeed , I am not sure that I loved him at all ; and after I had made up my mind to it quite , it did not hurt me so very much .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 9]: But you must have loved him dreadfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 5]: `` Perhaps I did .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 9]: But I had no anxiety about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 18]: `` But that you could not leave to a father such as yours even to settle . ''
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 6]: But I could to God .
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 15]: I could trust God with what I could not speak to my father about .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 26]: He is my father 's father , you know ; and so , more to him and me than we could be to each other .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 36]: The more we love God , the more we love each other ; for we find he makes the very love which sometimes we foolishly fear to do injustice to , by loving him most .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 21]: I love my father ten times more because he loves God , and because God has secrets with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 18]: `` I wish God were a father to me as he is to you , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 14]: `` But he is your father , whether you wish it or not .
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 11]: He can not be more your father than he is .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 28]: You may be more his child than you are , but not more than he meant you to be , nor more than he made you for .
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 13]: You are infinitely more his child than you have grown to yet .
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 18]: He made you altogether his child , but you have not given in to it yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 8]: yes ; I know what you mean .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 7]: I feel it is true . ''
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 10]: `` The Prodigal Son was his father 's child .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 10]: He knew it , and gave in to it .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 22]: He did not say : ' I wish my father loved me enough to treat me like a child again . '
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 18]: He did not say that , but -- I will arise and go to my father . ''
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 13]: Euphra made no answer , but wept , Margaret said no more .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 7]: Euphra was the first to resume .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 9]: `` Mr. Sutherland was very kind , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 21]: He promised -- and I know he will keep his promise -- to do all he could to help me .
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 13]: I hope he is finding out where that wicked count is . ''
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 14]: `` Write to him , and ask him to come and see you .
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 9]: He does not know where you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 11]: `` But I do n't know where he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 5]: `` I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 5]: `` Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 6]: rejoined Euphra with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 10]: `` But he does not know where I am .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 12]: I will give you his address , if you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 5]: Euphra pondered a little .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 20]: She would have liked very much to see him , for she was anxious to know of his success .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 63]: The love she had felt for him was a very small obstacle to their meeting now ; for her thoughts had been occupied with affairs , before the interest of which the poor love she had then been capable of , had melted away and vanished -- vanished , that is , in all that was restrictive and engrossing in its character .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 35]: But now that she knew the relation that had existed between Margaret and him , she shrunk from doing anything that might seem to Margaret to give Euphra an opportunity of regaining his preference .
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 34]: Not that she had herself the smallest hope , even had she had the smallest desire of doing so ; but she would not even suggest the idea of being Margaret 's rival .
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 13]: At length she answered : `` No , thank you , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 24]: As soon as he has anything to report , he will write to Arnstead , and Mrs. Horton will forward me the letter .
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 8]: No -- it is quite unnecessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 16]: Euphra 's health was improving a little , though still she was far from strong .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 2]: FOREBODINGS .
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 2]: Faust .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 13]: If heaven was made for man , 't was made for me .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 3]: Good Angel .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 10]: Faustus , repent ; yet heaven will pity thee .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 3]: Bad Angel .
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 11]: Thou art a spirit , God can not pity thee .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 2]: Faust .
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 11]: Be I a devil , yet God may pity me .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 3]: Bad Angel .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 3]: Too late .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 3]: Good Angel .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 8]: Never too late if Faustus will repent .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 3]: Bad Angel .
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 11]: If thou repent , devils will tear thee in pieces .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 3]: Old Man .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 27]: I see an angel hover o'er thy head , And with a vial full of precious grace , Offers to pour the same into thy soul .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 2]: MARLOWE .
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 4]: -- Doctor Faustus .
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 58]: Mr. Appleditch had had some business-misfortunes , not of a heavy nature , but sufficient to cast a gloom over the house in Dervish Town , and especially over the face of his spouse , who had set her heart on a new carpet for her drawing-room , and feared she ought not to procure it now .
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 16]: It is wonderful how conscientious some people are towards their balance at the banker 's .
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 32]: How the drawing-room , however , could come to want a new carpet is something mysterious , except there is a peculiar power of decay inherent in things deprived of use .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 31]: These influences operating , however , she began to think that the two scions of grocery were not drawing nine shillings ' worth a week of the sap of divinity .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 7]: This she hinted to Mr. Appleditch .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 8]: It was resolved to give Hugh warning .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 27]: As it would involve some awkwardness to state reasons , Mrs. Appleditch resolved to quarrel with him , as the easiest way of prefacing his discharge .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 29]: It was the way she took with her maids-of-all-work ; for it was grand in itself , and always left her with a comfortable feeling of injured dignity .
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 17]: As a preliminary course , she began to treat him with still less politeness than before .
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 16]: Hugh was so careless of her behaviour , that this made no impression upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 39]: But he came to understand it all afterwards , from putting together the remarks of the children , and the partial communications of Mr. Appleditch to Miss Talbot , which that good lady innocently imparted to her lodger .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 37]: At length , one day , she came into the room where Hugh was more busy in teaching than his pupils were in learning , and seated herself by the fire to watch for an opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 5]: This was soon found .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 48]: For the boys , rendered still more inattentive by the presence of their mother , could not be induced to fix the least thought upon the matter in hand ; so that Hugh was compelled to go over the same thing again and again , without success .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 33]: At last he said : `` I am afraid , Mrs. Appleditch , I must ask you to interfere , for I can not get any attention from the boys to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 33]: `` And how could it be otherwise , Mr. Sutherland , when you keep wearing them out with going over and over the same thing , till they are sick of it ?
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 8]: Why do n't you go on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 17]: `` How can I go on when they have not learned the thing they are at ?
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 12]: That would be to build the chimneys before the walls . ''
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 32]: `` It is very easy to be witty , sir ; but I beg you will behave more respectfully to me in the presence of my children , innocent lambs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 37]: Looking round at the moment , Hugh caught in his face what the elder lamb had intended for his back , a grimace hideous enough to have procured him instant promotion in the kingdom of apes .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 20]: The mother saw it too , and added : `` You see you can not make them respect you .
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 6]: Really , Mr. Sutherland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 76]: Hugh was about to reply , to the effect that it was useless , in such circumstances , to attempt teaching them at all , some utterance of which sort was watched for as the occasion for his instant dismission ; but at that very moment a carriage and pair pulled sharply up at the door , with more than the usual amount of quadrupedation , and mother and sons darted simultaneously to the window .
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 4]: `` My ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 9]: cried Johnnie , `` what a rum go !
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 10]: Is n't that a jolly carriage , Peetie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 8]: `` Papa 's bought a carriage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 3]: shouted Peetie .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 23]: `` Be quiet , children , '' said their mother , as she saw a footman get down and approach the door .
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 10]: `` Look at that buffer , '' said Johnnie .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 12]: `` Do come and see this grand footman , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 7]: He 's such a gentleman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 11]: A box on the ear from his mother silenced him .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 43]: The servant entering with some perturbation a moment after , addressed her mistress , for she dared not address any one else while she was in the room : `` Please 'm , the carriage is astin ' after Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 5]: `` Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 25]: The lady turned to Mr. Sutherland , who , although surprised as well , was not inclined to show his surprise to Mrs. Appleditch .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 23]: `` I did not know you had carriage-friends , Mr. Sutherland , '' said she , with a toss of her head .
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 9]: `` Neither did I , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 12]: `` But I will go and see who it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 38]: When he reached the street , he found Harry on the pavement , who having got out of the carriage , and not having been asked into the house , was unable to stand still for impatience .
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 30]: As soon as he saw his tutor , he bounded to him , and threw his arms round his neck , standing as they were in the open street .
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 7]: Tears of delight filled his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 18]: `` Come , come , come , '' said Harry ; `` we all want you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 6]: `` Who wants me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 8]: `` Mrs. Elton and Euphra and me .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 6]: Come , get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 8]: And he pulled Hugh towards the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 9]: `` I can not go with you now .
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 6]: I have pupils here . ''
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 5]: Harry 's face fell .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 7]: `` When will you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 5]: `` In half-an-hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 3]: `` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 9]: I shall be back exactly in half-an-hour then .
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 10]: Do be ready , please , Mr. Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 5]: `` I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 25]: Harry jumped into the carriage , telling the coachman to drive where he pleased , and be back at the same place in half-an-hour .
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 6]: Hugh returned into the house .
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 14]: As may be supposed , Margaret was the means of this happy meeting .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 28]: Although she saw plainly enough that Euphra would like to see Hugh , she did not for some time make up her mind to send for him .
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 12]: The circumstances which made her resolve to do so were these .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 16]: For some days Euphra seemed to be gradually regaining her health and composure of mind .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 25]: One evening , after a longer talk than usual , Margaret had left her in bed , and had gone to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 52]: She was just preparing to get into bed herself , when a knock at her door startled her , and going to it , she saw Euphra standing there , pale as death , with nothing on but her nightgown , notwithstanding the bitter cold of an early and severe frost .
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 30]: She thought at first she must be walking in her sleep , but the scared intelligence of her open eyes , soon satisfied her that it was not so .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 11]: `` What is the matter , dear Miss Cameron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 9]: she said , as calmly as she could .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 5]: `` He is coming .
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 4]: He wants me .
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 10]: If he calls me , I must go . ''
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 14]: `` No , you shall not go , '' rejoined Margaret , firmly .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 15]: `` I must , I must , '' answered Euphra , wringing her hands .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 20]: `` Do come in , '' said Margaret , `` you must not stand there in the cold . ''
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 9]: `` Let me get into your bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 10]: `` Better let me go with you to yours .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 9]: That will be more comfortable for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 6]: yes ; please do . ''
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 16]: Margaret threw a shawl round Euphra , and went back with her to her room .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 5]: `` He wants me .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 4]: He wants me .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 23]: He will call me soon , '' said Euphra , in an agonised whisper , as soon as the door was shut .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 7]: `` What shall I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 15]: `` Come to bed first , and we will talk about it there . ''
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 37]: As soon as they were in bed , Margaret put her arm round Euphra , who was trembling with cold and fear , and said : `` Has this man any right to call you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 11]: `` No , no , '' answered Euphra , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 7]: `` Then do n't go . ''
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 9]: `` But I am afraid of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 9]: `` Defy him in God 's name . ''
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 47]: `` But besides the fear , there is something that I ca n't describe , that always keeps telling me -- no , not telling me , pushing me -- no , drawing me , as if I could not rest a moment till I go .
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 6]: I can not describe it .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 28]: I hate to go , and yet I feel that if I were cold in my grave , I must rise and go if he called me .
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 11]: I wish I could tell you what it is like .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 16]: It is as if some demon were shaking my soul till I yielded and went .
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 5]: do n't despise me .
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 7]: I ca n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 14]: `` My darling , I do n't , I ca n't despise you .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 8]: You shall not go to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 39]: `` But I must , '' answered she , with a despairing faintness more convincing than any vehemence ; and then began to weep with a slow , hopeless weeping , like the rain of a November eve .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 6]: Margaret got out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 6]: Euphra thought she was offended .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 15]: Starting up , she clasped her hands , and said : `` Oh Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 5]: I wo n't cry .
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 5]: Do n't leave me .
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 6]: Do n't leave me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 7]: She entreated like a chidden child .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 16]: `` No , no , I did n't mean to leave you for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 14]: Lie down again , dear , and cry as much as you like .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 17]: I am going to read a little bit out of the New Testament to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 12]: `` I am afraid I ca n't listen to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 4]: Do n't try .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 7]: I want to read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 28]: Margaret got a New Testament , and read part of that chapter of St. John 's Gospel which speaks about human labour and the bread of life .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 31]: She stopped at these words : `` For I came down from heaven , not to do mine own will , but the will of him that sent me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 6]: Euphra 's tears had ceased .
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 52]: The sound of Margaret 's voice , which , if it lost in sweetness by becoming more Scotch when she read the Gospel , yet gained thereby in pathos , and the power of the blessed words themselves , had soothed the troubled spirit a little , and she lay quiet .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 13]: `` The count is not a good man , Miss Cameron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 9]: `` You know he is not , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 8]: He is the worst man alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 17]: `` Then it can not be God 's will that you should go to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 14]: `` But one does many things that are not God 's will . ''
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 16]: `` But it is God 's will that you should not go to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 8]: Euphra lay silent for a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 56]: Suddenly she exclaimed : `` Then I must not go to him , '' -- got out of bed , threw herself on her knees by the bedside , and holding up her clasped hands , said , in low tones that sounded as if forced from her by agony : `` I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 4]: I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 7]: O God , I will not .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 7]: Help me , help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 12]: Margaret knelt beside her , and put her arm round her .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 28]: Euphra spoke no more , but remained kneeling , with her extended arms and clasped hands lying on the bed , and her head laid between them .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 11]: At length Margaret grew alarmed , and looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 11]: But she found that she was in a sweet sleep .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 34]: She gently disengaged herself , and covering her up soft and warm , left her to sleep out her God-sent sleep undisturbed , while she sat beside , and watched for her waking .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 7]: She slept thus for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 38]: Then lifting her head , and seeing Margaret , she rose quietly , as if from her prayers , and said with a smile : `` Margaret , I was dreaming that I had a mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 8]: `` So you have , somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 32]: `` Yes , so I have , somewhere , '' she repeated , and crept into bed like a child , lay down , and was asleep again in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 48]: Margaret watched her for another hour , and then seeing no signs of restlessness , but that on the contrary her sleep was profound , lay down beside her , and soon shared in that repose which to weary women and men is God 's best gift .
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 17]: She rose at her usual hour the next day , and was dressed before Euphra awoke .
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 20]: It was a cold grey December morning , with the hoar-frost lying thick on the roofs of the houses .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 12]: Euphra opened her eyes while Margaret was busy lighting the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 18]: Seeing that she was there , she closed them again , and fell once more fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 24]: Before she woke again , Margaret had some tea ready for her ; after taking which , she felt able to get up .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 14]: She rose looking more bright and hopeful than Margaret had seen her before .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 19]: But Margaret , who watched her intently through the day , saw a change come over her cheer .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 7]: Her face grew pale and troubled .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 41]: Now and then her eyes were fixed on vacancy ; and again she would look at Margaret with a woebegone expression of countenance ; but presently , as if recollecting herself , would smile and look cheerful for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 67]: Margaret saw that the conflict was coming on , if not already begun -- that at least its shadow was upon her ; and thinking that if she could have a talk with Hugh about what he had been doing , it would comfort her a little , and divert her thoughts from herself , even if no farther or more pleasantly than to the count .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 17]: She let Harry know Hugh 's address , as given in the letter to her father .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 26]: She was certain that , if Harry succeeded in finding him , nothing more was necessary to insure his being brought to Mrs. Elton 's .
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 13]: As we have seen , Harry had traced him to Buccleuch Terrace .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 53]: Hugh re-entered the house in the same mind in which he had gone out ; namely , that after Mrs. Appleditch 's behaviour to him before his pupils , he could not remain their tutor any longer , however great his need might be of the pittance he received for his services .
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 76]: But although Mrs. Appleditch 's first feeling had been jealousy of Hugh 's acquaintance with `` carriage-people , '' the toadyism which is so essential an element of such jealousy , had by this time revived ; and when Hugh was proceeding to finish the lesson he had begun , intending it to be his last , she said : `` Why did n't you ask your friend into the drawing-room , Mr. Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 4]: The drawing-room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 18]: thought Hugh -- but answered : `` He will fetch me when the lesson is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 24]: `` I am sure , sir , any friends of yours that like to call upon you here , will be very welcome .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 31]: It will be more agreeable to you to receive them here , of course ; for your accommodation at poor Miss Talbot 's is hardly suitable for such visitors . ''
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 44]: `` I am sorry to say , however , '' answered Hugh , `` that after the way you have spoken to me to-day , in the presence of my pupils , I can not continue my relation to them any longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 3]: ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 21]: resnorted the lady , indignation and scorn mingling with mortification ; `` our grand visitors have set our backs up .
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 17]: Very well , Mr. Sutherland , you will oblige me by leaving the house at once .
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 12]: Do n't trouble yourself , pray , to finish the lesson .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 10]: I will pay you for it all the same .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 19]: Anything to get rid of a man who insults me before the very faces of my innocent lambs !
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 56]: And please to remember , '' she added , as she pulled out her purse , while Hugh was collecting some books he had lent the boys , `` that when you were starving , my husband and I took you in and gave you employment out of charity -- pure charity , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 6]: Here is your money . ''
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 30]: `` Good morning , Mrs. Appleditch , '' said Hugh ; and walked out with his books under his arm , leaving her with the money in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 33]: He had to knock his feet on the pavement in front of the house , to keep them from freezing , for half-an-hour , before the carriage arrived to take him away .
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 21]: As soon as it came up , he jumped into it , and was carried off in triumph by Harry .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 6]: Mrs. Elton received him kindly .
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 19]: Euphra held out her hand with a slight blush , and the quiet familiarity of an old friend .
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 24]: Hugh could almost have fallen in love with her again , from compassion for her pale , worn face , and subdued expression .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 30]: Mrs. Elton went out in the carriage almost directly , and Euphra begged Harry to leave them alone , as she had something to talk to Mr. Sutherland about .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 13]: `` Have you found any trace of Count Halkar , Hugh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 10]: she said , the moment they were by themselves .
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 11]: `` I am very sorry to say I have not .
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 7]: I have done my best . ''
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 8]: `` I am quite sure of that .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 36]: -- I just wanted to tell you , that , from certain indications which no one could understand so well as myself , I think you will have more chance of finding him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 12]: `` I am delighted to hear it , '' responded Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 8]: `` If I only had him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 18]: Euphra sighed , paused , and then said : `` But I am not sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 19]: I think he is in London ; but he may be in Bohemia , for anything I know .
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 19]: I shall , however , in all probability , know more about him within a few days . ''
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 19]: Hugh resolved to go at once to Falconer , and communicate to him what Euphra had told him .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 58]: But he said nothing to her as to the means by which he had tried to discover the count ; for although he felt sure that he had done right in telling Falconer all about it , he was afraid lest Euphra , not knowing what sort of a man he was , might not like it .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 23]: Euphra , on her part , did not mention Margaret 's name ; for she had begged her not to do so .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 11]: `` You will tell me when you know yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 3]: `` Perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 8]: -- I will , if I can .
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 9]: I do wish you could get the ring .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 14]: I have a painful feeling that it gives him power over me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 17]: `` That can only be a nervous fancy , surely , '' Hugh ventured to say .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 5]: `` Perhaps it is .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 18]: But , still , without that , there are plenty of reasons for wishing to recover it .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 13]: He will put it to a bad use , if he can .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 15]: But for your sake , especially , I wish we could get it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 6]: You were always kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 21]: `` No , '' she replied , without lifting her eyes ; `` I brought it all upon you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 9]: `` But you could not help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 6]: `` Not at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 11]: But all that led to it was my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 12]: She paused ; then suddenly resumed : `` I will confess .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 17]: -- Do you know what gave rise to the reports of the house being haunted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 22]: `` It was me wandering about it at night , looking for that very ring , to give to the count .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 4]: It was shameful .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 4]: But I did .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 9]: Those reports prevented me from being found out .
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 13]: But I hope not many ghosts are so miserable as I was .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 14]: -- You remember my speaking to you of Mr. Arnold 's jewels ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 6]: `` Yes , perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 15]: `` I wanted to find out , through you , where the ring was .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 10]: But I had no intention of involving you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 9]: `` I am sure you had not . ''
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 11]: `` Do n't be too sure of anything about me .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 13]: I do n't know what I might have been led to do .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 6]: But I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 5]: Do forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 12]: `` I can not allow that I have anything to forgive .
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 24]: But tell me , Euphra , were you the creature , in white that I saw in the Ghost 's Walk one night ?
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 9]: I do n't mean the last time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 18]: `` Very likely , '' she answered , bending her head yet lower , with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 12]: `` Then who was the creature in black that met you ?
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 8]: And what became of you then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 7]: `` Did you see her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 7]: rejoined Euphra , turning paler still .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 8]: `` I fainted at sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 14]: I took her for the nun that hangs in that horrid room . ''
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 9]: `` So did I , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 25]: `` But you could not have lain long ; for I went up to the spot where you vanished , and found nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 12]: `` I suppose I got into the shrubbery before I fell .
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 7]: Or the count dragged me in .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 8]: -- But was that really a ghost ?
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 30]: I feel now as if it was a good messenger , whether ghost or not , come to warn me , if I had had the courage to listen .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 9]: I wish I had taken the warning . ''
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 24]: They talked about these and other things , till Mrs. Elton , who had made Hugh promise to stay to lunch , returned .
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 27]: When they were seated at table , the kind-hearted woman said : `` Now , Mr. Sutherland , when will you begin again with Harry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 12]: `` I do not quite understand you , '' answered Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 14]: `` Of course you will come and give him lessons , poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 10]: He will be broken-hearted if you do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 6]: `` I wish I could .
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 19]: But I can not -- at least yet ; for I know his father was dissatisfied with me .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 15]: That was one of the reasons that made him send Harry to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 9]: Harry looked wretchedly disappointed , but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 12]: `` I never heard him say anything of the sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 9]: `` I am sure of it , though .
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 19]: I am very sorry he has mistaken me ; but he will know me better some day . ''
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 13]: `` I will take all the responsibility , '' persisted Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 14]: `` But unfortunately the responsibility sticks too fast for you to take it .
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 13]: I can not get rid of my share if I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 6]: `` You are too particular .
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 11]: I am sure Mr. Arnold never could have meant that .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 7]: This is my house too . ''
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 7]: `` But Harry is his boy .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 19]: If you will let me come and see him sometimes , I shall be very thankful , though .
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 12]: I may be useful to him without giving him lessons . ''
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 10]: `` Thank you , '' said Harry with delight .
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 21]: I suppose you are so much in request in London that you wo n't miss him for a pupil . ''
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 12]: `` On the contrary , I have not a single engagement .
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 16]: If you could find me one , I should be exceedingly obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 3]: `` Dear !
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 2]: dear !
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 3]: dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 4]: said Mrs. Elton .
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 8]: `` Then you shall have Harry . ''
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 12]: yes ; please take me , '' said Harry , beseechingly .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 7]: `` No , I can not .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 5]: I must not . ''
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 6]: Mrs. Elton rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 15]: `` James , tell the coachman I want the carriage in an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 62]: Mrs. Elton was as submissive to her coachman as ladies who have carriages generally are , and would not have dreamed of ordering the horses out so soon again for herself ; but she forgot everything else when a friend was in need of help , and became perfectly pachydermatous to the offended looks or indignant hints of that important functionary .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 45]: Within a few minutes after Hugh took his leave , Mrs. Elton was on her way to repeat a visit she had already paid the same morning , and to make several other calls , with the express object of finding pupils for Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 13]: But in this she was not so successful as she had expected .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 17]: In fact , no one whom she could think of , wanted such services at present .
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 23]: She returned home quite down-hearted , and all but convinced that nothing could be done before the approach of the London season .
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 2]: STRIFE .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 33]: They 'll turn me in your arms , Janet , An adder and a snake ; But haud me fast , let me not pass , Gin ye would be my maik .
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 32]: They 'll turn me in your arms , Janet , An adder and an aske ; They 'll turn me in your arms , Janet , A bale that burns fast .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 46]: They 'll shape me in your arms , Janet , A dove , but and a swan ; And last , they 'll shape me in your arms A mother-naked man : Cast your green mantle over me -- And sae shall I be wan .
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 5]: Scotch Ballad : Tamlane .
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 14]: As soon as Hugh had left the house , Margaret hastened to Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 18]: She found her in her own room , a little more cheerful , but still strangely depressed .
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 22]: This appearance increased towards the evening , till her looks became quite haggard , revealing an inward conflict of growing agony .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 5]: Margaret remained with her .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 23]: Just before dinner , the upstairs bell , whose summons Margaret was accustomed to obey , rang , and she went down .
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 9]: Mrs. Elton detained her for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 18]: The moment she was at liberty , she flew to Euphra 's room by the back staircase .
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 28]: But , as she ascended , she was horrified to meet Euphra , in a cloak and thick veil , creeping down the stairs like a thief .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 29]: Without saying a word , the strong girl lifted her in her arms as if she had been a child , and carried her back to her room .
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 6]: Euphra neither struggled nor spoke .
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 13]: Margaret laid her on her couch , and sat down beside her .
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 35]: She lay without moving , and , although wide awake , gave no other sign of existence than an occasional low moan , that seemed to come from a heart pressed almost to death .
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 12]: Having lain thus for an hour , she broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 10]: `` Margaret , do you despise me dreadfully ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 9]: `` No , not in the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 15]: `` Yet you found me going to do what I knew was wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 15]: `` You had not made yourself strong by thinking about the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 6]: Had you , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 8]: I will tell you how it was .
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 30]: I had been tormented with the inclination to go to him , and had been resisting it till I was worn out , and could hardly bear it more .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 17]: Suddenly all grew calm within me , and I seemed to hate Count Halkar no longer .
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 28]: I thought with myself how easy it would be to put a stop to this dreadful torment , just by yielding to it -- only this once .
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 34]: I thought I should then be stronger to resist the next time ; for this was wearing me out so , that I must yield the next time , if I persisted now .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 45]: But what seemed to justify me , was the thought that so I should find out where he was , and be able to tell Hugh ; and then he would get the ring for me , and , perhaps that would deliver me .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 8]: But it was very wrong of me .
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 9]: I forgot all about the will of God .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 8]: I will not go again , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 12]: Do you think I may try again to fight him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 9]: `` That is just what you must do .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 12]: All that God requires of you is , to try again .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 7]: God 's child must be free .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 8]: Do try , dear Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 13]: `` I think I could , if you would call me Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 13]: You are so strong , and pure , and good , Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 18]: I wish I had never had any thoughts but such as you have , you beautiful creature !
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 11]: Oh , how glad I am that you found me !
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 6]: Do watch me always . ''
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 7]: `` I will call you Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 18]: I will be your sister-servant -- anything you like , if you will only try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 13]: `` Thank you , with all my troubled heart , dear Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 7]: I will indeed try again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 37]: She sprang from the couch in a sudden agony , and grasping Margaret by the arm , looked at her with such a terror-stricken face , that she began to fear she was losing her reason .
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 45]: `` Margaret , '' she said , as if with the voice as of one just raised from the dead , speaking with all the charnel damps in her throat , `` could it be that I am in love with him still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 10]: Margaret shuddered , but did not lose her self-possession .
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 9]: `` No , no , Euphra , darling .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 20]: You were haunted with him , and so tired that you were not able to hate him any longer .
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 9]: Then you began to give way to him .
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 8]: There was no love in that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 5]: Euphra 's grasp relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 7]: `` Do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 4]: A pause followed .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 13]: `` Do you think God cares to have me do his will ?
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 7]: Is it anything to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 7]: `` I am sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 7]: Why did he make you else ?
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 31]: But it is not for the sake of being obeyed that he cares for it , but for the sake of serving you and making you blessed with his blessedness .
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 12]: He does not think about himself , but about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 5]: `` Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 4]: oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 6]: I must not go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 11]: `` Let me read to you again , Eupra . ''
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 9]: `` Yes , please do , Margaret . ''
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 48]: She read the fortieth chapter of Isaiah , one of her father 's favourite chapters , where all the strength and knowledge of God are urged to a height , that they may fall in overwhelming profusion upon the wants and fears and unbelief of his children .
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 14]: How should he that calleth the stars by their names forget his people ?
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 27]: While she read , the cloud melted away from Euphra 's face ; a sweet sleep followed ; and the paroxysm was over for the time .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 4]: Was Euphra insane ?
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 25]: and were these the first accesses of daily fits of madness , which had been growing and approaching for who could tell how long ?
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 20]: Even if she were mad , or going mad , was not this the right way to treat her ?
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 30]: I wonder how often the spiritual cure of faith in the Son of Man , the Great Healer , has been tried on those possessed with our modern demons .
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 27]: Is it proved that insanity has its origin in the physical disorder which , it is now said , can be shown to accompany it invariably ?
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 140]: Let it be so : it yet appears to me that if the physician would , like the Son of Man himself , descend as it were into the disorganized world in which the consciousness of his patient exists , and receiving as fact all that he reveals to him of its condition -- for fact it is , of a very real sort -- introduce , by all the means that sympathy can suggest , the one central cure for evil , spiritual and material , namely , the truth of the Son of Man , the vision of the perfect friend and helper , with the revelation of the promised liberty of obedience -- if he did this , it seems to me that cures might still be wrought as marvellous as those of the ancient time .
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 110]: It seems to me , too , that that can be but an imperfect religion , as it would be a poor salvation , from which one corner of darkness may hide us ; from whose blessed health and freedom a disordered brain may snatch us ; making us hopeless outcasts , till first the physician , the student of physical laws , shall interfere and restore us to a sound mind , or the great God 's - angel Death crumble the soul-oppressing brain , with its thousand phantoms of pain and fear and horror , into a film of dust in the hollow of the deserted skull .
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 24]: Hugh repaired immediately to Falconer 's chambers , where he was more likely to find him during the day than in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 5]: He was at home .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 20]: He told him of his interview with Euphra , and her feeling that the count was not far off .
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 12]: `` Do you think there can be anything in it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 10]: asked he , when he had finished his relation .
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 11]: `` I think very likely , '' answered his friend .
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 11]: `` I will be more on the outlook than ever .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 18]: It may , after all , be through the lady herself that we shall find the villain .
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 24]: If she were to fall into one of her trances , now , I think it almost certain she would go to him .
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 15]: She ought to be carefully watched and followed , if that should take place .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 10]: Let me know all that you learn about her .
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 28]: Go and see her again to-morrow , that we may be kept informed of her experiences , so far as she thinks proper to tell them . ''
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 13]: `` I will , '' said Hugh , and took his leave .
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 47]: But Margaret , who knew Euphra 's condition , both spiritual and physical , better than any other , had far different objects for her , through means of the unholy attraction which the count exercised over her , than the discovery of the stolen ring .
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 20]: She was determined that neither sleeping nor waking should she follow his call , or dance to his piping .
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 34]: She should resist to the last , in the name of God , and so redeem her lost will from the power of this devil , to whom she had foolishly sold it .
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 44]: The next day , the struggle evidently continued ; and it had such an effect on Euphra , that Margaret could not help feeling very anxious about the result as regarded her health , even if she should be victorious in the contest .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 30]: But not for one moment did Margaret quail ; for she felt convinced , come of it what might , that the only hope for Euphra lay in resistance .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 19]: Death , to her mind , was simply nothing in the balance with slavery of such a sort .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 22]: Once -- but evidently in a fit of absence -- Euphra rose , went to the door , and opened it .
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 20]: But she instantly dashed it to again , and walking slowly back , resumed her seat on the couch .
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 37]: Margaret came to her from the other side of the bed , where she had been working by the window , for the last quarter of an hour , for the sake of the waning light .
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 8]: `` What is it , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 5]: `` Oh , Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 4]: are you there ?
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 10]: I did not know you were in the room .
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 15]: I found myself at the door before I knew what I was doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 11]: `` But you came back of yourself this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 5]: `` Yes I did .
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 9]: But I still feel inclined to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 24]: `` There is no sin in that , so long as you do not encourage the feeling , or yield to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 6]: `` I hate it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 9]: `` You will soon be free from it .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 7]: Keep on courageously , dear sister .
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 10]: You will be in liberty and joy soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 6]: `` God grant it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 6]: `` He will , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 7]: I am sure he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 15]: `` I am sure you know , or you would not say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 8]: A knock came to the street door .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 13]: Euphra started , and sat in the attitude of a fearful listener .
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 21]: A message was presently brought her , that Mr. Sutherland was in the drawing-room , and wished to see her .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 9]: Euphra rose immediately , and went to him .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 35]: Margaret , who did not quite feel that she could be trusted yet , removed to a room behind the drawing-room , whence she could see Euphra if she passed to go down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 14]: Hugh asked her if she could tell him anything more about Count Halkar .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 20]: `` Only , '' she answered , `` that I am still surer of his being near me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 8]: `` How do you know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 25]: `` I need not mind telling you , for I have told you before that he has a kind of supernatural power over me .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 10]: I know it by his drawing me towards him .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 38]: It is true I might feel it just the same whether he was in America or in London ; but I do not think he would care to do it , if he were so far off .
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 23]: I know him well enough to know that he would not wish for me except for some immediate advantage to himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 24]: `` But what is the use of his doing so , when you do n't know where he is to be found . ''
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 16]: `` I should go straight to him , without knowing where I was going . ''
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 5]: Hugh rose in haste .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 13]: `` Put on your bonnet and cloak , and come with me .
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 7]: I will take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 17]: Lead me to him , and the ring shall soon be in your hands again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 11]: Euphra hesitated , half rose , but sat down immediately .
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 8]: Not for worlds , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 6]: `` Do not tempt me .
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 14]: I must not -- I dare not -- I will not go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 8]: `` But I shall be with you .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 7]: I will take care of you .
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 11]: Do n't you think I am able , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 3]: quite able .
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 13]: But I must not go anywhere at that man 's bidding . ''
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 17]: `` But it wo n't be at his bidding : it will be at mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 10]: that alters the case rather , does it not ?
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 8]: I wonder what Margaret would say . ''
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 3]: `` Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 4]: What Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 11]: my new maid , '' answered Euphra , recollecting herself .
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 13]: `` Not being well at present , she is my nurse . ''
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 16]: `` We shall take a cab as soon as we get to the corner . ''
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 23]: `` I do n't think the count would be able to guide the horse , '' said Euphra , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 5]: `` I must walk .
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 7]: But I should like to go .
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 3]: I will .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 15]: It would be such a victory to catch him in his own toils . ''
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 7]: She rose and ran up stairs .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 13]: In a few minutes she came down again , cloaked and veiled .
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 26]: But Margaret met her as she descended , and leading her into the back drawing-room , said : `` Are you going , Euphra ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 20]: `` Yes ; but I am going with Mr. Sutherland , '' answered Euphra , in a defensive tone .
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 15]: `` It is to please him , and not to obey the count . ''
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 12]: `` Are you sure it is all to please Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 17]: If it were , I do n't think you would be able to guide him right .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 16]: Is it not to get rid of your suffering by yielding to temptation , Euphra ?
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 36]: At all events , if you go , even should Mr. Sutherland be successful with him , you will never feel that you have overcome him , or he , that he has lost you .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 7]: He will still hold you fast .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 4]: Do n't go .
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 9]: I am sure you are deceiving yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 12]: Euphra stood for a moment and pouted like a naughty child .
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 25]: Then suddenly throwing her arms about Margaret 's neck , she kissed her , and said : `` I wo n't go , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 11]: Here , take my things up stairs for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 15]: She threw off her bonnet and cloak , and rejoined Hugh in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 10]: `` I ca n't go , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 6]: `` I must not go .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 20]: I should be yielding to him , and it would make a slave of me all my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 14]: `` It is our only chance for the ring , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 11]: Again Euphra hesitated and wavered ; but again she conquered .
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 11]: `` I can not help it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 18]: `` I would rather not have the ring than go -- if you will forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 6]: `` Oh , Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 3]: replied Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 10]: `` You know it is not for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 6]: `` I do know it .
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 12]: You wo n't mind then if I do n't go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 12]: `` Certainly not , if you have made up your mind .
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 10]: You must have a good reason for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 6]: `` Indeed I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 12]: And even already she felt that resistance brought its own reward .
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 24]: Hugh went almost immediately , in order to make his report to Falconer , with whom he had an appointment for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 10]: `` She is quite right , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 23]: `` I do not think , in the relation in which she stands to him , that she could safely do otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 19]: But it seems to me very likely that this will turn out well for our plans , too .
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 41]: Let her persist , and in all probability he will not only have to resign her perforce , but will so far make himself subject to her in turn , as to seek her who will not go to him .
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 20]: He will pull upon his own rope till he is drawn to the spot where he has fixed it .
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 21]: What remains for you and me to do , is to keep a close watch on the house and neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 11]: Most likely we shall find the villain before long . ''
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 8]: `` Do you really think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 32]: `` The whole affair is mysterious , and has to do with laws with which we are most imperfectly acquainted ; but this seems to me a presumption worth acting upon .
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 22]: Is there no one in the house on whom you could depend for assistance -- for information , at least ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 15]: There is the same old servant that Mrs. Elton had with her at Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 16]: He is a steady old fellow , and has been very friendly with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 57]: `` Well , what I would advise is , that you should find yourself quarters as near the spot as possible ; and , besides keeping as much of a personal guard upon the house as you can , engage the servant you mention to let you know , the moment the count makes his appearance .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 32]: It will probably be towards night when he calls , for such a man may have reasons as well as instincts to make him love the darkness rather than the light .
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 32]: You had better go at once ; and when you have found a place , leave or send the address here to me , and towards night-fall I will join you .
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 10]: But we may have to watch for several days .
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 8]: We must not be too sanguine . ''
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 13]: Almost without a word , Hugh went to do as Falconer said .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 29]: The only place he could find suitable , was a public-house at the corner of a back street , where the men-servants of the neighbourhood used to resort .
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 23]: He succeeded in securing a private room in it , for a week , and immediately sent Falconer word of his locality .
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 18]: He then called a second time at Mrs. Elton 's , and asked to see the butler .
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 21]: When he came : `` Irwan , '' said he , `` has Herr von Funkelstein called here to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 10]: `` No , sir , he has not . ''
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 11]: `` You would know him , would you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 8]: `` Yes , sir ; perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 32]: `` Well , if he should call to-night , or to-morrow , or any time within the next few days , let me know the moment he is in the house .
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 13]: You will find me at the Golden Staff , round the corner .
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 14]: It is of the utmost importance that I should see him at once .
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 14]: But do not let him know that any one wants to see him .
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 10]: You shall not repent helping me in this affair .
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 8]: I know I can trust you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 16]: Hugh had fixed him with his eyes , before he began to explain his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 45]: He had found out that this was the best way of securing attention from inferior natures , and that it was especially necessary with London servants ; for their superciliousness is cowed by it , and the superior will brought to bear upon theirs .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 17]: It is the only way a man without a carriage has to command attention from such .
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 8]: Irwan was not one of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 10]: He was a country servant , for one difference .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 10]: But Hugh made his address as impressive as possible .
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 20]: `` I will with pleasure , sir , '' answered Irwan , and Hugh felt tolerably sure of him .
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 3]: Falconer came .
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 11]: They ordered some supper , and sat till eleven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 14]: There being then no chance of a summons , they went out together .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 13]: Passing the house , they saw light in one upper window only .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 16]: That light would burn there all night , for it was in Euphra 's room .
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 23]: They went on , Hugh accompanying Falconer in one of his midnight walks through London , as he had done repeatedly before .
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 40]: From such companionship and the scenes to which Falconer introduced him , he had gathered this fruit , that he began to believe in God for the sake of the wretched men and women he saw in the world .
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 37]: At first it was his own pain at the sight of such misery that drove him , for consolation , to hope in God ; so , at first , it was for his own sake .
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 38]: But as he saw more of them , and grew to love them more , he felt that the only hope for them lay in the love of God ; and he hoped in God for them .
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 31]: He saw too that a God not both humanly and absolutely divine , a God less than that God shadowed forth in the Redeemer of men , would not do .
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 22]: But thinking about God thus , and hoping in him for his brothers and sisters , he began to love God .
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 58]: Then , last of all , that he might see in him one to whom he could abandon everything , that he might see him perfect and all in all and as he must be -- for the sake of God himself , he believed in him as the Saviour of these his sinful and suffering kin .
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 17]: As early as was at all excusable , the following morning , he called on Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 19]: The butler said that she had not come down yet , but he would send up his name .
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 31]: A message was brought back that Miss Cameron was sorry not to see him , but she had had a bad night , and was quite unable to get up .
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 13]: Irwan replied to his inquiry , that the count had not called .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 7]: Hugh withdrew to the Golden Staff .
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 8]: A bad night it had been indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 33]: As Euphra slept well the first part of it , and had no attack such as she had had upon both the preceding nights , Margaret had hoped the worst was over .
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 18]: Still she laid herself only within the threshold of sleep ready to wake at the least motion .
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 11]: In the middle of the night she felt Euphra move .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 10]: She lay still to see what she would do .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 34]: Euphra slipped out of bed , and partly dressed herself ; then went to her wardrobe , and put on a cloak with a large hood , which she drew over her head .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 10]: Margaret lay with a dreadful aching at her heart .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 6]: Euphra went towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 10]: Margaret called her , but she made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 12]: Margaret flew to the door , and reached it before her .
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 16]: Then , to her intense delight , she saw that Euphra 's eyes were closed .
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 18]: Just as she laid her hand on the door , Margaret took her gently in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 10]: `` Let me go , let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 4]: Euphra almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 22]: Then suddenly opening her eyes , she stared at Margaret in a bewildered fashion , like one waking from the dead .
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 3]: `` Euphra !
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 4]: dear Euphra ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 3]: said Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 5]: `` Oh , Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 6]: is it really you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 9]: exclaimed Euphra , flinging her arms about her .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 7]: `` Oh , I am glad .
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 9]: you see what I must have been about .
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 17]: I suppose I knew when I was doing it , but I do n't know now .
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 7]: I have forgotten all about it .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 3]: Oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 3]: oh dear !
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 9]: I thought it would come to this . ''
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 7]: `` Come to bed , dear .
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 6]: You could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 5]: It was not yourself .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 18]: There is not more than half of you awake , when you walk in your sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 5]: They went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 12]: Euphra crept close to Margaret , and cried herself asleep again .
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 9]: The next day she had a bad head-ache .
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 7]: This with her always followed somnambulation .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 9]: She did not get up all that day .
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 19]: When Hugh called again in the evening , he heard she was better , but still in bed .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 20]: Falconer joined Hugh at the Golden Staff , at night ; but they had no better success than before .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 13]: Falconer went out alone , for Hugh wanted to keep himself fresh .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 26]: Though very strong , he was younger and less hardened than Falconer , who could stand an incredible amount of labour and lack of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 9]: Hugh would have given way under the half .
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 50]: VICTORY O my admired mistress , quench not out The holy fires within you , though temptations Shower down upon you : clasp thine armour on ; Fight well , and thou shalt see , after these wars , Thy head wear sunbeams , and thy feet touch stars .
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 2]: MASSINGER .
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 5]: -- The Virgin Martyr .
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 15]: But Hugh could sleep no more than if he had been out with Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 12]: He was as restless as a wild beast in a cage .
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 9]: Something would not let him be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 10]: So he rose , dressed , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 16]: As soon as he turned the corner , he could see Mrs. Elton 's house .
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 22]: It was visible both by intermittent moonlight above , and by flickering gaslight below , for the wind blew rather strong .
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 10]: There was snow in the air , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 12]: The light they had observed last night , was burning now .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 38]: A moment served to make these observations ; and then Hugh 's eyes were arrested by the sight of something else -- a man walking up and down the pavement in front of Mrs. Elton 's house .
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 13]: He instantly stepped into the shadow of a porch to watch him .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 18]: The figure might be the count 's ; it might not ; he could not be sure .
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 12]: Every now and then the man looked up to the windows .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 14]: At length he stopped right under the lighted one , and looked up .
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 50]: Hugh was on the point of gliding out , that he might get as near him as possible before rushing on him , when , at the moment , to his great mortification , a policeman emerged from some mysterious corner , and the figure instantly vanished in another .
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 52]: Hugh did not pursue him ; because it would be to set all on a single chance , and that a poor one ; for if the count , should it be he , succeeded in escaping , he would not return to a spot which he knew to be watched .
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 14]: Hugh , therefore , withdrew once more under a porch , and waited .
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 16]: But , whatever might be the cause , the man made his appearance no more .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 15]: Hugh contrived to keep watch for two hours , in spite of suspicious policemen .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 8]: He slept late into the following morning .
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 36]: Calling at Mrs. Elton 's , he learned that the count had not been there ; that Miss Cameron had been very ill all night ; but that she was rather better since the morning .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 12]: That night , as the preceding , Margaret had awaked suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 9]: Euphra was not in the bed beside her .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 19]: She started up in an agony of terror ; but it was soon allayed , though not removed .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 18]: She saw Euphra on her knees at the foot of the bed , an old-fashioned four-post one .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 43]: She had her arms twined round one of the bed-posts , and her head thrown back , as if some one were pulling her backwards by her hair , which fell over her night-dress to the floor in thick , black masses .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 27]: Her eyes were closed ; her face was death-like , almost livid ; and the cold dews of torture were rolling down from brow to chin .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 32]: Her lips were moving convulsively , with now and then the appearance of an attempt at articulation , as if they were set in motion by an agony of inward prayer .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 15]: Margaret , unable to move , watched her with anxious sympathy and fearful expectation .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 16]: How long this lasted she could not tell , but it seemed a long time .
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 54]: At length Margaret rose , and longing to have some share in the struggle , however small , went softly , and stood behind her , shadowing her from a feeble ray of moonlight which , through a wind-rent cloud , had stolen into the room , and lay upon her upturned face .
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 9]: There she lifted up her heart in prayer .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 41]: In a moment after the tension of Euphra 's countenance relaxed a little ; composure slowly followed ; her head gradually rose , so that Margaret could see her face no longer ; then , as gradually , drooped forward .
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 16]: Next her arms untwined themselves from the bed-post , and her hands clasped themselves together .
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 13]: She looked like one praying in the intense silence of absorbing devotion .
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 7]: Margaret stood still as a statue .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 35]: In speaking about it afterwards to Hugh , Margaret told him that she distinctly remembered hearing , while she stood , the measured steps of a policeman pass the house on the pavement below .
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 18]: In a few minutes Euphra bowed her head yet lower , and then rose to her feet .
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 14]: She turned round towards Margaret , as if she knew she was there .
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 11]: To Margaret 's astonishment , her eyes were wide open .
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 26]: She smiled a most child-like , peaceful , happy smile , and said : `` It is over , Margaret , all over at last .
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 8]: Thank you , with my whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 6]: God has helped me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 24]: At that moment , the moon shone out full , and her face appeared in its light like the face of an angel .
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 7]: Margaret looked on her with awe .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 18]: Fear , distress , and doubt had vanished , and she was already beautiful like the blessed .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 14]: Margaret got a handkerchief , and wiped the cold damps from her face .
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 20]: Then she helped her into bed , where she fell asleep almost instantly , and slept like a child .
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 22]: Now and then she moaned ; but when Margaret looked at her , she saw the smile still upon her countenance .
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 9]: She woke weak and worn , but happy .
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 16]: `` I shall not trouble you to-day , Margaret , dear , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 17]: `` I shall not get up yet , but you will not need to watch me .
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 8]: A great change has passed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 4]: I am free .
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 5]: I have overcome him .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 8]: He may do as he pleases now .
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 5]: I do not care .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 4]: I defy him .
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 47]: I got up last night in my sleep , but I remember all about it ; and , although I was asleep , and felt powerless like a corpse , I resisted him , even when I thought he was dragging me away by bodily force .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 11]: And I resisted him , till he left me alone .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 4]: Thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 12]: It had been a terrible struggle , but she had overcome .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 19]: Nor was this all : she would no more lead two lives , the waking and the sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 26]: Her waking will and conscience had asserted themselves in her sleeping acts ; and the memory of the somnambulist lived still in the waking woman .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 20]: Hence her two lives were blended into one life ; and she was no more two , but one .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 9]: This indicated a mighty growth of individual being .
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 13]: `` I woke without terror , '' she went on to say .
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 17]: `` I always used to wake from such a sleep in an agony of unknown fear .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 14]: I do not think I shall ever walk in my sleep again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 29]: Is not salvation the uniting of all our nature into one harmonious whole -- God first in us , ourselves last , and all in due order between ?
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 46]: Something very much analogous to the change in Euphra takes place in a man when he first learns that his beliefs must become acts ; that his religious life and his human life are one ; that he must do the thing that he admires .
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 52]: The Ideal is the only absolute Real ; and it must become the Real in the individual life as well , however impossible they may count it who never try it , or who do not trust in God to effect it , when they find themselves baffled in the attempt .
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 16]: In the afternoon , Euphra fell asleep , and when she woke , seemed better .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 18]: She said to Margaret : `` Can it be that it was all a dream , Margaret ?
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 9]: I mean my association with that dreadful man .
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 24]: I feel as if it were only some horrid dream , and that I could never have had anything to do with him .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 31]: I may have been out of my mind , you know , and have told you things which I believed firmly enough then , but which never really took place .
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 13]: It could not have been me , Margaret , could it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 13]: `` Not your real , true , best self , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 10]: `` I have been a dreadful creature , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 43]: But I feel that all that has melted away from me , and gone behind the sunset , which will for ever stand , in all its glory and loveliness , between me and it , an impassable rampart of defence . ''
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 16]: Her words sounded strange and excited , but her eye and her pulse were calm .
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 14]: `` How could he ever have had that hateful power over me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 21]: `` Do n't think any more about him , dear , but enjoy the rest God has given you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 8]: `` I will , I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 19]: At that moment , a maid came to the door , with Funkelstein 's card for Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 14]: `` Very well , '' said Margaret ; `` ask him to wait .
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 6]: I will tell Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 9]: She may wish to send him a message .
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 5]: You may go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 11]: She told Euphra that the count was in the house .
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 11]: Euphra showed no surprise , no fear , no annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 52]: `` Will you see him for me , Margaret , if you do n't mind ; and tell him from me , that I defy him ; that I do not hate him , only because I despise and forget him ; that I challenge him to do his worst . ''
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 8]: She had forgotten all about the ring .
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 5]: But Margaret had not .
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 13]: `` I will , '' said she , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 16]: On her way down , she went into the drawing-room , and rang the bell .
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 10]: `` Send Mr. Irwan to me here , please .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 7]: It is for Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 17]: The man went , but presently returned , saying that the butler had just stepped out .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 7]: You will do just as well .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 14]: When the gentleman leaves who is calling now , you must follow him .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 22]: Take a cab , if necessary , and follow him everywhere , till you find where he stops for the night .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 12]: Watch the place , and send me word where you are .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 7]: But do n't let him know .
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 14]: Put on plain clothes , please , as fast as you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 8]: `` Yes , Miss , directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 8]: The servants all called Margaret , Miss. .
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 12]: She lingered yet a little , to give the man time .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 18]: She was not at all satisfied with her plan , but she could think of nothing better .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 7]: Happily , it was not necessary .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 17]: Irwan had run as fast as his old legs would carry him to the Golden Staff .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 7]: Hugh received the news with delight .
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 36]: His heart seemed to leap into his throat , and he felt just as he did , when , deer-stalking for the first time , he tried to take aim at a great red stag .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 10]: `` I shall wait for him outside the door .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 9]: We must have no noise in the house .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 11]: He is a thief , or worse , Irwan . ''
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 15]: And there 's the plate all laid out for dinner on the sideboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 12]: exclaimed Irwan , and hurried off faster than he had come .
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 15]: But Hugh was standing at the door long before Irwan got up to it .
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 18]: Had Margaret known who was watching outside , it would have been a wonderful relief to her .
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 11]: She entered the dining-room , where the count stood impatient .
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 22]: He advanced quickly , acting on his expectation of Euphra , but seeing his mistake , stopped , and bowed politely .
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 19]: Margaret told him that Miss Cameron was ill , and gave him her message , word for word .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 9]: The count turned pale with mortification and rage .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 34]: He bit his lip , made no reply , and walked out into the hall , where Irwan stood with the handle of the door in his hand , impatient to open it .
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 37]: No sooner was he out of the house , than Hugh sprang upon him ; but the count , who had been perfectly upon his guard , eluded him , and darted off down the street .
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 11]: Hugh pursued at full speed , mortified at his escape .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 60]: He had no fear at first of overtaking him , for he had found few men his equals in speed and endurance ; but he soon saw , to his dismay , that the count was increasing the distance between them , and feared that , by a sudden turn into some labyrinth , he might escape him altogether .
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 33]: They passed the Golden Staff at full speed , and at the next corner Hugh discovered what gave the count the advantage : it was his agility and recklessness in turning corners .
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 38]: But , like the sorcerer 's impunity , they failed him at last ; for , at the next turn , he ran full upon Falconer , who staggered back , while the count reeled and fell .
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 8]: Hugh was upon him in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 4]: `` Help ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 16]: roared the count , for a last chance from the sympathies of a gathering crowd .
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 7]: `` I 've got him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 3]: cried Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 23]: `` Let the man alone , '' growled a burly fellow in the crowd , with his fists clenched in his trowser-pockets .
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 17]: `` Let me have a look at him , '' said Falconer , stooping over him .
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 6]: I do n't know him .
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 7]: That 's as well for him .
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 7]: Let him up , Sutherland . ''
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 23]: The bystanders took Falconer for a detective , and did not seem inclined to interfere , all except the carman before mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 11]: He came up , pushing the crowd right and left .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 16]: `` Let the man alone , '' said he , in a very offensive tone .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 29]: `` I assure you , '' said Falconer , `` he 's not worth your trouble ; for -- '' `` None o ' your cursed jaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 18]: said the fellow , in a louder and deeper growl , approaching Falconer with a threatening mien .
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 18]: `` Well , I ca n't help it , '' said Falconer , as if to himself .
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 9]: `` Sutherland , look after the count . ''
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 11]: `` That I will , '' said Hugh , confidently .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 36]: Falconer turned on the carman , who was just on the point of closing with him , preferring that mode of fighting ; and saying only : `` Defend yourself , '' retreated a step .
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 27]: The man was good at his fists too , and , having failed in his first attempt , made the best use of them he could .
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 14]: But he had no chance with Falconer , whose coolness equalled his skill .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 47]: Meantime , the Bohemian had been watching his chance ; and although the contest certainly did not last longer than one minute , found opportunity , in the middle of it , to wrench himself free from Hugh , trip him up , and dart off .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 7]: The crowd gave way before him .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 25]: He vanished so suddenly and completely , that it was evident he must have studied the neighbourhood from the retreat side of the question .
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 21]: With rat-like instinct , he had consulted the holes and corners in anticipation of the necessity of applying to them .
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 31]: Hugh got up , and , directed , or possibly misdirected by the bystanders , sped away in pursuit ; but he could hear or see nothing of the fugitive .
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 14]: At the end of the minute , the carman lay in the road .
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 11]: `` Look after him , somebody , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 30]: `` No fear of him , sir ; he 's used to it , '' answered one of the bystanders , with the respect which Falconer 's prowess claimed .
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 19]: Falconer walked after Hugh , who soon returned , looking excessively mortified , and feeling very small indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 10]: `` Never mind , Sutherland , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 18]: `` The fellow is up to a trick or two ; but we shall catch him yet .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 18]: If it had n't been for that big fool there -- but he 's punished enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 8]: `` But what can we do next ?
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 8]: He will not come here again . ''
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 5]: `` Very likely not .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 12]: Still he may not give up his attempts upon Miss Cameron .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 20]: I almost wonder , seeing she is so impressible , that she can give no account of his whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 14]: But I presume clairvoyance depends on the presence of other qualifications as well .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 19]: I should like to mesmerize her myself , and see whether she could not help us then . ''
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 13]: `` Well , why not , if you have the power ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 23]: `` Because I have made up my mind not to superinduce any condition of whose laws I am so very partially informed .
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 42]: Besides , I consider it a condition of disease in which , as by sleeplessness for instance , the senses of the soul , if you will allow the expression , are , for its present state , rendered unnaturally acute .
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 20]: To induce such a condition , I dare not exercise a power which itself I do not understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 2]: MARGARET .
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 60]: For though that ever virtuous was she , She was increased in such excellence , Of thewes good , yset in high bounté , And so discreet and fair of eloquence , So benign , and so digne of reverence , And couthé so the poeple 's hert embrace , That each her loveth that looketh in her face .
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 2]: CHAUCER .
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 6]: -- The Clerk 's Tale .
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 61]: Hugh returned to Mrs. Elton 's , and , in the dining-room , wrote a note to Euphra , to express his disappointment , and shame that , after all , the count had foiled him ; but , at the same time , his determination not to abandon the quest , till there was no room for hope left .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 25]: He sent this up to her , and waited , thinking that she might be on the sofa , and might send for him .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 26]: A little weary from the reaction of the excitement he had just gone through , he sat down in the corner farthest from the door .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 11]: The large room was dimly lighted by one untrimmed lamp .
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 26]: He sat for some time , thinking that Euphra was writing him a note , or perhaps preparing herself to see him in her room .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 23]: Involuntarily he looked up , and a sudden pang , as at the vision of the disembodied , shot through his heart .
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 16]: A dim form stood in the middle of the room , gazing earnestly at him .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 32]: He saw the same face which he had seen for a moment in the library at Arnstead -- the glorified face of Margaret Elginbrod , shimmering faintly in the dull light .
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 23]: Instinctively he pressed his hands together , palm to palm , as if he had been about to kneel before Madonna herself .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 15]: Delight , mingled with hope , and tempered by shame , flushed his face .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 14]: Ghost or none , she brought no fear with her , only awe .
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 4]: She stood still .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 4]: `` Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 7]: he said , with trembling voice .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 5]: `` Mr. Sutherland ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 5]: she responded , sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 9]: `` Are you a ghost , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 23]: She smiled as if she were all spirit , and , advancing slowly , took his joined hands in both of hers .
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 25]: `` Forgive me , Margaret , '' sighed he , as if with his last breath , and burst into an agony of tears .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 15]: She waited motionless , till his passion should subside , still holding his hands .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 9]: He felt that her hands were so good .
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 6]: `` He is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 18]: said Hugh , at last , with all effort , followed by a fresh outburst of weeping .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 13]: `` Yes , he is dead , '' rejoined Margaret , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 25]: `` You would not weep so if you had seen him die as I did -- die with a smile like a summer sunset .
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 22]: Indeed , it was the sunset to me ; but the moon has been up for a long time now . ''
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 15]: She sighed a gentle , painless sigh , and smiled again like a saint .
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 20]: She spoke nearly as Scotch as ever in tone , though the words and pronunciation were almost pure English .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 37]: -- This lapse into so much of the old form , or rather garment , of speech , constantly recurred , as often as her feelings were moved , and especially when she talked to children .
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 11]: `` Forgive me , '' said Hugh , once more .
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 20]: `` We are the same as in the old days , '' answered Margaret ; and Hugh was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 10]: `` How do you come to be here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 10]: said Hugh , at last , after a silence .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 11]: `` I will tell you all about that another time .
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 10]: Now I must give you Miss Cameron 's message .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 16]: She is very sorry she can not see you , but she is quite unable .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 9]: Indeed , she is not out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 21]: But if you could call to-morrow morning , she hopes to be better and to be able to see you .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 10]: She says she can never thank you enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 6]: The lamp burned yet fainter .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 9]: Margaret went , and proceeded to trim it .
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 14]: The virgins that arose must have looked very lovely , trimming their lamps .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 21]: It is a deed very fair and womanly -- the best for a woman -- to make the lamp burn .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 18]: The light shone up in her face , and the hands removing the globe handled it delicately .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 22]: He saw that the good hands were very beautiful hands ; not small , but admirably shaped , and very pure .
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 24]: As she replaced the globe , -- `` That man , '' she said , `` will not trouble her any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 18]: `` I hope not , '' said Hugh ; `` but you speak confidently : why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 7]: `` Because she has behaved gloriously .
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 28]: She has fought and conquered him on his own ground ; and she is a free , beautiful , and good creature of God for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 26]: `` You delight me , '' rejoined Hugh `` Another time , perhaps , you will be able to tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 5]: `` I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 11]: I think she will not mind my telling you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 23]: They bade each other good night ; and Hugh went away with a strange feeling , which he had never experienced before .
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 49]: To compare great things with small , it was something like what he had once felt in a dream , in which , digging in his father 's garden , he had found a perfect marble statue , young as life , and yet old as the hills .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 32]: To think of the girl he had first seen in the drawing-room at Turriepuffit , idealizing herself into such a creature as that , so grand , and yet so womanly !
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 16]: so lofty , and yet so lovely ; so strong , and yet so graceful !
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 32]: Would that every woman believed in the ideal of herself , and hoped for it as the will of God , not merely as the goal of her own purest ambition !
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 33]: But even if the lower development of the hope were all she possessed , it would yet be well ; for its inevitable failure would soon develope the higher and triumphant hope .
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 17]: He thought about her till he fell asleep , and dreamed about her till he woke .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 32]: Not for a moment , however , did he fancy he was in love with her : the feeling was different from any he had hitherto recognized as embodying that passion .
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 80]: It was the recognition and consequent admiration of a beauty which everyone who beheld it must recognize and admire ; but mingled , in his case , with old and precious memories , doubly dear now in the increased earnestness of his nature and aspirations , and with a deep personal interest from the fact that , however little , he had yet contributed a portion of the vital food whereby the gracious creature had become what she was .
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 11]: In the so-called morning he went to Mrs. Elton 's .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 26]: Euphra was expecting his visit , and he was shown up into her room , where she was lying on a couch by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 14]: She received him with the warmth of gratitude added to that of friendship .
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 13]: Her face was pale and thin , but her eyes were brilliant .
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 24]: She did not appear at first sight to be very ill : but the depth and reality of her sickness grew upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 11]: Behind her couch stood Margaret , like a guardian angel .
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 24]: Margaret could bear the day , for she belonged to it ; and therefore she looked more beautiful still than by the lamp-light .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 22]: Euphra held out a pale little hand to Hugh , and before she withdrew it , led Hugh 's towards Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 4]: Their hands joined .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 12]: How different to Hugh was the touch of the two hands !
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 19]: Life , strength , persistency in the one : languor , feebleness , and fading in the other .
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 19]: `` I can never thank you enough , '' said Euphra ; `` therefore I will not try .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 10]: It is no bondage to remain your debtor . ''
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 14]: `` That would be thanks indeed , if I had done anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 16]: `` I have found out another mystery , '' Euphra resumed , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 12]: `` I am sorry to hear it , '' answered he .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 12]: `` I fear there will be no mysteries left by-and-by . ''
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 22]: `` No fear of that , '' she rejoined , `` so long as the angels come down to men . ''
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 9]: And she turned towards Margaret as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 3]: Margaret smiled .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 9]: In the compliment she felt only the kindness .
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 5]: Hugh looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 17]: She turned away , and found something to do at the other side of the room .
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 11]: `` What mystery , then , have you destroyed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 12]: `` Not destroyed it ; for the mystery of courage remains .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 34]: I was the wicked ghost that night in the Ghost 's Walk , you know -- the white one : there is the good ghost , the nun , the black one . ''
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 3]: Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 5]: `` Yes , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 9]: She has just been confessing it to me .
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 26]: I had my two angels , as one whose fate was undetermined ; my evil angel in the count -- my good angel in Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 15]: Little did I think then that the holy powers were watching me in her .
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 13]: I knew the evil one ; I knew nothing of the good .
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 12]: I suppose it is so with a great many people . ''
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 6]: Hugh sat silent in astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 15]: Margaret , then , had been at Arnstead with Mrs. Elton all the time .
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 10]: It was herself he had seen in the study .
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 9]: `` Did you suspect me , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 13]: resumed Euphra , turning towards her where she sat at the window .
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 6]: `` Not in the least .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 46]: I only knew that something was wrong about the house ; that some being was terrifying the servants , and poor Harry ; and I resolved to do my best to meet it , especially if it should be anything of a ghostly kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 10]: `` Then you do believe in such appearances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 3]: said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 11]: `` I have never met anything of the sort yet .
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 6]: I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 8]: `` And you were not afraid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 4]: `` Not much .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 8]: I am never really afraid of anything .
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 6]: Why should I be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 13]: No justification of fear was suggested either by Hugh or by Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 15]: They felt the dignity of nature that lifted Margaret above the region of fear .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 18]: `` Come and see me again soon , '' said Euphra , as Hugh rose to go .
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 3]: He promised .
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 12]: Next day he dined by invitation with Mrs. Elton and Harry .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 21]: Euphra was unable to see him , but sent a kind message by Margaret as he was taking his leave .
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 29]: He had been fearing that he should not see Margaret ; and when she did appear he was the more delighted ; but the interview was necessarily short .
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 13]: He called the next day , and saw neither Euphra nor Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 5]: She was no better .
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 20]: Mrs. Elton said the physicians could discover no definite disease either of the lungs or of any other organ .
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 5]: Yet life seemed sinking .
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 42]: Margaret thought that the conflict which she had passed through , had exhausted her vitality ; that , had she yielded , she might have lived a slave ; but that now , perhaps , she must die a free woman .
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 22]: Her continued illness made Hugh still more anxious to find the ring , for he knew it would please her much .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 28]: Falconer would have applied to the police , but he feared that the man would vanish from London , upon the least suspicion that he was watched .
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 8]: They held many consultations on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 4]: A NEW GUIDE .
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 19]: Das Denken ist nur ein Traum des Fühlens , ein erstorbenes Fühlen , ein blass-graues , schwaches Leben .
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 18]: Thinking is only a dream of feeling ; a dead feeling ; a pale-grey , feeble life .
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 2]: NOVALIS .
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 6]: -- Die Lehrlinge zu Sais .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 13]: For where 's no courage , there 's no ruth nor mone .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 5]: Faerie Queene : vi .
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 4]: 7 , 18 .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 24]: One morning , as soon as she waked , Euphra said : `` Have I been still all the night , Margaret ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 4]: `` Quite still .
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 6]: Why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 25]: `` Because I have had such a strange and vivid dream , that I feel as if I must have been to the place .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 22]: It was a foolish question , though ; because , of course , you would not have let me go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 11]: `` I hope it did not trouble you much . ''
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 36]: `` No , not much ; for though I was with the count , I did not seem to be there in the body at all , only somehow near him , and seeing him .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 8]: I can recall the place perfectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 17]: `` Do you think it really was the place he was in at the time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 6]: `` I should not wonder .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 28]: But now I feel so free , so far beyond him and all his power , that I do n't mind where or when I see him .
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 8]: He can not hurt me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 10]: `` Could you describe the place to Mr. Sutherland ?
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 10]: It might help him to find the count . ''
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 7]: `` That 's a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 7]: Will you send for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 5]: `` Yes , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 8]: May I tell him for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 6]: `` By all means . ''
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 14]: Margaret wrote to Hugh at once , and sent the note by hand .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 8]: He was at home when it arrived .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 11]: He hurriedly answered it , and went to find Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 16]: To his delight he was at home -- not out of bed , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 5]: `` Read that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 7]: `` Who is it from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 7]: `` Miss Cameron 's maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 12]: `` It does not look like a maid 's production . ''
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 5]: `` It is though .
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 6]: Will you come with me ?
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 11]: You know London ten thousand times better than I do .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 12]: I do n't think we ought to lose a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 6]: I will go with you .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 9]: But perhaps she will not see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 14]: yes , she will , when I have told her about you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 13]: `` It will be rather a trial to see a stranger . ''
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 27]: `` A man can not be a stranger with you ten minutes , if he only looks at you ; -- still less a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 7]: Falconer looked pleased , and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 8]: `` I am glad you think so .
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 5]: Let us go . ''
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 9]: When they arrived , Margaret came to them .
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 24]: Hugh told her that Falconer was his best friend , and one who knew London perhaps better than any other man in it .
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 12]: Margaret looked at him full in the face for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 10]: Falconer smiled at the intensity of her still gaze .
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 19]: Margaret returned the smile , and said : `` I will ask Miss Cameron to see ye . ''
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 19]: `` Thank you , '' was all Falconer 's reply ; but the tone was more than speech .
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 14]: After a little while , they were shown up to Euphra 's room .
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 22]: She had wanted to sit up , but Margaret would not let her ; so she was lying on her couch .
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 19]: When Falconer was presented to her , he took her hand , and held it for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 30]: A kind of indescribable beam broke over his face , as if his spirit smiled and the smile shone through without moving one of his features as it passed .
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 7]: The tears stood in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 17]: To understand all this look , one would need to know his history as I do .
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 18]: He laid her hand gently on her bosom , and said : `` God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 12]: Euphra felt that God did bless her in the very words .
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 10]: She had been looking at Falconer all the time .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 39]: It was only fifteen seconds or so ; but the outcome of a life was crowded into Falconer 's side of it ; and the confidence of Euphra rose to meet the faithfulness of a man of God .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 6]: -- What words those are !
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 6]: -- A man of God !
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 7]: Have I not written a revelation ?
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 11]: Yes -- to him who can read it -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 29]: `` I know enough of your story , Miss Cameron , '' he said , `` to understand without any preface what you choose to tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 19]: Euphra began at once : `` I dreamed last night that I found myself outside the street door .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 16]: I did not know where I was going ; but my feet seemed to know .
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 23]: They carried me , round two or three corners , into a wide , long street , which I think was Oxford-street .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 14]: They carried me on into London , far beyond any quarter I knew .
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 74]: All I can tell further is , that I turned to the left beside a church , on the steeple of which stood what I took for a wandering ghost just lighted there ; -- only I ought to tell you , that frequently in my dreams -- always in my peculiar dreams -- the more material and solid and ordinary things are , the more thin and ghostly they appear to me .
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 39]: Then I went on and on , turning left and right too many times for me to remember , till at last I came to a little , old-fashioned court , with two or three trees in it .
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 12]: I had to go up a few steps to enter it .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 20]: I was not afraid , because I knew I was dreaming , and that my body was not there .
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 20]: It is a great relief to feel that sometimes ; for it is often very much in the way .
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 25]: I opened a door , upon which the moon shone very bright , and walked up two flights of stairs into a back room .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 14]: And there I found him , doing something at a table by candlelight .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 22]: He had a sheet of paper before him ; but what he was doing with it , I could not see .
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 11]: I tried hard ; but it was of no use .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 13]: The dream suddenly faded , and I awoke , and found Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 20]: -- Then I knew I was safe , '' she added , with a loving glance at her maid .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 3]: Falconer rose .
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 13]: `` I know the place you mean perfectly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 9]: `` It is too peculiar to be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 13]: Last night , let me see , how did the moon shine ?
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 3]: -- Yes .
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 17]: I shall be able to tell the very door , I think , or almost . ''
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 12]: `` How kind of you not to laugh at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 15]: `` I might make a fool of myself if I laughed at any one .
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 6]: So I generally avoid it .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 26]: We may as well get the good out of what we do not understand -- or at least try if there be any in it .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 7]: Will you come , Sutherland ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 10]: Hugh rose , and took his leave with Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 11]: `` How pleased she seemed with you , Falconer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 9]: said he , as they left the house .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 8]: `` Yes , she touched me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 11]: `` Wo n't you go and see her again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 15]: `` No ; there is no need , except she sends for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 14]: `` It would please her -- comfort her , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 14]: `` She has got one of God 's angels beside her , Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 7]: She does n't want me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 9]: `` I mean that maid of hers . ''
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 9]: A pang -- of jealousy , was it ?
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 7]: -- shot through Hugh 's heart .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 15]: How could he see -- what right had he to see anything in Margaret ?
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 33]: Hugh might have kept himself at peace , even if he had loved Margaret as much as she deserved , which would have been about ten times as much as he did .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 21]: Is a man not to recognize an angel when he sees her , and to call her by her name ?
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 37]: Had Hugh seen into the core of that grand heart -- what form sat there , and how -- he would have been at peace -- would almost have fallen down to do the man homage .
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 4]: He was silent .
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 6]: `` My dear fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 65]: said Falconer , as if he divined his feeling -- for Falconer 's power over men and women came all from sympathy with their spirits , and not their nerves -- `` if you have any hold of that woman , do not lose it ; for as sure as there 's a sun in heaven , she is one of the winged ones .
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 12]: Do n't I know a woman when I see her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 20]: He sighed with a kind of involuntary sigh , which yet did not seek to hide itself from Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 33]: `` My dear boy , '' he added , laying a stress on the word , '' -- I am nearly twice your age -- do n't be jealous of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 13]: `` Mr. Falconer , '' said Hugh humbly , `` forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 32]: The feeling was involuntary ; and if you have detected in it more than I was aware of , you are at least as likely to be right as I am .
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 14]: But you can not think more highly of Margaret than I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 19]: And yet Hugh did not know half the good of her then , that the reader does now .
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 16]: `` Well , we had better part now , and meet again at night . ''
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 10]: `` What time shall I come to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 8]: about nine I think will do . ''
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 46]: So Hugh went home , and tried to turn his thoughts to his story ; but Euphra , Falconer , Funkelstein , and Margaret persisted in sitting to him , the one after the other , instead of the heroes and heroines of his tale .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 18]: He was compelled to lay it aside , and betake himself to a stroll and a pipe .
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 11]: As he went down stairs , he met Miss Talbot .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 11]: `` You 're soon tired of home , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 18]: You have n't been in above half an hour , and you 're out again already . ''
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 17]: `` Why , you see , Miss Talbot , I want a pipe very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 19]: `` Well , you ai n't going to the public house to smoke it , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 8]: `` No , '' answered Hugh laughing .
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 22]: `` But you know , Miss Talbot , you made it part of the agreement that I should n't smoke indoors .
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 11]: So I 'm going to smoke in the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 11]: `` Now , think of being taken that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 9]: retorted Miss Talbot , with an injured air .
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 12]: `` Why , that was before I knew anything about you .
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 26]: Go up stairs directly , and smoke your pipe ; and when the room ca n't hold any more , you can open the windows .
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 11]: Your smoke wo n't do any harm , Mr. Sutherland .
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 11]: But I 'm very sorry you quarrelled with Mrs. Appleditch .
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 35]: She 's a hard woman , and over fond of her money and her drawing-room ; and for those boys of hers -- the Lord have mercy on them , for she has none !
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 22]: But she 's a true Christian for all that , and does a power of good among the poor people . ''
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 11]: `` What does she give them , Miss Talbot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 11]: -- she gives them -- hm-m -- tracts and things .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 22]: You know , '' she added , perceiving the weakness of her position , `` people 's souls should come first .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 37]: And poor Mrs. Appleditch -- you see -- some folks is made stickier than others , and their money sticks to them , somehow , that they ca n't part with it -- poor woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 44]: To this Hugh had no answer at hand ; for though Miss Talbot 's logic was more than questionable , her charity was perfectly sound ; and Hugh felt that he had not been forbearing enough with the mother of the future pastors .
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 34]: So he went back to his room , lighted his pipe , and smoked till he fell asleep over a small volume of morbid modern divinity , which Miss Talbot had lent him .
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 28]: I do not mention the name of the book , lest some of my acquaintance should abuse me , and others it , more than either deserves .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 47]: Hugh , however , found the best refuge from the diseased self-consciousness which it endeavoured to rouse , and which is a kind of spiritual somnambulism , in an hour of God 's good sleep , into a means of which the book was temporarily elevated .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 17]: When he woke he found himself greatly refreshed by the influence it had exercised upon him .
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 14]: It was now the hour for the daily pretence of going to dine .
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 5]: So he went out .
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 16]: But all he had was some bread , which he ate as he walked about .
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 53]: Loitering here , and trifling there , passing five minutes over a volume on every bookstall in Holborn , and comparing the shapes of the meerschaums in every tobacconist 's window , time ambled gently along with him ; and it struck nine just as he found himself at Falconer 's door .
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 8]: `` You are ready , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 3]: said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 4]: `` Quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 9]: `` Will you take anything before you go ?
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 10]: I think we had better have some supper first .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 8]: It is early for our project . ''
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 8]: This was a welcome proposal to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 39]: Cold meat and ale were excellent preparatives for what might be required of him ; for a tendency to collapse in a certain region , called by courtesy the chest , is not favourable to deeds of valour .
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 30]: By the time he had spent ten minutes in the discharge of the agreeable duty suggested , he felt himself ready for anything that might fall to his lot .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 35]: The friends set out together ; and , under the guidance of the two foremost bumps upon Falconer 's forehead , soon arrived at the place he judged to be that indicated by Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 13]: It was very different from the place Hugh had pictured to himself .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 9]: Yet in everything it corresponded to her description .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 30]: `` Are we not great fools , Sutherland , to set out on such a chase , with the dream of a sick girl for our only guide ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 18]: `` I am sure you do n't think so , else you would not have gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 21]: `` I think we can afford the small risk to our reputation involved in the chase of this same wild-goose .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 20]: There is enough of strange testimony about things of the sort to justify us in attending to the hint .
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 31]: Besides , if we neglected it , it would be mortifying to find out some day , perhaps a hundred years after this , that it was a true hint .
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 15]: It is altogether different from giving ourselves up to the pursuit of such things .
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 28]: -- But this ought to be the house , '' he added , going up to one that had a rather more respectable look than the rest .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 6]: He knocked at the door .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 12]: An elderly woman half opened it and looked at them suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 27]: `` Will you take my card to the foreign gentleman who is lodging with you , and say I am happy to wait upon him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 3]: said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 20]: She glanced at him again , and turned inwards , hesitating whether to leave the door half-open or not .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 20]: Falconer stood so close to it , however , that she was afraid to shut it in his face .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 23]: `` Now , Sutherland , follow me , '' whispered Falconer , as soon as the woman had disappeared on the stair .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 23]: Hugh followed behind the moving tower of his friend , who strode with long , noiseless strides till he reached the stair .
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 9]: That he took three steps at a time .
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 26]: They went up two flights , and reached the top just as the woman was laying her hand on the lock of the back-room door .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 6]: She turned and faced them .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 28]: `` Speak one word , '' said Falconer , in a hissing whisper , `` and -- '' He completed the sentence by an awfully threatening gesture .
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 14]: She drew back in terror , and yielded her place at the door .
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 20]: `` Come in , '' bawled some one , in second answer to the knock she had already given .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 6]: `` It is he ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 7]: said Hugh , trembling with excitement .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 7]: said Falconer , and went in .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 3]: Hugh followed .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 10]: He knew the back of the count at once .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 22]: He was seated at a table , apparently writing ; but , going nearer , they saw that he was drawing .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 15]: A single closer glance showed them the portrait of Euphra growing under his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 20]: In order to intensify his will and concentrate it upon her , he was drawing her portrait from memory .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 39]: But at the moment they caught sight of it , the wretch , aware of a hostile presence , sprang to his feet , and reached the chimney-piece at one bound , whence he caught up a sword .
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 16]: `` Take care , Falconer , '' cried Hugh ; `` that weapon is poisoned .
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 12]: He is no every-day villain you have to deal with . ''
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 5]: He remembered the cat .
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 16]: Funkelstein made a sudden lunge at Hugh , his face pale with hatred and anger .
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 24]: But a blow from Falconer 's huge fist , travelling faster than the point of his weapon , stretched him on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 19]: Such was Falconer 's impetus , that it hurled both him and the table across the fallen villain .
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 7]: Falconer was up in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 4]: Not so Funkelstein .
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 26]: There was plenty of time for Hugh to secure the rapier , and for Falconer to secure its owner , before he came to himself .
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 7]: `` Where 's my ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 10]: said Hugh , the moment he opened his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 26]: `` Gentlemen , I protest , '' began Funkelstein , in a voice upon which the cord that bound his wrists had an evident influence .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 5]: `` No chaff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 3]: said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 8]: `` We 've got all our feathers .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 15]: Hand over the two rings , or be the security for them yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 9]: `` What witness have you against me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 10]: `` The best of witnesses -- Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 8]: `` And me , '' added Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 8]: `` Gentlemen , I am very sorry .
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 5]: I yielded to temptation .
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 24]: I meant to restore the diamond after the joke had been played out , but I was forced to part with it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 14]: `` The joke is played out , you see , '' said Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 17]: `` So you had better produce the other bauble you stole at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 8]: `` I have not got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 10]: `` Come , come , that 's too much .
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 11]: Nobody would give you more than five shillings for it .
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 12]: And you knew what it was worth when you took it .
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 12]: Sutherland , you stand over him while I search the room .
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 14]: This portrait may as well be put out of the way first . ''
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 15]: As he spoke , Falconer tore the portrait and threw it into the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 10]: He then turned to a cupboard in the room .
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 18]: Whether it was that Funkelstein feared further revelations , I do not know , but he quailed .
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 13]: `` I have not got it , '' he repeated , however .
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 8]: `` You lie , '' answered Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 11]: `` I would give it you if I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 5]: `` You shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 14]: The Bohemian looked contemptible enough now , despite the handsomeness of his features .
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 19]: It needed freedom , and the absence of any urgency , to enable him to personate a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 7]: Given those conditions , he succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 27]: But as soon as he was disturbed , the gloss vanished , and the true nature came out , that of a ruffian and a sneak .
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 15]: He quite quivered at the look with which Falconer turned again to the cupboard .
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 13]: `` Stop , '' he cried ; `` here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 42]: And muttering what sounded like curses , he pulled out of his bosom the ring , suspended from his neck `` Sutherland , '' said Falconer , taking the ring , `` secure that rapier , and be careful with it .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 7]: We will have its point tested .
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 31]: Meantime , '' -- here he turned again to his prisoner -- `` I give you warning that the moment I leave this house , I go to Scotland Yard .
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 7]: -- Do you know the place ?
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 18]: I there recommend the police to look after you , and they will mind what I say .
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 22]: If you leave London , a message will be sent , wherever you go , that you had better be watched .
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 17]: My advice to you is , to stay where you are as long as you can .
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 7]: I shall meet you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 25]: They left him on the floor , to the care of his landlady , whom they found outside the room , speechless with terror .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 36]: As soon as they were in the square , on which the moon was now shining , as it had shone in Euphra 's dream the night before , Falconer gave the ring to Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 24]: `` Take it to a jeweller 's , Sutherland , and get it cleaned , before you give it to Miss Cameron . ''
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 22]: `` I will , '' answered Hugh , and added , `` I do n't know how to thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 13]: `` Then do n't , '' said Falconer , with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 18]: When they reached the end of the street , he turned , and bade Hugh good night .
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 8]: `` Take care of that cowardly thing .
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 8]: It may be as you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 5]: Hugh turned towards home .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 15]: Falconer dived into a court , and was out of sight in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 4]: THE LAST GROAT .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 57]: Thou hast been As one , in suffering all , that suffers nothing ; A man that fortune 's buffets and rewards Hast ta'en with equal thanks ; and blessed are those Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled That they are not a pipe for fortune 's finger To sound what stop she please .
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 2]: Hamlet .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 9]: Most friends befriend themselves with friendship 's show .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 2]: SOUTHWELL .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 17]: Hugh took the ring to Mrs. Elton 's , and gave it into Margaret 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 12]: She brought him back a message of warmest thanks from Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 23]: She had asked for writing materials at once , and was now communicating the good news to Mr. Arnold , in Madeira .
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 14]: `` I have never seen her look so happy , '' added Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 22]: `` She hopes to be able to see you in the evening , if you would not mind calling again . ''
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 8]: Hugh did call , and saw her .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 6]: She received him most kindly .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 10]: He was distressed to see how altered she was .
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 29]: The fire of one life seemed dying out -- flowing away and spending from her eyes , which it illuminated with too much light as it passed out .
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 43]: But the fire of another life , the immortal life , which lies in thought and feeling , in truth and love divine , which death can not touch , because it is not of his kind , was growing as fast .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 12]: He sat with her for an hour , and then went .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 28]: This chapter of his own history concluded , Hugh returned with fresh energy to his novel , and worked at it as his invention gave him scope .
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 42]: There was the more necessity that he should make progress , from the fact that , having sent his mother the greater part of the salary he had received from Mr. Arnold , he was now reduced to his last sovereign .
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 12]: Poverty looks rather ugly when she comes so close as this .
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 52]: But she had not yet accosted him ; and with a sovereign in his pocket , and last week 's rent paid , a bachelor is certainly not poverty-stricken , at least when he is as independent , not only of other people , but of himself , as Hugh was .
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 33]: Still , without more money than that a man walks in fetters , and is ready to forget that the various restraints he is under are not incompatible with most honourable freedom .
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 19]: So Hugh worked as hard as he could to finish his novel , and succeeded within a week .
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 6]: Then the real anxiety began .
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 17]: He carried it , with much doubtful hope , to one of the principal publishing houses .
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 22]: Had he been more selfishly wise , he would have put it into the hands of Falconer to negotiate for him .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 12]: But he thought he had given him quite trouble enough already .
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 8]: So he went without an introduction even .
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 11]: The manuscript was received politely , and attention was promised .
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 11]: But a week passed , and another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 27]: A human soul was in commotion about the meat that perisheth -- and the manuscript lay all the time unread , -- forgotten in a drawer .
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 8]: At length he reached his last coin .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 19]: He had had no meat for several days , except once that he dined at Mrs. Elton 's .
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 18]: But he would not borrow till absolutely compelled , and sixpence would keep him alive another day .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 31]: In the morning he had some breakfast -LRB- for he knew his books were worth enough to pay all he owed Miss Talbot -RRB- , and then he wandered out .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 49]: Through the streets he paced and paced , looking in at all the silversmiths ' and printsellers ' windows , and solacing his poverty with a favourite amusement of his in uneasy circumstances , an amusement cheap enough for a Scotchman reduced to his last sixpence -- castle-building .
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 36]: This is not altogether a bad employment where hope has laid the foundation ; but it is rather a heartless one where the imagination has to draw the ground plan as well as the elevations .
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 13]: The latter , however , was not quite Hugh 's condition yet .
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 24]: -- He returned at night , carefully avoiding the cook-shops and their kindred snares , with a silver groat in his pocket still .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 25]: But he crawled up stairs rather feebly , it must be confessed , for a youth with limbs moulded in the fashion of his .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 32]: He found a letter waiting him , from a friend of his mother , informing him that she was dangerously ill , and urging him to set off immediately for home .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 47]: This was like the blast of fiery breath from the dragon 's maw , which overthrew the Red-cross knight -- but into the well of life , where all his wounds were healed , and -- and -- well -- board and lodging provided him gratis .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 29]: When he had read the letter , he fell on his knees , and said to his father in heaven : `` What am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 20]: There was no lake with golden pieces in its bottom , whence a fish might bring him a coin .
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 22]: Nor in all the wide London lay there one he could claim as his , but the groat in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 12]: He rose with the simple resolution to go and tell Falconer .
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 3]: He went .
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 6]: He was not at home .
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 25]: Emboldened by necessity , Hugh left his card , with the words on it : `` Come to me ; I need you . ''
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 15]: He then returned , packed a few necessaries , and sat down to wait .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 11]: But he had not sat five minutes before Falconer entered .
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 12]: `` What 's the matter , Sutherland , my dear fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 13]: You have n't pricked yourself with that skewer , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 31]: Hugh handed him the letter with one hand ; and when he had read it , held out the fourpenny piece in the other hand , to be read likewise .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 5]: Falconer understood at once .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 27]: `` Sutherland , '' he said , in a tone of reproof , `` it is a shame of you to forget that men are brothers .
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 27]: Are not two who come out of the heart of God , as closely related as if they had lain in the womb of one mother ?
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 7]: Why did you not tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 11]: You have suffered -- I am sure you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 11]: `` I have -- a little , '' Hugh confessed .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 9]: `` I am getting rather low in fact .
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 10]: I have n't had quite enough to eat . ''
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 20]: He said this to excuse the tears which Falconer 's kindness -- not hunger -- compelled from their cells .
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 40]: `` But , '' he added , `` I would have come to you as soon as the fourpence was gone ; or at least , if I had n't got another before I was very hungry again . ''
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 6]: exclaimed Falconer , half angrily .
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 25]: Then pulling out his watch , `` We have two hours , '' said he , `` before a train starts for the north .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 6]: Come to my place . ''
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 5]: Hugh rose and obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 50]: Falconer 's attendant soon brought them a plentiful supper from a neighbouring shop ; after which Falconer got out one of his bottles of port , well known to his more intimate friends ; and Hugh thought no more about money than if he had had his purse full .
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 26]: If it had not been for anxiety about his mother , he would have been happier than he had ever been in his life before .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 53]: For , crossing in the night the wavering , heaving morass of the world , had he not set his foot upon one spot which did not shake ; the summit , indeed , of a mighty Plutonic rock , that went down widening away to the very centre of the earth ?
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 48]: As he sped along in the railway that night , the prophecy of thousands of years came back : `` A man shall be a hiding-place from the wind , a covert from the tempest , the shadow of a great rock in a weary land . ''
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 20]: And he thought it would be a blessed time indeed , when this was just what a man was .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 27]: And then he thought of the Son of Man , who , by being such first , was enabling all his friends to be such too .
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 48]: Of him Falconer had already learned this `` truth in the inward parts '' ; and had found , in the process of learning it , that this was the true nature which God had made his from the first , no new thing superinduced upon it .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 30]: He had had but to clear away the rubbish of worldliness , which more or less buries the best natures for a time , and so to find himself .
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 34]: After Hugh had eaten and drunk , and thus once more experienced the divinity that lay in food and wine , he went to take leave of his friends at Mrs. Elton 's .
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 17]: Like most invalids , Euphra was better in the evening : she requested to see him .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 15]: He found her in bed , and much wasted since he saw her last .
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 25]: He could not keep the tears from filling his eyes , for all the events of that day had brought them near the surface .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 13]: `` Do not cry , dear friend , '' she said sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 18]: `` There is no room for me here any more , and I am sent for . ''
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 5]: Hugh could not reply .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 23]: She went on : `` I have written to Mr. Arnold about the ring , and all you did to get it .
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 12]: Do you know he is going to marry Lady Emily ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 6]: Still Hugh could not answer .
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 33]: Margaret stood on the other side of the bed , the graceful embodiment of holy health , and in his sorrow , he could not help feeling the beauty of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 20]: Her lovely hands were the servants of Euphra , and her light , firm feet moved only in ministration .
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 15]: He felt that Euphra had room in the world while Margaret waited on her .
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 87]: It is not house , and fire , and plenty of servants , and all the things that money can procure , that make a home -- not father or mother or friends ; but one heart which will not be weary of helping , will not be offended with the petulance of sickness , nor the ministrations needful to weakness : this `` entire affection hating nicer hands '' will make a home of a cave in a rock , or a gipsy 's tent .
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 11]: This Euphra had in Margaret , and Hugh saw it .
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 15]: `` I trust you will find your mother better , Hugh '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 9]: `` I fear not , '' answered he .
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 31]: `` Well , Margaret has been teaching me , and I think I have learned it , that death is not at all such a dreadful thing as it looks .
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 24]: I said to her : ` It is easy for you , Margaret , who are so far from death 's door . '
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 25]: But she told me that she had been all but dead once , and that you had saved her life almost with your own .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 4]: Oh , Hugh !
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 7]: she is such a dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 23]: Euphra smiled with ten times the fascination of any of her old smiles ; for the soul of the smile was love .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 16]: `` I shall never see you again , I daresay , '' she went on .
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 17]: `` My heart thanks you , from its very depths , for your goodness to me .
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 12]: It has been a thousand times more than I deserve . ''
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 17]: Hugh kissed in silence the wasted hand held out to him in adieu , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 10]: And the world itself was a sad wandering star .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 6]: Falconer had called for him .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 26]: They drove to Miss Talbot 's , where Hugh got his ` bag of needments , ' and bade his landlady good-bye for a time .
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 8]: Falconer then accompanied him to the railway .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 28]: Having left him for a moment , Falconer rejoined him , saying : `` I have your ticket ; '' and put him into a first-class carriage .
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 3]: Hugh remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 15]: Falconer replied : `` I find this hulk of mine worth taking care of .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 18]: You will be twice the good to your mother , if you reach her tolerably fresh . ''
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 67]: He stood by the carriage door talking to him , till the train started ; walked alongside till it was fairly in motion ; then , bidding him good-bye , left in his hand a little packet , which Hugh , opening it by the light of the lamp , found to consist of a few sovereigns and a few shillings folded up in a twenty-pound-note .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 11]: I ought to tell one other little fact , however .
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 24]: Just before the engine whistled , Falconer said to Hugh : `` Give me that fourpenny piece , you brave old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 9]: `` There it is , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 9]: `` What do you want it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 21]: `` I am going to make a wedding-present of it to your wife , whoever she may happen to be .
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 10]: I hope she will be worthy of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 17]: Hugh instantly thought within himself : `` What a wife Margaret would make to Falconer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 12]: The thought was followed by a pang , keen and clear .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 34]: Those who are in the habit of regarding the real and the ideal as essentially and therefore irreconcileably opposed , will remark that I can not have drawn the representation of Falconer faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 56]: Perhaps the difficulty they will experience in recognizing its truthfulness , may spring from the fact that they themselves are un-ideal enough to belong to the not small class of strong-minded friends whose chief care , in performing the part of the rock in the weary land , is -- not to shelter you imprudently .
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 73]: They are afraid of weakening your constitution by it , especially if it is not strong to begin with ; so if they do just take off the edge of the tempest with the sharp corners of their sheltering rock for a moment , the next , they will thrust you out into the rain , to get hardy and self-denying , by being wet to the skin and well blown about .
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 21]: The rich easily learn the wisdom of Solomon , but are unapt scholars of him who is greater than Solomon .
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 35]: It is , on the other hand , so easy for the poor to help each other , that they have little merit in it : it is no virtue -- only a beauty .
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 47]: But there are a few rich , who , rivalling the poor in their own peculiar excellences , enter into the kingdom of heaven in spite of their riches ; and then find that by means of their riches they are made rulers over many cities .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 24]: She to whose memory this book is dedicated , is -- I will not say was -- one of the noblest of such .
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 50]: There are two ways of accounting for the difficulty which a reader may find in believing in such a character : either that , not being poor , he has never needed such a friend ; or that , being rich , he has never been such a friend .
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 28]: Or if it be that , being poor , he has never found such a friend ; his difficulty is easy to remove : -- I have .
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 2]: DEATH .
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 50]: Think then , my soul , that death is but a groom Which brings a taper to the outward room , Whence thou spy ` st first a little glimmering light ; And after brings it nearer to thy sight : For such approaches doth heaven make in death .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 3]: DR. DONNE .
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 20]: Hugh found his mother even worse than he had expected ; but she rallied a little after his arrival .
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 13]: In the evening , he wandered out in the bright moonlit snow .
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 19]: How strange it was to see all the old forms with his heart so full of new things !
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 18]: The same hills rose about him , with all the lines of their shapes unchanged in seeming .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 32]: Yet they were changing as surely as himself ; nay , he continued more the same than they ; for in him the old forms were folded up in the new .
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 25]: In the eyes of Him who creates time , there is no rest , but a living sacred change , a journeying towards rest .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 17]: He alone rests ; and he alone , in virtue of his rest , creates change .
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 47]: He thought with sadness , how all the haunts of his childhood would pass to others , who would feel no love or reverence for them ; that the house would be the same , but sounding with new steps , and ringing with new laughter .
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 84]: A little further thought , however , soon satisfied him that places die as well as their dwellers ; that , by slow degrees , their forms are wiped out ; that the new tastes obliterate the old fashions ; and that ere long the very shape of the house and farm would be lapped , as it were , about the tomb of him who had been the soul of the shape , and would vanish from the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 9]: All the old things at home looked sad .
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 34]: The look came from this , that , though he could sympathize with them and their story , they could not sympathize with him , and he suffused them with his own sadness .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 17]: He could find no refuge in the past ; he must go on into the future .
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 11]: His mother lingered for some time without any evident change .
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 11]: He sat by her bedside the most of the day .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 31]: All she wanted was to have him within reach of her feeble voice , that she might , when she pleased , draw him within touch of her feeble hand .
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 16]: Once she said : `` My boy , I am going to your father . ''
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 14]: `` Yes , mother , I think you are , '' Hugh replied .
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 11]: `` How glad he will be to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 9]: `` But I shall leave you alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 8]: `` Mother , I love God . ''
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 38]: The mother looked at him , as only a mother can look , smiled sweetly , closed her eyes as with the weight of her contentment , fell asleep holding his hand , and slept for hours .
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 10]: Meanwhile , in London , Margaret was watching Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 15]: She was dying , and Margaret was the angel of life watching over her .
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 17]: `` I shall get rid of my lameness there , Margaret , shall I not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 9]: said Euphra , one day , half playfully .
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 6]: `` Yes , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 12]: `` It will be delightful to walk again without pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 16]: `` Perhaps you will not get rid of it all at once , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 8]: `` Why do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 9]: asked Euphra , with some appearance of uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 53]: `` Because , if it is taken from you before you are quite willing to have it as long as God pleases , by and by you will not be able to rest , till you have asked for it back again , that you may bear it for his sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 11]: `` I am willing , Margaret , I am willing .
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 11]: Only one ca n't like it , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 9]: `` I know that , '' answered Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 12]: She spoke no more , and Margaret heard her weeping gently .
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 31]: Half an hour had passed away , when she looked up , and said : `` Margaret , dear , I begin to like my lameness , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 6]: `` Why , dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 15]: `` Why , just because God made it , and bade me bear it .
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 15]: May I not think it is a mark on me from his hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 8]: `` Yes , I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 11]: `` Why do you think it came on me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 11]: `` To walk back to Him with , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 11]: `` Yes , yes ; I see it all . ''
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 19]: Until now , Margaret had not known to what a degree the lameness of Euphra had troubled her .
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 35]: That her pretty ankle should be deformed , and her light foot able only to limp , had been a source of real distress to her , even in the midst of far deeper .
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 12]: The days passed on , and every day she grew weaker .
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 14]: She did not suffer much , but nothing seemed to do her good .
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 6]: Mrs. Elton was kindness itself .
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 6]: Harry was in dreadful distress .
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 22]: He haunted her room , creeping in whenever he had a chance , and sitting in corners out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 8]: Euphra liked to have him near her .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 24]: She seldom spoke to him , or to any one but Margaret , for Margaret alone could hear with ease what she said .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 30]: But now and then she would motion him to her bedside , and say -- it was always the same -- `` Harry , dear , be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 18]: `` I will ; indeed I will , dear Euphra , '' was still Harry 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 36]: Once , expressing to Margaret her regret that she should be such a trouble to her , she said : `` You have to do so much for me , that I am ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 33]: `` Do let me wash the feet of one of his disciples ; '' Margaret replied , gently expostulating ; after which , Euphra never grumbled at her own demands upon her .
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 19]: Again , one day , she said : `` I am not right at all to-day , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 12]: God ca n't love me , I am so hateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 13]: `` Do n't measure God 's mind by your own , Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 21]: It would be a poor love that depended not on itself , but on the feelings of the person loved .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 23]: A crying baby turns away from its mother 's breast , but she does not put it away till it stops crying .
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 5]: She holds it closer .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 32]: For my part , in the worst mood I am ever in , when I do n't feel I love God at all , I just look up to his love .
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 10]: I say to him : ` Look at me .
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 7]: See what state I am in .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 4]: Help me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 8]: you would wonder how that makes peace .
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 18]: And the love comes of itself ; sometimes so strong , it nearly breaks my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 12]: `` But there is a text I do n't like . ''
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 7]: `` Take another , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 8]: `` But it will keep coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 13]: `` Give it back to God , and never mind it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 8]: `` But would that be right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 27]: `` One day , when I was a little girl , so high , I could n't eat my porridge , and sat looking at it .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 11]: ` Eat your porridge , ' said my mother . '
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 10]: I do n't want it , ' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 32]: ` There 's nothing else for you , ' said my mother -- for she had not learned so much from my father then , as she did before he died .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 4]: ` Hoots ! '
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 18]: said my father -- I can not , dear Euphra , make his words into English . ''
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 21]: `` No , no , do n't , '' said Euphra ; `` I shall understand them perfectly . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 3]: ` Hoots !
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 6]: Janet , my woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 4]: said my father .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 10]: ` Gie the bairn a dish o ' tay .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 12]: Wadna ye like some tay , Maggy , my doo ? '
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 20]: ` Ay wad I , ' said I. ` The parritch is guid eneuch , '' said my mother .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 23]: ` Nae doot aboot the parritch , woman ; it 's the bairn 's stamack , it 's no the parritch . '
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 27]: My mother said no more , but made me a cup of such nice tea ; for whenever she gave in , she gave in quite .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 29]: I drank it ; and , half from anxiety to please my mother , half from reviving hunger , attacked the porridge next , and ate it up .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 6]: ` Leuk at that ! '
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 4]: said my father .
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 30]: ` Janet , my woman , gie a body the guid that they can tak ' , an ' they 'll sune tak ' the guid that they canna .
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 11]: Ye 're better noo , Maggy , my doo ? '
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 27]: I never told him that I had taken the porridge too soon after all , and had to creep into the wood , and be sick .
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 11]: But it is all the same for the story . ''
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 15]: Euphra laughed a feeble but delighted laugh , and applied the story for herself .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 7]: So the winter days passed on .
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 14]: `` I wish I could live till the spring , '' said Euphra .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 14]: `` I should like to see a snowdrop and a primrose again . ''
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 16]: `` Perhaps you will , dear ; but you are going into a better spring .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 9]: I could almost envy you , Euphra . ''
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 9]: `` But shall we have spring there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 6]: `` I think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 5]: `` And spring-flowers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 11]: `` I think we shall -- better than here . ''
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 10]: `` But they will not mean so much . ''
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 9]: `` Then they wo n't be so good .
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 20]: But I should think they would mean ever so much more , and be ever so much more spring-like .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 15]: They will be the spring-flowers to all winters in one , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 36]: Folded in the love of this woman , anointed for her death by her wisdom , baptized for the new life by her sympathy and its tears , Euphra died in the arms of Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 13]: Margaret wept , fell on her knees , and gave God thanks .
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 49]: Mrs. Elton was so distressed , that , as soon as the funeral was over , she broke up her London household , sending some of the servants home to the country , and taking some to her favourite watering place , to which Harry also accompanied her .
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 38]: She hoped that , now the affair of the ring was cleared up , she might , as soon as Hugh returned , succeed in persuading him to follow them to Devonshire , and resume his tutorship .
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 11]: This would satisfy her anxiety about Hugh and Harry both .
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 10]: Hugh 's mother died too , and was buried .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 29]: When he returned from the grave which now held both father and mother , he found a short note from Margaret , telling him that Euphra was gone .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 40]: Sorrow is easier to bear when it comes upon sorrow ; but he could not help feeling a keen additional pang , when he learned that she was dead whom he had loved once , and now loved better .
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 29]: Margaret 's note informed him likewise that Euphra had left a written request , that her diamond ring should be given to him to wear for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 37]: He prepared to leave the home whence all the homeness had now vanished , except what indeed lingered in the presence of an old nurse , who had remained faithful to his mother to the last .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 46]: The body itself is of little value after the spirit , the love , is out of it : so the house and all the old things are little enough , after the loved ones are gone who kept it alive and made it home .
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 30]: All that Hugh could do for this old nurse was to furnish a cottage for her out of his mother 's furniture , giving her everything she liked best .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 67]: Then he gathered the little household treasures , the few books , the few portraits and ornaments , his father 's sword , and his mother 's wedding-ring ; destroyed with sacred fire all written papers ; sold the remainder of the furniture , which he would gladly have burnt too , and so proceeded to take his last departure from the home of his childhood .
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 5]: NATURE AND HER LADY .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 13]: Die Frauen sind ein liebliches Geheimniss , nur verhüllt , nicht verschlossen .
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 3]: -- NOVALIS .
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 4]: - Moralische Ansichten .
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 14]: Women are a lovely mystery -- veiled , however , not shut up .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 18]: Her twilights were more clear than our mid-day ; She dreamt devoutlier than most used to pray .
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 3]: DR. DONNE .
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 60]: Perhaps the greatest benefit that resulted to Hugh from being thus made a pilgrim and a stranger in the earth , was , that Nature herself saw him , and took him in , Hitherto , as I have already said , Hugh 's acquaintance with Nature had been chiefly a second-hand one -- he knew friends of hers .
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 38]: Nature in poetry -- not in the form of Thomsonian or Cowperian descriptions , good as they are , but closely interwoven with and expository of human thought and feeling -- had long been dear to him .
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 26]: In this form he had believed that he knew her so well , as to be able to reproduce the lineaments of her beloved face .
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 67]: But now she herself appeared to him -- the grand , pure , tender mother , ancient in years , yet ever young ; appeared to him , not in the mirror of a man 's words , but bending over him from the fathomless bosom of the sky , from the outspread arms of the forest-trees , from the silent judgment of the everlasting hills .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 41]: She spoke to him from the depths of air , from the winds that harp upon the boughs , and trumpet upon the great caverns , and from the streams that sing as they go to be lost in rest .
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 56]: She would have shone upon him out of the eyes of her infants , the flowers , but they had their faces turned to her breast now , hiding from the pale blue eyes and the freezing breath of old Winter , who was looking for them with his face bent close to their refuge .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 41]: And he felt that she had a power to heal and to instruct ; yea , that she was a power of life , and could speak to the heart and conscience mighty words about God and Truth and Love .
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 11]: For he did not forsake his dead home in haste .
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 11]: He lingered over it , and roamed about its neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 27]: Regarding all about him with quiet , almost passive spirit , he was astonished to find how his eyes opened to see nature in the mass .
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 10]: Before , he had beheld only portions and beauties .
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 13]: When or how the change passed upon him he could not tell .
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 58]: But he no longer looked for a pretty eyebrow or a lovely lip on the face of nature : the soul of nature looked out upon him from the harmony of all , guiding him unsought to the discovery of a thousand separate delights ; while from the expanded vision new meanings flashed upon him every day .
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 31]: He beheld in the great All the expression of the thoughts and feelings of the maker of the heavens and the earth and the sea and the fountains of water .
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 33]: The powers of the world to come , that is , the world of unseen truth and ideal reality , were upon him in the presence of the world that now is .
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 53]: For the first time in his life , he felt at home with nature ; and while he could moan with the wintry wind , he no longer sighed in the wintry sunshine , that foretold , like the far-off flutter of a herald 's banner , the approach of victorious lady-spring .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 70]: With the sorrow and loneliness of loss within him , and Nature around him seeming to sigh for a fuller expression of the thought that throbbed within her , it is no wonder that the form of Margaret , the gathering of the thousand forms of nature into one intensity and harmony of loveliness , should rise again upon the world of his imagination , to set no more .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 6]: Father and mother were gone .
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 4]: Margaret remained behind .
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 77]: Nature lay around him like a shining disk , that needed a visible centre of intensest light -- a shield of silver , that needed but a diamond boss : Margaret alone could be that centre -- that diamond light-giver ; for she alone , of all the women he knew , seemed so to drink of the sun-rays of God , as to radiate them forth , for very fulness , upon the clouded world .
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 60]: She had dawned on him like a sweet crescent moon , hanging far-off in a cold and low horizon : now , lifting his eyes , he saw that same moon nearly at the full , and high overhead , yet leaning down towards him through the deep blue air , that overflowed with her calm triumph of light .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 8]: He knew that he loved her now .
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 48]: He knew that every place he went through , caught a glimmer of romance the moment he thought of her ; that every most trifling event that happened to himself , looked like a piece of a story-book the moment he thought of telling it to her .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 35]: But the growth of these feelings had been gradual -- so slow and gradual , that when he recognized them , it seemed to him as if he had felt them from the first .
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 24]: The fact was , that as soon as he began to be capable of loving Margaret , he had begun to love her .
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 16]: He had never been able to understand her till he was driven into the desert .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 70]: But now that Nature revealed herself to him full of Life , yea , of the Life of Life , namely , of God himself , it was natural that he should honour and love that ` lady of her own ' ; that he should recognize Margaret as greater than himself , as nearer to the heart of Nature -- yea , of God the father of all .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 27]: She had been one with Nature from childhood , and when he began to be one with nature too , he must become one with her .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 26]: And now , in absence , he began to study the character of her whom , in presence , he had thought he knew perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 37]: He soon found that it was a Manoa , a golden city in a land of Paradise -- too good to be believed in , except by him who was blessed with the beholding of it .
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 17]: He knew now that she had always understood what he was only just waking to recognize .
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 33]: And he felt that the scholar had been very patient with the stupidity of the master , and had drawn from his lessons a nourishment of which he had known nothing himself .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 45]: But dared he think of marrying her , a creature inspired with a presence of the Spirit of God which none but the saints enjoy , and thence clothed with a garment of beauty , which her spirit wove out of its own loveliness ?
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 26]: She was a being to glorify any man merely by granting him her habitual presence : what , then , if she gave her love !
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 30]: She would bring with her the presence of God himself , for she walked ever in his light , and that light clung to her and radiated from her .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 32]: True , many young maidens must be walking in the sunshine of God , else whence the light and loveliness and bloom , the smile and the laugh of their youth ?
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 17]: But Margaret not only walked in this light : she knew it and whence it came .
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 13]: She looked up to its source , and it illuminated her face .
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 62]: The silent girl of old days , whose countenance wore the stillness of an unsunned pool , as she listened with reverence to his lessons , had blossomed into the calm , stately woman , before whose presence he felt rebuked he knew not why , upon whose face lay slumbering thought , ever ready to wake into life and motion .
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 5]: Dared he love her ?
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 9]: Dared he tell her that he loved her ?
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 18]: Dared he , so poor , so worthless , seek for himself such a world 's treasure ?
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 21]: -- He might have known that worth does not need honour ; that its lowliness is content with ascribing it .
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 108]: Some of my readers may be inclined to think that I hide , for the sake of my hero -- poor little hero , one of God 's children , learning to walk -- an inevitable struggle between his love and his pride ; inasmuch as , being but a tutor , he might be expected to think the more of his good family , and the possibility of his one day coming to honour without the drawback of having done anything to merit it , a title being almost within his grasp ; while Margaret was a ploughman 's daughter , and a lady 's maid .
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 61]: But , although I know more of Hugh 's faults than I have thought it at all necessary to bring out in my story , I protest that , had he been capable of giving the name of love to a feeling in whose presence pride dared to speak , I should have considered him unworthy of my poor pen .
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 18]: In plain language , I doubt if I should have cared to write his story at all .
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 68]: He gathered together , as I have said , the few memorials of the old ship gone down in the quiet ocean of time ; paid one visit of sorrowful gladness to his parent 's grave , over which he raised no futile stone -- leaving it , like the forms within it , in the hands of holy decay ; and took his road -- whither ?
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 22]: To Margaret 's home -- to see old Janet ; and to go once to the grave of his second father .
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 14]: Then he would return to the toil and hunger and hope of London .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 7]: What made Hugh go to Turriepuffit ?
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 5]: His love to Margaret ?
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 10]: A better motive even than that : -- Repentance .
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 32]: Better I mean for Hugh as to the individual occasion ; not in itself ; for love is deeper than repentance , seeing that without love there can be no repentance .
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 54]: He had repented before ; but now that he haunted in silence the regions of the past , the whole of his history in connection with David returned on him clear and vivid , as if passing once again before his eyes and through his heart ; and he repented more deeply still .
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 14]: Perhaps he was not quite so much to blame as he thought himself .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 33]: Perhaps only now was it possible for the seeds of truth , which David had sown in his heart , to show themselves above the soil of lower , yet ministering cares .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 12]: They had needed to lie a winter long in the earth .
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 22]: Now the keen blasts and grinding frosts had done their work , and they began to grow in the tearful prime .
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 30]: Sorrow for loss brought in her train sorrow for wrong -- a sister more solemn still , and with a deeper blessing in the voice of her loving farewell .
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 16]: -- It is a great mistake to suppose that sorrow is a part of repentance .
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 12]: It is far too good a grace to come so easily .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 47]: A man may repent , that is , think better of it , and change his way , and be very much of a Pharisee -- I do not say a hypocrite -- for a long time after : it needs a saint to be sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 10]: Yet repentance is generally the road to this sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 49]: -- And now that in the gracious time of grief , his eyesight purified by tears , he entered one after another all the chambers of the past , he humbly renewed once more his friendship with the noble dead , and with the homely , heartful living .
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 98]: The grey-headed man who walked with God like a child , and with his fellow-men like an elder brother who was always forgetting his birthright and serving the younger ; the woman who believed where she could not see , and loved where she could not understand ; and the maiden who was still and lustreless , because she ever absorbed and seldom reflected the light -- all came to him , as if to comfort him once more in his loneliness , when his heart had room for them , and need of them yet again .
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 62]: David now became , after his departure , yet more of a father to him than before , for that spirit , which is the true soul of all this body of things , had begun to recall to his mind the words of David , and so teach him the things that David knew , the everlasting realities of God .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 34]: And it seemed to him the while , that he heard David himself uttering , in his homely , kingly voice , whatever truth returned to him from the echo-cave of the past .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 42]: Even when a quite new thought arose within him , it came to him in the voice of David , or at least with the solemn music of his tones clinging about it as the murmur about the river 's course .
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 40]: Experience had now brought him up to the point where he could begin to profit by David 's communion ; he needed the things which David could teach him ; and David began forthwith to give them to him .
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 40]: That birth of nature in his soul , which enabled him to understand and love Margaret , helped him likewise to contemplate with admiration and awe , the towering peaks of David 's hopes , trusts , and aspirations .
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 78]: He had taught the ploughman mathematics , but that ploughman had possessed in himself all the essential elements of the grandeur of the old prophets , glorified by the faith which the Son of Man did not find in the earth , but left behind him to grow in it , and which had grown to a noble growth of beauty and strength in this peasant , simple and patriarchal in the midst of a self-conceited age .
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 4]: And , oh !
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 8]: how good he had been to him !
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 29]: He had built a house that he might take him in from the cold , and make life pleasant to him , as in the presence of God .
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 16]: He had given him his heart every time he gave him his great manly hand .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 22]: And this man , this friend , this presence of Christ , Hugh had forsaken , neglected , all but forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 43]: He could not go , and , like the prodigal , fall down before him , and say , `` Father , I have sinned against heaven and thee , '' for that heaven had taken him up out of his sight .
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 10]: He could only weep instead , and bitterly repent .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 11]: Yes ; there was one thing more he could do .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 4]: Janet still lived .
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 16]: He would go to her , and confess his sin , and beg her forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 9]: Receiving it , he would be at peace .
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 63]: He knew David forgave him , whether he confessed or not ; and that , if he were alive , David would seek his confession only as the casting away of the separation from his heart , as the banishment of the worldly spirit , and as the natural sign by which he might know that Hugh was one with him yet .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 14]: Janet was David 's representative on earth : he would go to her .
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 49]: So he returned , rich and great ; rich in knowing that he was the child of Him to whom all the gold mines belong ; and great in that humility which alone recognizes greatness , and in the beginnings of that meekness which shall inherit the earth .
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 11]: No more would he stunt his spiritual growth by self-satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 54]: No more would he lay aside , in the cellars of his mind , poor withered bulbs of opinions , which , but for the evil ministrations of that self-satisfaction , seeking to preserve them by drying and salting , might have been already bursting into blossoms of truth , of infinite loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 18]: He knew that Margaret thought far too well of him -- honoured him greatly beyond his deserts .
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 12]: He would not allow her to be any longer thus deceived .
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 11]: He would tell her what a poor creature he was .
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 30]: But he would say , too , that he hoped one day to be worthy of her praise , that he hoped to grow to what she thought him .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 34]: If he should fail in convincing her , he would receive all the honour she gave him humbly , as paid , not to him , but to what he ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 11]: God grant it might be as to his future self !
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 8]: In this mood he went to Janet .
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 4]: THE FIR-WOOD AGAIN .
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 7]: Er stand vor der himmlischen Jungfrau .
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 17]: Da hob er den leichten , glänzenden Schleir , und -- Rosenblüthchen sank in seine Arme .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 3]: -- Novalis .
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 6]: -- Die Lehrlinge zu Sais .
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 15]: He stood before the heavenly Virgin -LRB- Isis , the Goddess of Nature -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 22]: Then lifted he the light , shining veil , and -- Rosebud -LRB- his old love -RRB- sank into his arms .
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 10]: So womanly , so benigne , and so meek .
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 2]: CHAUCER .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 3]: -- Prol .
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 3]: to Leg .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 4]: of Good Women .
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 31]: It was with a mingling of strange emotions , that Hugh approached the scene of those not very old , and yet , to his feeling , quite early memories .
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 7]: The dusk was beginning to gather .
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 8]: The hoar-frost lay thick on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 24]: The pine-trees stood up in the cold , looking , in their garment of spikes , as if the frost had made them .
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 13]: The rime on the gate was unfriendly , and chilled his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 6]: He turned into the footpath .
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 10]: He saw the room David had built for him .
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 20]: Its thatch was one mass of mosses , whose colours were hidden now in the cuckoo-fruit of the frost .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 2]: Alas !
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 19]: how Death had cast his deeper frost over all ; for the man was gone from the hearth !
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 17]: But neither old Winter nor skeleton Death can withhold the feet of the little child Spring .
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 6]: She is stronger than both .
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 11]: Love shall conquer hate ; and God will overcome sin .
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 9]: He drew nigh to the door , trembling .
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 18]: It seemed strange to him that his nerves only , and not his mind , should feel .
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 36]: -- In moments of unusual excitement , it sometimes happens that the only consciousness a strong man has of emotion , lies in an unwonted physical vibration , the mind itself refusing to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 26]: It is , however , but a seeming : the emotion is so deep , that consciousness can lay hold of its physical result only .
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 16]: -- The cottage looked the same as ever , only the peat-stack outside was smaller .
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 20]: In the shadowiness of the firs , the glimmer of a fire was just discernible on the kitchen window .
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 10]: He trembled so much that he could not enter .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 25]: He would go into the fir-wood first , and see Margaret 's tree , as he always called it in his thoughts and dreams .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 20]: Very poor and stunted and meagre looked the fir-trees of Turriepuffit , after the beeches and elms of Arnstead .
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 33]: The evening wind whistled keen and cold through their dry needles , and made them moan , as if because they were fettered , and must endure the winter in helpless patience .
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 31]: Here and there amongst them , rose the Titans of the little forest -- the huge , old , contorted , wizard-like , yet benevolent beings -- the Scotch firs .
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 9]: Towards one of these he bent his way .
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 53]: It was the one under which he had seen Margaret , when he met her first in the wood , with her whole soul lost in the waving of its wind-swung , sun-lighted top , floating about in the sea of air like a golden nest for some silvery bird of heaven .
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 34]: To think that the young girl to whom he had given the primrose he had just found , the then first-born of the Spring , should now be the queen of his heart !
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 20]: Her childish dream of the angel haunting the wood had been true , only she was the angel herself .
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 6]: He drew near the place .
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 6]: How well he knew it !
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 22]: He seated himself , cold as it was in the February of Scotland , at the foot of the blessed tree .
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 9]: He did not know that it was cold .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 24]: While he sat with his eyes fixed on the ground , a light rustle in the fallen leaves made him raise them suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 29]: It was all winter and fallen leaves about him ; but he lifted his eyes , and in his soul it was summer : Margaret stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 8]: He was not in the least surprised .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 20]: For how can one wonder to see before his eyes , the form of which his soul is full ?
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 6]: -- there is no shock .
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 22]: She stood a little way off , looking -- as if she wanted to be sure before she moved a step .
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 16]: She was dressed in a grey winsey gown , close to her throat and wrists .
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 7]: She had neither shawl nor bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 15]: Her fine health kept her warm , even in a winter wood at sun-down .
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 20]: She looked just the same ; -- at home everywhere ; most at home in Nature 's secret chamber .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 14]: Like the genius of the place , she made the winter-wood look homely .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 10]: What were the oaks and beeches of Arnstead now ?
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 6]: Homeliness and glory are Heaven .
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 4]: She came nearer .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 4]: `` Margaret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 8]: he murmured , and would have risen .
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 17]: `` No , no ; sit still , '' she rejoined , in a pleading tone .
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 11]: `` I thought it was the angel in the picture .
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 5]: Now I know it .
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 12]: Sit still , dear Mr. Sutherland , one moment more . ''
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 33]: Humbled by his sense of unworthiness , and a little distressed that she could so quietly reveal the depth of her feeling towards him , he said : `` Ah , Margaret !
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 13]: I wish you would not praise one so little deserving it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 4]: `` Praise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 9]: she repeated , with an accent of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 5]: `` I praise you !
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 12]: No , Mr. Sutherland ; that I am not guilty of .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 12]: Next to my father , you made me know and feel .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 35]: And as I walked here , I was thinking of the old times , and older times still ; and all at once I saw the very picture out of the old Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 7]: She came close to him now .
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 15]: He rose , trembling , but held out no hand , uttered no greeting .
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 9]: `` Margaret , dare I love you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 3]: he faltered .
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 8]: She looked at him with wide-open eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 12]: she said ; and her eyes did not move from his .
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 10]: A slight rose-flush bloomed out on her motionless face .
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 8]: `` Will you be my wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 7]: he said , trembling yet more .
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 17]: She made no answer , but looked at him still , with parted lips , motionless .
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 8]: `` I am very poor , Margaret .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 7]: I could not marry now . ''
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 11]: It was a stupid speech , but he made it .
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 24]: `` I do n't care , '' she answered , with a voice like thinking , `` if you never marry me . ''
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 12]: He misunderstood her , and turned cold to the very heart .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 5]: He misunderstood her stillness .
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 22]: Her heart lay so deep , that it took a long time for its feelings to reach and agitate the surface .
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 12]: He said no more , but turned away with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 11]: `` Come home to my mother , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 12]: He obeyed mechanically , and walked in silence by her side .
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 7]: They reached the cottage and entered .
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 14]: Margaret said : `` Here he is , mother ; '' and disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 45]: Janet was seated -- in her widow 's mutch , with the plain black ribbon down both sides , and round the back -- in the arm-chair by the fire , pondering on the past , or gently dreaming of him that was gone .
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 5]: She turned her head .
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 10]: Sorrow had baptized her face with a new gentleness .
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 18]: The tender expression which had been but occasional while her husband lived , was almost constant now .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 6]: She did not recognize Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 12]: He saw it , and it added weight to his despair .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 5]: He was left outside .
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 4]: `` Mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 5]: he said , involuntarily .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 12]: She started to her feet , cried : `` My bairn !
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 4]: my bairn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 14]: threw her arms around him , and laid her head on his bosom .
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 9]: Hugh sobbed as if his heart would break .
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 13]: Janet wept , but her weeping was quiet as a summer rain .
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 38]: He led her to her chair , knelt by her side , and hiding his face in her lap like a child , faltered out , interrupted by convulsive sobs : `` Forgive me ; forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 11]: I do n't deserve it , but forgive me . ''
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 4]: `` Hoot awa !
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 3]: my bairn !
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 4]: my bonny man !
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 5]: Dinna greet that gait .
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 5]: The Lord preserve 's !
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 7]: what are ye greetin ' for ?
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 9]: Are na ye come hame to yer ain ?
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 13]: Didna Dawvid aye say -- ` Gie the lad time , woman .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 13]: It 's unco chaip , for the Lord 's aye maki n't .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 10]: The best things is aye the maist plentifu ' .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 10]: Gie the lad time , my bonny woman ! '
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 6]: -- didna he say that ?
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 20]: Ay , he ca 'd me his bonny woman , ill as I deserved it at his han ' .
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 36]: An ' it 's no for me to say ae word agen you , Maister Sutherlan ' , gin ye had been a hantle waur nor a young thochtless lad cudna weel help bein ' .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 37]: An ' noo ye 're come hame , an ' nothing cud glaidden my heart mair , ` cep ' , maybe , the Maister himsel ' was to say to my man : ` Dawvid !
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 5]: come furth . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 6]: Hugh could make no reply .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 28]: He got hold of Margaret 's creepie , which stood in its usual place , and sat down upon it , at the old woman 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 38]: She gazed in his face for a while , and then , putting her arm round his neck , drew his head to her bosom , and fondled him as if he had been her own first-born .
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 4]: `` But eh !
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 20]: yer bonnie face is sharp an ' sma ' to what it used to be , Maister Sutherlan ' .
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 13]: I doot ye hae come through a heap o ' trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 13]: `` I 'll tell you all about it , '' said Hugh .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 10]: `` Na , na ; bide still a wee .
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 9]: I ken a ' aboot it frae Maggy .
