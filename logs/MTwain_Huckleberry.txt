Parsing [sent. 1 len. 45]: ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN By Mark Twain NOTICE PERSONS attempting to find a motive in this narrative will be prosecuted ; persons attempting to find a moral in it will be banished ; persons attempting to find a plot in it will be shot .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 13]: BY ORDER OF THE AUTHOR , Per G.G. , Chief of Ordnance .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 44]: EXPLANATORY IN this book a number of dialects are used , to wit : the Missouri negro dialect ; the extremest form of the backwoods Southwestern dialect ; the ordinary `` Pike County '' dialect ; and four modified varieties of this last .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 35]: The shadings have not been done in a haphazard fashion , or by guesswork ; but painstakingly , and with the trustworthy guidance and support of personal familiarity with these several forms of speech .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 27]: I make this explanation for the reason that without it many readers would suppose that all these characters were trying to talk alike and not succeeding .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 3]: THE AUTHOR .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 19]: ADVENTURES OF HUCKLEBERRY FINN Scene : The Mississippi Valley Time : Forty to fifty years ago CHAPTER I .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 29]: YOU do n't know about me without you have read a book by the name of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer ; but that ai n't no matter .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 17]: That book was made by Mr. Mark Twain , and he told the truth , mainly .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 14]: There was things which he stretched , but mainly he told the truth .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 4]: That is nothing .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 25]: I never seen anybody but lied one time or another , without it was Aunt Polly , or the widow , or maybe Mary .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 42]: Aunt Polly -- Tom 's Aunt Polly , she is -- and Mary , and the Widow Douglas is all told about in that book , which is mostly a true book , with some stretchers , as I said before .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 31]: Now the way that the book winds up is this : Tom and me found the money that the robbers hid in the cave , and it made us rich .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 10]: We got six thousand dollars apiece -- all gold .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 13]: It was an awful sight of money when it was piled up .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 39]: Well , Judge Thatcher he took it and put it out at interest , and it fetched us a dollar a day apiece all the year round -- more than a body could tell what to do with .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 57]: The Widow Douglas she took me for her son , and allowed she would sivilize me ; but it was rough living in the house all the time , considering how dismal regular and decent the widow was in all her ways ; and so when I could n't stand it no longer I lit out .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 17]: I got into my old rags and my sugar-hogshead again , and was free and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 35]: But Tom Sawyer he hunted me up and said he was going to start a band of robbers , and I might join if I would go back to the widow and be respectable .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 5]: So I went back .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 36]: The widow she cried over me , and called me a poor lost lamb , and she called me a lot of other names , too , but she never meant no harm by it .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 26]: She put me in them new clothes again , and I could n't do nothing but sweat and sweat , and feel all cramped up .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 10]: Well , then , the old thing commenced again .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 16]: The widow rung a bell for supper , and you had to come to time .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 58]: When you got to the table you could n't go right to eating , but you had to wait for the widow to tuck down her head and grumble a little over the victuals , though there war n't really anything the matter with them , -- that is , nothing only everything was cooked by itself .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 30]: In a barrel of odds and ends it is different ; things get mixed up , and the juice kind of swaps around , and the things go better .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 69]: After supper she got out her book and learned me about Moses and the Bulrushers , and I was in a sweat to find out all about him ; but by and by she let it out that Moses had been dead a considerable long time ; so then I did n't care no more about him , because I do n't take no stock in dead people .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 15]: Pretty soon I wanted to smoke , and asked the widow to let me .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 5]: But she would n't .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 23]: She said it was a mean practice and was n't clean , and I must try to not do it any more .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 9]: That is just the way with some people .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 15]: They get down on a thing when they do n't know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 45]: Here she was a-bothering about Moses , which was no kin to her , and no use to anybody , being gone , you see , yet finding a power of fault with me for doing a thing that had some good in it .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 20]: And she took snuff , too ; of course that was all right , because she done it herself .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 35]: Her sister , Miss Watson , a tolerable slim old maid , with goggles on , had just come to live with her , and took a set at me now with a spelling-book .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 19]: She worked me middling hard for about an hour , and then the widow made her ease up .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 8]: I could n't stood it much longer .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 14]: Then for an hour it was deadly dull , and I was fidgety .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 60]: Miss Watson would say , `` Do n't put your feet up there , Huckleberry ; '' and `` Do n't scrunch up like that , Huckleberry -- set up straight ; '' and pretty soon she would say , `` Do n't gap and stretch like that , Huckleberry -- why do n't you try to behave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 19]: Then she told me all about the bad place , and I said I wished I was there .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 13]: She got mad then , but I did n't mean no harm .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 20]: All I wanted was to go somewheres ; all I wanted was a change , I war n't particular .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 36]: She said it was wicked to say what I said ; said she would n't say it for the whole world ; she was going to live so as to go to the good place .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 28]: Well , I could n't see no advantage in going where she was going , so I made up my mind I would n't try for it .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 20]: But I never said so , because it would only make trouble , and would n't do no good .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 20]: Now she had got a start , and she went on and told me all about the good place .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 27]: She said all a body would have to do there was to go around all day long with a harp and sing , forever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 9]: So I did n't think much of it .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 6]: But I never said so .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 21]: I asked her if she reckoned Tom Sawyer would go there , and she said not by a considerable sight .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 16]: I was glad about that , because I wanted him and me to be together .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 15]: Miss Watson she kept pecking at me , and it got tiresome and lonesome .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 20]: By and by they fetched the niggers in and had prayers , and then everybody was off to bed .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 19]: I went up to my room with a piece of candle , and put it on the table .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 25]: Then I set down in a chair by the window and tried to think of something cheerful , but it war n't no use .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 11]: I felt so lonesome I most wished I was dead .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 79]: The stars were shining , and the leaves rustled in the woods ever so mournful ; and I heard an owl , away off , who-whooing about somebody that was dead , and a whippowill and a dog crying about somebody that was going to die ; and the wind was trying to whisper something to me , and I could n't make out what it was , and so it made the cold shivers run over me .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 57]: Then away out in the woods I heard that kind of a sound that a ghost makes when it wants to tell about something that 's on its mind and ca n't make itself understood , and so ca n't rest easy in its grave , and has to go about that way every night grieving .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 14]: I got so down-hearted and scared I did wish I had some company .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 33]: Pretty soon a spider went crawling up my shoulder , and I flipped it off and it lit in the candle ; and before I could budge it was all shriveled up .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 36]: I did n't need anybody to tell me that that was an awful bad sign and would fetch me some bad luck , so I was scared and most shook the clothes off of me .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 37]: I got up and turned around in my tracks three times and crossed my breast every time ; and then I tied up a little lock of my hair with a thread to keep witches away .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 7]: But I had n't no confidence .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 47]: You do that when you 've lost a horseshoe that you 've found , instead of nailing it up over the door , but I had n't ever heard anybody say it was any way to keep off bad luck when you 'd killed a spider .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 37]: I set down again , a-shaking all over , and got out my pipe for a smoke ; for the house was all as still as death now , and so the widow would n't know .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 34]: Well , after a long time I heard the clock away off in the town go boom -- boom -- boom -- twelve licks ; and all still again -- stiller than ever .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 20]: Pretty soon I heard a twig snap down in the dark amongst the trees -- something was a stirring .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 6]: I set still and listened .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 10]: Directly I could just barely hear a `` me-yow !
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 3]: me-yow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 3]: down there .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 4]: That was good !
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 6]: Says I , `` me-yow !
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 3]: me-yow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 24]: as soft as I could , and then I put out the light and scrambled out of the window on to the shed .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 27]: Then I slipped down to the ground and crawled in among the trees , and , sure enough , there was Tom Sawyer waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 3]: CHAPTER II .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 31]: WE went tiptoeing along a path amongst the trees back towards the end of the widow 's garden , stooping down so as the branches would n't scrape our heads .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 17]: When we was passing by the kitchen I fell over a root and made a noise .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 7]: We scrouched down and laid still .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 31]: Miss Watson 's big nigger , named Jim , was setting in the kitchen door ; we could see him pretty clear , because there was a light behind him .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 14]: He got up and stretched his neck out about a minute , listening .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 9]: Then he says : `` Who dah ? ''
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 24]: He listened some more ; then he come tiptoeing down and stood right between us ; we could a touched him , nearly .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 23]: Well , likely it was minutes and minutes that there war n't a sound , and we all there so close together .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 37]: There was a place on my ankle that got to itching , but I das n't scratch it ; and then my ear begun to itch ; and next my back , right between my shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 11]: Seemed like I 'd die if I could n't scratch .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 11]: Well , I 've noticed that thing plenty times since .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 51]: If you are with the quality , or at a funeral , or trying to go to sleep when you ai n't sleepy -- if you are anywheres where it wo n't do for you to scratch , why you will itch all over in upwards of a thousand places .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 12]: Pretty soon Jim says : `` Say , who is you ?
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 4]: Whar is you ?
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 38]: Dog my cats ef I didn ' hear sumf ` n. Well , I know what I 's gwyne to do : I 's gwyne to set down here and listen tell I hears it agin . ''
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 12]: So he set down on the ground betwixt me and Tom .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 24]: He leaned his back up against a tree , and stretched his legs out till one of them most touched one of mine .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 6]: My nose begun to itch .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 10]: It itched till the tears come into my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 6]: But I das n't scratch .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 9]: Then it begun to itch on the inside .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 7]: Next I got to itching underneath .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 12]: I did n't know how I was going to set still .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 21]: This miserableness went on as much as six or seven minutes ; but it seemed a sight longer than that .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 9]: I was itching in eleven different places now .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 25]: I reckoned I could n't stand it more 'n a minute longer , but I set my teeth hard and got ready to try .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 23]: Just then Jim begun to breathe heavy ; next he begun to snore -- and then I was pretty soon comfortable again .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 28]: Tom he made a sign to me -- kind of a little noise with his mouth -- and we went creeping away on our hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 22]: When we was ten foot off Tom whispered to me , and wanted to tie Jim to the tree for fun .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 24]: But I said no ; he might wake and make a disturbance , and then they 'd find out I war n't in .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 22]: Then Tom said he had n't got candles enough , and he would slip in the kitchen and get some more .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 8]: I did n't want him to try .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 9]: I said Jim might wake up and come .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 28]: But Tom wanted to resk it ; so we slid in there and got three candles , and Tom laid five cents on the table for pay .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 41]: Then we got out , and I was in a sweat to get away ; but nothing would do Tom but he must crawl to where Jim was , on his hands and knees , and play something on him .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 17]: I waited , and it seemed a good while , everything was so still and lonesome .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 37]: As soon as Tom was back we cut along the path , around the garden fence , and by and by fetched up on the steep top of the hill the other side of the house .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 33]: Tom said he slipped Jim 's hat off of his head and hung it on a limb right over him , and Jim stirred a little , but he did n't wake .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 45]: Afterwards Jim said the witches be witched him and put him in a trance , and rode him all over the State , and then set him under the trees again , and hung his hat on a limb to show who done it .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 62]: And next time Jim told it he said they rode him down to New Orleans ; and , after that , every time he told it he spread it more and more , till by and by he said they rode him all over the world , and tired him most to death , and his back was all over saddle-boils .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 20]: Jim was monstrous proud about it , and he got so he would n't hardly notice the other niggers .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 25]: Niggers would come miles to hear Jim tell about it , and he was more looked up to than any nigger in that country .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 22]: Strange niggers would stand with their mouths open and look him all over , same as if he was a wonder .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 39]: Niggers is always talking about witches in the dark by the kitchen fire ; but whenever one was talking and letting on to know all about such things , Jim would happen in and say , `` Hm !
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 8]: What you know ` bout witches ? ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 14]: and that nigger was corked up and had to take a back seat .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 64]: Jim always kept that five-center piece round his neck with a string , and said it was a charm the devil give to him with his own hands , and told him he could cure anybody with it and fetch witches whenever he wanted to just by saying something to it ; but he never told what it was he said to it .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 40]: Niggers would come from all around there and give Jim anything they had , just for a sight of that five-center piece ; but they would n't touch it , because the devil had had his hands on it .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 26]: Jim was most ruined for a servant , because he got stuck up on account of having seen the devil and been rode by witches .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 68]: Well , when Tom and me got to the edge of the hilltop we looked away down into the village and could see three or four lights twinkling , where there was sick folks , maybe ; and the stars over us was sparkling ever so fine ; and down by the village was the river , a whole mile broad , and awful still and grand .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 28]: We went down the hill and found Jo Harper and Ben Rogers , and two or three more of the boys , hid in the old tanyard .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 28]: So we unhitched a skiff and pulled down the river two mile and a half , to the big scar on the hillside , and went ashore .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 37]: We went to a clump of bushes , and Tom made everybody swear to keep the secret , and then showed them a hole in the hill , right in the thickest part of the bushes .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 15]: Then we lit the candles , and crawled in on our hands and knees .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 14]: We went about two hundred yards , and then the cave opened up .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 26]: Tom poked about amongst the passages , and pretty soon ducked under a wall where you would n't a noticed that there was a hole .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 26]: We went along a narrow place and got into a kind of room , all damp and sweaty and cold , and there we stopped .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 21]: Tom says : `` Now , we 'll start this band of robbers and call it Tom Sawyer 's Gang .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 20]: Everybody that wants to join has got to take an oath , and write his name in blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 4]: Everybody was willing .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 20]: So Tom got out a sheet of paper that he had wrote the oath on , and read it .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 76]: It swore every boy to stick to the band , and never tell any of the secrets ; and if anybody done anything to any boy in the band , whichever boy was ordered to kill that person and his family must do it , and he must n't eat and he must n't sleep till he had killed them and hacked a cross in their breasts , which was the sign of the band .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 34]: And nobody that did n't belong to the band could use that mark , and if he did he must be sued ; and if he done it again he must be killed .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 63]: And if anybody that belonged to the band told the secrets , he must have his throat cut , and then have his carcass burnt up and the ashes scattered all around , and his name blotted off of the list with blood and never mentioned again by the gang , but have a curse put on it and be forgot forever .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 22]: Everybody said it was a real beautiful oath , and asked Tom if he got it out of his own head .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 26]: He said , some of it , but the rest was out of pirate-books and robber-books , and every gang that was high-toned had it .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 17]: Some thought it would be good to kill the FAMILIES of boys that told the secrets .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 18]: Tom said it was a good idea , so he took a pencil and wrote it in .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 28]: Then Ben Rogers says : `` Here 's Huck Finn , he hai n't got no family ; what you going to do ` bout him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 11]: `` Well , hai n't he got a father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 4]: says Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 19]: `` Yes , he 's got a father , but you ca n't never find him these days .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 28]: He used to lay drunk with the hogs in the tanyard , but he hai n't been seen in these parts for a year or more . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 41]: They talked it over , and they was going to rule me out , because they said every boy must have a family or somebody to kill , or else it would n't be fair and square for the others .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 18]: Well , nobody could think of anything to do -- everybody was stumped , and set still .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 30]: I was most ready to cry ; but all at once I thought of a way , and so I offered them Miss Watson -- they could kill her .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 10]: Everybody said : `` Oh , she 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 5]: That 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 6]: Huck can come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 25]: Then they all stuck a pin in their fingers to get blood to sign with , and I made my mark on the paper .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 20]: `` Now , '' says Ben Rogers , `` what 's the line of business of this Gang ? ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 11]: `` Nothing only robbery and murder , '' Tom said .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 9]: `` But who are we going to rob ?
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 12]: -- houses , or cattle , or -- '' `` Stuff !
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 18]: stealing cattle and such things ai n't robbery ; it 's burglary , '' says Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 6]: `` We ai n't burglars .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 8]: That ai n't no sort of style .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 4]: We are highwaymen .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 25]: We stop stages and carriages on the road , with masks on , and kill the people and take their watches and money . ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 9]: `` Must we always kill the people ? ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 5]: `` Oh , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 4]: It 's best .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 34]: Some authorities think different , but mostly it 's considered best to kill them -- except some that you bring to the cave here , and keep them till they 're ransomed . ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 3]: `` Ransomed ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 5]: What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 7]: But that 's what they do .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 21]: I 've seen it in books ; and so of course that 's what we 've got to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 17]: `` But how can we do it if we do n't know what it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 14]: `` Why , blame it all , we 've GOT to do it .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 11]: Do n't I tell you it 's in the books ?
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 23]: Do you want to go to doing different from what 's in the books , and get things all muddled up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 38]: `` Oh , that 's all very fine to SAY , Tom Sawyer , but how in the nation are these fellows going to be ransomed if we do n't know how to do it to them ?
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 11]: -- that 's the thing I want to get at .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 10]: Now , what do you reckon it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 8]: `` Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 25]: But per ` aps if we keep them till they 're ransomed , it means that we keep them till they 're dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 8]: `` Now , that 's something LIKE .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 4]: That 'll answer .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 8]: Why could n't you said that before ?
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 33]: We 'll keep them till they 're ransomed to death ; and a bothersome lot they 'll be , too -- eating up everything , and always trying to get loose . ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 8]: `` How you talk , Ben Rogers .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 25]: How can they get loose when there 's a guard over them , ready to shoot them down if they move a peg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 4]: `` A guard !
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 6]: Well , that IS good .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 22]: So somebody 's got to set up all night and never get any sleep , just so as to watch them .
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 6]: I think that 's foolishness .
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 19]: Why ca n't a body take a club and ransom them as soon as they get here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 14]: `` Because it ai n't in the books so -- that 's why .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 18]: Now , Ben Rogers , do you want to do things regular , or do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 6]: -- that 's the idea .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 20]: Do n't you reckon that the people that made the books knows what 's the correct thing to do ?
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 9]: Do you reckon YOU can learn 'em anything ?
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 6]: Not by a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 18]: No , sir , we 'll just go on and ransom them in the regular way . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 16]: I do n't mind ; but I say it 's a fool way , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 11]: Say , do we kill the women , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 19]: `` Well , Ben Rogers , if I was as ignorant as you I would n't let on .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 4]: Kill the women ?
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 12]: No ; nobody ever saw anything in the books like that .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 39]: You fetch them to the cave , and you 're always as polite as pie to them ; and by and by they fall in love with you , and never want to go home any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 22]: `` Well , if that 's the way I 'm agreed , but I do n't take no stock in it .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 31]: Mighty soon we 'll have the cave so cluttered up with women , and fellows waiting to be ransomed , that there wo n't be no place for the robbers .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 13]: But go ahead , I ai n't got nothing to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 42]: Little Tommy Barnes was asleep now , and when they waked him up he was scared , and cried , and said he wanted to go home to his ma , and did n't want to be a robber any more .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 32]: So they all made fun of him , and called him cry-baby , and that made him mad , and he said he would go straight and tell all the secrets .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 30]: But Tom give him five cents to keep quiet , and said we would all go home and meet next week , and rob somebody and kill some people .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 43]: Ben Rogers said he could n't get out much , only Sundays , and so he wanted to begin next Sunday ; but all the boys said it would be wicked to do it on Sunday , and that settled the thing .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 37]: They agreed to get together and fix a day as soon as they could , and then we elected Tom Sawyer first captain and Jo Harper second captain of the Gang , and so started home .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 16]: I clumb up the shed and crept into my window just before day was breaking .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 15]: My new clothes was all greased up and clayey , and I was dog-tired .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 3]: CHAPTER III .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 52]: WELL , I got a good going-over in the morning from old Miss Watson on account of my clothes ; but the widow she did n't scold , but only cleaned off the grease and clay , and looked so sorry that I thought I would behave awhile if I could .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 18]: Then Miss Watson she took me in the closet and prayed , but nothing come of it .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 18]: She told me to pray every day , and whatever I asked for I would get it .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 6]: But it war n't so .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 4]: I tried it .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 10]: Once I got a fish-line , but no hooks .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 10]: It war n't any good to me without hooks .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 19]: I tried for the hooks three or four times , but somehow I could n't make it work .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 24]: By and by , one day , I asked Miss Watson to try for me , but she said I was a fool .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 16]: She never told me why , and I could n't make it out no way .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 18]: I set down one time back in the woods , and had a long think about it .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 29]: I says to myself , if a body can get anything they pray for , why do n't Deacon Winn get back the money he lost on pork ?
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 14]: Why ca n't the widow get back her silver snuffbox that was stole ?
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 8]: Why ca n't Miss Watson fat up ?
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 15]: No , says I to my self , there ai n't nothing in it .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 28]: I went and told the widow about it , and she said the thing a body could get by praying for it was `` spiritual gifts . ''
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 45]: This was too many for me , but she told me what she meant -- I must help other people , and do everything I could for other people , and look out for them all the time , and never think about myself .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 11]: This was including Miss Watson , as I took it .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 53]: I went out in the woods and turned it over in my mind a long time , but I could n't see no advantage about it -- except for the other people ; so at last I reckoned I would n't worry about it any more , but just let it go .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 39]: Sometimes the widow would take me one side and talk about Providence in a way to make a body 's mouth water ; but maybe next day Miss Watson would take hold and knock it all down again .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 42]: I judged I could see that there was two Providences , and a poor chap would stand considerable show with the widow 's Providence , but if Miss Watson 's got him there war n't no help for him any more .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 56]: I thought it all out , and reckoned I would belong to the widow 's if he wanted me , though I could n't make out how he was a-going to be any better off then than what he was before , seeing I was so ignorant , and so kind of low-down and ornery .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 29]: Pap he had n't been seen for more than a year , and that was comfortable for me ; I did n't want to see him no more .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 35]: He used to always whale me when he was sober and could get his hands on me ; though I used to take to the woods most of the time when he was around .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 23]: Well , about this time he was found in the river drownded , about twelve mile above town , so people said .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 63]: They judged it was him , anyway ; said this drownded man was just his size , and was ragged , and had uncommon long hair , which was all like pap ; but they could n't make nothing out of the face , because it had been in the water so long it war n't much like a face at all .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 12]: They said he was floating on his back in the water .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 10]: They took him and buried him on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 15]: But I war n't comfortable long , because I happened to think of something .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 20]: I knowed mighty well that a drownded man do n't float on his back , but on his face .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 23]: So I knowed , then , that this war n't pap , but a woman dressed up in a man 's clothes .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 6]: So I was uncomfortable again .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 20]: I judged the old man would turn up again by and by , though I wished he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 15]: We played robber now and then about a month , and then I resigned .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 5]: All the boys did .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 17]: We had n't robbed nobody , had n't killed any people , but only just pretended .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 32]: We used to hop out of the woods and go charging down on hog-drivers and women in carts taking garden stuff to market , but we never hived any of them .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 45]: Tom Sawyer called the hogs `` ingots , '' and he called the turnips and stuff `` julery , '' and we would go to the cave and powwow over what we had done , and how many people we had killed and marked .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 10]: But I could n't see no profit in it .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 126]: One time Tom sent a boy to run about town with a blazing stick , which he called a slogan -LRB- which was the sign for the Gang to get together -RRB- , and then he said he had got secret news by his spies that next day a whole parcel of Spanish merchants and rich A-rabs was going to camp in Cave Hollow with two hundred elephants , and six hundred camels , and over a thousand `` sumter '' mules , all loaded down with di ` monds , and they did n't have only a guard of four hundred soldiers , and so we would lay in ambuscade , as he called it , and kill the lot and scoop the things .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 15]: He said we must slick up our swords and guns , and get ready .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 57]: He never could go after even a turnip-cart but he must have the swords and guns all scoured up for it , though they was only lath and broomsticks , and you might scour at them till you rotted , and then they war n't worth a mouthful of ashes more than what they was before .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 56]: I did n't believe we could lick such a crowd of Spaniards and A-rabs , but I wanted to see the camels and elephants , so I was on hand next day , Saturday , in the ambuscade ; and when we got the word we rushed out of the woods and down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 19]: But there war n't no Spaniards and A-rabs , and there war n't no camels nor no elephants .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 16]: It war n't anything but a Sunday-school picnic , and only a primer-class at that .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 57]: We busted it up , and chased the children up the hollow ; but we never got anything but some doughnuts and jam , though Ben Rogers got a rag doll , and Jo Harper got a hymn-book and a tract ; and then the teacher charged in , and made us drop everything and cut .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 16]: I did n't see no di ` monds , and I told Tom Sawyer so .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 26]: He said there was loads of them there , anyway ; and he said there was A-rabs there , too , and elephants and things .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 12]: I said , why could n't we see them , then ?
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 24]: He said if I war n't so ignorant , but had read a book called Don Quixote , I would know without asking .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 9]: He said it was all done by enchantment .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 44]: He said there was hundreds of soldiers there , and elephants and treasure , and so on , but we had enemies which he called magicians ; and they had turned the whole thing into an infant Sunday-school , just out of spite .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 20]: I said , all right ; then the thing for us to do was to go for the magicians .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 8]: Tom Sawyer said I was a numskull .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 33]: `` Why , '' said he , `` a magician could call up a lot of genies , and they would hash you up like nothing before you could say Jack Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 16]: They are as tall as a tree and as big around as a church . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 29]: `` Well , '' I says , `` s ` pose we got some genies to help US -- ca n't we lick the other crowd then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 9]: `` How you going to get them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 7]: How do THEY get them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 47]: `` Why , they rub an old tin lamp or an iron ring , and then the genies come tearing in , with the thunder and lightning a-ripping around and the smoke a-rolling , and everything they 're told to do they up and do it .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 31]: They do n't think nothing of pulling a shot-tower up by the roots , and belting a Sunday-school superintendent over the head with it -- or any other man . ''
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 9]: `` Who makes them tear around so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 11]: `` Why , whoever rubs the lamp or the ring .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 21]: They belong to whoever rubs the lamp or the ring , and they 've got to do whatever he says .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 63]: If he tells them to build a palace forty miles long out of di ` monds , and fill it full of chewing-gum , or whatever you want , and fetch an emperor 's daughter from China for you to marry , they 've got to do it -- and they 've got to do it before sun-up next morning , too .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 23]: And more : they 've got to waltz that palace around over the country wherever you want it , you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 31]: `` Well , '' says I , `` I think they are a pack of flat-heads for not keeping the palace themselves ` stead of fooling them away like that .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 38]: And what 's more -- if I was one of them I would see a man in Jericho before I would drop my business and come to him for the rubbing of an old tin lamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 8]: `` How you talk , Huck Finn .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 20]: Why , you 'd HAVE to come when he rubbed it , whether you wanted to or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 14]: and I as high as a tree and as big as a church ?
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 28]: All right , then ; I WOULD come ; but I lay I 'd make that man climb the highest tree there was in the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 16]: `` Shucks , it ai n't no use to talk to you , Huck Finn .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 14]: You do n't seem to know anything , somehow -- perfect saphead . ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 25]: I thought all this over for two or three days , and then I reckoned I would see if there was anything in it .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 50]: I got an old tin lamp and an iron ring , and went out in the woods and rubbed and rubbed till I sweat like an Injun , calculating to build a palace and sell it ; but it war n't no use , none of the genies come .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 18]: So then I judged that all that stuff was only just one of Tom Sawyer 's lies .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 19]: I reckoned he believed in the A-rabs and the elephants , but as for me I think different .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 9]: It had all the marks of a Sunday-school .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 3]: CHAPTER IV .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 18]: WELL , three or four months run along , and it was well into the winter now .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 54]: I had been to school most all the time and could spell and read and write just a little , and could say the multiplication table up to six times seven is thirty-five , and I do n't reckon I could ever get any further than that if I was to live forever .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 11]: I do n't take no stock in mathematics , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 19]: At first I hated the school , but by and by I got so I could stand it .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 24]: Whenever I got uncommon tired I played hookey , and the hiding I got next day done me good and cheered me up .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 14]: So the longer I went to school the easier it got to be .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 23]: I was getting sort of used to the widow 's ways , too , and they war n't so raspy on me .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 42]: Living in a house and sleeping in a bed pulled on me pretty tight mostly , but before the cold weather I used to slide out and sleep in the woods sometimes , and so that was a rest to me .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 24]: I liked the old ways best , but I was getting so I liked the new ones , too , a little bit .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 16]: The widow said I was coming along slow but sure , and doing very satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 9]: She said she war n't ashamed of me .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 12]: One morning I happened to turn over the salt-cellar at breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 38]: I reached for some of it as quick as I could to throw over my left shoulder and keep off the bad luck , but Miss Watson was in ahead of me , and crossed me off .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 20]: She says , `` Take your hands away , Huckleberry ; what a mess you are always making ! ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 28]: The widow put in a good word for me , but that war n't going to keep off the bad luck , I knowed that well enough .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 31]: I started out , after breakfast , feeling worried and shaky , and wondering where it was going to fall on me , and what it was going to be .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 39]: There is ways to keep off some kinds of bad luck , but this was n't one of them kind ; so I never tried to do anything , but just poked along low-spirited and on the watch-out .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 21]: I went down to the front garden and clumb over the stile where you go through the high board fence .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 18]: There was an inch of new snow on the ground , and I seen somebody 's tracks .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 24]: They had come up from the quarry and stood around the stile a while , and then went on around the garden fence .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 14]: It was funny they had n't come in , after standing around so .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 7]: I could n't make it out .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 7]: It was very curious , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 18]: I was going to follow around , but I stooped down to look at the tracks first .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 13]: I did n't notice anything at first , but next I did .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 19]: There was a cross in the left boot-heel made with big nails , to keep off the devil .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 12]: I was up in a second and shinning down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 17]: I looked over my shoulder every now and then , but I did n't see nobody .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 14]: I was at Judge Thatcher 's as quick as I could get there .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 16]: He said : `` Why , my boy , you are all out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 8]: Did you come for your interest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 17]: `` No , sir , '' I says ; `` is there some for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 19]: `` Oh , yes , a half-yearly is in last night -- over a hundred and fifty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 6]: Quite a fortune for you .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 24]: You had better let me invest it along with your six thousand , because if you take it you 'll spend it . ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 18]: `` No , sir , '' I says , `` I do n't want to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 15]: I do n't want it at all -- nor the six thousand , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 22]: I want you to take it ; I want to give it to you -- the six thousand and all . ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 4]: He looked surprised .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 9]: He could n't seem to make it out .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 15]: He says : `` Why , what can you mean , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 16]: I says , `` Do n't you ask me no questions about it , please .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 10]: You 'll take it -- wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 10]: He says : `` Well , I 'm puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 6]: Is something the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 28]: `` Please take it , '' says I , `` and do n't ask me nothing -- then I wo n't have to tell no lies . ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 13]: He studied a while , and then he says : `` Oho-o !
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 5]: I think I see .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 14]: You want to SELL all your property to me -- not give it .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 7]: That 's the correct idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 28]: Then he wrote something on a paper and read it over , and says : `` There ; you see it says ` for a consideration . '
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 14]: That means I have bought it of you and paid you for it .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 7]: Here 's a dollar for you .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 6]: Now you sign it . ''
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 8]: So I signed it , and left .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 38]: Miss Watson 's nigger , Jim , had a hair-ball as big as your fist , which had been took out of the fourth stomach of an ox , and he used to do magic with it .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 15]: He said there was a spirit inside of it , and it knowed everything .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 24]: So I went to him that night and told him pap was here again , for I found his tracks in the snow .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 21]: What I wanted to know was , what he was going to do , and was he going to stay ?
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 24]: Jim got out his hair-ball and said something over it , and then he held it up and dropped it on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 12]: It fell pretty solid , and only rolled about an inch .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 17]: Jim tried it again , and then another time , and it acted just the same .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 16]: Jim got down on his knees , and put his ear against it and listened .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 14]: But it war n't no use ; he said it would n't talk .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 10]: He said sometimes it would n't talk without money .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 59]: I told him I had an old slick counterfeit quarter that war n't no good because the brass showed through the silver a little , and it would n't pass nohow , even if the brass did n't show , because it was so slick it felt greasy , and so that would tell on it every time .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 18]: -LRB- I reckoned I would n't say nothing about the dollar I got from the judge . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 25]: I said it was pretty bad money , but maybe the hair-ball would take it , because maybe it would n't know the difference .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 24]: Jim smelt it and bit it and rubbed it , and said he would manage so the hair-ball would think it was good .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 59]: He said he would split open a raw Irish potato and stick the quarter in between and keep it there all night , and next morning you could n't see no brass , and it would n't feel greasy no more , and so anybody in town would take it in a minute , let alone a hair-ball .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 17]: Well , I knowed a potato would do that before , but I had forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 15]: Jim put the quarter under the hair-ball , and got down and listened again .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 10]: This time he said the hair-ball was all right .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 14]: He said it would tell my whole fortune if I wanted it to .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 6]: I says , go on .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 14]: So the hair-ball talked to Jim , and Jim told it to me .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 19]: He says : `` Yo ' ole father doan ' know yit what he 's a-gwyne to do .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 18]: Sometimes he spec he 'll go ` way , en den agin he spec he 'll stay .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 19]: De bes ' way is to res ' easy en let de ole man take his own way .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 12]: Dey 's two angels hoverin ' roun ' ` bout him .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 16]: One uv 'em is white en shiny , en t ` other one is black .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 24]: De white one gits him to go right a little while , den de black one sail in en bust it all up .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 17]: A body ca n't tell yit which one gwyne to fetch him at de las ' .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 6]: But you is all right .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 15]: You gwyne to have considable trouble in yo ' life , en considable joy .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 26]: Sometimes you gwyne to git hurt , en sometimes you gwyne to git sick ; but every time you 's gwyne to git well agin .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 14]: Dey 's two gals flyin ' ` bout you in yo ' life .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 13]: One uv 'em 's light en t ` other one is dark .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 11]: One is rich en t ` other is po ' .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 18]: You 's gwyne to marry de po ' one fust en de rich one by en by .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 39]: You wants to keep ` way fum de water as much as you kin , en do n't run no resk , ` kase it 's down in de bills dat you 's gwyne to git hung . ''
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 21]: When I lit my candle and went up to my room that night there sat pap -- his own self !
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 9]: CHAPTER V. I HAD shut the door to .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 9]: Then I turned around and there he was .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 17]: I used to be scared of him all the time , he tanned me so much .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 60]: I reckoned I was scared now , too ; but in a minute I see I was mistaken -- that is , after the first jolt , as you may say , when my breath sort of hitched , he being so unexpected ; but right away after I see I war n't scared of him worth bothring about .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 10]: He was most fifty , and he looked it .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 27]: His hair was long and tangled and greasy , and hung down , and you could see his eyes shining through like he was behind vines .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 16]: It was all black , no gray ; so was his long , mixed-up whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 52]: There war n't no color in his face , where his face showed ; it was white ; not like another man 's white , but a white to make a body sick , a white to make a body 's flesh crawl -- a tree-toad white , a fish-belly white .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 12]: As for his clothes -- just rags , that was all .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 35]: He had one ankle resting on t ` other knee ; the boot on that foot was busted , and two of his toes stuck through , and he worked them now and then .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 22]: His hat was laying on the floor -- an old black slouch with the top caved in , like a lid .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 21]: I stood a-looking at him ; he set there a-looking at me , with his chair tilted back a little .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 6]: I set the candle down .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 16]: I noticed the window was up ; so he had clumb in by the shed .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 7]: He kept a-looking me all over .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 12]: By and by he says : `` Starchy clothes -- very .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 16]: You think you 're a good deal of a big-bug , DO N'T you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 14]: `` Maybe I am , maybe I ai n't , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 16]: `` Do n't you give me none o ' your lip , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 13]: `` You 've put on considerable many frills since I been away .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 14]: I 'll take you down a peg before I get done with you .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 14]: You 're educated , too , they say -- can read and write .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 20]: You think you 're better 'n your father , now , do n't you , because he ca n't ?
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 8]: I 'LL take it out of you .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 14]: Who told you you might meddle with such hifalut 'n foolishness , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 8]: -- who told you you could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 4]: `` The widow .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 5]: She told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 6]: `` The widow , hey ?
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 24]: -- and who told the widow she could put in her shovel about a thing that ai n't none of her business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 7]: `` Nobody never told her . ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 11]: `` Well , I 'll learn her how to meddle .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 12]: And looky here -- you drop that school , you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 28]: I 'll learn people to bring up a boy to put on airs over his own father and let on to be better 'n what HE is .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 14]: You lem me catch you fooling around that school again , you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 18]: Your mother could n't read , and she could n't write , nuther , before she died .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 10]: None of the family could n't before THEY died .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 14]: I ca n't ; and here you 're a-swelling yourself up like this .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 12]: I ai n't the man to stand it -- you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 9]: Say , lem me hear you read . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 15]: I took up a book and begun something about General Washington and the wars .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 26]: When I 'd read about a half a minute , he fetched the book a whack with his hand and knocked it across the house .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 8]: He says : `` It 's so .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 5]: You can do it .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 9]: I had my doubts when you told me .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 11]: Now looky here ; you stop that putting on frills .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 6]: I wo n't have it .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 23]: I 'll lay for you , my smarty ; and if I catch you about that school I 'll tan you good .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 10]: First you know you 'll get religion , too .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 8]: I never see such a son . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 25]: He took up a little blue and yaller picture of some cows and a boy , and says : `` What 's this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 14]: `` It 's something they give me for learning my lessons good . ''
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 24]: He tore it up , and says : `` I 'll give you something better -- I 'll give you a cowhide . ''
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 24]: He set there a-mumbling and a-growling a minute , and then he says : `` AI N'T you a sweet-scented dandy , though ?
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 36]: A bed ; and bedclothes ; and a look 'n' - glass ; and a piece of carpet on the floor -- and your own father got to sleep with the hogs in the tanyard .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 7]: I never see such a son .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 21]: I bet I 'll take some o ' these frills out o ' you before I 'm done with you .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 17]: Why , there ai n't no end to your airs -- they say you 're rich .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 2]: Hey ?
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 6]: -- how 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 9]: `` They lie -- that 's how . ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 29]: `` Looky here -- mind how you talk to me ; I 'm a-standing about all I can stand now -- so do n't gim me no sass .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 21]: I 've been in town two days , and I hai n't heard nothing but about you bein ' rich .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 11]: I heard about it away down the river , too .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 6]: That 's why I come .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 12]: You git me that money to-morrow -- I want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 9]: `` I hai n't got no money . ''
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 6]: `` It 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 6]: Judge Thatcher 's got it .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 4]: You git it .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 5]: I want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 12]: `` I hai n't got no money , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 13]: You ask Judge Thatcher ; he 'll tell you the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 22]: I 'll ask him ; and I 'll make him pungle , too , or I 'll know the reason why .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 10]: Say , how much you got in your pocket ?
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 5]: I want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 36]: `` I hai n't got only a dollar , and I want that to -- '' `` It do n't make no difference what you want it for -- you just shell it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 37]: He took it and bit it to see if it was good , and then he said he was going down town to get some whisky ; said he had n't had a drink all day .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 74]: When he had got out on the shed he put his head in again , and cussed me for putting on frills and trying to be better than him ; and when I reckoned he was gone he come back and put his head in again , and told me to mind about that school , because he was going to lay for me and lick me if I did n't drop that .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 44]: Next day he was drunk , and he went to Judge Thatcher 's and bullyragged him , and tried to make him give up the money ; but he could n't , and then he swore he 'd make the law force him .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 76]: The judge and the widow went to law to get the court to take me away from him and let one of them be my guardian ; but it was a new judge that had just come , and he did n't know the old man ; so he said courts must n't interfere and separate families if they could help it ; said he 'd druther not take a child away from its father .
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 13]: So Judge Thatcher and the widow had to quit on the business .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 11]: That pleased the old man till he could n't rest .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 22]: He said he 'd cowhide me till I was black and blue if I did n't raise some money for him .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 68]: I borrowed three dollars from Judge Thatcher , and pap took it and got drunk , and went a-blowing around and cussing and whooping and carrying on ; and he kept it up all over town , with a tin pan , till most midnight ; then they jailed him , and next day they had him before court , and jailed him again for a week .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 24]: But he said HE was satisfied ; said he was boss of his son , and he 'd make it warm for HIM .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 18]: When he got out the new judge said he was a-going to make a man of him .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 42]: So he took him to his own house , and dressed him up clean and nice , and had him to breakfast and dinner and supper with the family , and was just old pie to him , so to speak .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 69]: And after supper he talked to him about temperance and such things till the old man cried , and said he 'd been a fool , and fooled away his life ; but now he was a-going to turn over a new leaf and be a man nobody would n't be ashamed of , and he hoped the judge would help him and not look down on him .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 44]: The judge said he could hug him for them words ; so he cried , and his wife she cried again ; pap said he 'd been a man that had always been misunderstood before , and the judge said he believed it .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 28]: The old man said that what a man wanted that was down was sympathy , and the judge said it was so ; so they cried again .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 37]: And when it was bedtime the old man rose up and held out his hand , and says : `` Look at it , gentlemen and ladies all ; take a-hold of it ; shake it .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 45]: There 's a hand that was the hand of a hog ; but it ai n't so no more ; it 's the hand of a man that 's started in on a new life , and 'll die before he 'll go back .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 12]: You mark them words -- do n't forget I said them .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 16]: It 's a clean hand now ; shake it -- do n't be afeard . ''
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 16]: So they shook it , one after the other , all around , and cried .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 8]: The judge 's wife she kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 13]: Then the old man he signed a pledge -- made his mark .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 16]: The judge said it was the holiest time on record , or something like that .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 101]: Then they tucked the old man into a beautiful room , which was the spare room , and in the night some time he got powerful thirsty and clumb out on to the porch-roof and slid down a stanchion and traded his new coat for a jug of forty-rod , and clumb back again and had a good old time ; and towards daylight he crawled out again , drunk as a fiddler , and rolled off the porch and broke his left arm in two places , and was most froze to death when somebody found him after sun-up .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 21]: And when they come to look at that spare room they had to take soundings before they could navigate it .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 8]: The judge he felt kind of sore .
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 26]: He said he reckoned a body could reform the old man with a shotgun , maybe , but he did n't know no other way .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 3]: CHAPTER VI .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 44]: WELL , pretty soon the old man was up and around again , and then he went for Judge Thatcher in the courts to make him give up that money , and he went for me , too , for not stopping school .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 31]: He catched me a couple of times and thrashed me , but I went to school just the same , and dodged him or outrun him most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 22]: I did n't want to go to school much before , but I reckoned I 'd go now to spite pap .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 47]: That law trial was a slow business -- appeared like they war n't ever going to get started on it ; so every now and then I 'd borrow two or three dollars off of the judge for him , to keep from getting a cowhiding .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 31]: Every time he got money he got drunk ; and every time he got drunk he raised Cain around town ; and every time he raised Cain he got jailed .
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 15]: He was just suited -- this kind of thing was right in his line .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 33]: He got to hanging around the widow 's too much and so she told him at last that if he did n't quit using around there she would make trouble for him .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 7]: Well , WAS N'T he mad ?
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 12]: He said he would show who was Huck Finn 's boss .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 74]: So he watched out for me one day in the spring , and catched me , and took me up the river about three mile in a skiff , and crossed over to the Illinois shore where it was woody and there war n't no houses but an old log hut in a place where the timber was so thick you could n't find it if you did n't know where it was .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 19]: He kept me with him all the time , and I never got a chance to run off .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 22]: We lived in that old cabin , and he always locked the door and put the key under his head nights .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 26]: He had a gun which he had stole , I reckon , and we fished and hunted , and that was what we lived on .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 46]: Every little while he locked me in and went down to the store , three miles , to the ferry , and traded fish and game for whisky , and fetched it home and got drunk and had a good time , and licked me .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 62]: The widow she found out where I was by and by , and she sent a man over to try to get hold of me ; but pap drove him off with the gun , and it war n't long after that till I was used to being where I was , and liked it -- all but the cowhide part .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 24]: It was kind of lazy and jolly , laying off comfortable all day , smoking and fishing , and no books nor study .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 83]: Two months or more run along , and my clothes got to be all rags and dirt , and I did n't see how I 'd ever got to like it so well at the widow 's , where you had to wash , and eat on a plate , and comb up , and go to bed and get up regular , and be forever bothering over a book , and have old Miss Watson pecking at you all the time .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 10]: I did n't want to go back no more .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 27]: I had stopped cussing , because the widow did n't like it ; but now I took to it again because pap had n't no objections .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 16]: It was pretty good times up in the woods there , take it all around .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 21]: But by and by pap got too handy with his hick ` ry , and I could n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 6]: I was all over welts .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 15]: He got to going away so much , too , and locking me in .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 11]: Once he locked me in and was gone three days .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 5]: It was dreadful lonesome .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 19]: I judged he had got drownded , and I was n't ever going to get out any more .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 4]: I was scared .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 15]: I made up my mind I would fix up some way to leave there .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 21]: I had tried to get out of that cabin many a time , but I could n't find no way .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 16]: There war n't a window to it big enough for a dog to get through .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 13]: I could n't get up the chimbly ; it was too narrow .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 9]: The door was thick , solid oak slabs .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 58]: Pap was pretty careful not to leave a knife or anything in the cabin when he was away ; I reckon I had hunted the place over as much as a hundred times ; well , I was most all the time at it , because it was about the only way to put in the time .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 33]: But this time I found something at last ; I found an old rusty wood-saw without any handle ; it was laid in between a rafter and the clapboards of the roof .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 9]: I greased it up and went to work .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 35]: There was an old horse-blanket nailed against the logs at the far end of the cabin behind the table , to keep the wind from blowing through the chinks and putting the candle out .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 32]: I got under the table and raised the blanket , and went to work to saw a section of the big bottom log out -- big enough to let me through .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 28]: Well , it was a good long job , but I was getting towards the end of it when I heard pap 's gun in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 26]: I got rid of the signs of my work , and dropped the blanket and hid my saw , and pretty soon pap come in .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 15]: Pap war n't in a good humor -- so he was his natural self .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 13]: He said he was down town , and everything was going wrong .
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 45]: His lawyer said he reckoned he would win his lawsuit and get the money if they ever got started on the trial ; but then there was ways to put it off a long time , and Judge Thatcher knowed how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 35]: And he said people allowed there 'd be another trial to get me away from him and give me to the widow for my guardian , and they guessed it would win this time .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 33]: This shook me up considerable , because I did n't want to go back to the widow 's any more and be so cramped up and sivilized , as they called it .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 87]: Then the old man got to cussing , and cussed everything and everybody he could think of , and then cussed them all over again to make sure he had n't skipped any , and after that he polished off with a kind of a general cuss all round , including a considerable parcel of people which he did n't know the names of , and so called them what 's - his-name when he got to them , and went right along with his cussing .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 12]: He said he would like to see the widow get me .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 47]: He said he would watch out , and if they tried to come any such game on him he knowed of a place six or seven mile off to stow me in , where they might hunt till they dropped and they could n't find me .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 27]: That made me pretty uneasy again , but only for a minute ; I reckoned I would n't stay on hand till he got that chance .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 17]: The old man made me go to the skiff and fetch the things he had got .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 38]: There was a fifty-pound sack of corn meal , and a side of bacon , ammunition , and a four-gallon jug of whisky , and an old book and two newspapers for wadding , besides some tow .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 21]: I toted up a load , and went back and set down on the bow of the skiff to rest .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 30]: I thought it all over , and I reckoned I would walk off with the gun and some lines , and take to the woods when I run away .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 51]: I guessed I would n't stay in one place , but just tramp right across the country , mostly night times , and hunt and fish to keep alive , and so get so far away that the old man nor the widow could n't ever find me any more .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 22]: I judged I would saw out and leave that night if pap got drunk enough , and I reckoned he would .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 30]: I got so full of it I did n't notice how long I was staying till the old man hollered and asked me whether I was asleep or drownded .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 17]: I got the things all up to the cabin , and then it was about dark .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 26]: While I was cooking supper the old man took a swig or two and got sort of warmed up , and went to ripping again .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 25]: He had been drunk over in town , and laid in the gutter all night , and he was a sight to look at .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 15]: A body would a thought he was Adam -- he was just all mud .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 25]: Whenever his liquor begun to work he most always went for the govment , this time he says : `` Call this a govment !
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 13]: why , just look at it and see what it 's like .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 40]: Here 's the law a-standing ready to take a man 's son away from him -- a man 's own son , which he has had all the trouble and all the anxiety and all the expense of raising .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 42]: Yes , just as that man has got that son raised at last , and ready to go to work and begin to do suthin ' for HIM and give him a rest , the law up and goes for him .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: And they call THAT govment !
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 7]: That ai n't all , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 20]: The law backs that old Judge Thatcher up and helps him to keep me out o ' my property .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 49]: Here 's what the law does : The law takes a man worth six thousand dollars and up ` ards , and jams him into an old trap of a cabin like this , and lets him go round in clothes that ai n't fitten for a hog .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: They call that govment !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 13]: A man ca n't get his rights in a govment like this .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 16]: Sometimes I 've a mighty notion to just leave the country for good and all .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 17]: Yes , and I TOLD 'em so ; I told old Thatcher so to his face .
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 13]: Lots of 'em heard me , and can tell what I said .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 19]: Says I , for two cents I 'd leave the blamed country and never come a-near it agin .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 6]: Them 's the very words .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 59]: I says look at my hat -- if you call it a hat -- but the lid raises up and the rest of it goes down till it 's below my chin , and then it ai n't rightly a hat at all , but more like my head was shoved up through a jint o ' stove-pipe .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 30]: Look at it , says I -- such a hat for me to wear -- one of the wealthiest men in this town if I could git my rights .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 13]: `` Oh , yes , this is a wonderful govment , wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 5]: Why , looky here .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 20]: There was a free nigger there from Ohio -- a mulatter , most as white as a white man .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 60]: He had the whitest shirt on you ever see , too , and the shiniest hat ; and there ai n't a man in that town that 's got as fine clothes as what he had ; and he had a gold watch and chain , and a silver-headed cane -- the awfulest old gray-headed nabob in the State .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 6]: And what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 24]: They said he was a p ` fessor in a college , and could talk all kinds of languages , and knowed everything .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 7]: And that ai n't the wust .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 11]: They said he could VOTE when he was at home .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 7]: Well , that let me out .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 10]: Thinks I , what is the country a-coming to ?
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 50]: It was ` lection day , and I was just about to go and vote myself if I war n't too drunk to get there ; but when they told me there was a State in this country where they 'd let that nigger vote , I drawed out .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 8]: I says I 'll never vote agin .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 33]: Them 's the very words I said ; they all heard me ; and the country may rot for all me -- I 'll never vote agin as long as I live .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 32]: And to see the cool way of that nigger -- why , he would n't a give me the road if I had n't shoved him out o ' the way .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 18]: I says to the people , why ai n't this nigger put up at auction and sold ?
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 9]: -- that 's what I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 8]: And what do you reckon they said ?
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 29]: Why , they said he could n't be sold till he 'd been in the State six months , and he had n't been there that long yet .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: There , now -- that 's a specimen .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 22]: They call that a govment that ca n't sell a free nigger till he 's been in the State six months .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 131]: Here 's a govment that calls itself a govment , and lets on to be a govment , and thinks it is a govment , and yet 's got to set stock-still for six whole months before it can take a hold of a prowling , thieving , infernal , white-shirted free nigger , and -- '' Pap was agoing on so he never noticed where his old limber legs was taking him to , so he went head over heels over the tub of salt pork and barked both shins , and the rest of his speech was all the hottest kind of language -- mostly hove at the nigger and the govment , though he give the tub some , too , all along , here and there .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 49]: He hopped around the cabin considerable , first on one leg and then on the other , holding first one shin and then the other one , and at last he let out with his left foot all of a sudden and fetched the tub a rattling kick .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 75]: But it war n't good judgment , because that was the boot that had a couple of his toes leaking out of the front end of it ; so now he raised a howl that fairly made a body 's hair raise , and down he went in the dirt , and rolled there , and held his toes ; and the cussing he done then laid over anything he had ever done previous .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 8]: He said so his own self afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 34]: He had heard old Sowberry Hagan in his best days , and he said it laid over him , too ; but I reckon that was sort of piling it on , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 22]: After supper pap took the jug , and said he had enough whisky there for two drunks and one delirium tremens .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 6]: That was always his word .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 31]: I judged he would be blind drunk in about an hour , and then I would steal the key , or saw myself out , one or t ` other .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 23]: He drank and drank , and tumbled down on his blankets by and by ; but luck did n't run my way .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 11]: He did n't go sound asleep , but was uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 16]: He groaned and moaned and thrashed around this way and that for a long time .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 37]: At last I got so sleepy I could n't keep my eyes open all I could do , and so before I knowed what I was about I was sound asleep , and the candle burning .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 25]: I do n't know how long I was asleep , but all of a sudden there was an awful scream and I was up .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 17]: There was pap looking wild , and skipping around every which way and yelling about snakes .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 37]: He said they was crawling up his legs ; and then he would give a jump and scream , and say one had bit him on the cheek -- but I could n't see no snakes .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 16]: He started and run round and round the cabin , hollering `` Take him off !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 4]: take him off !
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 9]: he 's biting me on the neck ! ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 12]: I never see a man look so wild in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 50]: Pretty soon he was all fagged out , and fell down panting ; then he rolled over and over wonderful fast , kicking things every which way , and striking and grabbing at the air with his hands , and screaming and saying there was devils a-hold of him .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 15]: He wore out by and by , and laid still a while , moaning .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 12]: Then he laid stiller , and did n't make a sound .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 20]: I could hear the owls and the wolves away off in the woods , and it seemed terrible still .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 8]: He was laying over by the corner .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 18]: By and by he raised up part way and listened , with his head to one side .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 36]: He says , very low : `` Tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; that 's the dead ; tramp -- tramp -- tramp ; they 're coming after me ; but I wo n't go .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 6]: Oh , they 're here !
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 8]: do n't touch me -- do n't !
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: hands off -- they 're cold ; let go .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 9]: Oh , let a poor devil alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 45]: Then he went down on all fours and crawled off , begging them to let him alone , and he rolled himself up in his blanket and wallowed in under the old pine table , still a-begging ; and then he went to crying .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 8]: I could hear him through the blanket .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 24]: By and by he rolled out and jumped up on his feet looking wild , and he see me and went for me .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 37]: He chased me round and round the place with a clasp-knife , calling me the Angel of Death , and saying he would kill me , and then I could n't come for him no more .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 31]: I begged , and told him I was only Huck ; but he laughed SUCH a screechy laugh , and roared and cussed , and kept on chasing me up .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 46]: Once when I turned short and dodged under his arm he made a grab and got me by the jacket between my shoulders , and I thought I was gone ; but I slid out of the jacket quick as lightning , and saved myself .
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 30]: Pretty soon he was all tired out , and dropped down with his back against the door , and said he would rest a minute and then kill me .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 25]: He put his knife under him , and said he would sleep and get strong , and then he would see who was who .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 7]: So he dozed off pretty soon .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 30]: By and by I got the old split-bottom chair and clumb up as easy as I could , not to make any noise , and got down the gun .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 38]: I slipped the ramrod down it to make sure it was loaded , then I laid it across the turnip barrel , pointing towards pap , and set down behind it to wait for him to stir .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 11]: And how slow and still the time did drag along .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 3]: CHAPTER VII .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 4]: `` GIT up !
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 6]: What you ` bout ? ''
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 16]: I opened my eyes and looked around , trying to make out where I was .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 12]: It was after sun-up , and I had been sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 12]: Pap was standing over me looking sour and sick , too .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 13]: He says : `` What you doin ' with this gun ? ''
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 33]: I judged he did n't know nothing about what he had been doing , so I says : `` Somebody tried to get in , so I was laying for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 10]: `` Why did n't you roust me out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 19]: `` Well , I tried to , but I could n't ; I could n't budge you . ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 6]: `` Well , all right .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 25]: Do n't stand there palavering all day , but out with you and see if there 's a fish on the lines for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 9]: I 'll be along in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 13]: He unlocked the door , and I cleared out up the river-bank .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 28]: I noticed some pieces of limbs and such things floating down , and a sprinkling of bark ; so I knowed the river had begun to rise .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 16]: I reckoned I would have great times now if I was over at the town .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 56]: The June rise used to be always luck for me ; because as soon as that rise begins here comes cordwood floating down , and pieces of log rafts -- sometimes a dozen logs together ; so all you have to do is to catch them and sell them to the wood-yards and the sawmill .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 26]: I went along up the bank with one eye out for pap and t ` other one out for what the rise might fetch along .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 29]: Well , all at once here comes a canoe ; just a beauty , too , about thirteen or fourteen foot long , riding high like a duck .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 23]: I shot head-first off of the bank like a frog , clothes and all on , and struck out for the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 42]: I just expected there 'd be somebody laying down in it , because people often done that to fool folks , and when a chap had pulled a skiff out most to it they 'd raise up and laugh at him .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 8]: But it war n't so this time .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 16]: It was a drift-canoe sure enough , and I clumb in and paddled her ashore .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 20]: Thinks I , the old man will be glad when he sees this -- she 's worth ten dollars .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 91]: But when I got to shore pap was n't in sight yet , and as I was running her into a little creek like a gully , all hung over with vines and willows , I struck another idea : I judged I 'd hide her good , and then , ` stead of taking to the woods when I run off , I 'd go down the river about fifty mile and camp in one place for good , and not have such a rough time tramping on foot .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 61]: It was pretty close to the shanty , and I thought I heard the old man coming all the time ; but I got her hid ; and then I out and looked around a bunch of willows , and there was the old man down the path a piece just drawing a bead on a bird with his gun .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 7]: So he had n't seen anything .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 17]: When he got along I was hard at it taking up a `` trot '' line .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 29]: He abused me a little for being so slow ; but I told him I fell in the river , and that was what made me so long .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 17]: I knowed he would see I was wet , and then he would be asking questions .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 11]: We got five catfish off the lines and went home .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 72]: While we laid off after breakfast to sleep up , both of us being about wore out , I got to thinking that if I could fix up some way to keep pap and the widow from trying to follow me , it would be a certainer thing than trusting to luck to get far enough off before they missed me ; you see , all kinds of things might happen .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 49]: Well , I did n't see no way for a while , but by and by pap raised up a minute to drink another barrel of water , and he says : `` Another time a man comes a-prowling round here you roust me out , you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 9]: That man war n't here for no good .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 6]: I 'd a shot him .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 11]: Next time you roust me out , you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 24]: Then he dropped down and went to sleep again ; but what he had been saying give me the very idea I wanted .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 19]: I says to myself , I can fix it now so nobody wo n't think of following me .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 13]: About twelve o'clock we turned out and went along up the bank .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 18]: The river was coming up pretty fast , and lots of driftwood going by on the rise .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 16]: By and by along comes part of a log raft -- nine logs fast together .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 11]: We went out with the skiff and towed it ashore .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 5]: Then we had dinner .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 27]: Anybody but pap would a waited and seen the day through , so as to catch more stuff ; but that war n't pap 's style .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 18]: Nine logs was enough for one time ; he must shove right over to town and sell .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 20]: So he locked me in and took the skiff , and started off towing the raft about half-past three .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 10]: I judged he would n't come back that night .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 28]: I waited till I reckoned he had got a good start ; then I out with my saw , and went to work on that log again .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 32]: Before he was t ` other side of the river I was out of the hole ; him and his raft was just a speck on the water away off yonder .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 44]: I took the sack of corn meal and took it to where the canoe was hid , and shoved the vines and branches apart and put it in ; then I done the same with the side of bacon ; then the whisky-jug .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 51]: I took all the coffee and sugar there was , and all the ammunition ; I took the wadding ; I took the bucket and gourd ; I took a dipper and a tin cup , and my old saw and two blankets , and the skillet and the coffee-pot .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 16]: I took fish-lines and matches and other things -- everything that was worth a cent .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 6]: I cleaned out the place .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 30]: I wanted an axe , but there was n't any , only the one out at the woodpile , and I knowed why I was going to leave that .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 12]: I fetched out the gun , and now I was done .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 20]: I had wore the ground a good deal crawling out of the hole and dragging out so many things .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 28]: So I fixed that as good as I could from the outside by scattering dust on the place , which covered up the smoothness and the sawdust .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 42]: Then I fixed the piece of log back into its place , and put two rocks under it and one against it to hold it there , for it was bent up at that place and did n't quite touch ground .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 46]: If you stood four or five foot away and did n't know it was sawed , you would n't never notice it ; and besides , this was the back of the cabin , and it war n't likely anybody would go fooling around there .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 17]: It was all grass clear to the canoe , so I had n't left a track .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 6]: I followed around to see .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 12]: I stood on the bank and looked out over the river .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 3]: All safe .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 45]: So I took the gun and went up a piece into the woods , and was hunting around for some birds when I see a wild pig ; hogs soon went wild in them bottoms after they had got away from the prairie farms .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 10]: I shot this fellow and took him into camp .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 10]: I took the axe and smashed in the door .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 10]: I beat it and hacked it considerable a-doing it .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 48]: I fetched the pig in , and took him back nearly to the table and hacked into his throat with the axe , and laid him down on the ground to bleed ; I say ground because it was ground -- hard packed , and no boards .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 59]: Well , next I took an old sack and put a lot of big rocks in it -- all I could drag -- and I started it from the pig , and dragged it to the door and through the woods down to the river and dumped it in , and down it sunk , out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 13]: You could easy see that something had been dragged over the ground .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 28]: I did wish Tom Sawyer was there ; I knowed he would take an interest in this kind of business , and throw in the fancy touches .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 14]: Nobody could spread himself like Tom Sawyer in such a thing as that .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 33]: Well , last I pulled out some of my hair , and blooded the axe good , and stuck it on the back side , and slung the axe in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 39]: Then I took up the pig and held him to my breast with my jacket -LRB- so he could n't drip -RRB- till I got a good piece below the house and then dumped him into the river .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 7]: Now I thought of something else .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 25]: So I went and got the bag of meal and my old saw out of the canoe , and fetched them to the house .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 46]: I took the bag to where it used to stand , and ripped a hole in the bottom of it with the saw , for there war n't no knives and forks on the place -- pap done everything with his clasp-knife about the cooking .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 47]: Then I carried the sack about a hundred yards across the grass and through the willows east of the house , to a shallow lake that was five mile wide and full of rushes -- and ducks too , you might say , in the season .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 35]: There was a slough or a creek leading out of it on the other side that went miles away , I do n't know where , but it did n't go to the river .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 16]: The meal sifted out and made a little track all the way to the lake .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 20]: I dropped pap 's whetstone there too , so as to look like it had been done by accident .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 33]: Then I tied up the rip in the meal sack with a string , so it would n't leak no more , and took it and my saw to the canoe again .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 31]: It was about dark now ; so I dropped the canoe down the river under some willows that hung over the bank , and waited for the moon to rise .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 34]: I made fast to a willow ; then I took a bite to eat , and by and by laid down in the canoe to smoke a pipe and lay out a plan .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 26]: I says to myself , they 'll follow the track of that sackful of rocks to the shore and then drag the river for me .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 33]: And they 'll follow that meal track to the lake and go browsing down the creek that leads out of it to find the robbers that killed me and took the things .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 14]: They wo n't ever hunt the river for anything but my dead carcass .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 17]: They 'll soon get tired of that , and wo n't bother no more about me .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 11]: All right ; I can stop anywhere I want to .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 22]: Jackson 's Island is good enough for me ; I know that island pretty well , and nobody ever comes there .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 20]: And then I can paddle over to town nights , and slink around and pick up things I want .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 7]: Jackson 's Island 's the place .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 15]: I was pretty tired , and the first thing I knowed I was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 15]: When I woke up I did n't know where I was for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 11]: I set up and looked around , a little scared .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 4]: Then I remembered .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 8]: The river looked miles and miles across .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 28]: The moon was so bright I could a counted the drift logs that went a-slipping along , black and still , hundreds of yards out from shore .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 14]: Everything was dead quiet , and it looked late , and SMELT late .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 17]: You know what I mean -- I do n't know the words to put it in .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 27]: I took a good gap and a stretch , and was just going to unhitch and start when I heard a sound away over the water .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 3]: I listened .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 7]: Pretty soon I made it out .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 23]: It was that dull kind of a regular sound that comes from oars working in rowlocks when it 's a still night .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 21]: I peeped out through the willow branches , and there it was -- a skiff , away across the water .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 10]: I could n't tell how many was in it .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 22]: It kept a-coming , and when it was abreast of me I see there war n't but one man in it .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 16]: Think 's I , maybe it 's pap , though I war n't expecting him .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 39]: He dropped below me with the current , and by and by he came a-swinging up shore in the easy water , and he went by so close I could a reached out the gun and touched him .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 22]: Well , it WAS pap , sure enough -- and sober , too , by the way he laid his oars .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 7]: I did n't lose no time .
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 18]: The next minute I was a-spinning down stream soft but quick in the shade of the bank .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 46]: I made two mile and a half , and then struck out a quarter of a mile or more towards the middle of the river , because pretty soon I would be passing the ferry landing , and people might see me and hail me .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 22]: I got out amongst the driftwood , and then laid down in the bottom of the canoe and let her float .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 29]: I laid there , and had a good rest and a smoke out of my pipe , looking away into the sky ; not a cloud in it .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 23]: The sky looks ever so deep when you lay down on your back in the moonshine ; I never knowed it before .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 13]: And how far a body can hear on the water such nights !
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 9]: I heard people talking at the ferry landing .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 13]: I heard what they said , too -- every word of it .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 16]: One man said it was getting towards the long days and the short nights now .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 63]: T'other one said THIS war n't one of the short ones , he reckoned -- and then they laughed , and he said it over again , and they laughed again ; then they waked up another fellow and told him , and laughed , but he did n't laugh ; he ripped out something brisk , and said let him alone .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 40]: The first fellow said he ` lowed to tell it to his old woman -- she would think it was pretty good ; but he said that war n't nothing to some things he had said in his time .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 25]: I heard one man say it was nearly three o'clock , and he hoped daylight would n't wait more than about a week longer .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 45]: After that the talk got further and further away , and I could n't make out the words any more ; but I could hear the mumble , and now and then a laugh , too , but it seemed a long ways off .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 8]: I was away below the ferry now .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 46]: I rose up , and there was Jackson 's Island , about two mile and a half down stream , heavy timbered and standing up out of the middle of the river , big and dark and solid , like a steamboat without any lights .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 19]: There war n't any signs of the bar at the head -- it was all under water now .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 10]: It did n't take me long to get there .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 34]: I shot past the head at a ripping rate , the current was so swift , and then I got into the dead water and landed on the side towards the Illinois shore .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 42]: I run the canoe into a deep dent in the bank that I knowed about ; I had to part the willow branches to get in ; and when I made fast nobody could a seen the canoe from the outside .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 47]: I went up and set down on a log at the head of the island , and looked out on the big river and the black driftwood and away over to the town , three mile away , where there was three or four lights twinkling .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 24]: A monstrous big lumber-raft was about a mile up stream , coming along down , with a lantern in the middle of it .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 29]: I watched it come creeping down , and when it was most abreast of where I stood I heard a man say , `` Stern oars , there !
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 7]: heave her head to stabboard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 15]: I heard that just as plain as if the man was by my side .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 26]: There was a little gray in the sky now ; so I stepped into the woods , and laid down for a nap before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 3]: CHAPTER VIII .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 18]: THE sun was up so high when I waked that I judged it was after eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 23]: I laid there in the grass and the cool shade thinking about things , and feeling rested and ruther comfortable and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 28]: I could see the sun out at one or two holes , but mostly it was big trees all about , and gloomy in there amongst them .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 34]: There was freckled places on the ground where the light sifted down through the leaves , and the freckled places swapped about a little , showing there was a little breeze up there .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 15]: A couple of squirrels set on a limb and jabbered at me very friendly .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 17]: I was powerful lazy and comfortable -- did n't want to get up and cook breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 20]: Well , I was dozing off again when I thinks I hears a deep sound of `` boom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 5]: away up the river .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 19]: I rouses up , and rests on my elbow and listens ; pretty soon I hears it again .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 37]: I hopped up , and went and looked out at a hole in the leaves , and I see a bunch of smoke laying on the water a long ways up -- about abreast the ferry .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 12]: And there was the ferryboat full of people floating along down .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 8]: I knowed what was the matter now .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 4]: `` Boom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 13]: I see the white smoke squirt out of the ferryboat 's side .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 21]: You see , they was firing cannon over the water , trying to make my carcass come to the top .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 26]: I was pretty hungry , but it war n't going to do for me to start a fire , because they might see the smoke .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 14]: So I set there and watched the cannon-smoke and listened to the boom .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 41]: The river was a mile wide there , and it always looks pretty on a summer morning -- so I was having a good enough time seeing them hunt for my remainders if I only had a bite to eat .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 34]: Well , then I happened to think how they always put quicksilver in loaves of bread and float them off , because they always go right to the drownded carcass and stop there .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 28]: So , says I , I 'll keep a lookout , and if any of them 's floating around after me I 'll give them a show .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 23]: I changed to the Illinois edge of the island to see what luck I could have , and I war n't disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 27]: A big double loaf come along , and I most got it with a long stick , but my foot slipped and she floated out further .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 21]: Of course I was where the current set in the closest to the shore -- I knowed enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 15]: But by and by along comes another one , and this time I won .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 20]: I took out the plug and shook out the little dab of quicksilver , and set my teeth in .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 19]: It was `` baker 's bread '' -- what the quality eat ; none of your low-down corn-pone .
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 29]: I got a good place amongst the leaves , and set there on a log , munching the bread and watching the ferry-boat , and very well satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 6]: And then something struck me .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 30]: I says , now I reckon the widow or the parson or somebody prayed that this bread would find me , and here it has gone and done it .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 55]: So there ai n't no doubt but there is something in that thing -- that is , there 's something in it when a body like the widow or the parson prays , but it do n't work for me , and I reckon it do n't work for only just the right kind .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 16]: I lit a pipe and had a good long smoke , and went on watching .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 38]: The ferryboat was floating with the current , and I allowed I 'd have a chance to see who was aboard when she come along , because she would come in close , where the bread did .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 41]: When she 'd got pretty well along down towards me , I put out my pipe and went to where I fished out the bread , and laid down behind a log on the bank in a little open place .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 9]: Where the log forked I could peep through .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 25]: By and by she come along , and she drifted in so close that they could a run out a plank and walked ashore .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 7]: Most everybody was on the boat .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 33]: Pap , and Judge Thatcher , and Bessie Thatcher , and Jo Harper , and Tom Sawyer , and his old Aunt Polly , and Sid and Mary , and plenty more .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 47]: Everybody was talking about the murder , but the captain broke in and says : `` Look sharp , now ; the current sets in the closest here , and maybe he 's washed ashore and got tangled amongst the brush at the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 7]: I hope so , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 6]: I did n't hope so .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 25]: They all crowded up and leaned over the rails , nearly in my face , and kept still , watching with all their might .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 13]: I could see them first-rate , but they could n't see me .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 11]: Then the captain sung out : `` Stand away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 34]: and the cannon let off such a blast right before me that it made me deef with the noise and pretty near blind with the smoke , and I judged I was gone .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 21]: If they 'd a had some bullets in , I reckon they 'd a got the corpse they was after .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 13]: Well , I see I war n't hurt , thanks to goodness .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 16]: The boat floated on and went out of sight around the shoulder of the island .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 31]: I could hear the booming now and then , further and further off , and by and by , after an hour , I did n't hear it no more .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 7]: The island was three mile long .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 15]: I judged they had got to the foot , and was giving it up .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 8]: But they did n't yet a while .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 31]: They turned around the foot of the island and started up the channel on the Missouri side , under steam , and booming once in a while as they went .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 10]: I crossed over to that side and watched them .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 26]: When they got abreast the head of the island they quit shooting and dropped over to the Missouri shore and went home to the town .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 8]: I knowed I was all right now .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 8]: Nobody else would come a-hunting after me .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 19]: I got my traps out of the canoe and made me a nice camp in the thick woods .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 25]: I made a kind of a tent out of my blankets to put my things under so the rain could n't get at them .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 24]: I catched a catfish and haggled him open with my saw , and towards sundown I started my camp fire and had supper .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 13]: Then I set out a line to catch some fish for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 91]: When it was dark I set by my camp fire smoking , and feeling pretty well satisfied ; but by and by it got sort of lonesome , and so I went and set on the bank and listened to the current swashing along , and counted the stars and drift logs and rafts that come down , and then went to bed ; there ai n't no better way to put in time when you are lonesome ; you ca n't stay so , you soon get over it .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 8]: And so for three days and nights .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 8]: No difference -- just the same thing .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 13]: But the next day I went exploring around down through the island .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 35]: I was boss of it ; it all belonged to me , so to say , and I wanted to know all about it ; but mainly I wanted to put in the time .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 28]: I found plenty strawberries , ripe and prime ; and green summer grapes , and green razberries ; and the green blackberries was just beginning to show .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: They would all come handy by and by , I judged .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 24]: Well , I went fooling along in the deep woods till I judged I war n't far from the foot of the island .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 27]: I had my gun along , but I had n't shot nothing ; it was for protection ; thought I would kill some game nigh home .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 36]: About this time I mighty near stepped on a good-sized snake , and it went sliding off through the grass and flowers , and I after it , trying to get a shot at it .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 25]: I clipped along , and all of a sudden I bounded right on to the ashes of a camp fire that was still smoking .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 8]: My heart jumped up amongst my lungs .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 26]: I never waited for to look further , but uncocked my gun and went sneaking back on my tiptoes as fast as ever I could .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 28]: Every now and then I stopped a second amongst the thick leaves and listened , but my breath come so hard I could n't hear nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 19]: I slunk along another piece further , then listened again ; and so on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 51]: If I see a stump , I took it for a man ; if I trod on a stick and broke it , it made me feel like a person had cut one of my breaths in two and I only got half , and the short half , too .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 35]: When I got to camp I war n't feeling very brash , there war n't much sand in my craw ; but I says , this ai n't no time to be fooling around .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 46]: So I got all my traps into my canoe again so as to have them out of sight , and I put out the fire and scattered the ashes around to look like an old last year 's camp , and then clumb a tree .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 38]: I reckon I was up in the tree two hours ; but I did n't see nothing , I did n't hear nothing -- I only THOUGHT I heard and seen as much as a thousand things .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 32]: Well , I could n't stay up there forever ; so at last I got down , but I kept in the thick woods and on the lookout all the time .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 16]: All I could get to eat was berries and what was left over from breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 11]: By the time it was night I was pretty hungry .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 29]: So when it was good and dark I slid out from shore before moonrise and paddled over to the Illinois bank -- about a quarter of a mile .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 49]: I went out in the woods and cooked a supper , and I had about made up my mind I would stay there all night when I hear a PLUNKETY-PLUNK , PLUNKETY-PLUNK , and says to myself , horses coming ; and next I hear people 's voices .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 27]: I got everything into the canoe as quick as I could , and then went creeping through the woods to see what I could find out .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 32]: I had n't got far when I hear a man say : `` We better camp here if we can find a good place ; the horses is about beat out .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 6]: Let 's look around . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 13]: I did n't wait , but shoved out and paddled away easy .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 17]: I tied up in the old place , and reckoned I would sleep in the canoe .
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 6]: I did n't sleep much .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 9]: I could n't , somehow , for thinking .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 15]: And every time I waked up I thought somebody had me by the neck .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 10]: So the sleep did n't do me no good .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 41]: By and by I says to myself , I ca n't live this way ; I 'm a-going to find out who it is that 's here on the island with me ; I 'll find it out or bust .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 8]: Well , I felt better right off .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 28]: So I took my paddle and slid out from shore just a step or two , and then let the canoe drop along down amongst the shadows .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 19]: The moon was shining , and outside of the shadows it made it most as light as day .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 17]: I poked along well on to an hour , everything still as rocks and sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 16]: Well , by this time I was most down to the foot of the island .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 23]: A little ripply , cool breeze begun to blow , and that was as good as saying the night was about done .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 31]: I give her a turn with the paddle and brung her nose to shore ; then I got my gun and slipped out and into the edge of the woods .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 15]: I sat down there on a log , and looked out through the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 17]: I see the moon go off watch , and the darkness begin to blanket the river .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 21]: But in a little while I see a pale streak over the treetops , and knowed the day was coming .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 26]: So I took my gun and slipped off towards where I had run across that camp fire , stopping every minute or two to listen .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 17]: But I had n't no luck somehow ; I could n't seem to find the place .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 19]: But by and by , sure enough , I catched a glimpse of fire away through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 9]: I went for it , cautious and slow .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 21]: By and by I was close enough to have a look , and there laid a man on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 7]: It most give me the fan-tods .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 17]: He had a blanket around his head , and his head was nearly in the fire .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 24]: I set there behind a clump of bushes , in about six foot of him , and kept my eyes on him steady .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 7]: It was getting gray daylight now .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 21]: Pretty soon he gapped and stretched himself and hove off the blanket , and it was Miss Watson 's Jim !
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 9]: I bet I was glad to see him .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 9]: I says : `` Hello , Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 4]: and skipped out .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 9]: He bounced up and stared at me wild .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 25]: Then he drops down on his knees , and puts his hands together and says : `` Doan ' hurt me -- do n't !
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 12]: I hai n't ever done no harm to a ghos ' .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 14]: I alwuz liked dead people , en done all I could for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 35]: You go en git in de river agin , whah you b ` longs , en doan ' do nuffn to Ole Jim , ` at ` uz awluz yo ' fren ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 14]: Well , I war n't long making him understand I war n't dead .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 9]: I was ever so glad to see Jim .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 6]: I war n't lonesome now .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 16]: I told him I war n't afraid of HIM telling the people where I was .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 18]: I talked along , but he only set there and looked at me ; never said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 10]: Then I says : `` It 's good daylight .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 5]: Le 's get breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 8]: Make up your camp fire good . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 19]: `` What 's de use er makin ' up de camp fire to cook strawbries en sich truck ?
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 10]: But you got a gun , hai n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 10]: Den we kin git sumfn better den strawbries . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 10]: `` Strawberries and such truck , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 9]: `` Is that what you live on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 12]: `` I couldn ' git nuffn else , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 14]: `` Why , how long you been on the island , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 12]: `` I come heah de night arter you 's killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 8]: `` What , all that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 6]: `` Yes -- indeedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 16]: `` And ai n't you had nothing but that kind of rubbage to eat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 9]: `` No , sah -- nuffn else . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 14]: `` Well , you must be most starved , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 10]: `` I reck 'n I could eat a hoss .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 5]: I think I could .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 10]: How long you ben on de islan ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 9]: `` Since the night I got killed . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 10]: W ` y , what has you lived on ?
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 6]: But you got a gun .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 9]: Oh , yes , you got a gun .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 4]: Dat 's good .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 13]: Now you kill sumfn en I 'll make up de fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 62]: So we went over to where the canoe was , and while he built a fire in a grassy open place amongst the trees , I fetched meal and bacon and coffee , and coffee-pot and frying-pan , and sugar and tin cups , and the nigger was set back considerable , because he reckoned it was all done with witchcraft .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 21]: I catched a good big catfish , too , and Jim cleaned him with his knife , and fried him .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 15]: When breakfast was ready we lolled on the grass and eat it smoking hot .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 16]: Jim laid it in with all his might , for he was most about starved .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 15]: Then when we had got pretty well stuffed , we laid off and lazied .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 30]: By and by Jim says : `` But looky here , Huck , who wuz it dat ` uz killed in dat shanty ef it war n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 15]: Then I told him the whole thing , and he said it was smart .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 16]: He said Tom Sawyer could n't get up no better plan than what I had .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 23]: Then I says : `` How do you come to be here , Jim , and how 'd you get here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 14]: He looked pretty uneasy , and did n't say nothing for a minute .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 12]: Then he says : `` Maybe I better not tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 6]: `` Why , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 7]: `` Well , dey 's reasons .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 20]: But you wouldn ' tell on me ef I uz to tell you , would you , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 9]: `` Blamed if I would , Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 11]: `` Well , I b ` lieve you , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 7]: I -- I RUN OFF . ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: `` Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 23]: `` But mind , you said you wouldn ' tell -- you know you said you wouldn ' tell , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 6]: `` Well , I did .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 13]: I said I would n't , and I 'll stick to it .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 6]: Honest INJUN , I will .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 22]: People would call me a low-down Abolitionist and despise me for keeping mum -- but that do n't make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 17]: I ai n't a-going to tell , and I ai n't a-going back there , anyways .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 12]: So , now , le 's know all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: `` Well , you see , it ` uz dis way .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 35]: Ole missus -- dat 's Miss Watson -- she pecks on me all de time , en treats me pooty rough , but she awluz said she wouldn ' sell me down to Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 22]: But I noticed dey wuz a nigger trader roun ' de place considable lately , en I begin to git oneasy .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 74]: Well , one night I creeps to de do ' pooty late , en de do ' war n't quite shet , en I hear old missus tell de widder she gwyne to sell me down to Orleans , but she didn ' want to , but she could git eight hund 'd dollars for me , en it ` uz sich a big stack o ' money she couldn ' resis ' .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 25]: De widder she try to git her to say she wouldn ' do it , but I never waited to hear de res ' .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 10]: I lit out mighty quick , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 57]: `` I tuck out en shin down de hill , en ` spec to steal a skift ` long de sho ' som ` ers ` bove de town , but dey wuz people a-stirring yit , so I hid in de ole tumble-down cooper-shop on de bank to wait for everybody to go ` way .

Parsing [sent. 966 len. 20]: I ` uz powerful sorry you 's killed , Huck , but I ai n't no mo ' now .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 11]: `` I laid dah under de shavin 's all day .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 80]: I ` uz hungry , but I war n't afeard ; bekase I knowed ole missus en de widder wuz goin ' to start to de camp-meet 'n' right arter breakfas ' en be gone all day , en dey knows I goes off wid de cattle ` bout daylight , so dey wouldn ' ` spec to see me roun ' de place , en so dey wouldn ' miss me tell arter dark in de evenin ' .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 28]: De yuther servants wouldn ' miss me , kase dey 'd shin out en take holiday soon as de ole folks ` uz out 'n de way .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 31]: `` Well , when it come dark I tuck out up de river road , en went ` bout two mile er more to whah dey war n't no houses .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 15]: I 'd made up my mine ` bout what I 's agwyne to do .

Parsing [sent. 973 len. 19]: So I says , a raff is what I 's arter ; it doan ' MAKE no track .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 67]: `` I see a light a-comin ' roun ' de p ` int bymeby , so I wade ' in en shove ' a log ahead o ' me en swum more 'n half way acrost de river , en got in ` mongst de drift-wood , en kep ' my head down low , en kinder swum agin de current tell de raff come along .

Parsing [sent. 992 len. 7]: `` Well , that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 15]: You 've had to keep in the woods all the time , of course .

Parsing [sent. 997 len. 14]: I see um go by heah -- watched um thoo de bushes . ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 17]: Some young birds come along , flying a yard or two at a time and lighting .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 12]: Jim said it was a sign it was going to rain .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 28]: He said it was a sign when young chickens flew that way , and so he reckoned it was the same way when young birds done it .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 16]: I was going to catch some of them , but Jim would n't let me .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 6]: He said it was death .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 31]: He said his father laid mighty sick once , and some of them catched a bird , and his old granny said his father would die , and he did .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 24]: And Jim said you must n't count the things you are going to cook for dinner , because that would bring bad luck .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 10]: The same if you shook the table-cloth after sundown .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 40]: And he said if a man owned a beehive and that man died , the bees must be told about it before sun-up next morning , or else the bees would all weaken down and quit work and die .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 32]: Jim said bees would n't sting idiots ; but I did n't believe that , because I had tried them lots of times myself , and they would n't sting me .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 16]: I had heard about some of these things before , but not all of them .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 7]: Jim knowed all kinds of signs .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 7]: He said he knowed most everything .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 28]: I said it looked to me like all the signs was about bad luck , and so I asked him if there war n't any good-luck signs .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 18]: He says : `` Mighty few -- an ' DEY ai n't no use to a body .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 13]: What you want to know when good luck 's a-comin ' for ?
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 7]: Want to keep it off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 29]: And he said : `` Ef you 's got hairy arms en a hairy breas ' , it 's a sign dat you 's agwyne to be rich .

Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 6]: `` So I done it .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 20]: Den I reck 'n' d I 'd inves ' de thirty-five dollars right off en keep things a-movin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 66]: Dey wuz a nigger name ' Bob , dat had ketched a wood-flat , en his marster didn ' know it ; en I bought it off 'n him en told him to take de thirty-five dollars when de en ' er de year come ; but somebody stole de wood-flat dat night , en nex day de one-laigged nigger say de bank 's busted .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 12]: So dey didn ' none uv us git no money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 13]: `` What did you do with the ten cents , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 52]: `` Well , I ` uz gwyne to spen ' it , but I had a dream , en de dream tole me to give it to a nigger name ' Balum -- Balum 's Ass dey call him for short ; he 's one er dem chuckleheads , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 16]: But he 's lucky , dey say , en I see I war n't lucky .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 19]: De dream say let Balum inves ' de ten cents en he 'd make a raise for me .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 45]: Well , Balum he tuck de money , en when he wuz in church he hear de preacher say dat whoever give to de po ' len ' to de Lord , en boun ' to git his money back a hund 'd times .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 28]: So Balum he tuck en give de ten cents to de po ' , en laid low to see what wuz gwyne to come of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 12]: `` Well , what did come of it , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 7]: `` Nuffn never come of it .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 19]: I couldn ' manage to k ` leck dat money no way ; en Balum he couldn ' .

Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 26]: `` Well , it 's all right anyway , Jim , long as you 're going to be rich again some time or other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 15]: `` Yes ; en I 's rich now , come to look at it .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 13]: I owns mysef , en I 's wuth eight hund 'd dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 16]: I wisht I had de money , I wouldn ' want no mo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 3]: CHAPTER IX .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 50]: I WANTED to go and look at a place right about the middle of the island that I 'd found when I was exploring ; so we started and soon got to it , because the island was only three miles long and a quarter of a mile wide .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 16]: This place was a tolerable long , steep hill or ridge about forty foot high .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 21]: We had a rough time getting to the top , the sides was so steep and the bushes so thick .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 33]: We tramped and clumb around all over it , and by and by found a good big cavern in the rock , most up to the top on the side towards Illinois .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 22]: The cavern was as big as two or three rooms bunched together , and Jim could stand up straight in it .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 6]: It was cool in there .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 29]: Jim was for putting our traps in there right away , but I said we did n't want to be climbing up and down there all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 44]: Jim said if we had the canoe hid in a good place , and had all the traps in the cavern , we could rush there if anybody was to come to the island , and they would never find us without dogs .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 27]: And , besides , he said them little birds had said it was going to rain , and did I want the things to get wet ?
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 24]: So we went back and got the canoe , and paddled up abreast the cavern , and lugged all the traps up there .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 19]: Then we hunted up a place close by to hide the canoe in , amongst the thick willows .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 21]: We took some fish off of the lines and set them again , and begun to get ready for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 42]: The door of the cavern was big enough to roll a hogshead in , and on one side of the door the floor stuck out a little bit , and was flat and a good place to build a fire on .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 9]: So we built it there and cooked dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 16]: We spread the blankets inside for a carpet , and eat our dinner in there .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 14]: We put all the other things handy at the back of the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 21]: Pretty soon it darkened up , and begun to thunder and lighten ; so the birds was right about it .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 24]: Directly it begun to rain , and it rained like all fury , too , and I never see the wind blow so .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 9]: It was one of these regular summer storms .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 101]: It would get so dark that it looked all blue-black outside , and lovely ; and the rain would thrash along by so thick that the trees off a little ways looked dim and spider-webby ; and here would come a blast of wind that would bend the trees down and turn up the pale underside of the leaves ; and then a perfect ripper of a gust would follow along and set the branches to tossing their arms as if they was just wild ; and next , when it was just about the bluest and blackest -- FST !
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 99]: it was as bright as glory , and you 'd have a little glimpse of tree-tops a-plunging about away off yonder in the storm , hundreds of yards further than you could see before ; dark as sin again in a second , and now you 'd hear the thunder let go with an awful crash , and then go rumbling , grumbling , tumbling , down the sky towards the under side of the world , like rolling empty barrels down stairs -- where it 's long stairs and they bounce a good deal , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 11]: `` Jim , this is nice , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 12]: `` I would n't want to be nowhere else but here .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 13]: Pass me along another hunk of fish and some hot corn-bread . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 19]: `` Well , you would n't a ben here ' f it had n't a ben for Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 28]: You 'd a ben down dah in de woods widout any dinner , en gittn ' mos ' drownded , too ; dat you would , honey .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 18]: Chickens knows when it 's gwyne to rain , en so do de birds , chile . ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 22]: The river went on raising and raising for ten or twelve days , till at last it was over the banks .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 21]: The water was three or four foot deep on the island in the low places and on the Illinois bottom .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 41]: On that side it was a good many miles wide , but on the Missouri side it was the same old distance across -- a half a mile -- because the Missouri shore was just a wall of high bluffs .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 30]: Daytimes we paddled all over the island in the canoe , It was mighty cool and shady in the deep woods , even if the sun was blazing outside .
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 28]: We went winding in and out amongst the trees , and sometimes the vines hung so thick we had to back away and go some other way .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 71]: Well , on every old broken-down tree you could see rabbits and snakes and such things ; and when the island had been overflowed a day or two they got so tame , on account of being hungry , that you could paddle right up and put your hand on them if you wanted to ; but not the snakes and turtles -- they would slide off in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 11]: The ridge our cavern was in was full of them .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 12]: We could a had pets enough if we 'd wanted them .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 16]: One night we catched a little section of a lumber raft -- nice pine planks .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 30]: It was twelve foot wide and about fifteen or sixteen foot long , and the top stood above water six or seven inches -- a solid , level floor .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 25]: We could see saw-logs go by in the daylight sometimes , but we let them go ; we did n't show ourselves in daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 28]: Another night when we was up at the head of the island , just before daylight , here comes a frame-house down , on the west side .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 10]: She was a two-story , and tilted over considerable .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 14]: We paddled out and got aboard -- clumb in at an upstairs window .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 24]: But it was too dark to see yet , so we made the canoe fast and set in her to wait for daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 15]: The light begun to come before we got to the foot of the island .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 8]: Then we looked in at the window .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 35]: We could make out a bed , and a table , and two old chairs , and lots of things around about on the floor , and there was clothes hanging against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 17]: There was something laying on the floor in the far corner that looked like a man .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 10]: So Jim says : `` Hello , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 6]: But it did n't budge .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 21]: So I hollered again , and then Jim says : `` De man ai n't asleep -- he 's dead .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 11]: You hold still -- I 'll go en see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 19]: He went , and bent down and looked , and says : `` It 's a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 8]: Yes , indeedy ; naked , too .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 8]: He 's ben shot in de back .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 12]: I reck 'n he 's ben dead two er three days .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 19]: Come in , Huck , but doan ' look at his face -- it 's too gashly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 9]: I did n't look at him at all .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 23]: Jim throwed some old rags over him , but he need n't done it ; I did n't want to see him .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 46]: There was heaps of old greasy cards scattered around over the floor , and old whisky bottles , and a couple of masks made out of black cloth ; and all over the walls was the ignorantest kind of words and pictures made with charcoal .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 30]: There was two old dirty calico dresses , and a sun-bonnet , and some women 's underclothes hanging against the wall , and some men 's clothing , too .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 13]: We put the lot into the canoe -- it might come good .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 19]: There was a boy 's old speckled straw hat on the floor ; I took that , too .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 24]: And there was a bottle that had had milk in it , and it had a rag stopper for a baby to suck .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 12]: We would a took the bottle , but it was broke .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 17]: There was a seedy old chest , and an old hair trunk with the hinges broke .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 17]: They stood open , but there war n't nothing left in them that was any account .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 29]: The way things was scattered about we reckoned the people left in a hurry , and war n't fixed so as to carry off most of their stuff .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 155]: We got an old tin lantern , and a butcher-knife without any handle , and a bran-new Barlow knife worth two bits in any store , and a lot of tallow candles , and a tin candlestick , and a gourd , and a tin cup , and a ratty old bedquilt off the bed , and a reticule with needles and pins and beeswax and buttons and thread and all such truck in it , and a hatchet and some nails , and a fishline as thick as my little finger with some monstrous hooks on it , and a roll of buckskin , and a leather dog-collar , and a horseshoe , and some vials of medicine that did n't have no label on them ; and just as we was leaving I found a tolerable good curry-comb , and Jim he found a ratty old fiddle-bow , and a wooden leg .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 49]: The straps was broke off of it , but , barring that , it was a good enough leg , though it was too long for me and not long enough for Jim , and we could n't find the other one , though we hunted all around .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 14]: And so , take it all around , we made a good haul .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 58]: When we was ready to shove off we was a quarter of a mile below the island , and it was pretty broad day ; so I made Jim lay down in the canoe and cover up with the quilt , because if he set up people could tell he was a nigger a good ways off .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 19]: I paddled over to the Illinois shore , and drifted down most a half a mile doing it .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 21]: I crept up the dead water under the bank , and had n't no accidents and did n't see nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 6]: We got home all safe .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 3]: CHAPTER X .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 27]: AFTER breakfast I wanted to talk about the dead man and guess out how he come to be killed , but Jim did n't want to .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 48]: He said it would fetch bad luck ; and besides , he said , he might come and ha ` nt us ; he said a man that war n't buried was more likely to go a-ha ` nting around than one that was planted and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 38]: That sounded pretty reasonable , so I did n't say no more ; but I could n't keep from studying over it and wishing I knowed who shot the man , and what they done it for .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 25]: We rummaged the clothes we 'd got , and found eight dollars in silver sewed up in the lining of an old blanket overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 30]: Jim said he reckoned the people in that house stole the coat , because if they 'd a knowed the money was there they would n't a left it .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: I said I reckoned they killed him , too ; but Jim did n't want to talk about that .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 36]: I says : `` Now you think it 's bad luck ; but what did you say when I fetched in the snake-skin that I found on the top of the ridge day before yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 19]: You said it was the worst bad luck in the world to touch a snake-skin with my hands .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 8]: Well , here 's your bad luck !
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 12]: We 've raked in all this truck and eight dollars besides .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 16]: I wish we could have some bad luck like this every day , Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 11]: `` Never you mind , honey , never you mind .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 7]: Do n't you git too peart .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 5]: It 's a-comin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 11]: Mind I tell you , it 's a-comin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 6]: It did come , too .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 10]: It was a Tuesday that we had that talk .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 26]: Well , after dinner Friday we was laying around in the grass at the upper end of the ridge , and got out of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 16]: I went to the cavern to get some , and found a rattlesnake in there .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 32]: I killed him , and curled him up on the foot of Jim 's blanket , ever so natural , thinking there 'd be some fun when Jim found him there .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 36]: Well , by night I forgot all about the snake , and when Jim flung himself down on the blanket while I struck a light the snake 's mate was there , and bit him .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 23]: He jumped up yelling , and the first thing the light showed was the varmint curled up and ready for another spring .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 24]: I laid him out in a second with a stick , and Jim grabbed pap 's whisky-jug and begun to pour it down .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 14]: He was barefooted , and the snake bit him right on the heel .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 30]: That all comes of my being such a fool as to not remember that wherever you leave a dead snake its mate always comes there and curls around it .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 27]: Jim told me to chop off the snake 's head and throw it away , and then skin the body and roast a piece of it .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 16]: I done it , and he eat it and said it would help cure him .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 16]: He made me take off the rattles and tie them around his wrist , too .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 7]: He said that that would help .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 38]: Then I slid out quiet and throwed the snakes clear away amongst the bushes ; for I war n't going to let Jim find out it was all my fault , not if I could help it .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 40]: Jim sucked and sucked at the jug , and now and then he got out of his head and pitched around and yelled ; but every time he come to himself he went to sucking at the jug again .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 46]: His foot swelled up pretty big , and so did his leg ; but by and by the drunk begun to come , and so I judged he was all right ; but I 'd druther been bit with a snake than pap 's whisky .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 10]: Jim was laid up for four days and nights .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 12]: Then the swelling was all gone and he was around again .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 29]: I made up my mind I would n't ever take a-holt of a snake-skin again with my hands , now that I see what had come of it .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 11]: Jim said he reckoned I would believe him next time .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 25]: And he said that handling a snake-skin was such awful bad luck that maybe we had n't got to the end of it yet .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 27]: He said he druther see the new moon over his left shoulder as much as a thousand times than take up a snake-skin in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 39]: Well , I was getting to feel that way myself , though I 've always reckoned that looking at the new moon over your left shoulder is one of the carelessest and foolishest things a body can do .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 77]: Old Hank Bunker done it once , and bragged about it ; and in less than two years he got drunk and fell off of the shot-tower , and spread himself out so that he was just a kind of a layer , as you may say ; and they slid him edgeways between two barn doors for a coffin , and buried him so , so they say , but I did n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 4]: Pap told me .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 17]: But anyway it all come of looking at the moon that way , like a fool .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 65]: Well , the days went along , and the river went down between its banks again ; and about the first thing we done was to bait one of the big hooks with a skinned rabbit and set it and catch a catfish that was as big as a man , being six foot two inches long , and weighed over two hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 17]: We could n't handle him , of course ; he would a flung us into Illinois .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 15]: We just set there and watched him rip and tear around till he drownded .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 18]: We found a brass button in his stomach and a round ball , and lots of rubbage .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 17]: We split the ball open with the hatchet , and there was a spool in it .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 23]: Jim said he 'd had it there a long time , to coat it over so and make a ball of it .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 17]: It was as big a fish as was ever catched in the Mississippi , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 11]: Jim said he had n't ever seen a bigger one .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 13]: He would a been worth a good deal over at the village .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 35]: They peddle out such a fish as that by the pound in the market-house there ; everybody buys some of him ; his meat 's as white as snow and makes a good fry .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 22]: Next morning I said it was getting slow and dull , and I wanted to get a stirring up some way .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 18]: I said I reckoned I would slip over the river and find out what was going on .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 18]: Jim liked that notion ; but he said I must go in the dark and look sharp .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 25]: Then he studied it over and said , could n't I put on some of them old things and dress up like a girl ?
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 8]: That was a good notion , too .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 24]: So we shortened up one of the calico gowns , and I turned up my trouser-legs to my knees and got into it .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 15]: Jim hitched it behind with the hooks , and it was a fair fit .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 33]: I put on the sun-bonnet and tied it under my chin , and then for a body to look in and see my face was like looking down a joint of stove-pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 14]: Jim said nobody would know me , even in the daytime , hardly .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 52]: I practiced around all day to get the hang of the things , and by and by I could do pretty well in them , only Jim said I did n't walk like a girl ; and he said I must quit pulling up my gown to get at my britches-pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 8]: I took notice , and done better .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 13]: I started up the Illinois shore in the canoe just after dark .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 29]: I started across to the town from a little below the ferry-landing , and the drift of the current fetched me in at the bottom of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 9]: I tied up and started along the bank .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 30]: There was a light burning in a little shanty that had n't been lived in for a long time , and I wondered who had took up quarters there .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 10]: I slipped up and peeped in at the window .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 21]: There was a woman about forty year old in there knitting by a candle that was on a pine table .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 28]: I did n't know her face ; she was a stranger , for you could n't start a face in that town that I did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 28]: Now this was lucky , because I was weakening ; I was getting afraid I had come ; people might know my voice and find me out .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 44]: But if this woman had been in such a little town two days she could tell me all I wanted to know ; so I knocked at the door , and made up my mind I would n't forget I was a girl .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 3]: CHAPTER XI .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 13]: `` COME in , '' says the woman , and I did .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 9]: She says : `` Take a cheer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 4]: I done it .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 22]: She looked me all over with her little shiny eyes , and says : `` What might your name be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 5]: `` Sarah Williams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 8]: `` Where ` bouts do you live ?
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 5]: In this neighborhood ? '
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 4]: `` No 'm .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 7]: In Hookerville , seven mile below .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 14]: I 've walked all the way and I 'm all tired out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: `` Hungry , too , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 7]: I 'll find you something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 9]: `` No 'm , I ai n't hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 24]: I was so hungry I had to stop two miles below here at a farm ; so I ai n't hungry no more .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 8]: It 's what makes me so late .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 23]: My mother 's down sick , and out of money and everything , and I come to tell my uncle Abner Moore .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 13]: He lives at the upper end of the town , she says .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 8]: I hai n't ever been here before .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 6]: Do you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: `` No ; but I do n't know everybody yet .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 9]: I have n't lived here quite two weeks .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 13]: It 's a considerable ways to the upper end of the town .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 7]: You better stay here all night .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 6]: Take off your bonnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 21]: `` No , '' I says ; `` I 'll rest a while , I reckon , and go on .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 9]: I ai n't afeared of the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 38]: She said she would n't let me go by myself , but her husband would be in by and by , maybe in a hour and a half , and she 'd send him along with me .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 114]: Then she got to talking about her husband , and about her relations up the river , and her relations down the river , and about how much better off they used to was , and how they did n't know but they 'd made a mistake coming to our town , instead of letting well alone -- and so on and so on , till I was afeard I had made a mistake coming to her to find out what was going on in the town ; but by and by she dropped on to pap and the murder , and then I was pretty willing to let her clatter right along .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 51]: She told about me and Tom Sawyer finding the six thousand dollars -LRB- only she got it ten -RRB- and all about pap and what a hard lot he was , and what a hard lot I was , and at last she got down to where I was murdered .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 8]: I says : `` Who done it ?
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 26]: We 've heard considerable about these goings on down in Hookerville , but we do n't know who 't was that killed Huck Finn . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 23]: `` Well , I reckon there 's a right smart chance of people HERE that 'd like to know who killed him .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 9]: Some think old Finn done it himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 8]: `` No -- is that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 8]: `` Most everybody thought it at first .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 12]: He 'll never know how nigh he come to getting lynched .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 19]: But before night they changed around and judged it was done by a runaway nigger named Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 8]: `` Why HE -- '' I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 7]: I reckoned I better keep still .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 27]: She run on , and never noticed I had put in at all : `` The nigger run off the very night Huck Finn was killed .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 13]: So there 's a reward out for him -- three hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 16]: And there 's a reward out for old Finn , too -- two hundred dollars .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 37]: You see , he come to town the morning after the murder , and told about it , and was out with 'em on the ferryboat hunt , and right away after he up and left .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 16]: Before night they wanted to lynch him , but he was gone , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 30]: Well , next day they found out the nigger was gone ; they found out he had n't ben seen sence ten o'clock the night the murder was done .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 46]: So then they put it on him , you see ; and while they was full of it , next day , back comes old Finn , and went boo-hooing to Judge Thatcher to get money to hunt for the nigger all over Illinois with .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 34]: The judge gave him some , and that evening he got drunk , and was around till after midnight with a couple of mighty hard-looking strangers , and then went off with them .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 64]: Well , he hai n't come back sence , and they ai n't looking for him back till this thing blows over a little , for people thinks now that he killed his boy and fixed things so folks would think robbers done it , and then he 'd get Huck 's money without having to bother a long time with a lawsuit .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 13]: People do say he war n't any too good to do it .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 9]: Oh , he 's sly , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 15]: If he do n't come back for a year he 'll be all right .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 32]: You ca n't prove anything on him , you know ; everything will be quieted down then , and he 'll walk in Huck 's money as easy as nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 9]: `` Yes , I reckon so , 'm .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 11]: I do n't see nothing in the way of it .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 10]: Has everybody quit thinking the nigger done it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , not everybody .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 8]: A good many thinks he done it .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 21]: But they 'll get the nigger pretty soon now , and maybe they can scare it out of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 10]: `` Why , are they after him yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 11]: `` Well , you 're innocent , ai n't you !
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 14]: Does three hundred dollars lay around every day for people to pick up ?
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 11]: Some folks think the nigger ai n't far from here .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 14]: I 'm one of them -- but I hai n't talked it around .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 41]: A few days ago I was talking with an old couple that lives next door in the log shanty , and they happened to say hardly anybody ever goes to that island over yonder that they call Jackson 's Island .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 6]: Do n't anybody live there ?
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 9]: says I. No , nobody , says they .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 13]: I did n't say any more , but I done some thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 59]: I was pretty near certain I 'd seen smoke over there , about the head of the island , a day or two before that , so I says to myself , like as not that nigger 's hiding over there ; anyway , says I , it 's worth the trouble to give the place a hunt .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 34]: I hai n't seen any smoke sence , so I reckon maybe he 's gone , if it was him ; but husband 's going over to see -- him and another man .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 28]: He was gone up the river ; but he got back to-day , and I told him as soon as he got here two hours ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 11]: I had got so uneasy I could n't set still .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 25]: I had to do something with my hands ; so I took up a needle off of the table and went to threading it .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 14]: My hands shook , and I was making a bad job of it .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 22]: When the woman stopped talking I looked up , and she was looking at me pretty curious and smiling a little .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 34]: I put down the needle and thread , and let on to be interested -- and I was , too -- and says : `` Three hundred dollars is a power of money .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 8]: I wish my mother could get it .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 9]: Is your husband going over there to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 25]: He went up-town with the man I was telling you of , to get a boat and see if they could borrow another gun .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 8]: They 'll go over after midnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 15]: `` Could n't they see better if they was to wait till daytime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 10]: And could n't the nigger see better , too ?
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 36]: After midnight he 'll likely be asleep , and they can slip around through the woods and hunt up his camp fire all the better for the dark , if he 's got one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 9]: `` I did n't think of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 18]: The woman kept looking at me pretty curious , and I did n't feel a bit comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 17]: Pretty soon she says , `` What did you say your name was , honey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 7]: `` M -- Mary Williams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 49]: Somehow it did n't seem to me that I said it was Mary before , so I did n't look up -- seemed to me I said it was Sarah ; so I felt sort of cornered , and was afeared maybe I was looking it , too .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 19]: I wished the woman would say something more ; the longer she set still the uneasier I was .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 22]: But now she says : `` Honey , I thought you said it was Sarah when you first come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes 'm , I did .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 4]: Sarah Mary Williams .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 6]: Sarah 's my first name .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 11]: Some calls me Sarah , some calls me Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 11]: `` Oh , that 's the way of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 17]: I was feeling better then , but I wished I was out of there , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 7]: I could n't look up yet .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 49]: Well , the woman fell to talking about how hard times was , and how poor they had to live , and how the rats was as free as if they owned the place , and so forth and so on , and then I got easy again .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 7]: She was right about the rats .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 18]: You 'd see one stick his nose out of a hole in the corner every little while .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 26]: She said she had to have things handy to throw at them when she was alone , or they would n't give her no peace .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 47]: She showed me a bar of lead twisted up into a knot , and said she was a good shot with it generly , but she 'd wrenched her arm a day or two ago , and did n't know whether she could throw true now .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 27]: But she watched for a chance , and directly banged away at a rat ; but she missed him wide , and said `` Ouch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: it hurt her arm so .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 11]: Then she told me to try for the next one .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 22]: I wanted to be getting away before the old man got back , but of course I did n't let on .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 35]: I got the thing , and the first rat that showed his nose I let drive , and if he 'd a stayed where he was he 'd a been a tolerable sick rat .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 16]: She said that was first-rate , and she reckoned I would hive the next one .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 29]: She went and got the lump of lead and fetched it back , and brought along a hank of yarn which she wanted me to help her with .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 26]: I held up my two hands and she put the hank over them , and went on talking about her and her husband 's matters .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 15]: But she broke off to say : `` Keep your eye on the rats .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 12]: You better have the lead in your lap , handy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 27]: So she dropped the lump into my lap just at that moment , and I clapped my legs together on it and she went on talking .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 6]: But only about a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 33]: Then she took off the hank and looked me straight in the face , and very pleasant , and says : `` Come , now , what 's your real name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 8]: `` Wh -- what , mum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 7]: `` What 's your real name ?
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 10]: Is it Bill , or Tom , or Bob ?
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 7]: -- or what is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 18]: I reckon I shook like a leaf , and I did n't know hardly what to do .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 20]: But I says : `` Please to do n't poke fun at a poor girl like me , mum .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 19]: If I 'm in the way here , I 'll -- '' `` No , you wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 8]: Set down and stay where you are .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 20]: I ai n't going to hurt you , and I ai n't going to tell on you , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 11]: You just tell me your secret , and trust me .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 16]: I 'll keep it ; and , what 's more , I 'll help you .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 11]: So 'll my old man if you want him to .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 14]: You see , you 're a runaway ` prentice , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 5]: It ai n't anything .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 8]: There ai n't no harm in it .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 15]: You 've been treated bad , and you made up your mind to cut .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 12]: Bless you , child , I would n't tell on you .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 14]: Tell me all about it now , that 's a good boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 40]: So I said it would n't be no use to try to play it any longer , and I would just make a clean breast and tell her everything , but she mus n't go back on her promise .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 88]: Then I told her my father and mother was dead , and the law had bound me out to a mean old farmer in the country thirty mile back from the river , and he treated me so bad I could n't stand it no longer ; he went away to be gone a couple of days , and so I took my chance and stole some of his daughter 's old clothes and cleared out , and I had been three nights coming the thirty miles .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 32]: I traveled nights , and hid daytimes and slept , and the bag of bread and meat I carried from home lasted me all the way , and I had a-plenty .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 28]: I said I believed my uncle Abner Moore would take care of me , and so that was why I struck out for this town of Goshen .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 5]: `` Goshen , child ?
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 5]: This ai n't Goshen .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 5]: This is St. Petersburg .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 9]: Goshen 's ten mile further up the river .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 8]: Who told you this was Goshen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 27]: `` Why , a man I met at daybreak this morning , just as I was going to turn into the woods for my regular sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 24]: He told me when the roads forked I must take the right hand , and five mile would fetch me to Goshen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 8]: `` He was drunk , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 8]: He told you just exactly wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 19]: `` Well , he did act like he was drunk , but it ai n't no matter now .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 7]: I got to be moving along .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 8]: I 'll fetch Goshen before daylight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 6]: `` Hold on a minute .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 10]: I 'll put you up a snack to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 6]: You might want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 29]: So she put me up a snack , and says : `` Say , when a cow 's laying down , which end of her gets up first ?
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 13]: Answer up prompt now -- do n't stop to study over it .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 7]: Which end gets up first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 8]: `` The hind end , mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 9]: `` Well , then , a horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 10]: `` The for ` rard end , mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 13]: `` Which side of a tree does the moss grow on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 5]: `` North side . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 24]: `` If fifteen cows is browsing on a hillside , how many of them eats with their heads pointed the same direction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 8]: `` The whole fifteen , mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 12]: `` Well , I reckon you HAVE lived in the country .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 11]: I thought maybe you was trying to hocus me again .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 9]: What 's your real name , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 7]: `` George Peters , mum . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 10]: `` Well , try to remember it , George .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 28]: Do n't forget and tell me it 's Elexander before you go , and then get out by saying it 's George Elexander when I catch you .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 11]: And do n't go about women in that old calico .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 15]: You do a girl tolerable poor , but you might fool men , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 58]: Bless you , child , when you set out to thread a needle do n't hold the thread still and fetch the needle up to it ; hold the needle still and poke the thread at it ; that 's the way a woman most always does , but a man always does t ` other way .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 39]: And when you throw at a rat or anything , hitch yourself up a tiptoe and fetch your hand up over your head as awkward as you can , and miss your rat about six or seven foot .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 41]: Throw stiff-armed from the shoulder , like there was a pivot there for it to turn on , like a girl ; not from the wrist and elbow , with your arm out to one side , like a boy .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 40]: And , mind you , when a girl tries to catch anything in her lap she throws her knees apart ; she do n't clap them together , the way you did when you catched the lump of lead .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 26]: Why , I spotted you for a boy when you was threading the needle ; and I contrived the other things just to make certain .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 46]: Now trot along to your uncle , Sarah Mary Williams George Elexander Peters , and if you get into trouble you send word to Mrs. Judith Loftus , which is me , and I 'll do what I can to get you out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 20]: Keep the river road all the way , and next time you tramp take shoes and socks with you .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 26]: The river road 's a rocky one , and your feet 'll be in a condition when you get to Goshen , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 32]: I went up the bank about fifty yards , and then I doubled on my tracks and slipped back to where my canoe was , a good piece below the house .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 11]: I jumped in , and was off in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 18]: I went up-stream far enough to make the head of the island , and then started across .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 16]: I took off the sun-bonnet , for I did n't want no blinders on then .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 32]: When I was about the middle I heard the clock begin to strike , so I stops and listens ; the sound come faint over the water but clear -- eleven .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 48]: When I struck the head of the island I never waited to blow , though I was most winded , but I shoved right into the timber where my old camp used to be , and started a good fire there on a high and dry spot .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 27]: Then I jumped in the canoe and dug out for our place , a mile and a half below , as hard as I could go .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 17]: I landed , and slopped through the timber and up the ridge and into the cavern .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 10]: There Jim laid , sound asleep on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 16]: I roused him out and says : `` Git up and hump yourself , Jim !
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 8]: There ai n't a minute to lose .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 6]: They 're after us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 30]: Jim never asked no questions , he never said a word ; but the way he worked for the next half an hour showed about how he was scared .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 31]: By that time everything we had in the world was on our raft , and she was ready to be shoved out from the willow cove where she was hid .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 23]: We put out the camp fire at the cavern the first thing , and did n't show a candle outside after that .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 41]: I took the canoe out from the shore a little piece , and took a look ; but if there was a boat around I could n't see it , for stars and shadows ai n't good to see by .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 28]: Then we got out the raft and slipped along down in the shade , past the foot of the island dead still -- never saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 3]: CHAPTER XII .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 28]: IT must a been close on to one o'clock when we got below the island at last , and the raft did seem to go mighty slow .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 55]: If a boat was to come along we was going to take to the canoe and break for the Illinois shore ; and it was well a boat did n't come , for we had n't ever thought to put the gun in the canoe , or a fishing-line , or anything to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 16]: We was in ruther too much of a sweat to think of so many things .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 12]: It war n't good judgment to put EVERYTHING on the raft .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 28]: If the men went to the island I just expect they found the camp fire I built , and watched it all night for Jim to come .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 25]: Anyways , they stayed away from us , and if my building the fire never fooled them it war n't no fault of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 12]: I played it as low down on them as I could .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 54]: When the first streak of day began to show we tied up to a towhead in a big bend on the Illinois side , and hacked off cottonwood branches with the hatchet , and covered up the raft with them so she looked like there had been a cave-in in the bank there .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 15]: A tow-head is a sandbar that has cottonwoods on it as thick as harrow-teeth .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 38]: We had mountains on the Missouri shore and heavy timber on the Illinois side , and the channel was down the Missouri shore at that place , so we war n't afraid of anybody running across us .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 29]: We laid there all day , and watched the rafts and steamboats spin down the Missouri shore , and up-bound steamboats fight the big river in the middle .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 53]: I told Jim all about the time I had jabbering with that woman ; and Jim said she was a smart one , and if she was to start after us herself she would n't set down and watch a camp fire -- no , sir , she 'd fetch a dog .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 19]: Well , then , I said , why could n't she tell her husband to fetch a dog ?
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 71]: Jim said he bet she did think of it by the time the men was ready to start , and he believed they must a gone up-town to get a dog and so they lost all that time , or else we would n't be here on a towhead sixteen or seventeen mile below the village -- no , indeedy , we would be in that same old town again .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 23]: So I said I did n't care what was the reason they did n't get us as long as they did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 63]: When it was beginning to come on dark we poked our heads out of the cottonwood thicket , and looked up and down and across ; nothing in sight ; so Jim took up some of the top planks of the raft and built a snug wigwam to get under in blazing weather and rainy , and to keep the things dry .
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 38]: Jim made a floor for the wigwam , and raised it a foot or more above the level of the raft , so now the blankets and all the traps was out of reach of steamboat waves .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 54]: Right in the middle of the wigwam we made a layer of dirt about five or six inches deep with a frame around it for to hold it to its place ; this was to build a fire on in sloppy weather or chilly ; the wigwam would keep it from being seen .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 22]: We made an extra steering-oar , too , because one of the others might get broke on a snag or something .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 94]: We fixed up a short forked stick to hang the old lantern on , because we must always light the lantern whenever we see a steamboat coming down-stream , to keep from getting run over ; but we would n't have to light it for up-stream boats unless we see we was in what they call a `` crossing '' ; for the river was pretty high yet , very low banks being still a little under water ; so up-bound boats did n't always run the channel , but hunted easy water .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 23]: This second night we run between seven and eight hours , with a current that was making over four mile an hour .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 19]: We catched fish and talked , and we took a swim now and then to keep off sleepiness .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 52]: It was kind of solemn , drifting down the big , still river , laying on our backs looking up at the stars , and we did n't ever feel like talking loud , and it war n't often that we laughed -- only a little kind of a low chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 30]: We had mighty good weather as a general thing , and nothing ever happened to us at all -- that night , nor the next , nor the next .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 31]: Every night we passed towns , some of them away up on black hillsides , nothing but just a shiny bed of lights ; not a house could you see .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 18]: The fifth night we passed St. Louis , and it was like the whole world lit up .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 38]: In St. Petersburg they used to say there was twenty or thirty thousand people in St. Louis , but I never believed it till I see that wonderful spread of lights at two o'clock that still night .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 11]: There war n't a sound there ; everybody was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 51]: Every night now I used to slip ashore towards ten o'clock at some little village , and buy ten or fifteen cents ' worth of meal or bacon or other stuff to eat ; and sometimes I lifted a chicken that war n't roosting comfortable , and took him along .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 38]: Pap always said , take a chicken when you get a chance , because if you do n't want him yourself you can easy find somebody that does , and a good deed ai n't ever forgot .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 24]: I never see pap when he did n't want the chicken himself , but that is what he used to say , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 31]: Mornings before daylight I slipped into cornfields and borrowed a watermelon , or a mushmelon , or a punkin , or some new corn , or things of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 45]: Pap always said it war n't no harm to borrow things if you was meaning to pay them back some time ; but the widow said it war n't anything but a soft name for stealing , and no decent body would do it .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 57]: Jim said he reckoned the widow was partly right and pap was partly right ; so the best way would be for us to pick out two or three things from the list and say we would n't borrow them any more -- then he reckoned it would n't be no harm to borrow the others .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 38]: So we talked it over all one night , drifting along down the river , trying to make up our minds whether to drop the watermelons , or the cantelopes , or the mushmelons , or what .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 20]: But towards daylight we got it all settled satisfactory , and concluded to drop crabapples and p ` simmons .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 16]: We war n't feeling just right before that , but it was all comfortable now .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 34]: I was glad the way it come out , too , because crabapples ai n't ever good , and the p ` simmons would n't be ripe for two or three months yet .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 27]: We shot a water-fowl now and then that got up too early in the morning or did n't go to bed early enough in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 10]: Take it all round , we lived pretty high .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 32]: The fifth night below St. Louis we had a big storm after midnight , with a power of thunder and lightning , and the rain poured down in a solid sheet .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 14]: We stayed in the wigwam and let the raft take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 23]: When the lightning glared out we could see a big straight river ahead , and high , rocky bluffs on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 15]: By and by says I , `` Hel-LO , Jim , looky yonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 12]: It was a steamboat that had killed herself on a rock .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 8]: We was drifting straight down for her .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: The lightning showed her very distinct .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 50]: She was leaning over , with part of her upper deck above water , and you could see every little chimbly-guy clean and clear , and a chair by the big bell , with an old slouch hat hanging on the back of it , when the flashes come .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 45]: Well , it being away in the night and stormy , and all so mysterious-like , I felt just the way any other boy would a felt when I see that wreck laying there so mournful and lonesome in the middle of the river .
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 20]: I wanted to get aboard of her and slink around a little , and see what there was there .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 14]: So I says : `` Le 's land on her , Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 9]: But Jim was dead against it at first .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 18]: He says : `` I doan ' want to go fool 'n ` long er no wrack .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 23]: We 's doin ' blame ' well , en we better let blame ' well alone , as de good book says .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 12]: Like as not dey 's a watchman on dat wrack . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 63]: `` Watchman your grandmother , '' I says ; `` there ai n't nothing to watch but the texas and the pilot-house ; and do you reckon anybody 's going to resk his life for a texas and a pilot-house such a night as this , when it 's likely to break up and wash off down the river any minute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 14]: Jim could n't say nothing to that , so he did n't try .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 22]: `` And besides , '' I says , `` we might borrow something worth having out of the captain 's stateroom .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 15]: Seegars , I bet you -- and cost five cents apiece , solid cash .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 34]: Steamboat captains is always rich , and get sixty dollars a month , and THEY do n't care a cent what a thing costs , you know , long as they want it .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 21]: Stick a candle in your pocket ; I ca n't rest , Jim , till we give her a rummaging .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 12]: Do you reckon Tom Sawyer would ever go by this thing ?
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 8]: Not for pie , he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 29]: He 'd call it an adventure -- that 's what he 'd call it ; and he 'd land on that wreck if it was his last act .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 9]: And would n't he throw style into it ?
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 10]: -- would n't he spread himself , nor nothing ?
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 12]: Why , you 'd think it was Christopher C'lumbus discovering Kingdom-Come .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 8]: I wish Tom Sawyer WAS here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 10]: Jim he grumbled a little , but give in .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 19]: He said we must n't talk any more than we could help , and then talk mighty low .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 23]: The lightning showed us the wreck again just in time , and we fetched the stabboard derrick , and made fast there .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 7]: The deck was high out here .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 52]: We went sneaking down the slope of it to labboard , in the dark , towards the texas , feeling our way slow with our feet , and spreading our hands out to fend off the guys , for it was so dark we could n't see no sign of them .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 49]: Pretty soon we struck the forward end of the skylight , and clumb on to it ; and the next step fetched us in front of the captain 's door , which was open , and by Jimminy , away down through the texas-hall we see a light !
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 15]: and all in the same second we seem to hear low voices in yonder !
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 17]: Jim whispered and said he was feeling powerful sick , and told me to come along .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 45]: I says , all right , and was going to start for the raft ; but just then I heard a voice wail out and say : `` Oh , please do n't , boys ; I swear I wo n't ever tell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 16]: Another voice said , pretty loud : `` It 's a lie , Jim Turner .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 7]: You 've acted this way before .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 34]: You always want more 'n your share of the truck , and you 've always got it , too , because you 've swore ' t if you did n't you 'd tell .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 13]: But this time you 've said it jest one time too many .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 12]: You 're the meanest , treacherousest hound in this country . ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 10]: By this time Jim was gone for the raft .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 39]: I was just a-biling with curiosity ; and I says to myself , Tom Sawyer would n't back out now , and so I wo n't either ; I 'm a-going to see what 's going on here .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 35]: So I dropped on my hands and knees in the little passage , and crept aft in the dark till there war n't but one stateroom betwixt me and the cross-hall of the texas .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 44]: Then in there I see a man stretched on the floor and tied hand and foot , and two men standing over him , and one of them had a dim lantern in his hand , and the other one had a pistol .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 24]: This one kept pointing the pistol at the man 's head on the floor , and saying : `` I 'd LIKE to !
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 11]: And I orter , too -- a mean skunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 30]: The man on the floor would shrivel up and say , `` Oh , please do n't , Bill ; I hai n't ever goin ' to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 23]: And every time he said that the man with the lantern would laugh and say : '' ` Deed you AI N'T !
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 14]: You never said no truer thing 'n that , you bet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 10]: And once he said : `` Hear him beg !
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 21]: and yit if we had n't got the best of him and tied him he 'd a killed us both .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 4]: And what FOR ?
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 18]: Jist for noth ` n. Jist because we stood on our RIGHTS -- that 's what for .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 17]: But I lay you ai n't a-goin ' to threaten nobody any more , Jim Turner .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 8]: Put UP that pistol , Bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 13]: Bill says : `` I do n't want to , Jake Packard .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 27]: I 'm for killin ' him -- and did n't he kill old Hatfield jist the same way -- and do n't he deserve it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 19]: `` But I do n't WANT him killed , and I 've got my reasons for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 12]: `` Bless yo ' heart for them words , Jake Packard !
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 11]: I 'll never forgit you long 's I live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 11]: says the man on the floor , sort of blubbering .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 34]: Packard did n't take no notice of that , but hung up his lantern on a nail and started towards where I was there in the dark , and motioned Bill to come .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 44]: I crawfished as fast as I could about two yards , but the boat slanted so that I could n't make very good time ; so to keep from getting run over and catched I crawled into a stateroom on the upper side .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 28]: The man came a-pawing along in the dark , and when Packard got to my stateroom , he says : `` Here -- come in here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 10]: And in he come , and Bill after him .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 20]: But before they got in I was up in the upper berth , cornered , and sorry I come .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 18]: Then they stood there , with their hands on the ledge of the berth , and talked .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 21]: I could n't see them , but I could tell where they was by the whisky they 'd been having .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 35]: I was glad I did n't drink whisky ; but it would n't made much difference anyway , because most of the time they could n't a treed me because I did n't breathe .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 5]: I was too scared .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 14]: And , besides , a body COULD N'T breathe and hear such talk .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 6]: They talked low and earnest .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 6]: Bill wanted to kill Turner .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 15]: He says : `` He 's said he 'll tell , and he will .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 28]: If we was to give both our shares to him NOW it would n't make no difference after the row and the way we 've served him .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 18]: Shore 's you 're born , he 'll turn State 's evidence ; now you hear ME .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 11]: I 'm for putting him out of his troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 12]: `` So 'm I , '' says Packard , very quiet .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 14]: `` Blame it , I 'd sorter begun to think you was n't .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 9]: Well , then , that 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 8]: Le 's go and do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 14]: `` Hold on a minute ; I hai n't had my say yit .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 5]: You listen to me .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 18]: Shooting 's good , but there 's quieter ways if the thing 's GOT to be done .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 51]: But what I say is this : it ai n't good sense to go court 'n around after a halter if you can git at what you 're up to in some way that 's jist as good and at the same time do n't bring you into no resks .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 6]: Ai n't that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 6]: `` You bet it is .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 12]: But how you goin ' to manage it this time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 33]: `` Well , my idea is this : we 'll rustle around and gather up whatever pickins we 've overlooked in the staterooms , and shove for shore and hide the truck .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 5]: Then we 'll wait .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 27]: Now I say it ai n't a-goin ' to be more 'n two hours befo ' this wrack breaks up and washes off down the river .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 2]: See ?
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 19]: He 'll be drownded , and wo n't have nobody to blame for it but his own self .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 14]: I reckon that 's a considerble sight better 'n killin ' of him .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 30]: I 'm unfavorable to killin ' a man as long as you can git aroun ' it ; it ai n't good sense , it ai n't good morals .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 6]: Ai n't I right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 9]: `` Yes , I reck 'n you are .
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 14]: But s ` pose she DO N'T break up and wash off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 18]: `` Well , we can wait the two hours anyway and see , ca n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 10]: `` All right , then ; come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 19]: So they started , and I lit out , all in a cold sweat , and scrambled forward .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 23]: It was dark as pitch there ; but I said , in a kind of a coarse whisper , `` Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 85]: and he answered up , right at my elbow , with a sort of a moan , and I says : `` Quick , Jim , it ai n't no time for fooling around and moaning ; there 's a gang of murderers in yonder , and if we do n't hunt up their boat and set her drifting down the river so these fellows ca n't get away from the wreck there 's one of 'em going to be in a bad fix .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 24]: But if we find their boat we can put ALL of 'em in a bad fix -- for the sheriff 'll get 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 4]: Quick -- hurry !
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 12]: I 'll hunt the labboard side , you hunt the stabboard .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 17]: You start at the raft , and -- '' `` Oh , my lordy , lordy !
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 3]: RAF ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 24]: Dey ain ' no raf ' no mo ' ; she done broke loose en gone I -- en here we is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIII .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 10]: WELL , I catched my breath and most fainted .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: Shut up on a wreck with such a gang as that !
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 10]: But it war n't no time to be sentimentering .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 16]: We 'd GOT to find that boat now -- had to have it for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 29]: So we went a-quaking and shaking down the stabboard side , and slow work it was , too -- seemed a week before we got to the stern .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: No sign of a boat .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 25]: Jim said he did n't believe he could go any further -- so scared he had n't hardly any strength left , he said .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 22]: But I said , come on , if we get left on this wreck we are in a fix , sure .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 6]: So on we prowled again .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 40]: We struck for the stern of the texas , and found it , and then scrabbled along forwards on the skylight , hanging on from shutter to shutter , for the edge of the skylight was in the water .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 17]: When we got pretty close to the cross-hall door there was the skiff , sure enough !
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 7]: I could just barely see her .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 6]: I felt ever so thankful .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 18]: In another second I would a been aboard of her , but just then the door opened .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 47]: One of the men stuck his head out only about a couple of foot from me , and I thought I was gone ; but he jerked it in again , and says : `` Heave that blame lantern out o ' sight , Bill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 19]: He flung a bag of something into the boat , and then got in himself and set down .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 4]: It was Packard .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 9]: Then Bill HE come out and got in .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 16]: Packard says , in a low voice : `` All ready -- shove off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 15]: I could n't hardly hang on to the shutters , I was so weak .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 15]: But Bill says : `` Hold on -- 'd you go through him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 5]: Did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 13]: So he 's got his share o ' the cash yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 18]: `` Well , then , come along ; no use to take truck and leave money . ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 14]: `` Say , wo n't he suspicion what we 're up to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 6]: `` Maybe he wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: But we got to have it anyway .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 4]: Come along . ''
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 8]: So they got out and went in .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 30]: The door slammed to because it was on the careened side ; and in a half second I was in the boat , and Jim come tumbling after me .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 15]: I out with my knife and cut the rope , and away we went !
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 20]: We did n't touch an oar , and we did n't speak nor whisper , nor hardly even breathe .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 59]: We went gliding swift along , dead silent , past the tip of the paddle-box , and past the stern ; then in a second or two more we was a hundred yards below the wreck , and the darkness soaked her up , every last sign of her , and we was safe , and knowed it .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 58]: When we was three or four hundred yards down-stream we see the lantern show like a little spark at the texas door for a second , and we knowed by that that the rascals had missed their boat , and was beginning to understand that they was in just as much trouble now as Jim Turner was .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 14]: Then Jim manned the oars , and we took out after our raft .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 24]: Now was the first time that I begun to worry about the men -- I reckon I had n't had time to before .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 20]: I begun to think how dreadful it was , even for murderers , to be in such a fix .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 29]: I says to myself , there ai n't no telling but I might come to be a murderer myself yet , and then how would I like it ?
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 80]: So says I to Jim : `` The first light we see we 'll land a hundred yards below it or above it , in a place where it 's a good hiding-place for you and the skiff , and then I 'll go and fix up some kind of a yarn , and get somebody to go for that gang and get them out of their scrape , so they can be hung when their time comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 23]: But that idea was a failure ; for pretty soon it begun to storm again , and this time worse than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 18]: The rain poured down , and never a light showed ; everybody in bed , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 16]: We boomed along down the river , watching for lights and watching for our raft .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 41]: After a long time the rain let up , but the clouds stayed , and the lightning kept whimpering , and by and by a flash showed us a black thing ahead , floating , and we made for it .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 17]: It was the raft , and mighty glad was we to get aboard of it again .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 14]: We seen a light now away down to the right , on shore .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 9]: So I said I would go for it .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 17]: The skiff was half full of plunder which that gang had stole there on the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 53]: We hustled it on to the raft in a pile , and I told Jim to float along down , and show a light when he judged he had gone about two mile , and keep it burning till I come ; then I manned my oars and shoved for the light .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 17]: As I got down towards it three or four more showed -- up on a hillside .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 5]: It was a village .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 16]: I closed in above the shore light , and laid on my oars and floated .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 19]: As I went by I see it was a lantern hanging on the jackstaff of a double-hull ferryboat .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 33]: I skimmed around for the watchman , a-wondering whereabouts he slept ; and by and by I found him roosting on the bitts forward , with his head down between his knees .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 15]: I gave his shoulder two or three little shoves , and begun to cry .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 39]: He stirred up in a kind of a startlish way ; but when he see it was only me he took a good gap and stretch , and then he says : `` Hello , what 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 6]: Do n't cry , bub .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 6]: What 's the trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 20]: I says : `` Pap , and mam , and sis , and -- '' Then I broke down .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 33]: He says : `` Oh , dang it now , DO N'T take on so ; we all has to have our troubles , and this 'n 'll come out all right .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 8]: What 's the matter with 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 16]: `` They 're -- they 're -- are you the watchman of the boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' he says , kind of pretty-well-satisfied like .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 29]: `` I 'm the captain and the owner and the mate and the pilot and watchman and head deck-hand ; and sometimes I 'm the freight and passengers .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 115]: I ai n't as rich as old Jim Hornback , and I ca n't be so blame ' generous and good to Tom , Dick , and Harry as what he is , and slam around money the way he does ; but I 've told him a many a time ' t I would n't trade places with him ; for , says I , a sailor 's life 's the life for me , and I 'm derned if I 'D live two mile out o ' town , where there ai n't nothing ever goin ' on , not for all his spondulicks and as much more on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 28]: Says I -- '' I broke in and says : `` They 're in an awful peck of trouble , and -- '' `` WHO is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 29]: `` Why , pap and mam and sis and Miss Hooker ; and if you 'd take your ferryboat and go up there -- '' `` Up where ?
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 5]: Where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 6]: `` On the wreck . ''
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 5]: `` What wreck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 10]: `` Why , there ai n't but one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 12]: `` What , you do n't mean the Walter Scott ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 4]: `` Good land !
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 12]: what are they doin ' THERE , for gracious sakes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 11]: `` Well , they did n't go there a-purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 7]: `` I bet they did n't !
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 21]: Why , great goodness , there ai n't no chance for 'em if they do n't git off mighty quick !
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 16]: Why , how in the nation did they ever git into such a scrape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 4]: `` Easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 22]: Miss Hooker was a-visiting up there to the town -- '' `` Yes , Booth 's Landing -- go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 99]: `` She was a-visiting there at Booth 's Landing , and just in the edge of the evening she started over with her nigger woman in the horse-ferry to stay all night at her friend 's house , Miss What-you-may-call-her I disremember her name -- and they lost their steering-oar , and swung around and went a-floating down , stern first , about two mile , and saddle-baggsed on the wreck , and the ferryman and the nigger woman and the horses was all lost , but Miss Hooker she made a grab and got aboard the wreck .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 57]: Well , about an hour after dark we come along down in our trading-scow , and it was so dark we did n't notice the wreck till we was right on it ; and so WE saddle-baggsed ; but all of us was saved but Bill Whipple -- and oh , he WAS the best cretur !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 15]: -- I most wish ' t it had been me , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 4]: `` My George !
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 9]: It 's the beatenest thing I ever struck .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 9]: And THEN what did you all do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 22]: `` Well , we hollered and took on , but it 's so wide there we could n't make nobody hear .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 13]: So pap said somebody got to get ashore and get help somehow .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 45]: I was the only one that could swim , so I made a dash for it , and Miss Hooker she said if I did n't strike help sooner , come here and hunt up her uncle , and he 'd fix the thing .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 40]: I made the land about a mile below , and been fooling along ever since , trying to get people to do something , but they said , ` What , in such a night and such a current ?
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 15]: There ai n't no sense in it ; go for the steam ferry . '
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 43]: Now if you 'll go and -- '' `` By Jackson , I 'd LIKE to , and , blame it , I do n't know but I will ; but who in the dingnation 's a-going ' to PAY for it ?
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 14]: Do you reckon your pap -- '' `` Why THAT 'S all right .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 18]: Miss Hooker she tole me , PARTICULAR , that her uncle Hornback -- '' `` Great guns !
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 5]: is HE her uncle ?
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 53]: Looky here , you break for that light over yonder-way , and turn out west when you git there , and about a quarter of a mile out you 'll come to the tavern ; tell 'em to dart you out to Jim Hornback 's , and he 'll foot the bill .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 17]: And do n't you fool around any , because he 'll want to know the news .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 16]: Tell him I 'll have his niece all safe before he can get to town .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 20]: Hump yourself , now ; I 'm a-going up around the corner here to roust out my engineer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 63]: I struck for the light , but as soon as he turned the corner I went back and got into my skiff and bailed her out , and then pulled up shore in the easy water about six hundred yards , and tucked myself in among some woodboats ; for I could n't rest easy till I could see the ferryboat start .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 30]: But take it all around , I was feeling ruther comfortable on accounts of taking all this trouble for that gang , for not many would a done it .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 8]: I wished the widow knowed about it .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 32]: I judged she would be proud of me for helping these rapscallions , because rapscallions and dead beats is the kind the widow and good people takes the most interest in .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 17]: Well , before long here comes the wreck , dim and dusky , sliding along down !
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 17]: A kind of cold shiver went through me , and then I struck out for her .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 23]: She was very deep , and I see in a minute there war n't much chance for anybody being alive in her .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 21]: I pulled all around her and hollered a little , but there was n't any answer ; all dead still .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 25]: I felt a little bit heavy-hearted about the gang , but not much , for I reckoned if they could stand it I could .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 94]: Then here comes the ferryboat ; so I shoved for the middle of the river on a long down-stream slant ; and when I judged I was out of eye-reach I laid on my oars , and looked back and see her go and smell around the wreck for Miss Hooker 's remainders , because the captain would know her uncle Hornback would want them ; and then pretty soon the ferryboat give it up and went for the shore , and I laid into my work and went a-booming down the river .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 29]: It did seem a powerful long time before Jim 's light showed up ; and when it did show it looked like it was a thousand mile off .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 45]: By the time I got there the sky was beginning to get a little gray in the east ; so we struck for an island , and hid the raft , and sunk the skiff , and turned in and slept like dead people .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIV .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 56]: BY and by , when we got up , we turned over the truck the gang had stole off of the wreck , and found boots , and blankets , and clothes , and all sorts of other things , and a lot of books , and a spyglass , and three boxes of seegars .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 14]: We had n't ever been this rich before in neither of our lives .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 5]: The seegars was prime .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 24]: We laid off all the afternoon in the woods talking , and me reading the books , and having a general good time .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 36]: I told Jim all about what happened inside the wreck and at the ferryboat , and I said these kinds of things was adventures ; but he said he did n't want no more adventures .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 86]: He said that when I went in the texas and he crawled back to get on the raft and found her gone he nearly died , because he judged it was all up with HIM anyway it could be fixed ; for if he did n't get saved he would get drownded ; and if he did get saved , whoever saved him would send him back home so as to get the reward , and then Miss Watson would sell him South , sure .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 22]: Well , he was right ; he was most always right ; he had an uncommon level head for a nigger .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 64]: I read considerable to Jim about kings and dukes and earls and such , and how gaudy they dressed , and how much style they put on , and called each other your majesty , and your grace , and your lordship , and so on , ` stead of mister ; and Jim 's eyes bugged out , and he was interested .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 15]: He says : `` I didn ' know dey was so many un um .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 32]: I hai n't hearn ` bout none un um , skasely , but ole King Sollermun , onless you counts dem kings dat 's in a pack er k ` yards .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 8]: How much do a king git ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 4]: `` Get ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 34]: I says ; `` why , they get a thousand dollars a month if they want it ; they can have just as much as they want ; everything belongs to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 6]: `` AIN ' dat gay ?
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 10]: En what dey got to do , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 7]: `` THEY do n't do nothing !
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 6]: Why , how you talk !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 6]: They just set around . ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 8]: `` No ; is dat so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 6]: `` Of course it is .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 22]: They just set around -- except , maybe , when there 's a war ; then they go to the war .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 19]: But other times they just lazy around ; or go hawking -- just hawking and sp -- Sh !
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 8]: -- d' you hear a noise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 32]: We skipped out and looked ; but it war n't nothing but the flutter of a steamboat 's wheel away down , coming around the point ; so we come back .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 37]: `` Yes , '' says I , `` and other times , when things is dull , they fuss with the parlyment ; and if everybody do n't go just so he whacks their heads off .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 9]: But mostly they hang round the harem . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 7]: `` Roun ' de which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 4]: `` Harem . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 7]: `` What 's de harem ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 9]: `` The place where he keeps his wives .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 8]: Do n't you know about the harem ?
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 12]: Solomon had one ; he had about a million wives . ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 17]: `` Why , yes , dat 's so ; I -- I 'd done forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 24]: A harem 's a bo 'd ` n-house , I reck ` n. Mos ' likely dey has rackety times in de nussery .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 16]: En I reck 'n de wives quarrels considable ; en dat ` crease de racket .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 13]: Yit dey say Sollermun de wises ' man dat ever live ' .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 9]: I doan ' take no stock in dat .

Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 25]: `` Well , but he WAS the wisest man , anyway ; because the widow she told me so , her own self . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 19]: `` I doan k ` yer what de widder say , he WAR N'T no wise man nuther .

Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 13]: Dat 's de way Sollermun was gwyne to do wid de chile .

Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 19]: If he got a notion in his head once , there war n't no getting it out again .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 14]: He was the most down on Solomon of any nigger I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 14]: So I went to talking about other kings , and let Solomon slide .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 49]: I told about Louis Sixteenth that got his head cut off in France long time ago ; and about his little boy the dolphin , that would a been a king , but they took and shut him up in jail , and some say he died there .

Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 20]: `` NO , Jim ; you could n't understand a word they said -- not a single word . ''

Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 9]: `` No , a cat do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: `` Well , does a cow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 11]: `` No , a cow do n't , nuther . ''
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 18]: `` Does a cat talk like a cow , or a cow talk like a cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 8]: `` No , dey do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 20]: `` It 's natural and right for 'em to talk different from each other , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 4]: `` Course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 21]: `` And ai n't it natural and right for a cat and a cow to talk different from US ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 10]: `` Why , mos ' sholy it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 21]: `` Well , then , why ai n't it natural and right for a FRENCHMAN to talk different from us ?
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 6]: You answer me that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 10]: `` Is a cat a man , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 19]: `` Well , den , dey ai n't no sense in a cat talkin ' like a man .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 6]: Is a cow a man ?
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 9]: -- er is a cow a cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 11]: `` No , she ai n't either of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 22]: `` Well , den , she ai n't got no business to talk like either one er the yuther of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 7]: Is a Frenchman a man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 5]: `` WELL , den !
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 13]: Dad blame it , why doan ' he TALK like a man ?
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 6]: You answer me DAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 19]: I see it war n't no use wasting words -- you ca n't learn a nigger to argue .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 4]: So I quit .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 3]: CHAPTER XV .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 33]: WE judged that three nights more would fetch us to Cairo , at the bottom of Illinois , where the Ohio River comes in , and that was what we was after .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 28]: We would sell the raft and get on a steamboat and go way up the Ohio amongst the free States , and then be out of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 62]: Well , the second night a fog begun to come on , and we made for a towhead to tie to , for it would n't do to try to run in a fog ; but when I paddled ahead in the canoe , with the line to make fast , there war n't anything but little saplings to tie to .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 44]: I passed the line around one of them right on the edge of the cut bank , but there was a stiff current , and the raft come booming down so lively she tore it out by the roots and away she went .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 47]: I see the fog closing down , and it made me so sick and scared I could n't budge for most a half a minute it seemed to me -- and then there war n't no raft in sight ; you could n't see twenty yards .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 23]: I jumped into the canoe and run back to the stern , and grabbed the paddle and set her back a stroke .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 6]: But she did n't come .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 12]: I was in such a hurry I had n't untied her .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 27]: I got up and tried to untie her , but I was so excited my hands shook so I could n't hardly do anything with them .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 22]: As soon as I got started I took out after the raft , hot and heavy , right down the towhead .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 54]: That was all right as far as it went , but the towhead war n't sixty yards long , and the minute I flew by the foot of it I shot out into the solid white fog , and had n't no more idea which way I was going than a dead man .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 52]: Thinks I , it wo n't do to paddle ; first I know I 'll run into the bank or a towhead or something ; I got to set still and float , and yet it 's mighty fidgety business to have to hold your hands still at such a time .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 5]: I whooped and listened .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 16]: Away down there somewheres I hears a small whoop , and up comes my spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 13]: I went tearing after it , listening sharp to hear it again .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 23]: The next time it come I see I war n't heading for it , but heading away to the right of it .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 47]: And the next time I was heading away to the left of it -- and not gaining on it much either , for I was flying around , this way and that and t ` other , but it was going straight ahead all the time .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 42]: I did wish the fool would think to beat a tin pan , and beat it all the time , but he never did , and it was the still places between the whoops that was making the trouble for me .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 15]: Well , I fought along , and directly I hears the whoop BEHIND me .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 6]: I was tangled good now .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 14]: That was somebody else 's whoop , or else I was turned around .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 6]: I throwed the paddle down .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 74]: I heard the whoop again ; it was behind me yet , but in a different place ; it kept coming , and kept changing its place , and I kept answering , till by and by it was in front of me again , and I knowed the current had swung the canoe 's head down-stream , and I was all right if that was Jim and not some other raftsman hollering .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 24]: I could n't tell nothing about voices in a fog , for nothing do n't look natural nor sound natural in a fog .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 58]: The whooping went on , and in about a minute I come a-booming down on a cut bank with smoky ghosts of big trees on it , and the current throwed me off to the left and shot by , amongst a lot of snags that fairly roared , the currrent was tearing by them so swift .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 13]: In another second or two it was solid white and still again .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 27]: I set perfectly still then , listening to my heart thump , and I reckon I did n't draw a breath while it thumped a hundred .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 6]: I just give up then .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 7]: I knowed what the matter was .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 19]: That cut bank was an island , and Jim had gone down t ` other side of it .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 14]: It war n't no towhead that you could float by in ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 26]: It had the big timber of a regular island ; it might be five or six miles long and more than half a mile wide .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 16]: I kept quiet , with my ears cocked , about fifteen minutes , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 24]: I was floating along , of course , four or five miles an hour ; but you do n't ever think of that .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 46]: No , you FEEL like you are laying dead still on the water ; and if a little glimpse of a snag slips by you do n't think to yourself how fast YOU 'RE going , but you catch your breath and think , my !
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 7]: how that snag 's tearing along .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 30]: If you think it ai n't dismal and lonesome out in a fog that way by yourself in the night , you try it once -- you 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 106]: Next , for about a half an hour , I whoops now and then ; at last I hears the answer a long ways off , and tries to follow it , but I could n't do it , and directly I judged I 'd got into a nest of towheads , for I had little dim glimpses of them on both sides of me -- sometimes just a narrow channel between , and some that I could n't see I knowed was there because I 'd hear the wash of the current against the old dead brush and trash that hung over the banks .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 39]: Well , I war n't long loosing the whoops down amongst the towheads ; and I only tried to chase them a little while , anyway , because it was worse than chasing a Jack-o ' - lantern .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 18]: You never knowed a sound dodge around so , and swap places so quick and so much .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 67]: I had to claw away from the bank pretty lively four or five times , to keep from knocking the islands out of the river ; and so I judged the raft must be butting into the bank every now and then , or else it would get further ahead and clear out of hearing -- it was floating a little faster than what I was .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 27]: Well , I seemed to be in the open river again by and by , but I could n't hear no sign of a whoop nowheres .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 20]: I reckoned Jim had fetched up on a snag , maybe , and it was all up with him .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 22]: I was good and tired , so I laid down in the canoe and said I would n't bother no more .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 34]: I did n't want to go to sleep , of course ; but I was so sleepy I could n't help it ; so I thought I would take jest one little cat-nap .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 38]: But I reckon it was more than a cat-nap , for when I waked up the stars was shining bright , the fog was all gone , and I was spinning down a big bend stern first .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 35]: First I did n't know where I was ; I thought I was dreaming ; and when things began to come back to me they seemed to come up dim out of last week .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 36]: It was a monstrous big river here , with the tallest and the thickest kind of timber on both banks ; just a solid wall , as well as I could see by the stars .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 14]: I looked away down-stream , and seen a black speck on the water .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 24]: I took after it ; but when I got to it it war n't nothing but a couple of sawlogs made fast together .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 20]: Then I see another speck , and chased that ; then another , and this time I was right .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 5]: It was the raft .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 28]: When I got to it Jim was setting there with his head down between his knees , asleep , with his right arm hanging over the steering-oar .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 20]: The other oar was smashed off , and the raft was littered up with leaves and branches and dirt .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 8]: So she 'd had a rough time .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 40]: I made fast and laid down under Jim 's nose on the raft , and began to gap , and stretch my fists out against Jim , and says : `` Hello , Jim , have I been asleep ?
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 9]: Why did n't you stir me up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 10]: `` Goodness gracious , is dat you , Huck ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 16]: En you ain ' dead -- you ain ' drownded -- you 's back agin ?
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 16]: It 's too good for true , honey , it 's too good for true .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 14]: Lem me look at you chile , lem me feel o ' you .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 7]: No , you ain ' dead !
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 27]: you 's back agin , ` live en soun ' , jis de same ole Huck -- de same ole Huck , thanks to goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter with you , Jim ?
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 5]: You been a-drinking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 4]: `` Drinkin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 6]: Has I ben a-drinkin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 11]: Has I had a chance to be a-drinkin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 13]: `` Well , then , what makes you talk so wild ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 8]: `` How does I talk wild ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 3]: `` HOW ?
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 26]: Why , hai n't you been talking about my coming back , and all that stuff , as if I 'd been gone away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 19]: `` Huck -- Huck Finn , you look me in de eye ; look me in de eye .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 8]: HAI N'T you ben gone away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 4]: `` Gone away ?
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 10]: Why , what in the nation do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 7]: I hai n't been gone anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 7]: Where would I go to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 17]: `` Well , looky here , boss , dey 's sumf 'n wrong , dey is .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 9]: Is I ME , or who IS I ?
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 9]: Is I heah , or whah IS I ?
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 10]: Now dat 's what I wants to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 25]: `` Well , I think you 're here , plain enough , but I think you 're a tangle-headed old fool , Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 7]: `` I is , is I ?
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 27]: Well , you answer me dis : Did n't you tote out de line in de canoe fer to make fas ' to de tow-head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 7]: `` No , I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 3]: What tow-head ?
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 8]: I hai n't see no tow-head . ''
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 8]: `` You hai n't seen no towhead ?
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 32]: Looky here , did n't de line pull loose en de raf ' go a-hummin ' down de river , en leave you en de canoe behine in de fog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 5]: `` What fog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 6]: `` Why , de fog !
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 11]: -- de fog dat 's been aroun ' all night .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 52]: En did n't you whoop , en did n't I whoop , tell we got mix ' up in de islands en one un us got los ' en t ` other one was jis ' as good as los ' , ` kase he didn ' know whah he wuz ?
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 23]: En did n't I bust up agin a lot er dem islands en have a turrible time en mos ' git drownded ?
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 13]: Now ain ' dat so , boss -- ai n't it so ?
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 6]: You answer me dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 12]: `` Well , this is too many for me , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 18]: I hai n't seen no fog , nor no islands , nor no troubles , nor nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 27]: I been setting here talking with you all night till you went to sleep about ten minutes ago , and I reckon I done the same .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 19]: You could n't a got drunk in that time , so of course you 've been dreaming . ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 18]: `` Dad fetch it , how is I gwyne to dream all dat in ten minutes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 22]: `` Well , hang it all , you did dream it , because there did n't any of it happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 36]: `` But , Huck , it 's all jis ' as plain to me as -- '' `` It do n't make no difference how plain it is ; there ai n't nothing in it .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 13]: I know , because I 've been here all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 17]: Jim did n't say nothing for about five minutes , but set there studying over it .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 34]: Then he says : `` Well , den , I reck 'n I did dream it , Huck ; but dog my cats ef it ai n't de powerfullest dream I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 21]: En I hai n't ever had no dream b ` fo ' dat 's tired me like dis one . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 21]: `` Oh , well , that 's all right , because a dream does tire a body like everything sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 17]: But this one was a staving dream ; tell me all about it , Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 26]: So Jim went to work and told me the whole thing right through , just as it happened , only he painted it up considerable .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 22]: Then he said he must start in and '' ` terpret '' it , because it was sent for a warning .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 32]: He said the first towhead stood for a man that would try to do us some good , but the current was another man that would get us away from him .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 45]: The whoops was warnings that would come to us every now and then , and if we did n't try hard to make out to understand them they 'd just take us into bad luck , ` stead of keeping us out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 68]: The lot of towheads was troubles we was going to get into with quarrelsome people and all kinds of mean folks , but if we minded our business and did n't talk back and aggravate them , we would pull through and get out of the fog and into the big clear river , which was the free States , and would n't have no more trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 23]: It had clouded up pretty dark just after I got on to the raft , but it was clearing up again now .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 33]: `` Oh , well , that 's all interpreted well enough as far as it goes , Jim , '' I says ; `` but what does THESE things stand for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 14]: It was the leaves and rubbish on the raft and the smashed oar .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 7]: You could see them first-rate now .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 19]: Jim looked at the trash , and then looked at me , and back at the trash again .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 32]: He had got the dream fixed so strong in his head that he could n't seem to shake it loose and get the facts back into its place again right away .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 29]: But when he did get the thing straightened around he looked at me steady without ever smiling , and says : `` What do dey stan ' for ?
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 8]: I ` se gwyne to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 54]: When I got all wore out wid work , en wid de callin ' for you , en went to sleep , my heart wuz mos ' broke bekase you wuz los ' , en I didn ' k ` yer no ' mo ' what become er me en de raf ' .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 41]: En when I wake up en fine you back agin , all safe en soun ' , de tears come , en I could a got down on my knees en kiss yo ' foot , I 's so thankful .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 22]: En all you wuz thinkin ' ` bout wuz how you could make a fool uv ole Jim wid a lie .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 28]: Dat truck dah is TRASH ; en trash is what people is dat puts dirt on de head er dey fren 's en makes 'em ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 21]: Then he got up slow and walked to the wigwam , and went in there without saying anything but that .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 5]: But that was enough .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 20]: It made me feel so mean I could almost kissed HIS foot to get him to take it back .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 36]: It was fifteen minutes before I could work myself up to go and humble myself to a nigger ; but I done it , and I war n't ever sorry for it afterwards , neither .
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 30]: I did n't do him no more mean tricks , and I would n't done that one if I 'd a knowed it would make him feel that way .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVI .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 30]: WE slept most all day , and started out at night , a little ways behind a monstrous long raft that was as long going by as a procession .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 22]: She had four long sweeps at each end , so we judged she carried as many as thirty men , likely .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 27]: She had five big wigwams aboard , wide apart , and an open camp fire in the middle , and a tall flag-pole at each end .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 9]: There was a power of style about her .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 14]: It AMOUNTED to something being a raftsman on such a craft as that .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 18]: We went drifting down into a big bend , and the night clouded up and got hot .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 31]: The river was very wide , and was walled with solid timber on both sides ; you could n't see a break in it hardly ever , or a light .
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 18]: We talked about Cairo , and wondered whether we would know it when we got to it .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 46]: I said likely we would n't , because I had heard say there war n't but about a dozen houses there , and if they did n't happen to have them lit up , how was we going to know we was passing a town ?
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 15]: Jim said if the two big rivers joined together there , that would show .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 24]: But I said maybe we might think we was passing the foot of an island and coming into the same old river again .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 8]: That disturbed Jim -- and me too .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 9]: So the question was , what to do ?
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 45]: I said , paddle ashore the first time a light showed , and tell them pap was behind , coming along with a trading-scow , and was a green hand at the business , and wanted to know how far it was to Cairo .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 18]: Jim thought it was a good idea , so we took a smoke on it and waited .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 24]: There war n't nothing to do now but to look out sharp for the town , and not pass it without seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 44]: He said he 'd be mighty sure to see it , because he 'd be a free man the minute he seen it , but if he missed it he 'd be in a slave country again and no more show for freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 15]: Every little while he jumps up and says : `` Dah she is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 5]: But it war n't .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 26]: It was Jack-o ' - lanterns , or lightning bugs ; so he set down again , and went to watching , same as before .
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 17]: Jim said it made him all over trembly and feverish to be so close to freedom .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 44]: Well , I can tell you it made me all over trembly and feverish , too , to hear him , because I begun to get it through my head that he WAS most free -- and who was to blame for it ?
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 4]: Why , ME .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 16]: I could n't get that out of my conscience , no how nor no way .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 20]: It got to troubling me so I could n't rest ; I could n't stay still in one place .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 19]: It had n't ever come home to me before , what this thing was that I was doing .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 18]: But now it did ; and it stayed with me , and scorched me more and more .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 63]: I tried to make out to myself that I war n't to blame , because I did n't run Jim off from his rightful owner ; but it war n't no use , conscience up and says , every time , `` But you knowed he was running for his freedom , and you could a paddled ashore and told somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 12]: That was so -- I could n't get around that noway .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 6]: That was where it pinched .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 33]: Conscience says to me , `` What had poor Miss Watson done to you that you could see her nigger go off right under your eyes and never say one single word ?
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 17]: What did that poor old woman do to you that you could treat her so mean ?
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 31]: Why , she tried to learn you your book , she tried to learn you your manners , she tried to be good to you every way she knowed how .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 7]: THAT 'S what she done . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 16]: I got to feeling so mean and so miserable I most wished I was dead .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 23]: I fidgeted up and down the raft , abusing myself to myself , and Jim was fidgeting up and down past me .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 8]: We neither of us could keep still .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 14]: Every time he danced around and says , `` Dah 's Cairo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 23]: it went through me like a shot , and I thought if it WAS Cairo I reckoned I would die of miserableness .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 14]: Jim talked out loud all the time while I was talking to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 89]: He was saying how the first thing he would do when he got to a free State he would go to saving up money and never spend a single cent , and when he got enough he would buy his wife , which was owned on a farm close to where Miss Watson lived ; and then they would both work to buy the two children , and if their master would n't sell them , they 'd get an Ab ` litionist to go and steal them .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 9]: It most froze me to hear such talk .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 14]: He would n't ever dared to talk such talk in his life before .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 18]: Just see what a difference it made in him the minute he judged he was about free .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 22]: It was according to the old saying , `` Give a nigger an inch and he 'll take an ell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 12]: Thinks I , this is what comes of my not thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 51]: Here was this nigger , which I had as good as helped to run away , coming right out flat-footed and saying he would steal his children -- children that belonged to a man I did n't even know ; a man that had n't ever done me no harm .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 17]: I was sorry to hear Jim say that , it was such a lowering of him .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 44]: My conscience got to stirring me up hotter than ever , until at last I says to it , `` Let up on me -- it ai n't too late yet -- I 'll paddle ashore at the first light and tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 13]: I felt easy and happy and light as a feather right off .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 6]: All my troubles was gone .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 17]: I went to looking out sharp for a light , and sort of singing to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 6]: By and by one showed .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 15]: Jim sings out : `` We 's safe , Huck , we 's safe !
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 8]: Jump up and crack yo ' heels !
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 16]: Dat 's de good ole Cairo at las ' , I jis knows it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 16]: I says : `` I 'll take the canoe and go and see , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 9]: It might n't be , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 87]: He jumped and got the canoe ready , and put his old coat in the bottom for me to set on , and give me the paddle ; and as I shoved off , he says : `` Pooty soon I 'll be a-shout 'n' for joy , en I 'll say , it 's all on accounts o ' Huck ; I 's a free man , en I could n't ever ben free ef it hadn ' ben for Huck ; Huck done it .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 35]: Jim wo n't ever forgit you , Huck ; you 's de bes ' fren ' Jim 's ever had ; en you 's de ONLY fren ' ole Jim 's got now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 33]: I was paddling off , all in a sweat to tell on him ; but when he says this , it seemed to kind of take the tuck all out of me .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 25]: I went along slow then , and I war n't right down certain whether I was glad I started or whether I war n't .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 37]: When I was fifty yards off , Jim says : `` Dah you goes , de ole true Huck ; de on ' y white genlman dat ever kep ' his promise to ole Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 7]: Well , I just felt sick .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 18]: But I says , I GOT to do it -- I ca n't get OUT of it .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 21]: Right then along comes a skiff with two men in it with guns , and they stopped and I stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 12]: One of them says : `` What 's that yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 11]: `` A piece of a raft , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 8]: `` Do you belong on it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 7]: `` Any men on it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 7]: `` Only one , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 20]: `` Well , there 's five niggers run off to-night up yonder , above the head of the bend .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 8]: Is your man white or black ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 7]: I did n't answer up prompt .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 11]: I tried to , but the words would n't come .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 30]: I tried for a second or two to brace up and out with it , but I war n't man enough -- had n't the spunk of a rabbit .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 24]: I see I was weakening ; so I just give up trying , and up and says : `` He 's white . ''
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 12]: `` I reckon we 'll go and see for ourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 34]: `` I wish you would , '' says I , `` because it 's pap that 's there , and maybe you 'd help me tow the raft ashore where the light is .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 13]: He 's sick -- and so is mam and Mary Ann . ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 6]: `` Oh , the devil !
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 8]: we 're in a hurry , boy .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 10]: But I s ` pose we 've got to .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 14]: Come , buckle to your paddle , and let 's get along . ''
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 12]: I buckled to my paddle and they laid to their oars .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 27]: When we had made a stroke or two , I says : `` Pap 'll be mighty much obleeged to you , I can tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 25]: Everybody goes away when I want them to help me tow the raft ashore , and I ca n't do it by myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 8]: `` Well , that 's infernal mean .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 4]: Odd , too .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 13]: Say , boy , what 's the matter with your father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 18]: `` It 's the -- a -- the -- well , it ai n't anything much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 4]: They stopped pulling .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 13]: It war n't but a mighty little ways to the raft now .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 11]: One says : `` Boy , that 's a lie .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 8]: What IS the matter with your pap ?
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 15]: Answer up square now , and it 'll be the better for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 19]: `` I will , sir , I will , honest -- but do n't leave us , please .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 37]: It 's the -- the -- Gentlemen , if you 'll only pull ahead , and let me heave you the headline , you wo n't have to come a-near the raft -- please do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 12]: `` Set her back , John , set her back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 3]: says one .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 4]: They backed water .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 10]: `` Keep away , boy -- keep to looard .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 14]: Confound it , I just expect the wind has blowed it to us .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 14]: Your pap 's got the small-pox , and you know it precious well .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 10]: Why did n't you come out and say so ?
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 10]: Do you want to spread it all over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 26]: `` Well , '' says I , a-blubbering , `` I 've told everybody before , and they just went away and left us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 10]: `` Poor devil , there 's something in that .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 26]: We are right down sorry for you , but we -- well , hang it , we do n't want the small-pox , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 11]: Look here , I 'll tell you what to do .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 17]: Do n't you try to land by yourself , or you 'll smash everything to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 23]: You float along down about twenty miles , and you 'll come to a town on the left-hand side of the river .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 27]: It will be long after sun-up then , and when you ask for help you tell them your folks are all down with chills and fever .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 16]: Do n't be a fool again , and let people guess what is the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 25]: Now we 're trying to do you a kindness ; so you just put twenty miles between us , that 's a good boy .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 20]: It would n't do any good to land yonder where the light is -- it 's only a wood-yard .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 22]: Say , I reckon your father 's poor , and I 'm bound to say he 's in pretty hard luck .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 22]: Here , I 'll put a twenty-dollar gold piece on this board , and you get it when it floats by .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 12]: I feel mighty mean to leave you ; but my kingdom !
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 15]: it wo n't do to fool with small-pox , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 25]: `` Hold on , Parker , '' says the other man , `` here 's a twenty to put on the board for me .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 20]: Good-bye , boy ; you do as Mr. Parker told you , and you 'll be all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 12]: `` That 's so , my boy -- good-bye , good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 23]: If you see any runaway niggers you get help and nab them , and you can make some money by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 27]: `` Good-bye , sir , '' says I ; `` I wo n't let no runaway niggers get by me if I can help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 86]: They went off and I got aboard the raft , feeling bad and low , because I knowed very well I had done wrong , and I see it war n't no use for me to try to learn to do right ; a body that do n't get STARTED right when he 's little ai n't got no show -- when the pinch comes there ai n't nothing to back him up and keep him to his work , and so he gets beat .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 37]: Then I thought a minute , and says to myself , hold on ; s ` pose you 'd a done right and give Jim up , would you felt better than what you do now ?
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 21]: No , says I , I 'd feel bad -- I 'd feel just the same way I do now .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 40]: Well , then , says I , what 's the use you learning to do right when it 's troublesome to do right and ai n't no trouble to do wrong , and the wages is just the same ?
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 4]: I was stuck .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 6]: I could n't answer that .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 24]: So I reckoned I would n't bother no more about it , but after this always do whichever come handiest at the time .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 11]: I went into the wigwam ; Jim war n't there .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 10]: I looked all around ; he war n't anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 7]: I says : `` Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 7]: `` Here I is , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 8]: Is dey out o ' sight yit ?
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 6]: Do n't talk loud . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 16]: He was in the river under the stern oar , with just his nose out .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 14]: I told him they were out of sight , so he come aboard .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 32]: He says : `` I was a-listenin ' to all de talk , en I slips into de river en was gwyne to shove for sho ' if dey come aboard .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 16]: Den I was gwyne to swim to de raf ' agin when dey was gone .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 11]: But lawsy , how you did fool 'em , Huck !
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 7]: Dat WUZ de smartes ' dodge !
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 29]: I tell you , chile , I ` spec it save ' ole Jim -- ole Jim ai n't going to forgit you for dat , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 7]: Then we talked about the money .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 11]: It was a pretty good raise -- twenty dollars apiece .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 30]: Jim said we could take deck passage on a steamboat now , and the money would last us as far as we wanted to go in the free States .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 22]: He said twenty mile more war n't far for the raft to go , but he wished we was already there .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 17]: Towards daybreak we tied up , and Jim was mighty particular about hiding the raft good .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 18]: Then he worked all day fixing things in bundles , and getting all ready to quit rafting .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 21]: That night about ten we hove in sight of the lights of a town away down in a left-hand bend .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 11]: I went off in the canoe to ask about it .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 18]: Pretty soon I found a man out in the river with a skiff , setting a trot-line .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 15]: I ranged up and says : `` Mister , is that town Cairo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 3]: `` Cairo ?
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 2]: no .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 9]: You must be a blame ' fool . ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 9]: `` What town is it , mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 12]: `` If you want to know , go and find out .
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 25]: If you stay here botherin ' around me for about a half a minute longer you 'll get something you wo n't want . ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 6]: I paddled to the raft .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 21]: Jim was awful disappointed , but I said never mind , Cairo would be the next place , I reckoned .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 26]: We passed another town before daylight , and I was going out again ; but it was high ground , so I did n't go .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 9]: No high ground about Cairo , Jim said .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 5]: I had forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 16]: We laid up for the day on a towhead tolerable close to the left-hand bank .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 6]: I begun to suspicion something .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 4]: So did Jim .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 16]: I says : `` Maybe we went by Cairo in the fog that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 14]: He says : `` Doan ' le 's talk about it , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 9]: Po ' niggers ca n't have no luck .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 14]: I awluz ` spected dat rattlesnake-skin war n't done wid its work . ''
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 24]: `` I wish I 'd never seen that snake-skin , Jim -- I do wish I 'd never laid eyes on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 15]: `` It ai n't yo ' fault , Huck ; you didn ' know .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 12]: Do n't you blame yo ` self ` bout it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 24]: When it was daylight , here was the clear Ohio water inshore , sure enough , and outside was the old regular Muddy !
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 8]: So it was all up with Cairo .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 6]: We talked it all over .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 23]: It would n't do to take to the shore ; we could n't take the raft up the stream , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 22]: There war n't no way but to wait for dark , and start back in the canoe and take the chances .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 34]: So we slept all day amongst the cottonwood thicket , so as to be fresh for the work , and when we went back to the raft about dark the canoe was gone !
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 11]: We did n't say a word for a good while .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 7]: There war n't anything to say .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 24]: We both knowed well enough it was some more work of the rattlesnake-skin ; so what was the use to talk about it ?
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 37]: It would only look like we was finding fault , and that would be bound to fetch more bad luck -- and keep on fetching it , too , till we knowed enough to keep still .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 41]: By and by we talked about what we better do , and found there war n't no way but just to go along down with the raft till we got a chance to buy a canoe to go back in .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 28]: We war n't going to borrow it when there war n't anybody around , the way pap would do , for that might set people after us .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 10]: So we shoved out after dark on the raft .
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 41]: Anybody that do n't believe yet that it 's foolishness to handle a snake-skin , after all that that snake-skin done for us , will believe it now if they read on and see what more it done for us .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 14]: The place to buy canoes is off of rafts laying up at shore .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 20]: But we did n't see no rafts laying up ; so we went along during three hours and more .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 19]: Well , the night got gray and ruther thick , which is the next meanest thing to fog .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 18]: You ca n't tell the shape of the river , and you ca n't see no distance .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 19]: It got to be very late and still , and then along comes a steamboat up the river .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 12]: We lit the lantern , and judged she would see it .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 41]: Up-stream boats did n't generly come close to us ; they go out and follow the bars and hunt for easy water under the reefs ; but nights like this they bull right up the channel against the whole river .
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 19]: We could hear her pounding along , but we did n't see her good till she was close .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 6]: She aimed right for us .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 42]: Often they do that and try to see how close they can come without touching ; sometimes the wheel bites off a sweep , and then the pilot sticks his head out and laughs , and thinks he 's mighty smart .
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 30]: Well , here she comes , and we said she was going to try and shave us ; but she did n't seem to be sheering off a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 65]: She was a big one , and she was coming in a hurry , too , looking like a black cloud with rows of glow-worms around it ; but all of a sudden she bulged out , big and scary , with a long row of wide-open furnace doors shining like red-hot teeth , and her monstrous bows and guards hanging right over us .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 49]: There was a yell at us , and a jingling of bells to stop the engines , a powwow of cussing , and whistling of steam -- and as Jim went overboard on one side and I on the other , she come smashing straight through the raft .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 34]: I dived -- and I aimed to find the bottom , too , for a thirty-foot wheel had got to go over me , and I wanted it to have plenty of room .
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 22]: I could always stay under water a minute ; this time I reckon I stayed under a minute and a half .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 16]: Then I bounced for the top in a hurry , for I was nearly busting .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 20]: I popped out to my armpits and blowed the water out of my nose , and puffed a bit .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 56]: Of course there was a booming current ; and of course that boat started her engines again ten seconds after she stopped them , for they never cared much for raftsmen ; so now she was churning along up the river , out of sight in the thick weather , though I could hear her .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 46]: I sung out for Jim about a dozen times , but I did n't get any answer ; so I grabbed a plank that touched me while I was `` treading water , '' and struck out for shore , shoving it ahead of me .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 36]: But I made out to see that the drift of the current was towards the left-hand shore , which meant that I was in a crossing ; so I changed off and went that way .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 23]: It was one of these long , slanting , two-mile crossings ; so I was a good long time in getting over .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 12]: I made a safe landing , and clumb up the bank .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 41]: I could n't see but a little ways , but I went poking along over rough ground for a quarter of a mile or more , and then I run across a big old-fashioned double log-house before I noticed it .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 36]: I was going to rush by and get away , but a lot of dogs jumped out and went to howling and barking at me , and I knowed better than to move another peg .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVII .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 25]: IN about a minute somebody spoke out of a window without putting his head out , and says : `` Be done , boys !
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 5]: Who 's there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 9]: I says : `` It 's me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 6]: `` Who 's me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 7]: `` George Jackson , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 7]: `` What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 9]: `` I do n't want nothing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 17]: I only want to go along by , but the dogs wo n't let me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 16]: `` What are you prowling around here this time of night for -- hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 18]: `` I war n't prowling around , sir , I fell overboard off of the steamboat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 9]: `` Oh , you did , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 7]: Strike a light there , somebody .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: What did you say your name was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 6]: `` George Jackson , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 7]: I 'm only a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 21]: `` Look here , if you 're telling the truth you need n't be afraid -- nobody 'll hurt you .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: But do n't try to budge ; stand right where you are .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 15]: Rouse out Bob and Tom , some of you , and fetch the guns .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 10]: George Jackson , is there anybody with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 8]: `` No , sir , nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 16]: I heard the people stirring around in the house now , and see a light .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 24]: The man sung out : `` Snatch that light away , Betsy , you old fool -- ai n't you got any sense ?
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 10]: Put it on the floor behind the front door .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 14]: Bob , if you and Tom are ready , take your places . ''
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 5]: `` All ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 13]: `` Now , George Jackson , do you know the Shepherdsons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 12]: `` No , sir ; I never heard of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 13]: `` Well , that may be so , and it may n't .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 5]: Now , all ready .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 6]: Step forward , George Jackson .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 12]: And mind , do n't you hurry -- come mighty slow .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 21]: If there 's anybody with you , let him keep back -- if he shows himself he 'll be shot .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 4]: Come along now .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 20]: Come slow ; push the door open yourself -- just enough to squeeze in , d' you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 15]: I did n't hurry ; I could n't if I 'd a wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 24]: I took one slow step at a time and there war n't a sound , only I thought I could hear my heart .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 17]: The dogs were as still as the humans , but they followed a little behind me .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 17]: When I got to the three log doorsteps I heard them unlocking and unbarring and unbolting .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 33]: I put my hand on the door and pushed it a little and a little more till somebody said , `` There , that 's enough -- put your head in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 13]: I done it , but I judged they would take it off .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 92]: The candle was on the floor , and there they all was , looking at me , and me at them , for about a quarter of a minute : Three big men with guns pointed at me , which made me wince , I tell you ; the oldest , gray and about sixty , the other two thirty or more -- all of them fine and handsome -- and the sweetest old gray-headed lady , and back of her two young women which I could n't see right well .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 15]: The old gentleman says : `` There ; I reckon it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 4]: Come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 75]: As soon as I was in the old gentleman he locked the door and barred it and bolted it , and told the young men to come in with their guns , and they all went in a big parlor that had a new rag carpet on the floor , and got together in a corner that was out of the range of the front windows -- there war n't none on the side .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 37]: They held the candle , and took a good look at me , and all said , `` Why , HE ai n't a Shepherdson -- no , there ai n't any Shepherdson about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 33]: Then the old man said he hoped I would n't mind being searched for arms , because he did n't mean no harm by it -- it was only to make sure .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 24]: So he did n't pry into my pockets , but only felt outside with his hands , and said it was all right .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 55]: He told me to make myself easy and at home , and tell all about myself ; but the old lady says : `` Why , bless you , Saul , the poor thing 's as wet as he can be ; and do n't you reckon it may be he 's hungry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 11]: `` True for you , Rachel -- I forgot . ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 57]: So the old lady says : `` Betsy '' -LRB- this was a nigger woman -RRB- , `` you fly around and get him something to eat as quick as you can , poor thing ; and one of you girls go and wake up Buck and tell him -- oh , here he is himself .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 27]: Buck , take this little stranger and get the wet clothes off from him and dress him up in some of yours that 's dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 24]: Buck looked about as old as me -- thirteen or fourteen or along there , though he was a little bigger than me .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 15]: He had n't on anything but a shirt , and he was very frowzy-headed .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 24]: He came in gaping and digging one fist into his eyes , and he was dragging a gun along with the other one .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 12]: He says : `` Ai n't they no Shepherdsons around ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 11]: They said , no , 't was a false alarm .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 24]: `` Well , '' he says , `` if they 'd a ben some , I reckon I 'd a got one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 29]: They all laughed , and Bob says : `` Why , Buck , they might have scalped us all , you 've been so slow in coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 27]: `` Well , nobody come after me , and it ai n't right I 'm always kept down ; I do n't get no show . ''
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 34]: `` Never mind , Buck , my boy , '' says the old man , `` you 'll have show enough , all in good time , do n't you fret about that .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 16]: Go ` long with you now , and do as your mother told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 27]: When we got up-stairs to his room he got me a coarse shirt and a roundabout and pants of his , and I put them on .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 54]: While I was at it he asked me what my name was , but before I could tell him he started to tell me about a bluejay and a young rabbit he had catched in the woods day before yesterday , and he asked me where Moses was when the candle went out .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 18]: I said I did n't know ; I had n't heard about it before , no way .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 9]: `` Well , guess , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 23]: `` How 'm I going to guess , '' says I , `` when I never heard tell of it before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 10]: `` But you can guess , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 7]: It 's just as easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 5]: `` WHICH candle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 10]: `` Why , any candle , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 19]: `` I do n't know where he was , '' says I ; `` where was he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 9]: `` Why , he was in the DARK !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 7]: That 's where he was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 18]: `` Well , if you knowed where he was , what did you ask me for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 16]: `` Why , blame it , it 's a riddle , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 11]: Say , how long are you going to stay here ?
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 6]: You got to stay always .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 15]: We can just have booming times -- they do n't have no school now .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 6]: Do you own a dog ?
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 22]: I 've got a dog -- and he 'll go in the river and bring out chips that you throw in .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 15]: Do you like to comb up Sundays , and all that kind of foolishness ?
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 12]: You bet I do n't , but ma she makes me .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 5]: Confound these ole britches !
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 20]: I reckon I 'd better put 'em on , but I 'd ruther not , it 's so warm .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 5]: Are you all ready ?
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 3]: All right .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 7]: Come along , old hoss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 34]: Cold corn-pone , cold corn-beef , butter and buttermilk -- that is what they had for me down there , and there ai n't nothing better that ever I 've come across yet .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 27]: Buck and his ma and all of them smoked cob pipes , except the nigger woman , which was gone , and the two young women .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 12]: They all smoked and talked , and I eat and talked .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 15]: The young women had quilts around them , and their hair down their backs .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 141]: They all asked me questions , and I told them how pap and me and all the family was living on a little farm down at the bottom of Arkansaw , and my sister Mary Ann run off and got married and never was heard of no more , and Bill went to hunt them and he war n't heard of no more , and Tom and Mort died , and then there war n't nobody but just me and pap left , and he was just trimmed down to nothing , on account of his troubles ; so when he died I took what there was left , because the farm did n't belong to us , and started up the river , deck passage , and fell overboard ; and that was how I come to be here .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 16]: So they said I could have a home there as long as I wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 40]: Then it was most daylight and everybody went to bed , and I went to bed with Buck , and when I waked up in the morning , drat it all , I had forgot what my name was .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 27]: So I laid there about an hour trying to think , and when Buck waked up I says : `` Can you spell , Buck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 27]: `` I bet you ca n't spell my name , '' says I. `` I bet you what you dare I can , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 13]: `` All right , '' says I , `` go ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 11]: `` G-e-o-r-g-e J-a-x-o-n -- there now , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 20]: `` Well , '' says I , `` you done it , but I did n't think you could .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 17]: It ai n't no slouch of a name to spell -- right off without studying . ''
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 37]: I set it down , private , because somebody might want ME to spell it next , and so I wanted to be handy with it and rattle it off like I was used to it .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 15]: It was a mighty nice family , and a mighty nice house , too .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 21]: I had n't seen no house out in the country before that was so nice and had so much style .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 35]: It did n't have an iron latch on the front door , nor a wooden one with a buckskin string , but a brass knob to turn , the same as houses in town .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 27]: There war n't no bed in the parlor , nor a sign of a bed ; but heaps of parlors in towns has beds in them .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 52]: There was a big fireplace that was bricked on the bottom , and the bricks was kept clean and red by pouring water on them and scrubbing them with another brick ; sometimes they wash them over with red water-paint that they call Spanish-brown , same as they do in town .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 12]: They had big brass dog-irons that could hold up a saw-log .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 50]: There was a clock on the middle of the mantelpiece , with a picture of a town painted on the bottom half of the glass front , and a round place in the middle of it for the sun , and you could see the pendulum swinging behind it .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 46]: It was beautiful to hear that clock tick ; and sometimes when one of these peddlers had been along and scoured her up and got her in good shape , she would start in and strike a hundred and fifty before she got tuckered out .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 9]: They would n't took any money for her .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 27]: Well , there was a big outlandish parrot on each side of the clock , made out of something like chalk , and painted up gaudy .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 42]: By one of the parrots was a cat made of crockery , and a crockery dog by the other ; and when you pressed down on them they squeaked , but did n't open their mouths nor look different nor interested .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 5]: They squeaked through underneath .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 14]: There was a couple of big wild-turkey-wing fans spread out behind those things .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 72]: On the table in the middle of the room was a kind of a lovely crockery basket that had apples and oranges and peaches and grapes piled up in it , which was much redder and yellower and prettier than real ones is , but they war n't real because you could see where pieces had got chipped off and showed the white chalk , or whatever it was , underneath .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 28]: This table had a cover made out of beautiful oilcloth , with a red and blue spread-eagle painted on it , and a painted border all around .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 11]: It come all the way from Philadelphia , they said .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 19]: There was some books , too , piled up perfectly exact , on each corner of the table .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 10]: One was a big family Bible full of pictures .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 20]: One was Pilgrim 's Progress , about a man that left his family , it did n't say why .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 9]: I read considerable in it now and then .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 8]: The statements was interesting , but tough .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 21]: Another was Friendship 's Offering , full of beautiful stuff and poetry ; but I did n't read the poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 32]: Another was Henry Clay 's Speeches , and another was Dr. Gunn 's Family Medicine , which told you all about what to do if a body was sick or dead .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 13]: There was a hymn book , and a lot of other books .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 27]: And there was nice split-bottom chairs , and perfectly sound , too -- not bagged down in the middle and busted , like an old basket .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 29]: They had pictures hung on the walls -- mainly Washingtons and Lafayettes , and battles , and Highland Marys , and one called `` Signing the Declaration . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 28]: There was some that they called crayons , which one of the daughters which was dead made her own self when she was only fifteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 19]: They was different from any pictures I ever see before -- blacker , mostly , than is common .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 109]: One was a woman in a slim black dress , belted small under the armpits , with bulges like a cabbage in the middle of the sleeves , and a large black scoop-shovel bonnet with a black veil , and white slim ankles crossed about with black tape , and very wee black slippers , like a chisel , and she was leaning pensive on a tombstone on her right elbow , under a weeping willow , and her other hand hanging down her side holding a white handkerchief and a reticule , and underneath the picture it said `` Shall I Never See Thee More Alas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 75]: Another one was a young lady with her hair all combed up straight to the top of her head , and knotted there in front of a comb like a chair-back , and she was crying into a handkerchief and had a dead bird laying on its back in her other hand with its heels up , and underneath the picture it said `` I Shall Never Hear Thy Sweet Chirrup More Alas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 77]: There was one where a young lady was at a window looking up at the moon , and tears running down her cheeks ; and she had an open letter in one hand with black sealing wax showing on one edge of it , and she was mashing a locket with a chain to it against her mouth , and underneath the picture it said `` And Art Thou Gone Yes Thou Art Gone Alas . ''
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 35]: These was all nice pictures , I reckon , but I did n't somehow seem to take to them , because if ever I was down a little they always give me the fan-tods .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 35]: Everybody was sorry she died , because she had laid out a lot more of these pictures to do , and a body could see by what she had done what they had lost .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 17]: But I reckoned that with her disposition she was having a better time in the graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 45]: She was at work on what they said was her greatest picture when she took sick , and every day and every night it was her prayer to be allowed to live till she got it done , but she never got the chance .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 143]: It was a picture of a young woman in a long white gown , standing on the rail of a bridge all ready to jump off , with her hair all down her back , and looking up to the moon , with the tears running down her face , and she had two arms folded across her breast , and two arms stretched out in front , and two more reaching up towards the moon -- and the idea was to see which pair would look best , and then scratch out all the other arms ; but , as I was saying , she died before she got her mind made up , and now they kept this picture over the head of the bed in her room , and every time her birthday come they hung flowers on it .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 10]: Other times it was hid with a little curtain .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 32]: The young woman in the picture had a kind of a nice sweet face , but there was so many arms it made her look too spidery , seemed to me .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 42]: This young girl kept a scrap-book when she was alive , and used to paste obituaries and accidents and cases of patient suffering in it out of the Presbyterian Observer , and write poetry after them out of her own head .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 6]: It was very good poetry .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 44]: This is what she wrote about a boy by the name of Stephen Dowling Bots that fell down a well and was drownded : ODE TO STEPHEN DOWLING BOTS , DEC 'D And did young Stephen sicken , And did young Stephen die ?
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 13]: And did the sad hearts thicken , And did the mourners cry ?
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 28]: No ; such was not the fate of Young Stephen Dowling Bots ; Though sad hearts round him thickened , 'T was not from sickness ' shots .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 24]: No whooping-cough did rack his frame , Nor measles drear with spots ; Not these impaired the sacred name Of Stephen Dowling Bots .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 24]: Despised love struck not with woe That head of curly knots , Nor stomach troubles laid him low , Young Stephen Dowling Bots .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 3]: O no .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 13]: Then list with tearful eye , Whilst I his fate do tell .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 14]: His soul did from this cold world fly By falling down a well .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 31]: They got him out and emptied him ; Alas it was too late ; His spirit was gone for to sport aloft In the realms of the good and great .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 27]: If Emmeline Grangerford could make poetry like that before she was fourteen , there ai n't no telling what she could a done by and by .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 10]: Buck said she could rattle off poetry like nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 10]: She did n't ever have to stop to think .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 35]: He said she would slap down a line , and if she could n't find anything to rhyme with it would just scratch it out and slap down another one , and go ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 24]: She war n't particular ; she could write about anything you choose to give her to write about just so it was sadful .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 31]: Every time a man died , or a woman died , or a child died , she would be on hand with her `` tribute '' before he was cold .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 5]: She called them tributes .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 46]: The neighbors said it was the doctor first , then Emmeline , then the undertaker -- the undertaker never got in ahead of Emmeline but once , and then she hung fire on a rhyme for the dead person 's name , which was Whistler .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 24]: She war n't ever the same after that ; she never complained , but she kinder pined away and did not live long .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 48]: Poor thing , many 's the time I made myself go up to the little room that used to be hers and get out her poor old scrap-book and read in it when her pictures had been aggravating me and I had soured on her a little .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 22]: I liked all that family , dead ones and all , and war n't going to let anything come between us .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 58]: Poor Emmeline made poetry about all the dead people when she was alive , and it did n't seem right that there war n't nobody to make some about her now she was gone ; so I tried to sweat out a verse or two myself , but I could n't seem to make it go somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 35]: They kept Emmeline 's room trim and nice , and all the things fixed in it just the way she liked to have them when she was alive , and nobody ever slept there .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 31]: The old lady took care of the room herself , though there was plenty of niggers , and she sewed there a good deal and read her Bible there mostly .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 41]: Well , as I was saying about the parlor , there was beautiful curtains on the windows : white , with pictures painted on them of castles with vines all down the walls , and cattle coming down to drink .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 50]: There was a little old piano , too , that had tin pans in it , I reckon , and nothing was ever so lovely as to hear the young ladies sing `` The Last Link is Broken '' and play `` The Battle of Prague '' on it .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 27]: The walls of all the rooms was plastered , and most had carpets on the floors , and the whole house was whitewashed on the outside .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 41]: It was a double house , and the big open place betwixt them was roofed and floored , and sometimes the table was set there in the middle of the day , and it was a cool , comfortable place .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 6]: Nothing could n't be better .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 14]: And war n't the cooking good , and just bushels of it too !
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 3]: CHAPTER XVIII .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 9]: COL. GRANGERFORD was a gentleman , you see .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 13]: He was a gentleman all over ; and so was his family .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 68]: He was well born , as the saying is , and that 's worth as much in a man as it is in a horse , so the Widow Douglas said , and nobody ever denied that she was of the first aristocracy in our town ; and pap he always said it , too , though he war n't no more quality than a mudcat himself .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 90]: Col. Grangerford was very tall and very slim , and had a darkish-paly complexion , not a sign of red in it anywheres ; he was clean shaved every morning all over his thin face , and he had the thinnest kind of lips , and the thinnest kind of nostrils , and a high nose , and heavy eyebrows , and the blackest kind of eyes , sunk so deep back that they seemed like they was looking out of caverns at you , as you may say .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 18]: His forehead was high , and his hair was black and straight and hung to his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 56]: His hands was long and thin , and every day of his life he put on a clean shirt and a full suit from head to foot made out of linen so white it hurt your eyes to look at it ; and on Sundays he wore a blue tail-coat with brass buttons on it .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 12]: He carried a mahogany cane with a silver head to it .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 19]: There war n't no frivolishness about him , not a bit , and he war n't ever loud .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 23]: He was as kind as he could be -- you could feel that , you know , and so you had confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 50]: Sometimes he smiled , and it was good to see ; but when he straightened himself up like a liberty-pole , and the lightning begun to flicker out from under his eyebrows , you wanted to climb a tree first , and find out what the matter was afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 21]: He did n't ever have to tell anybody to mind their manners -- everybody was always good-mannered where he was .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 25]: Everybody loved to have him around , too ; he was sunshine most always -- I mean he made it seem like good weather .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 31]: When he turned into a cloudbank it was awful dark for half a minute , and that was enough ; there would n't nothing go wrong again for a week .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 37]: When him and the old lady come down in the morning all the family got up out of their chairs and give them good-day , and did n't set down again till they had set down .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 128]: Then Tom and Bob went to the sideboard where the decanter was , and mixed a glass of bitters and handed it to him , and he held it in his hand and waited till Tom 's and Bob 's was mixed , and then they bowed and said , `` Our duty to you , sir , and madam ; '' and THEY bowed the least bit in the world and said thank you , and so they drank , all three , and Bob and Tom poured a spoonful of water on the sugar and the mite of whisky or apple brandy in the bottom of their tumblers , and give it to me and Buck , and we drank to the old people too .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 28]: Bob was the oldest and Tom next -- tall , beautiful men with very broad shoulders and brown faces , and long black hair and black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 21]: They dressed in white linen from head to foot , like the old gentleman , and wore broad Panama hats .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 52]: Then there was Miss Charlotte ; she was twenty-five , and tall and proud and grand , but as good as she could be when she war n't stirred up ; but when she was she had a look that would make you wilt in your tracks , like her father .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 4]: She was beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 15]: So was her sister , Miss Sophia , but it was a different kind .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 15]: She was gentle and sweet like a dove , and she was only twenty .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 14]: Each person had their own nigger to wait on them -- Buck too .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 33]: My nigger had a monstrous easy time , because I war n't used to having anybody do anything for me , but Buck 's was on the jump most of the time .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 29]: This was all there was of the family now , but there used to be more -- three sons ; they got killed ; and Emmeline that died .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 14]: The old gentleman owned a lot of farms and over a hundred niggers .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 52]: Sometimes a stack of people would come there , horseback , from ten or fifteen mile around , and stay five or six days , and have such junketings round about and on the river , and dances and picnics in the woods daytimes , and balls at the house nights .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 9]: These people was mostly kinfolks of the family .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 8]: The men brought their guns with them .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 12]: It was a handsome lot of quality , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 21]: There was another clan of aristocracy around there -- five or six families -- mostly of the name of Shepherdson .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 17]: They was as high-toned and well born and rich and grand as the tribe of Grangerfords .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 47]: The Shepherdsons and Grangerfords used the same steamboat landing , which was about two mile above our house ; so sometimes when I went up there with a lot of our folks I used to see a lot of the Shepherdsons there on their fine horses .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 19]: One day Buck and me was away out in the woods hunting , and heard a horse coming .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 6]: We was crossing the road .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 6]: Buck says : `` Quick !
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 6]: Jump for the woods ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 14]: We done it , and then peeped down the woods through the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 22]: Pretty soon a splendid young man come galloping down the road , setting his horse easy and looking like a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 8]: He had his gun across his pommel .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 6]: I had seen him before .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 6]: It was young Harney Shepherdson .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 21]: I heard Buck 's gun go off at my ear , and Harney 's hat tumbled off from his head .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 15]: He grabbed his gun and rode straight to the place where we was hid .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 6]: But we did n't wait .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 9]: We started through the woods on a run .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 52]: The woods war n't thick , so I looked over my shoulder to dodge the bullet , and twice I seen Harney cover Buck with his gun ; and then he rode away the way he come -- to get his hat , I reckon , but I could n't see .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 9]: We never stopped running till we got home .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 46]: The old gentleman 's eyes blazed a minute -- 't was pleasure , mainly , I judged -- then his face sort of smoothed down , and he says , kind of gentle : `` I do n't like that shooting from behind a bush .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 13]: Why did n't you step into the road , my boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 8]: `` The Shepherdsons do n't , father .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 6]: They always take advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 26]: Miss Charlotte she held her head up like a queen while Buck was telling his tale , and her nostrils spread and her eyes snapped .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 12]: The two young men looked dark , but never said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 20]: Miss Sophia she turned pale , but the color come back when she found the man war n't hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 30]: Soon as I could get Buck down by the corn-cribs under the trees by ourselves , I says : `` Did you want to kill him , Buck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 9]: `` Well , I bet I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 9]: `` What did he do to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 3]: `` Him ?
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 8]: He never done nothing to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 15]: `` Well , then , what did you want to kill him for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 15]: `` Why , nothing -- only it 's on account of the feud . ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 7]: `` What 's a feud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 8]: `` Why , where was you raised ?
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 10]: Do n't you know what a feud is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 13]: `` Never heard of it before -- tell me about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 73]: `` Well , '' says Buck , `` a feud is this way : A man has a quarrel with another man , and kills him ; then that other man 's brother kills HIM ; then the other brothers , on both sides , goes for one another ; then the COUSINS chip in -- and by and by everybody 's killed off , and there ai n't no more feud .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 14]: But it 's kind of slow , and takes a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 12]: `` Has this one been going on long , Buck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 7]: `` Well , I should RECKON !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 13]: It started thirty year ago , or som ` ers along there .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 47]: There was trouble ` bout something , and then a lawsuit to settle it ; and the suit went agin one of the men , and so he up and shot the man that won the suit -- which he would naturally do , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 4]: Anybody would . ''
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 9]: `` What was the trouble about , Buck ?
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 4]: -- land ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 11]: `` I reckon maybe -- I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 8]: `` Well , who done the shooting ?
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 9]: Was it a Grangerford or a Shepherdson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 8]: `` Laws , how do I know ?
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 7]: It was so long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 7]: `` Do n't anybody know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 36]: `` Oh , yes , pa knows , I reckon , and some of the other old people ; but they do n't know now what the row was about in the first place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 10]: `` Has there been many killed , Buck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 9]: `` Yes ; right smart chance of funerals .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 7]: But they do n't always kill .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 25]: Pa 's got a few buckshot in him ; but he do n't mind it ` cuz he do n't weigh much , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 20]: Bob 's been carved up some with a bowie , and Tom 's been hurt once or twice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 11]: `` Has anybody been killed this year , Buck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 11]: `` Yes ; we got one and they got one .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 164]: ` Bout three months ago my cousin Bud , fourteen year old , was riding through the woods on t ` other side of the river , and did n't have no weapon with him , which was blame ' foolishness , and in a lonesome place he hears a horse a-coming behind him , and sees old Baldy Shepherdson a-linkin ' after him with his gun in his hand and his white hair a-flying in the wind ; and ` stead of jumping off and taking to the brush , Bud ` lowed he could out-run him ; so they had it , nip and tuck , for five mile or more , the old man a-gaining all the time ; so at last Bud seen it war n't any use , so he stopped and faced around so as to have the bullet holes in front , you know , and the old man he rode up and shot him down .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 24]: But he did n't git much chance to enjoy his luck , for inside of a week our folks laid HIM out . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 13]: `` I reckon that old man was a coward , Buck . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 9]: `` I reckon he WAR N'T a coward .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 7]: Not by a blame ' sight .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 13]: There ai n't a coward amongst them Shepherdsons -- not a one .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 11]: And there ai n't no cowards amongst the Grangerfords either .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 28]: Why , that old man kep ' up his end in a fight one day for half an hour against three Grangerfords , and come out winner .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 57]: They was all a-horseback ; he lit off of his horse and got behind a little woodpile , and kep ' his horse before him to stop the bullets ; but the Grangerfords stayed on their horses and capered around the old man , and peppered away at him , and he peppered away at them .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 35]: Him and his horse both went home pretty leaky and crippled , but the Grangerfords had to be FETCHED home -- and one of 'em was dead , and another died the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 36]: No , sir ; if a body 's out hunting for cowards he do n't want to fool away any time amongst them Shepherdsons , becuz they do n't breed any of that KIND . ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 15]: Next Sunday we all went to church , about three mile , everybody a-horseback .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 25]: The men took their guns along , so did Buck , and kept them between their knees or stood them handy against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 6]: The Shepherdsons done the same .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 79]: It was pretty ornery preaching -- all about brotherly love , and such-like tiresomeness ; but everybody said it was a good sermon , and they all talked it over going home , and had such a powerful lot to say about faith and good works and free grace and preforeordestination , and I do n't know what all , that it did seem to me to be one of the roughest Sundays I had run across yet .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 28]: About an hour after dinner everybody was dozing around , some in their chairs and some in their rooms , and it got to be pretty dull .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 16]: Buck and a dog was stretched out on the grass in the sun sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 16]: I went up to our room , and judged I would take a nap myself .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 67]: I found that sweet Miss Sophia standing in her door , which was next to ours , and she took me in her room and shut the door very soft , and asked me if I liked her , and I said I did ; and she asked me if I would do something for her and not tell anybody , and I said I would .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 44]: Then she said she 'd forgot her Testament , and left it in the seat at church between two other books , and would I slip out quiet and go there and fetch it to her , and not say nothing to nobody .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 5]: I said I would .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 50]: So I slid out and slipped off up the road , and there war n't anybody at the church , except maybe a hog or two , for there war n't any lock on the door , and hogs likes a puncheon floor in summer-time because it 's cool .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 24]: If you notice , most folks do n't go to church only when they 've got to ; but a hog is different .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 26]: Says I to myself , something 's up ; it ai n't natural for a girl to be in such a sweat about a Testament .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 27]: So I give it a shake , and out drops a little piece of paper with `` HALF-PAST TWO '' wrote on it with a pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 11]: I ransacked it , but could n't find anything else .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 37]: I could n't make anything out of that , so I put the paper in the book again , and when I got home and upstairs there was Miss Sophia in her door waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 64]: She pulled me in and shut the door ; then she looked in the Testament till she found the paper , and as soon as she read it she looked glad ; and before a body could think she grabbed me and give me a squeeze , and said I was the best boy in the world , and not to tell anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 24]: She was mighty red in the face for a minute , and her eyes lighted up , and it made her powerful pretty .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 83]: I was a good deal astonished , but when I got my breath I asked her what the paper was about , and she asked me if I had read it , and I said no , and she asked me if I could read writing , and I told her `` no , only coarse-hand , '' and then she said the paper war n't anything but a book-mark to keep her place , and I might go and play now .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 26]: I went off down to the river , studying over this thing , and pretty soon I noticed that my nigger was following along behind .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 49]: When we was out of sight of the house he looked back and around a second , and then comes a-running , and says : `` Mars Jawge , if you 'll come down into de swamp I 'll show you a whole stack o ' water-moccasins . ''
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 13]: Thinks I , that 's mighty curious ; he said that yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 17]: He oughter know a body do n't love water-moccasins enough to go around hunting for them .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 8]: What is he up to , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 12]: So I says : `` All right ; trot ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 25]: I followed a half a mile ; then he struck out over the swamp , and waded ankle deep as much as another half-mile .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 46]: We come to a little flat piece of land which was dry and very thick with trees and bushes and vines , and he says : `` You shove right in dah jist a few steps , Mars Jawge ; dah 's whah dey is .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 21]: I 's seed 'm befo ' ; I do n't k ` yer to see 'em no mo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 17]: Then he slopped right along and went away , and pretty soon the trees hid him .
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 43]: I poked into the place a-ways and come to a little open patch as big as a bedroom all hung around with vines , and found a man laying there asleep -- and , by jings , it was my old Jim !
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 28]: I waked him up , and I reckoned it was going to be a grand surprise to him to see me again , but it war n't .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 14]: He nearly cried he was so glad , but he war n't surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 38]: Said he swum along behind me that night , and heard me yell every time , but das n't answer , because he did n't want nobody to pick HIM up and take him into slavery again .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 68]: Says he : `` I got hurt a little , en could n't swim fas ' , so I wuz a considable ways behine you towards de las ' ; when you landed I reck ` ned I could ketch up wid you on de lan ' ` dout havin ' to shout at you , but when I see dat house I begin to go slow .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 51]: I ` uz off too fur to hear what dey say to you -- I wuz ` fraid o ' de dogs ; but when it ` uz all quiet agin I knowed you 's in de house , so I struck out for de woods to wait for day .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 62]: Early in de mawnin ' some er de niggers come along , gwyne to de fields , en dey tuk me en showed me dis place , whah de dogs ca n't track me on accounts o ' de water , en dey brings me truck to eat every night , en tells me how you 's a-gitt 'n along . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 17]: `` Why did n't you tell my Jack to fetch me here sooner , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 28]: `` Well , ` twar n't no use to ` sturb you , Huck , tell we could do sumfn -- but we 's all right now .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 34]: I ben a-buyin ' pots en pans en vittles , as I got a chanst , en a-patchin ' up de raf ' nights when -- '' `` WHAT raft , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 7]: `` Our ole raf ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 16]: `` You mean to say our old raft war n't smashed all to flinders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 7]: `` No , she war n't .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 36]: She was tore up a good deal -- one en ' of her was ; but dey war n't no great harm done , on ' y our traps was mos ' all los ' .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 52]: Ef we hadn ' dive ' so deep en swum so fur under water , en de night hadn ' ben so dark , en we war n't so sk ` yerd , en ben sich punkin-heads , as de sayin ' is , we 'd a seed de raf ' .
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 50]: But it 's jis ' as well we did n't , ` kase now she 's all fixed up agin mos ' as good as new , en we 's got a new lot o ' stuff , in de place o ' what ` uz los ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 21]: `` Why , how did you get hold of the raft again , Jim -- did you catch her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 14]: `` How I gwyne to ketch her en I out in de woods ?
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 117]: No ; some er de niggers foun ' her ketched on a snag along heah in de ben ' , en dey hid her in a crick ` mongst de willows , en dey wuz so much jawin ' ` bout which un ` um she b ` long to de mos ' dat I come to heah ` bout it pooty soon , so I ups en settles de trouble by tellin ' ` um she do n't b ` long to none uv um , but to you en me ; en I ast 'm if dey gwyne to grab a young white genlman 's propaty , en git a hid 'n for it ?

Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 12]: Dat Jack 's a good nigger , en pooty smart . ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 6]: `` Yes , he is .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 25]: He ai n't ever told me you was here ; told me to come , and he 'd show me a lot of water-moccasins .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 11]: If anything happens HE ai n't mixed up in it .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 17]: He can say he never seen us together , and it 'll be the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 12]: I do n't want to talk much about the next day .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 9]: I reckon I 'll cut it pretty short .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 33]: I waked up about dawn , and was a-going to turn over and go to sleep again when I noticed how still it was -- did n't seem to be anybody stirring .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 5]: That war n't usual .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 10]: Next I noticed that Buck was up and gone .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 23]: Well , I gets up , a-wondering , and goes down stairs -- nobody around ; everything as still as a mouse .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 5]: Just the same outside .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 8]: Thinks I , what does it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 21]: Down by the wood-pile I comes across my Jack , and says : `` What 's it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 13]: Says he : `` Do n't you know , Mars Jawge ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 13]: `` No , '' says I , `` I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: `` Well , den , Miss Sophia 's run off !
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 5]: ` deed she has .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 38]: She run off in de night some time -- nobody do n't know jis ' when ; run off to get married to dat young Harney Shepherdson , you know -- leastways , so dey ` spec .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 32]: De fambly foun ' it out ` bout half an hour ago -- maybe a little mo ' -- en ' I TELL you dey war n't no time los ' .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 12]: Sich another hurryin ' up guns en hosses YOU never see !
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 52]: De women folks has gone for to stir up de relations , en ole Mars Saul en de boys tuck dey guns en rode up de river road for to try to ketch dat young man en kill him ` fo ' he kin git acrost de river wid Miss Sophia .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 13]: I reck 'n dey 's gwyne to be mighty rough times . ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 11]: `` Buck went off ` thout waking me up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 9]: `` Well , I reck 'n he DID !
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 11]: Dey war n't gwyne to mix you up in it .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 21]: Mars Buck he loaded up his gun en ` lowed he 's gwyne to fetch home a Shepherdson or bust .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 30]: Well , dey 'll be plenty un 'm dah , I reck ` n , en you bet you he 'll fetch one ef he gits a chanst . ''
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 13]: I took up the river road as hard as I could put .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 13]: By and by I begin to hear guns a good ways off .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 52]: When I cOme in sight of the log store and the woodpile where the steamboats lands I worked along under the trees and brush till I got to a good place , and then I clumb up into the forks of a cottonwood that was out of reach , and watched .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 35]: There was a wood-rank four foot high a little ways in front of the tree , and first I was going to hide behind that ; but maybe it was luckier I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 52]: There was four or five men cavorting around on their horses in the open place before the log store , cussing and yelling , and trying to get at a couple of young chaps that was behind the wood-rank alongside of the steamboat landing ; but they could n't come it .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 19]: Every time one of them showed himself on the river side of the woodpile he got shot at .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 19]: The two boys was squatting back to back behind the pile , so they could watch both ways .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 11]: By and by the men stopped cavorting around and yelling .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 33]: They started riding towards the store ; then up gets one of the boys , draws a steady bead over the wood-rank , and drops one of them out of his saddle .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 33]: All the men jumped off of their horses and grabbed the hurt one and started to carry him to the store ; and that minute the two boys started on the run .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 15]: They got half way to the tree I was in before the men noticed .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 17]: Then the men see them , and jumped on their horses and took out after them .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 52]: They gained on the boys , but it did n't do no good , the boys had too good a start ; they got to the woodpile that was in front of my tree , and slipped in behind it , and so they had the bulge on the men again .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 20]: One of the boys was Buck , and the other was a slim young chap about nineteen years old .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 11]: The men ripped around awhile , and then rode away .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 17]: As soon as they was out of sight I sung out to Buck and told him .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 18]: He did n't know what to make of my voice coming out of the tree at first .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 5]: He was awful surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 35]: He told me to watch out sharp and let him know when the men come in sight again ; said they was up to some devilment or other -- would n't be gone long .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 16]: I wished I was out of that tree , but I das n't come down .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 32]: Buck begun to cry and rip , and ` lowed that him and his cousin Joe -LRB- that was the other young chap -RRB- would make up for this day yet .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 19]: He said his father and his two brothers was killed , and two or three of the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 9]: Said the Shepherdsons laid for them in ambush .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 21]: Buck said his father and brothers ought to waited for their relations -- the Shepherdsons was too strong for them .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 13]: I asked him what was become of young Harney and Miss Sophia .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 12]: He said they 'd got across the river and was safe .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 37]: I was glad of that ; but the way Buck did take on because he did n't manage to kill Harney that day he shot at him -- I hai n't ever heard anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 7]: All of a sudden , bang !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 2]: bang !
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 2]: bang !
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 23]: goes three or four guns -- the men had slipped around through the woods and come in from behind without their horses !
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 40]: The boys jumped for the river -- both of them hurt -- and as they swum down the current the men run along the bank shooting at them and singing out , `` Kill them , kill them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 13]: It made me so sick I most fell out of the tree .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 23]: I ai n't a-going to tell ALL that happened -- it would make me sick again if I was to do that .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 15]: I wished I had n't ever come ashore that night to see such things .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 19]: I ai n't ever going to get shut of them -- lots of times I dream about them .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 17]: I stayed in the tree till it begun to get dark , afraid to come down .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 36]: Sometimes I heard guns away off in the woods ; and twice I seen little gangs of men gallop past the log store with guns ; so I reckoned the trouble was still a-going on .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 31]: I was mighty downhearted ; so I made up my mind I would n't ever go anear that house again , because I reckoned I was to blame , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 61]: I judged that that piece of paper meant that Miss Sophia was to meet Harney somewheres at half-past two and run off ; and I judged I ought to told her father about that paper and the curious way she acted , and then maybe he would a locked her up , and this awful mess would n't ever happened .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 57]: When I got down out of the tree I crept along down the river bank a piece , and found the two bodies laying in the edge of the water , and tugged at them till I got them ashore ; then I covered up their faces , and got away as quick as I could .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 21]: I cried a little when I was covering up Buck 's face , for he was mighty good to me .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 6]: It was just dark now .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 18]: I never went near the house , but struck through the woods and made for the swamp .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 36]: Jim war n't on his island , so I tramped off in a hurry for the crick , and crowded through the willows , red-hot to jump aboard and get out of that awful country .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 5]: The raft was gone !
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 8]: My souls , but I was scared !
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 11]: I could n't get my breath for most a minute .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 6]: Then I raised a yell .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 14]: A voice not twenty-five foot from me says : `` Good lan ' !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 6]: is dat you , honey ?
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 7]: Doan ' make no noise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 13]: It was Jim 's voice -- nothing ever sounded so good before .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 28]: I run along the bank a piece and got aboard , and Jim he grabbed me and hugged me , he was so glad to see me .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 22]: He says : `` Laws bless you , chile , I ` uz right down sho ' you 's dead agin .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 72]: Jack 's been heah ; he say he reck 'n you 's ben shot , kase you didn ' come home no mo ' ; so I 's jes ' dis minute a startin ' de raf ' down towards de mouf er de crick , so 's to be all ready for to shove out en leave soon as Jack comes agin en tells me for certain you IS dead .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 15]: Lawsy , I 's mighty glad to git you back again , honey . ''
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 71]: I says : `` All right -- that 's mighty good ; they wo n't find me , and they 'll think I 've been killed , and floated down the river -- there 's something up there that 'll help them think so -- so do n't you lose no time , Jim , but just shove off for the big water as fast as ever you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 21]: I never felt easy till the raft was two mile below there and out in the middle of the Mississippi .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 19]: Then we hung up our signal lantern , and judged that we was free and safe once more .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 57]: I had n't had a bite to eat since yesterday , so Jim he got out some corn-dodgers and buttermilk , and pork and cabbage and greens -- there ai n't nothing in the world so good when it 's cooked right -- and whilst I eat my supper we talked and had a good time .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 22]: I was powerful glad to get away from the feuds , and so was Jim to get away from the swamp .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 14]: We said there war n't no home like a raft , after all .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 16]: Other places do seem so cramped up and smothery , but a raft do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 12]: You feel mighty free and easy and comfortable on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 3]: CHAPTER XIX .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 28]: TWO or three days and nights went by ; I reckon I might say they swum by , they slid along so quiet and smooth and lovely .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 10]: Here is the way we put in the time .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 66]: It was a monstrous big river down there -- sometimes a mile and a half wide ; we run nights , and laid up and hid daytimes ; soon as night was most gone we stopped navigating and tied up -- nearly always in the dead water under a towhead ; and then cut young cottonwoods and willows , and hid the raft with them .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 7]: Then we set out the lines .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 42]: Next we slid into the river and had a swim , so as to freshen up and cool off ; then we set down on the sandy bottom where the water was about knee deep , and watched the daylight come .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 24]: Not a sound anywheres -- perfectly still -- just like the whole world was asleep , only sometimes the bullfrogs a-cluttering , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 313]: The first thing to see , looking away over the water , was a kind of dull line -- that was the woods on t ` other side ; you could n't make nothing else out ; then a pale place in the sky ; then more paleness spreading around ; then the river softened up away off , and war n't black any more , but gray ; you could see little dark spots drifting along ever so far away -- trading scows , and such things ; and long black streaks -- rafts ; sometimes you could hear a sweep screaking ; or jumbled up voices , it was so still , and sounds come so far ; and by and by you could see a streak on the water which you know by the look of the streak that there 's a snag there in a swift current which breaks on it and makes that streak look that way ; and you see the mist curl up off of the water , and the east reddens up , and the river , and you make out a log-cabin in the edge of the woods , away on the bank on t ` other side of the river , being a woodyard , likely , and piled by them cheats so you can throw a dog through it anywheres ; then the nice breeze springs up , and comes fanning you from over there , so cool and fresh and sweet to smell on account of the woods and the flowers ; but sometimes not that way , because they 've left dead fish laying around , gars and such , and they do get pretty rank ; and next you 've got the full day , and everything smiling in the sun , and the song-birds just going it !
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 26]: A little smoke could n't be noticed now , so we would take some fish off of the lines and cook up a hot breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 26]: And afterwards we would watch the lonesomeness of the river , and kind of lazy along , and by and by lazy off to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 67]: Wake up by and by , and look to see what done it , and maybe see a steamboat coughing along up-stream , so far off towards the other side you could n't tell nothing about her only whether she was a stern-wheel or side-wheel ; then for about an hour there would n't be nothing to hear nor nothing to see -- just solid lonesomeness .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 73]: Next you 'd see a raft sliding by , away off yonder , and maybe a galoot on it chopping , because they 're most always doing it on a raft ; you 'd see the axe flash and come down -- you do n't hear nothing ; you see that axe go up again , and by the time it 's above the man 's head then you hear the K'CHUNK !
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: -- it had took all that time to come over the water .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 16]: So we would put in the day , lazying around , listening to the stillness .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 28]: Once there was a thick fog , and the rafts and things that went by was beating tin pans so the steamboats would n't run over them .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 51]: A scow or a raft went by so close we could hear them talking and cussing and laughing -- heard them plain ; but we could n't see no sign of them ; it made you feel crawly ; it was like spirits carrying on that way in the air .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 28]: Jim said he believed it was spirits ; but I says : `` No ; spirits would n't say , ` Dern the dern fog . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 100]: Soon as it was night out we shoved ; when we got her out to about the middle we let her alone , and let her float wherever the current wanted her to ; then we lit the pipes , and dangled our legs in the water , and talked about all kinds of things -- we was always naked , day and night , whenever the mosquitoes would let us -- the new clothes Buck 's folks made for me was too good to be comfortable , and besides I did n't go much on clothes , nohow .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: Sometimes we 'd have that whole river all to ourselves for the longest time .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 67]: Yonder was the banks and the islands , across the water ; and maybe a spark -- which was a candle in a cabin window ; and sometimes on the water you could see a spark or two -- on a raft or a scow , you know ; and maybe you could hear a fiddle or a song coming over from one of them crafts .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 9]: It 's lovely to live on a raft .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 38]: We had the sky up there , all speckled with stars , and we used to lay on our backs and look up at them , and discuss about whether they was made or only just happened .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 26]: Jim he allowed they was made , but I allowed they happened ; I judged it would have took too long to MAKE so many .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 45]: Jim said the moon could a LAID them ; well , that looked kind of reasonable , so I did n't say nothing against it , because I 've seen a frog lay most as many , so of course it could be done .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 17]: We used to watch the stars that fell , too , and see them streak down .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 14]: Jim allowed they 'd got spoiled and was hove out of the nest .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 120]: Once or twice of a night we would see a steamboat slipping along in the dark , and now and then she would belch a whole world of sparks up out of her chimbleys , and they would rain down in the river and look awful pretty ; then she would turn a corner and her lights would wink out and her powwow shut off and leave the river still again ; and by and by her waves would get to us , a long time after she was gone , and joggle the raft a bit , and after that you would n't hear nothing for you could n't tell how long , except maybe frogs or something .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 30]: After midnight the people on shore went to bed , and then for two or three hours the shores was black -- no more sparks in the cabin windows .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 30]: These sparks was our clock -- the first one that showed again meant morning was coming , so we hunted a place to hide and tie up right away .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 48]: One morning about daybreak I found a canoe and crossed over a chute to the main shore -- it was only two hundred yards -- and paddled about a mile up a crick amongst the cypress woods , to see if I could n't get some berries .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 35]: Just as I was passing a place where a kind of a cowpath crossed the crick , here comes a couple of men tearing up the path as tight as they could foot it .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 23]: I thought I was a goner , for whenever anybody was after anybody I judged it was ME -- or maybe Jim .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 55]: I was about to dig out from there in a hurry , but they was pretty close to me then , and sung out and begged me to save their lives -- said they had n't been doing nothing , and was being chased for it -- said there was men and dogs a-coming .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 18]: They wanted to jump right in , but I says : `` Do n't you do it .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 53]: I do n't hear the dogs and horses yet ; you 've got time to crowd through the brush and get up the crick a little ways ; then you take to the water and wade down to me and get in -- that 'll throw the dogs off the scent . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 36]: They done it , and soon as they was aboard I lit out for our towhead , and in about five or ten minutes we heard the dogs and the men away off , shouting .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 84]: We heard them come along towards the crick , but could n't see them ; they seemed to stop and fool around a while ; then , as we got further and further away all the time , we could n't hardly hear them at all ; by the time we had left a mile of woods behind us and struck the river , everything was quiet , and we paddled over to the towhead and hid in the cottonwoods and was safe .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 20]: One of these fellows was about seventy or upwards , and had a bald head and very gray whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 38]: He had an old battered-up slouch hat on , and a greasy blue woollen shirt , and ragged old blue jeans britches stuffed into his boot-tops , and home-knit galluses -- no , he only had one .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 29]: He had an old long-tailed blue jeans coat with slick brass buttons flung over his arm , and both of them had big , fat , ratty-looking carpet-bags .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 13]: The other fellow was about thirty , and dressed about as ornery .
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 26]: After breakfast we all laid off and talked , and the first thing that come out was that these chaps did n't know one another .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 8]: `` What got you into trouble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 9]: says the baldhead to t ` other chap .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 86]: `` Well , I 'd been selling an article to take the tartar off the teeth -- and it does take it off , too , and generly the enamel along with it -- but I stayed about one night longer than I ought to , and was just in the act of sliding out when I ran across you on the trail this side of town , and you told me they were coming , and begged me to help you to get off .
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 17]: So I told you I was expecting trouble myself , and would scatter out WITH you .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 10]: That 's the whole yarn -- what 's yourn ?
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 108]: `` Well , I 'd ben a-running ' a little temperance revival thar ` bout a week , and was the pet of the women folks , big and little , for I was makin ' it mighty warm for the rummies , I TELL you , and takin ' as much as five or six dollars a night -- ten cents a head , children and niggers free -- and business a-growin ' all the time , when somehow or another a little report got around last night that I had a way of puttin ' in my time with a private jug on the sly .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 73]: A nigger rousted me out this mornin ' , and told me the people was getherin ' on the quiet with their dogs and horses , and they 'd be along pretty soon and give me ` bout half an hour 's start , and then run me down if they could ; and if they got me they 'd tar and feather me and ride me on a rail , sure .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 14]: I did n't wait for no breakfast -- I war n't hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 25]: `` Old man , '' said the young one , `` I reckon we might double-team it together ; what do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 6]: `` I ai n't undisposed .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 8]: What 's your line -- mainly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 65]: `` Jour printer by trade ; do a little in patent medicines ; theater-actor -- tragedy , you know ; take a turn to mesmerism and phrenology when there 's a chance ; teach singing-geography school for a change ; sling a lecture sometimes -- oh , I do lots of things -- most anything that comes handy , so it ai n't work .
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 6]: What 's your lay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 13]: `` I 've done considerble in the doctoring way in my time .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 43]: Layin ' on o ' hands is my best holt -- for cancer and paralysis , and sich things ; and I k 'n tell a fortune pretty good when I 've got somebody along to find out the facts for me .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 19]: Preachin 's my line , too , and workin ' camp-meetin 's , and missionaryin ' around . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 22]: Nobody never said anything for a while ; then the young man hove a sigh and says : `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 9]: `` What 're you alassin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 4]: says the bald-head .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 23]: `` To think I should have lived to be leading such a life , and be degraded down into such company . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 14]: And he begun to wipe the corner of his eye with a rag .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 15]: `` Dern your skin , ai n't the company good enough for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 9]: says the baldhead , pretty pert and uppish .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 30]: `` Yes , it IS good enough for me ; it 's as good as I deserve ; for who fetched me so low when I was so high ?
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 4]: I did myself .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 18]: I do n't blame YOU , gentlemen -- far from it ; I do n't blame anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 5]: I deserve it all .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 21]: Let the cold world do its worst ; one thing I know -- there 's a grave somewhere for me .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 32]: The world may go on just as it 's always done , and take everything from me -- loved ones , property , everything ; but it ca n't take that .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 24]: Some day I 'll lie down in it and forget it all , and my poor broken heart will be at rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 5]: He went on a-wiping .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 27]: `` Drot your pore broken heart , '' says the baldhead ; `` what are you heaving your pore broken heart at US f ` r ?
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 7]: WE hai n't done nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 9]: `` No , I know you have n't .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 8]: I ai n't blaming you , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 12]: I brought myself down -- yes , I did it myself .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 18]: It 's right I should suffer -- perfectly right -- I do n't make any moan . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 7]: `` Brought you down from whar ?
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 8]: Whar was you brought down from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 23]: `` Ah , you would not believe me ; the world never believes -- let it pass -- 't is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 14]: The secret of my birth -- '' `` The secret of your birth !
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 37]: Do you mean to say -- '' `` Gentlemen , '' says the young man , very solemn , `` I will reveal it to you , for I feel I may have confidence in you .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 8]: By rights I am a duke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 18]: Jim 's eyes bugged out when he heard that ; and I reckon mine did , too .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: Then the baldhead says : `` No !
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 7]: you ca n't mean it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 50]: My great-grandfather , eldest son of the Duke of Bridgewater , fled to this country about the end of the last century , to breathe the pure air of freedom ; married here , and died , leaving a son , his own father dying about the same time .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 20]: The second son of the late duke seized the titles and estates -- the infant real duke was ignored .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 58]: I am the lineal descendant of that infant -- I am the rightful Duke of Bridgewater ; and here am I , forlorn , torn from my high estate , hunted of men , despised by the cold world , ragged , worn , heart-broken , and degraded to the companionship of felons on a raft ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 12]: Jim pitied him ever so much , and so did I .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 56]: We tried to comfort him , but he said it war n't much use , he could n't be much comforted ; said if we was a mind to acknowledge him , that would do him more good than most anything else ; so we said we would , if he would tell us how .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 84]: He said we ought to bow when we spoke to him , and say `` Your Grace , '' or `` My Lord , '' or `` Your Lordship '' -- and he would n't mind it if we called him plain `` Bridgewater , '' which , he said , was a title anyway , and not a name ; and one of us ought to wait on him at dinner , and do any little thing for him he wanted done .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 12]: Well , that was all easy , so we done it .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 31]: All through dinner Jim stood around and waited on him , and says , `` Will yo ' Grace have some o ' dis or some o ' dat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 16]: and so on , and a body could see it was mighty pleasing to him .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 36]: But the old man got pretty silent by and by -- did n't have much to say , and did n't look pretty comfortable over all that petting that was going on around that duke .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 9]: He seemed to have something on his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 43]: So , along in the afternoon , he says : `` Looky here , Bilgewater , '' he says , `` I 'm nation sorry for you , but you ai n't the only person that 's had troubles like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 6]: `` No you ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 19]: You ai n't the only person that 's ben snaked down wrongfully out 'n a high place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 4]: `` Alas ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 19]: `` No , you ai n't the only person that 's had a secret of his birth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 10]: And , by jings , HE begins to cry .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 3]: `` Hold !
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 9]: `` Bilgewater , kin I trust you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 10]: says the old man , still sort of sobbing .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 7]: `` To the bitter death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 25]: He took the old man by the hand and squeezed it , and says , `` That secret of your being : speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 10]: `` Bilgewater , I am the late Dauphin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: You bet you , Jim and me stared this time .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: Then the duke says : `` You are what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 40]: `` Yes , my friend , it is too true -- your eyes is lookin ' at this very moment on the pore disappeared Dauphin , Looy the Seventeen , son of Looy the Sixteen and Marry Antonette . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 3]: `` You !
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 4]: At your age !
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 24]: You mean you 're the late Charlemagne ; you must be six or seven hundred years old , at the very least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 24]: `` Trouble has done it , Bilgewater , trouble has done it ; trouble has brung these gray hairs and this premature balditude .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 32]: Yes , gentlemen , you see before you , in blue jeans and misery , the wanderin ' , exiled , trampled-on , and sufferin ' rightful King of France . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 39]: Well , he cried and took on so that me and Jim did n't know hardly what to do , we was so sorry -- and so glad and proud we 'd got him with us , too .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 19]: So we set in , like we done before with the duke , and tried to comfort HIM .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 89]: But he said it war n't no use , nothing but to be dead and done with it all could do him any good ; though he said it often made him feel easier and better for a while if people treated him according to his rights , and got down on one knee to speak to him , and always called him `` Your Majesty , '' and waited on him first at meals , and did n't set down in his presence till he asked them .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 33]: So Jim and me set to majestying him , and doing this and that and t ` other for him , and standing up till he told us we might set down .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 15]: This done him heaps of good , and so he got cheerful and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 116]: But the duke kind of soured on him , and did n't look a bit satisfied with the way things was going ; still , the king acted real friendly towards him , and said the duke 's great-grandfather and all the other Dukes of Bilgewater was a good deal thought of by HIS father , and was allowed to come to the palace considerable ; but the duke stayed huffy a good while , till by and by the king says : `` Like as not we got to be together a blamed long time on this h-yer raft , Bilgewater , and so what 's the use o ' your bein ' sour ?
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 7]: It 'll only make things oncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 32]: It ai n't my fault I war n't born a duke , it ai n't your fault you war n't born a king -- so what 's the use to worry ?
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 20]: Make the best o ' things the way you find 'em , says I -- that 's my motto .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 36]: This ai n't no bad thing that we 've struck here -- plenty grub and an easy life -- come , give us your hand , duke , and le 's all be friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 16]: The duke done it , and Jim and me was pretty glad to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 59]: It took away all the uncomfortableness and we felt mighty good over it , because it would a been a miserable business to have any unfriendliness on the raft ; for what you want , above all things , on a raft , is for everybody to be satisfied , and feel right and kind towards the others .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 30]: It did n't take me long to make up my mind that these liars war n't no kings nor dukes at all , but just low-down humbugs and frauds .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 37]: But I never said nothing , never let on ; kept it to myself ; it 's the best way ; then you do n't have no quarrels , and do n't get into no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 45]: If they wanted us to call them kings and dukes , I had n't no objections , ` long as it would keep peace in the family ; and it war n't no use to tell Jim , so I did n't tell him .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 33]: If I never learnt nothing else out of pap , I learnt that the best way to get along with his kind of people is to let them have their own way .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 3]: CHAPTER XX .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 36]: THEY asked us considerable many questions ; wanted to know what we covered up the raft that way for , and laid by in the daytime instead of running -- was Jim a runaway nigger ?
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 7]: Says I : `` Goodness sakes !
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 8]: would a runaway nigger run SOUTH ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: No , they allowed he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 44]: I had to account for things some way , so I says : `` My folks was living in Pike County , in Missouri , where I was born , and they all died off but me and pa and my brother Ike .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 34]: Pa , he ` lowed he 'd break up and go down and live with Uncle Ben , who 's got a little one-horse place on the river , forty-four mile below Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 30]: Pa was pretty poor , and had some debts ; so when he 'd squared up there war n't nothing left but sixteen dollars and our nigger , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 18]: That war n't enough to take us fourteen hundred mile , deck passage nor no other way .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 35]: Well , when the river rose pa had a streak of luck one day ; he ketched this piece of a raft ; so we reckoned we 'd go down to Orleans on it .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 61]: Pa 's luck did n't hold out ; a steamboat run over the forrard corner of the raft one night , and we all went overboard and dove under the wheel ; Jim and me come up all right , but pa was drunk , and Ike was only four years old , so they never come up no more .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 39]: Well , for the next day or two we had considerable trouble , because people was always coming out in skiffs and trying to take Jim away from me , saying they believed he was a runaway nigger .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 17]: We do n't run daytimes no more now ; nights they do n't bother us . ''
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 25]: The duke says : `` Leave me alone to cipher out a way so we can run in the daytime if we want to .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 17]: I 'll think the thing over -- I 'll invent a plan that 'll fix it .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 31]: We 'll let it alone for to-day , because of course we do n't want to go by that town yonder in daylight -- it might n't be healthy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 47]: Towards night it begun to darken up and look like rain ; the heat lightning was squirting around low down in the sky , and the leaves was beginning to shiver -- it was going to be pretty ugly , it was easy to see that .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 20]: So the duke and the king went to overhauling our wigwam , to see what the beds was like .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 67]: My bed was a straw tick better than Jim 's , which was a corn-shuck tick ; there 's always cobs around about in a shuck tick , and they poke into you and hurt ; and when you roll over the dry shucks sound like you was rolling over in a pile of dead leaves ; it makes such a rustling that you wake up .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 19]: Well , the duke allowed he would take my bed ; but the king allowed he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 31]: He says : `` I should a reckoned the difference in rank would a sejested to you that a corn-shuck bed war n't just fitten for me to sleep on .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 10]: Your Grace 'll take the shuck bed yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 54]: Jim and me was in a sweat again for a minute , being afraid there was going to be some more trouble amongst them ; so we was pretty glad when the duke says : '' 'T is my fate to be always ground into the mire under the iron heel of oppression .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 19]: Misfortune has broken my once haughty spirit ; I yield , I submit ; 't is my fate .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 16]: I am alone in the world -- let me suffer ; can bear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 12]: We got away as soon as it was good and dark .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 30]: The king told us to stand well out towards the middle of the river , and not show a light till we got a long ways below the town .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 36]: We come in sight of the little bunch of lights by and by -- that was the town , you know -- and slid by , about a half a mile out , all right .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 65]: When we was three-quarters of a mile below we hoisted up our signal lantern ; and about ten o'clock it come on to rain and blow and thunder and lighten like everything ; so the king told us to both stay on watch till the weather got better ; then him and the duke crawled into the wigwam and turned in for the night .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 46]: It was my watch below till twelve , but I would n't a turned in anyway if I 'd had a bed , because a body do n't see such a storm as that every day in the week , not by a long sight .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 10]: My souls , how the wind did scream along !
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 48]: And every second or two there 'd come a glare that lit up the white-caps for a half a mile around , and you 'd see the islands looking dusty through the rain , and the trees thrashing around in the wind ; then comes a H-WHACK !
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 3]: -- bum !
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 2]: bum !
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 25]: bumble-umble-um-bum-bum-bum-bum -- and the thunder would go rumbling and grumbling away , and quit -- and then RIP comes another flash and another sockdolager .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 23]: The waves most washed me off the raft sometimes , but I had n't any clothes on , and did n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 38]: We did n't have no trouble about snags ; the lightning was glaring and flittering around so constant that we could see them plenty soon enough to throw her head this way or that and miss them .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 44]: I had the middle watch , you know , but I was pretty sleepy by that time , so Jim he said he would stand the first half of it for me ; he was always mighty good that way , Jim was .
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 53]: I crawled into the wigwam , but the king and the duke had their legs sprawled around so there war n't no show for me ; so I laid outside -- I did n't mind the rain , because it was warm , and the waves war n't running so high now .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 61]: About two they come up again , though , and Jim was going to call me ; but he changed his mind , because he reckoned they war n't high enough yet to do any harm ; but he was mistaken about that , for pretty soon all of a sudden along comes a regular ripper and washed me overboard .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 6]: It most killed Jim a-laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 13]: He was the easiest nigger to laugh that ever was , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 50]: I took the watch , and Jim he laid down and snored away ; and by and by the storm let up for good and all ; and the first cabin-light that showed I rousted him out , and we slid the raft into hiding quarters for the day .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 28]: The king got out an old ratty deck of cards after breakfast , and him and the duke played seven-up a while , five cents a game .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 23]: Then they got tired of it , and allowed they would `` lay out a campaign , '' as they called it .
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 23]: The duke went down into his carpet-bag , and fetched up a lot of little printed bills and read them out loud .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 56]: One bill said , `` The celebrated Dr. Armand de Montalban , of Paris , '' would `` lecture on the Science of Phrenology '' at such and such a place , on the blank day of blank , at ten cents admission , and `` furnish charts of character at twenty-five cents apiece . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 7]: The duke said that was HIM .
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 22]: In another bill he was the `` world-renowned Shakespearian tragedian , Garrick the Younger , of Drury Lane , London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 37]: In other bills he had a lot of other names and done other wonderful things , like finding water and gold with a `` divining-rod , '' `` dissipating witch spells , '' and so on .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 15]: By and by he says : `` But the histrionic muse is the darling .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 10]: Have you ever trod the boards , Royalty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 8]: `` No , '' says the king .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 21]: `` You shall , then , before you 're three days older , Fallen Grandeur , '' says the duke .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 22]: `` The first good town we come to we 'll hire a hall and do the sword fight in Richard III .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 9]: and the balcony scene in Romeo and Juliet .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 7]: How does that strike you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 41]: `` I 'm in , up to the hub , for anything that will pay , Bilgewater ; but , you see , I do n't know nothing about play-actin ' , and hai n't ever seen much of it .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 14]: I was too small when pap used to have 'em at the palace .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 9]: Do you reckon you can learn me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 4]: `` Easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 4]: `` All right .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 11]: I 'm jist a-freezn ' for something fresh , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 7]: Le 's commence right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 32]: So the duke he told him all about who Romeo was and who Juliet was , and said he was used to being Romeo , so the king could be Juliet .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 32]: `` But if Juliet 's such a young gal , duke , my peeled head and my white whiskers is goin ' to look oncommon odd on her , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 18]: `` No , do n't you worry ; these country jakes wo n't ever think of that .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 48]: Besides , you know , you 'll be in costume , and that makes all the difference in the world ; Juliet 's in a balcony , enjoying the moonlight before she goes to bed , and she 's got on her night-gown and her ruffled nightcap .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 9]: Here are the costumes for the parts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 19]: He got out two or three curtain-calico suits , which he said was meedyevil armor for Richard III .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 19]: and t ` other chap , and a long white cotton nightshirt and a ruffled nightcap to match .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 61]: The king was satisfied ; so the duke got out his book and read the parts over in the most splendid spread-eagle way , prancing around and acting at the same time , to show how it had got to be done ; then he give the book to the king and told him to get his part by heart .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 53]: There was a little one-horse town about three mile down the bend , and after dinner the duke said he had ciphered out his idea about how to run in daylight without it being dangersome for Jim ; so he allowed he would go down to the town and fix that thing .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 18]: The king allowed he would go , too , and see if he could n't strike something .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 22]: We was out of coffee , so Jim said I better go along with them in the canoe and get some .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 22]: When we got there there war n't nobody stirring ; streets empty , and perfectly dead and still , like Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 40]: We found a sick nigger sunning himself in a back yard , and he said everybody that war n't too young or too sick or too old was gone to camp-meeting , about two mile back in the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 28]: The king got the directions , and allowed he 'd go and work that camp-meeting for all it was worth , and I might go , too .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 11]: The duke said what he was after was a printing-office .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 31]: We found it ; a little bit of a concern , up over a carpenter shop -- carpenters and printers all gone to the meeting , and no doors locked .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 30]: It was a dirty , littered-up place , and had ink marks , and handbills with pictures of horses and runaway niggers on them , all over the walls .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 13]: The duke shed his coat and said he was all right now .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 11]: So me and the king lit out for the camp-meeting .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 21]: We got there in about a half an hour fairly dripping , for it was a most awful hot day .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 14]: There was as much as a thousand people there from twenty mile around .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 25]: The woods was full of teams and wagons , hitched everywheres , feeding out of the wagon-troughs and stomping to keep off the flies .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 33]: There was sheds made out of poles and roofed over with branches , where they had lemonade and gingerbread to sell , and piles of watermelons and green corn and such-like truck .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 22]: The preaching was going on under the same kinds of sheds , only they was bigger and held crowds of people .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 25]: The benches was made out of outside slabs of logs , with holes bored in the round side to drive sticks into for legs .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 7]: They did n't have no backs .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 15]: The preachers had high platforms to stand on at one end of the sheds .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 27]: The women had on sun-bonnets ; and some had linsey-woolsey frocks , some gingham ones , and a few of the young ones had on calico .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 25]: Some of the young men was barefooted , and some of the children did n't have on any clothes but just a tow-linen shirt .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 20]: Some of the old women was knitting , and some of the young folks was courting on the sly .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 14]: The first shed we come to the preacher was lining out a hymn .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 51]: He lined out two lines , everybody sung it , and it was kind of grand to hear it , there was so many of them and they done it in such a rousing way ; then he lined out two more for them to sing -- and so on .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 29]: The people woke up more and more , and sung louder and louder ; and towards the end some begun to groan , and some begun to shout .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 99]: Then the preacher begun to preach , and begun in earnest , too ; and went weaving first to one side of the platform and then the other , and then a-leaning down over the front of it , with his arms and his body going all the time , and shouting his words out with all his might ; and every now and then he would hold up his Bible and spread it open , and kind of pass it around this way and that , shouting , `` It 's the brazen serpent in the wilderness !
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 7]: Look upon it and live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 9]: And people would shout out , `` Glory !
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 4]: -- A-a-MEN ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 26]: And so he went on , and the people groaning and crying and saying amen : `` Oh , come to the mourners ' bench !
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 6]: come , black with sin !
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 4]: -LRB- AMEN ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 6]: come , sick and sore !
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 4]: -LRB- AMEN ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 8]: come , lame and halt and blind !
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 4]: -LRB- AMEN ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 10]: come , pore and needy , sunk in shame !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 4]: -LRB- A-A-MEN ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 11]: come , all that 's worn and soiled and suffering !
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 7]: -- come with a broken spirit !
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 6]: come with a contrite heart !
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 9]: come in your rags and sin and dirt !
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 24]: the waters that cleanse is free , the door of heaven stands open -- oh , enter in and be at rest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 3]: -LRB- A-A-MEN !
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 6]: GLORY , GLORY HALLELUJAH ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 4]: And so on .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 20]: You could n't make out what the preacher said any more , on account of the shouting and crying .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 64]: Folks got up everywheres in the crowd , and worked their way just by main strength to the mourners ' bench , with the tears running down their faces ; and when all the mourners had got up there to the front benches in a crowd , they sung and shouted and flung themselves down on the straw , just crazy and wild .
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 47]: Well , the first I knowed the king got a-going , and you could hear him over everybody ; and next he went a-charging up on to the platform , and the preacher he begged him to speak to the people , and he done it .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 247]: He told them he was a pirate -- been a pirate for thirty years out in the Indian Ocean -- and his crew was thinned out considerable last spring in a fight , and he was home now to take out some fresh men , and thanks to goodness he 'd been robbed last night and put ashore off of a steamboat without a cent , and he was glad of it ; it was the blessedest thing that ever happened to him , because he was a changed man now , and happy for the first time in his life ; and , poor as he was , he was going to start right off and work his way back to the Indian Ocean , and put in the rest of his life trying to turn the pirates into the true path ; for he could do it better than anybody else , being acquainted with all pirate crews in that ocean ; and though it would take him a long time to get there without money , he would get there anyway , and every time he convinced a pirate he would say to him , `` Do n't you thank me , do n't you give me no credit ; it all belongs to them dear people in Pokeville camp-meeting , natural brothers and benefactors of the race , and that dear preacher there , the truest friend a pirate ever had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 12]: And then he busted into tears , and so did everybody .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 19]: Then somebody sings out , `` Take up a collection for him , take up a collection ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 27]: Well , a half a dozen made a jump to do it , but somebody sings out , `` Let HIM pass the hat around ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 9]: Then everybody said it , the preacher too .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 165]: So the king went all through the crowd with his hat swabbing his eyes , and blessing the people and praising them and thanking them for being so good to the poor pirates away off there ; and every little while the prettiest kind of girls , with the tears running down their cheeks , would up and ask him would he let them kiss him for to remember him by ; and he always done it ; and some of them he hugged and kissed as many as five or six times -- and he was invited to stay a week ; and everybody wanted him to live in their houses , and said they 'd think it was an honor ; but he said as this was the last day of the camp-meeting he could n't do no good , and besides he was in a sweat to get to the Indian Ocean right off and go to work on the pirates .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 24]: When we got back to the raft and he come to count up he found he had collected eighty-seven dollars and seventy-five cents .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 29]: And then he had fetched away a three-gallon jug of whisky , too , that he found under a wagon when he was starting home through the woods .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 24]: The king said , take it all around , it laid over any day he 'd ever put in in the missionarying line .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 24]: He said it war n't no use talking , heathens do n't amount to shucks alongside of pirates to work a camp-meeting with .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 29]: The duke was thinking HE 'D been doing pretty well till the king come to show up , but after that he did n't think so so much .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 27]: He had set up and printed off two little jobs for farmers in that printing-office -- horse bills -- and took the money , four dollars .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 37]: And he had got in ten dollars ' worth of advertisements for the paper , which he said he would put in for four dollars if they would pay in advance -- so they done it .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 74]: The price of the paper was two dollars a year , but he took in three subscriptions for half a dollar apiece on condition of them paying him in advance ; they were going to pay in cordwood and onions as usual , but he said he had just bought the concern and knocked down the price as low as he could afford it , and was going to run it for cash .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 72]: He set up a little piece of poetry , which he made , himself , out of his own head -- three verses -- kind of sweet and saddish -- the name of it was , `` Yes , crush , cold world , this breaking heart '' -- and he left that all set up and ready to print in the paper , and did n't charge nothing for it .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 25]: Well , he took in nine dollars and a half , and said he 'd done a pretty square day 's work for it .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 22]: Then he showed us another little job he 'd printed and had n't charged for , because it was for us .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 27]: It had a picture of a runaway nigger with a bundle on a stick over his shoulder , and `` $ 200 reward '' under it .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 15]: The reading was all about Jim , and just described him to a dot .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 42]: It said he run away from St. Jacques ' plantation , forty mile below New Orleans , last winter , and likely went north , and whoever would catch him and send him back he could have the reward and expenses .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 22]: `` Now , '' says the duke , `` after to-night we can run in the daytime if we want to .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 65]: Whenever we see anybody coming we can tie Jim hand and foot with a rope , and lay him in the wigwam and show this handbill and say we captured him up the river , and were too poor to travel on a steamboat , so we got this little raft on credit from our friends and are going down to get the reward .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 25]: Handcuffs and chains would look still better on Jim , but it would n't go well with the story of us being so poor .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 5]: Too much like jewelry .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 20]: Ropes are the correct thing -- we must preserve the unities , as we say on the boards . ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 20]: We all said the duke was pretty smart , and there could n't be no trouble about running daytimes .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 48]: We judged we could make miles enough that night to get out of the reach of the powwow we reckoned the duke 's work in the printing office was going to make in that little town ; then we could boom right along if we wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 44]: We laid low and kept still , and never shoved out till nearly ten o'clock ; then we slid by , pretty wide away from the town , and did n't hoist our lantern till we was clear out of sight of it .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 38]: When Jim called me to take the watch at four in the morning , he says : `` Huck , does you reck 'n we gwyne to run acrost any mo ' kings on dis trip ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 13]: `` No , '' I says , `` I reckon not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 15]: `` Well , '' says he , `` dat 's all right , den .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 14]: I doan ' mine one er two kings , but dat 's enough .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 15]: Dis one 's powerful drunk , en de duke ain ' much better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 45]: I found Jim had been trying to get him to talk French , so he could hear what it was like ; but he said he had been in this country so long , and had so much trouble , he 'd forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXI .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 17]: IT was after sun-up now , but we went right on and did n't tie up .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 32]: The king and the duke turned out by and by looking pretty rusty ; but after they 'd jumped overboard and took a swim it chippered them up a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 57]: After breakfast the king he took a seat on the corner of the raft , and pulled off his boots and rolled up his britches , and let his legs dangle in the water , so as to be comfortable , and lit his pipe , and went to getting his Romeo and Juliet by heart .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 17]: When he had got it pretty good him and the duke begun to practice it together .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 57]: The duke had to learn him over and over again how to say every speech ; and he made him sigh , and put his hand on his heart , and after a while he said he done it pretty well ; `` only , '' he says , `` you must n't bellow out ROMEO !
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 21]: that way , like a bull -- you must say it soft and sick and languishy , so -- R-o-o-meo !
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 30]: that is the idea ; for Juliet 's a dear sweet mere child of a girl , you know , and she does n't bray like a jackass . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 51]: Well , next they got out a couple of long swords that the duke made out of oak laths , and begun to practice the sword fight -- the duke called himself Richard III. ; and the way they laid on and pranced around the raft was grand to see .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 38]: But by and by the king tripped and fell overboard , and after that they took a rest , and had a talk about all kinds of adventures they 'd had in other times along the river .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 36]: After dinner the duke says : `` Well , Capet , we 'll want to make this a first-class show , you know , so I guess we 'll add a little more to it .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 13]: We want a little something to answer encores with , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 8]: `` What 's onkores , Bilgewater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 48]: The duke told him , and then says : `` I 'll answer by doing the Highland fling or the sailor 's hornpipe ; and you -- well , let me see -- oh , I 've got it -- you can do Hamlet 's soliloquy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 6]: `` Hamlet 's which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 15]: `` Hamlet 's soliloquy , you know ; the most celebrated thing in Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 8]: Ah , it 's sublime , sublime !
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 5]: Always fetches the house .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 27]: I have n't got it in the book -- I 've only got one volume -- but I reckon I can piece it out from memory .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 24]: I 'll just walk up and down a minute , and see if I can call it back from recollection 's vaults . ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 60]: So he went to marching up and down , thinking , and frowning horrible every now and then ; then he would hoist up his eyebrows ; next he would squeeze his hand on his forehead and stagger back and kind of moan ; next he would sigh , and next he 'd let on to drop a tear .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 7]: It was beautiful to see him .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 7]: By and by he got it .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 7]: He told us to give attention .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 82]: Then he strikes a most noble attitude , with one leg shoved forwards , and his arms stretched away up , and his head tilted back , looking up at the sky ; and then he begins to rip and rave and grit his teeth ; and after that , all through his speech , he howled , and spread around , and swelled up his chest , and just knocked the spots out of any acting ever I see before .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 95]: This is the speech -- I learned it , easy enough , while he was learning it to the king : To be , or not to be ; that is the bare bodkin That makes calamity of so long life ; For who would fardels bear , till Birnam Wood do come to Dunsinane , But that the fear of something after death Murders the innocent sleep , Great nature 's second course , And makes us rather sling the arrows of outrageous fortune Than fly to others that we know not of .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 15]: There 's the respect must give us pause : Wake Duncan with thy knocking !
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 128]: I would thou couldst ; For who would bear the whips and scorns of time , The oppressor 's wrong , the proud man 's contumely , The law 's delay , and the quietus which his pangs might take , In the dead waste and middle of the night , when churchyards yawn In customary suits of solemn black , But that the undiscovered country from whose bourne no traveler returns , Breathes forth contagion on the world , And thus the native hue of resolution , like the poor cat i ' the adage , Is sicklied o'er with care , And all the clouds that lowered o'er our housetops , With this regard their currents turn awry , And lose the name of action .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 9]: 'T is a consummation devoutly to be wished .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 25]: But soft you , the fair Ophelia : Ope not thy ponderous and marble jaws , But get thee to a nunnery -- go !
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 23]: Well , the old man he liked that speech , and he mighty soon got it so he could do it first-rate .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 43]: It seemed like he was just born for it ; and when he had his hand in and was excited , it was perfectly lovely the way he would rip and tear and rair up behind when he was getting it off .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 59]: The first chance we got the duke he had some showbills printed ; and after that , for two or three days as we floated along , the raft was a most uncommon lively place , for there war n't nothing but sword fighting and rehearsing -- as the duke called it -- going on all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 85]: One morning , when we was pretty well down the State of Arkansaw , we come in sight of a little one-horse town in a big bend ; so we tied up about three-quarters of a mile above it , in the mouth of a crick which was shut in like a tunnel by the cypress trees , and all of us but Jim took the canoe and went down there to see if there was any chance in that place for our show .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 40]: We struck it mighty lucky ; there was going to be a circus there that afternoon , and the country people was already beginning to come in , in all kinds of old shackly wagons , and on horses .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 17]: The circus would leave before night , so our show would have a pretty good chance .
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 17]: The duke he hired the courthouse , and we went around and stuck up our bills .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 10]: They read like this : Shaksperean Revival ! ! !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 3]: Wonderful Attraction !
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 5]: For One Night Only !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 59]: The world renowned tragedians , David Garrick the Younger , of Drury Lane Theatre London , and Edmund Kean the elder , of the Royal Haymarket Theatre , Whitechapel , Pudding Lane , Piccadilly , London , and the Royal Continental Theatres , in their sublime Shaksperean Spectacle entitled The Balcony Scene in Romeo and Juliet ! ! !
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 23]: Romeo ... ... ... ... Mr. Garrick Juliet ... ... ... ... Mr. Kean Assisted by the whole strength of the company !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 9]: New costumes , new scenery , new appointments !
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 18]: Also : The thrilling , masterly , and blood-curdling Broad-sword conflict In Richard III . ! ! !
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 12]: Richard III ... ... ... Mr. Garrick Richmond ... ... ... .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 15]: Mr. Kean Also : -LRB- by special request -RRB- Hamlet 's Immortal Soliloquy ! !
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 5]: By The Illustrious Kean !
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 9]: Done by him 300 consecutive nights in Paris !
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 12]: For One Night Only , On account of imperative European engagements !
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 11]: Admission 25 cents ; children and servants , 10 cents .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: Then we went loafing around town .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 51]: The stores and houses was most all old , shackly , dried up frame concerns that had n't ever been painted ; they was set up three or four foot above ground on stilts , so as to be out of reach of the water when the river was over-flowed .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 48]: The houses had little gardens around them , but they did n't seem to raise hardly anything in them but jimpson-weeds , and sunflowers , and ash piles , and old curled-up boots and shoes , and pieces of bottles , and rags , and played-out tinware .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 39]: The fences was made of different kinds of boards , nailed on at different times ; and they leaned every which way , and had gates that did n't generly have but one hinge -- a leather one .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 26]: Some of the fences had been white-washed some time or another , but the duke said it was in Clumbus ' time , like enough .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 14]: There was generly hogs in the garden , and people driving them out .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 8]: All the stores was along one street .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 19]: They had white domestic awnings in front , and the country people hitched their horses to the awning-posts .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 41]: There was empty drygoods boxes under the awnings , and loafers roosting on them all day long , whittling them with their Barlow knives ; and chawing tobacco , and gaping and yawning and stretching -- a mighty ornery lot .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 54]: They generly had on yellow straw hats most as wide as an umbrella , but did n't wear no coats nor waistcoats , they called one another Bill , and Buck , and Hank , and Joe , and Andy , and talked lazy and drawly , and used considerable many cuss words .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 39]: There was as many as one loafer leaning up against every awning-post , and he most always had his hands in his britches-pockets , except when he fetched them out to lend a chaw of tobacco or scratch .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 24]: What a body was hearing amongst them all the time was : `` Gim me a chaw ' v tobacker , Hank . ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 13]: `` Cai n't ; I hai n't got but one chaw left .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 4]: Ask Bill . ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 19]: Maybe Bill he gives him a chaw ; maybe he lies and says he ai n't got none .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 23]: Some of them kinds of loafers never has a cent in the world , nor a chaw of tobacco of their own .
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 79]: They get all their chawing by borrowing ; they say to a fellow , `` I wisht you 'd len ' me a chaw , Jack , I jist this minute give Ben Thompson the last chaw I had '' -- which is a lie pretty much everytime ; it do n't fool nobody but a stranger ; but Jack ai n't no stranger , so he says : `` YOU give him a chaw , did you ?
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: So did your sister 's cat 's grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 42]: You pay me back the chaws you 've awready borry 'd off 'n me , Lafe Buckner , then I 'll loan you one or two ton of it , and wo n't charge you no back intrust , nuther . ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 14]: `` Well , I DID pay you back some of it wunst . ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 11]: `` Yes , you did -- ` bout six chaws .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 11]: You borry 'd store tobacker and paid back nigger-head . ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 17]: Store tobacco is flat black plug , but these fellows mostly chaws the natural leaf twisted .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 83]: When they borrow a chaw they do n't generly cut it off with a knife , but set the plug in between their teeth , and gnaw with their teeth and tug at the plug with their hands till they get it in two ; then sometimes the one that owns the tobacco looks mournful at it when it 's handed back , and says , sarcastic : `` Here , gim me the CHAW , and you take the PLUG . ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 43]: All the streets and lanes was just mud ; they war n't nothing else BUT mud -- mud as black as tar and nigh about a foot deep in some places , and two or three inches deep in ALL the places .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 8]: The hogs loafed and grunted around everywheres .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 64]: You 'd see a muddy sow and a litter of pigs come lazying along the street and whollop herself right down in the way , where folks had to walk around her , and she 'd stretch out and shut her eyes and wave her ears whilst the pigs was milking her , and look as happy as if she was on salary .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 14]: And pretty soon you 'd hear a loafer sing out , `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 3]: SO boy !
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 6]: sick him , Tige ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 59]: and away the sow would go , squealing most horrible , with a dog or two swinging to each ear , and three or four dozen more a-coming ; and then you would see all the loafers get up and watch the thing out of sight , and laugh at the fun and look grateful for the noise .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 13]: Then they 'd settle back again till there was a dog fight .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 54]: There could n't anything wake them up all over , and make them happy all over , like a dog fight -- unless it might be putting turpentine on a stray dog and setting fire to him , or tying a tin pan to his tail and see him run himself to death .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 37]: On the river front some of the houses was sticking out over the bank , and they was bowed and bent , and about ready to tumble in , The people had moved out of them .
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 19]: The bank was caved away under one corner of some others , and that corner was hanging over .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 28]: People lived in them yet , but it was dangersome , because sometimes a strip of land as wide as a house caves in at a time .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 31]: Sometimes a belt of land a quarter of a mile deep will start in and cave along and cave along till it all caves into the river in one summer .
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 27]: Such a town as that has to be always moving back , and back , and back , because the river 's always gnawing at it .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 28]: The nearer it got to noon that day the thicker and thicker was the wagons and horses in the streets , and more coming all the time .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 17]: Families fetched their dinners with them from the country , and eat them in the wagons .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 14]: There was considerable whisky drinking going on , and I seen three fights .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: By and by somebody sings out : `` Here comes old Boggs !
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 19]: -- in from the country for his little old monthly drunk ; here he comes , boys ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 18]: All the loafers looked glad ; I reckoned they was used to having fun out of Boggs .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 17]: One of them says : `` Wonder who he 's a-gwyne to chaw up this time .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 28]: If he 'd a-chawed up all the men he 's ben a-gwyne to chaw up in the last twenty year he 'd have considerable ruputation now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 32]: Another one says , `` I wisht old Boggs 'd threaten me , ` cuz then I 'd know I war n't gwyne to die for a thousan ' year . ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 26]: Boggs comes a-tearing along on his horse , whooping and yelling like an Injun , and singing out : `` Cler the track , thar .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 17]: I 'm on the waw-path , and the price uv coffins is a-gwyne to raise . ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 25]: He was drunk , and weaving about in his saddle ; he was over fifty year old , and had a very red face .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 69]: Everybody yelled at him and laughed at him and sassed him , and he sassed back , and said he 'd attend to them and lay them out in their regular turns , but he could n't wait now because he 'd come to town to kill old Colonel Sherburn , and his motto was , `` Meat first , and spoon vittles to top off on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 20]: He see me , and rode up and says : `` Whar 'd you come f 'm , boy ?
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 6]: You prepared to die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 5]: Then he rode on .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 29]: I was scared , but a man says : `` He do n't mean nothing ; he 's always a-carryin ' on like that when he 's drunk .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 19]: He 's the best naturedest old fool in Arkansaw -- never hurt nobody , drunk nor sober . ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 35]: Boggs rode up before the biggest store in town , and bent his head down so he could see under the curtain of the awning and yells : `` Come out here , Sherburn !
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 10]: Come out and meet the man you 've swindled .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 20]: You 're the houn ' I 'm after , and I 'm a-gwyne to have you , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 30]: And so he went on , calling Sherburn everything he could lay his tongue to , and the whole street packed with people listening and laughing and going on .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 43]: By and by a proud-looking man about fifty-five -- and he was a heap the best dressed man in that town , too -- steps out of the store , and the crowd drops back on each side to let him come .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 30]: He says to Boggs , mighty ca 'm and slow -- he says : `` I 'm tired of this , but I 'll endure it till one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 9]: Till one o'clock , mind -- no longer .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 25]: If you open your mouth against me only once after that time you ca n't travel so far but I will find you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 7]: Then he turns and goes in .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 17]: The crowd looked mighty sober ; nobody stirred , and there war n't no more laughing .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 34]: Boggs rode off blackguarding Sherburn as loud as he could yell , all down the street ; and pretty soon back he comes and stops before the store , still keeping it up .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 45]: Some men crowded around him and tried to get him to shut up , but he would n't ; they told him it would be one o'clock in about fifteen minutes , and so he MUST go home -- he must go right away .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 8]: But it did n't do no good .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 39]: He cussed away with all his might , and throwed his hat down in the mud and rode over it , and pretty soon away he went a-raging down the street again , with his gray hair a-flying .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 50]: Everybody that could get a chance at him tried their best to coax him off of his horse so they could lock him up and get him sober ; but it war n't no use -- up the street he would tear again , and give Sherburn another cussing .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 12]: By and by somebody says : `` Go for his daughter !
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 15]: -- quick , go for his daughter ; sometimes he 'll listen to her .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 10]: If anybody can persuade him , she can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 7]: So somebody started on a run .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 9]: I walked down street a ways and stopped .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 17]: In about five or ten minutes here comes Boggs again , but not on his horse .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 28]: He was a-reeling across the street towards me , bare-headed , with a friend on both sides of him a-holt of his arms and hurrying him along .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 25]: He was quiet , and looked uneasy ; and he war n't hanging back any , but was doing some of the hurrying himself .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 8]: Somebody sings out : `` Boggs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 17]: I looked over there to see who said it , and it was that Colonel Sherburn .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 36]: He was standing perfectly still in the street , and had a pistol raised in his right hand -- not aiming it , but holding it out with the barrel tilted up towards the sky .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 19]: The same second I see a young girl coming on the run , and two men with her .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 41]: Boggs and the men turned round to see who called him , and when they see the pistol the men jumped to one side , and the pistol-barrel come down slow and steady to a level -- both barrels cocked .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 19]: Boggs throws up both of his hands and says , `` O Lord , do n't shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 2]: Bang !
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 17]: goes the first shot , and he staggers back , clawing at the air -- bang !
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 24]: goes the second one , and he tumbles backwards on to the ground , heavy and solid , with his arms spread out .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 37]: That young girl screamed out and comes rushing , and down she throws herself on her father , crying , and saying , `` Oh , he 's killed him , he 's killed him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 41]: The crowd closed up around them , and shouldered and jammed one another , with their necks stretched , trying to see , and people on the inside trying to shove them back and shouting , `` Back , back !
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 9]: give him air , give him air ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 21]: Colonel Sherburn he tossed his pistol on to the ground , and turned around on his heels and walked off .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 46]: They took Boggs to a little drug store , the crowd pressing around just the same , and the whole town following , and I rushed and got a good place at the window , where I was close to him and could see in .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 45]: They laid him on the floor and put one large Bible under his head , and opened another one and spread it on his breast ; but they tore open his shirt first , and I seen where one of the bullets went in .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 43]: He made about a dozen long gasps , his breast lifting the Bible up when he drawed in his breath , and letting it down again when he breathed it out -- and after that he laid still ; he was dead .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 18]: Then they pulled his daughter away from him , screaming and crying , and took her off .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 18]: She was about sixteen , and very sweet and gentle looking , but awful pale and scared .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 98]: Well , pretty soon the whole town was there , squirming and scrouging and pushing and shoving to get at the window and have a look , but people that had the places would n't give them up , and folks behind them was saying all the time , `` Say , now , you 've looked enough , you fellows ; ` tai n't right and ` tai n't fair for you to stay thar all the time , and never give nobody a chance ; other folks has their rights as well as you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 20]: There was considerable jawing back , so I slid out , thinking maybe there was going to be trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 10]: The streets was full , and everybody was excited .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 31]: Everybody that seen the shooting was telling how it happened , and there was a big crowd packed around each one of these fellows , stretching their necks and listening .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 126]: One long , lanky man , with long hair and a big white fur stovepipe hat on the back of his head , and a crooked-handled cane , marked out the places on the ground where Boggs stood and where Sherburn stood , and the people following him around from one place to t ` other and watching everything he done , and bobbing their heads to show they understood , and stooping a little and resting their hands on their thighs to watch him mark the places on the ground with his cane ; and then he stood up straight and stiff where Sherburn had stood , frowning and having his hat-brim down over his eyes , and sung out , `` Boggs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 17]: and then fetched his cane down slow to a level , and says `` Bang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 8]: staggered backwards , says `` Bang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 10]: again , and fell down flat on his back .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 24]: The people that had seen the thing said he done it perfect ; said it was just exactly the way it all happened .
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 15]: Then as much as a dozen people got out their bottles and treated him .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 13]: Well , by and by somebody said Sherburn ought to be lynched .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 32]: In about a minute everybody was saying it ; so away they went , mad and yelling , and snatching down every clothes-line they come to to do the hanging with .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXII .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 37]: THEY swarmed up towards Sherburn 's house , a-whooping and raging like Injuns , and everything had to clear the way or get run over and tromped to mush , and it was awful to see .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 71]: Children was heeling it ahead of the mob , screaming and trying to get out of the way ; and every window along the road was full of women 's heads , and there was nigger boys in every tree , and bucks and wenches looking over every fence ; and as soon as the mob would get nearly to them they would break and skaddle back out of reach .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 17]: Lots of the women and girls was crying and taking on , scared most to death .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 28]: They swarmed up in front of Sherburn 's palings as thick as they could jam together , and you could n't hear yourself think for the noise .
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 7]: It was a little twenty-foot yard .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 9]: Some sung out `` Tear down the fence !
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 6]: tear down the fence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 32]: Then there was a racket of ripping and tearing and smashing , and down she goes , and the front wall of the crowd begins to roll in like a wave .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 39]: Just then Sherburn steps out on to the roof of his little front porch , with a double-barrel gun in his hand , and takes his stand , perfectly ca 'm and deliberate , not saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 10]: The racket stopped , and the wave sucked back .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 13]: Sherburn never said a word -- just stood there , looking down .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 8]: The stillness was awful creepy and uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 35]: Sherburn run his eye slow along the crowd ; and wherever it struck the people tried a little to out-gaze him , but they could n't ; they dropped their eyes and looked sneaky .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 33]: Then pretty soon Sherburn sort of laughed ; not the pleasant kind , but the kind that makes you feel like when you are eating bread that 's got sand in it .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 16]: Then he says , slow and scornful : `` The idea of YOU lynching anybody !
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 4]: It 's amusing .
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 14]: The idea of you thinking you had pluck enough to lynch a MAN !
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 35]: Because you 're brave enough to tar and feather poor friendless cast-out women that come along here , did that make you think you had grit enough to lay your hands on a MAN ?
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 29]: Why , a MAN 'S safe in the hands of ten thousand of your kind -- as long as it 's daytime and you 're not behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 6]: `` Do I know you ?
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 29]: I know you clear through was born and raised in the South , and I 've lived in the North ; so I know the average all around .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 7]: The average man 's a coward .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 26]: In the North he lets anybody walk over him that wants to , and goes home and prays for a humble spirit to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 25]: In the South one man all by himself , has stopped a stage full of men in the daytime , and robbed the lot .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 31]: Your newspapers call you a brave people so much that you think you are braver than any other people -- whereas you 're just AS brave , and no braver .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 8]: Why do n't your juries hang murderers ?
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 28]: Because they 're afraid the man 's friends will shoot them in the back , in the dark -- and it 's just what they WOULD do .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 28]: `` So they always acquit ; and then a MAN goes in the night , with a hundred masked cowards at his back and lynches the rascal .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 36]: Your mistake is , that you did n't bring a man with you ; that 's one mistake , and the other is that you did n't come in the dark and fetch your masks .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 32]: You brought PART of a man -- Buck Harkness , there -- and if you had n't had him to start you , you 'd a taken it out in blowing .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 8]: `` You did n't want to come .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 10]: The average man do n't like trouble and danger .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 8]: YOU do n't like trouble and danger .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 18]: But if only HALF a man -- like Buck Harkness , there -- shouts ` Lynch him !
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 4]: lynch him ! '
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 54]: you 're afraid to back down -- afraid you 'll be found out to be what you are -- COWARDS -- and so you raise a yell , and hang yourselves on to that half-a-man 's coat-tail , and come raging up here , swearing what big things you 're going to do .
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 45]: The pitifulest thing out is a mob ; that 's what an army is -- a mob ; they do n't fight with courage that 's born in them , but with courage that 's borrowed from their mass , and from their officers .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 15]: But a mob without any MAN at the head of it is BENEATH pitifulness .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 21]: Now the thing for YOU to do is to droop your tails and go home and crawl in a hole .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 36]: If any real lynching 's going to be done it will be done in the dark , Southern fashion ; and when they come they 'll bring their masks , and fetch a MAN along .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 27]: Now LEAVE -- and take your half-a-man with you '' -- tossing his gun up across his left arm and cocking it when he says this .
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 33]: The crowd washed back sudden , and then broke all apart , and went tearing off every which way , and Buck Harkness he heeled it after them , looking tolerable cheap .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 16]: I could a stayed if I wanted to , but I did n't want to .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 25]: I went to the circus and loafed around the back side till the watchman went by , and then dived in under the tent .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 43]: I had my twenty-dollar gold piece and some other money , but I reckoned I better save it , because there ai n't no telling how soon you are going to need it , away from home and amongst strangers that way .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 7]: You ca n't be too careful .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 29]: I ai n't opposed to spending money on circuses when there ai n't no other way , but there ai n't no use in WASTING it on them .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: It was a real bully circus .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 101]: It was the splendidest sight that ever was when they all come riding in , two and two , a gentleman and lady , side by side , the men just in their drawers and undershirts , and no shoes nor stirrups , and resting their hands on their thighs easy and comfortable -- there must a been twenty of them -- and every lady with a lovely complexion , and perfectly beautiful , and looking just like a gang of real sure-enough queens , and dressed in clothes that cost millions of dollars , and just littered with diamonds .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 14]: It was a powerful fine sight ; I never see anything so lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 73]: And then one by one they got up and stood , and went a-weaving around the ring so gentle and wavy and graceful , the men looking ever so tall and airy and straight , with their heads bobbing and skimming along , away up there under the tent-roof , and every lady 's rose-leafy dress flapping soft and silky around her hips , and she looking like the most loveliest parasol .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 50]: And then faster and faster they went , all of them dancing , first one foot out in the air and then the other , the horses leaning more and more , and the ringmaster going round and round the center-pole , cracking his whip and shouting `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 4]: -- hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 46]: and the clown cracking jokes behind him ; and by and by all hands dropped the reins , and every lady put her knuckles on her hips and every gentleman folded his arms , and then how the horses did lean over and hump themselves !
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 39]: And so one after the other they all skipped off into the ring , and made the sweetest bow I ever see , and then scampered out , and everybody clapped their hands and went just about wild .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 28]: Well , all through the circus they done the most astonishing things ; and all the time that clown carried on so it most killed the people .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 56]: The ringmaster could n't ever say a word to him but he was back at him quick as a wink with the funniest things a body ever said ; and how he ever COULD think of so many of them , and so sudden and so pat , was what I could n't noway understand .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 13]: Why , I could n't a thought of them in a year .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 32]: And by and by a drunk man tried to get into the ring -- said he wanted to ride ; said he could ride as well as anybody that ever was .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 24]: They argued and tried to keep him out , but he would n't listen , and the whole show come to a standstill .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 61]: Then the people begun to holler at him and make fun of him , and that made him mad , and he begun to rip and tear ; so that stirred up the people , and a lot of men begun to pile down off of the benches and swarm towards the ring , saying , `` Knock him down !
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 5]: throw him out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 9]: and one or two women begun to scream .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 51]: So , then , the ringmaster he made a little speech , and said he hoped there would n't be no disturbance , and if the man would promise he would n't make no more trouble he would let him ride if he thought he could stay on the horse .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 14]: So everybody laughed and said all right , and the man got on .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 69]: The minute he was on , the horse begun to rip and tear and jump and cavort around , with two circus men hanging on to his bridle trying to hold him , and the drunk man hanging on to his neck , and his heels flying in the air every jump , and the whole crowd of people standing up shouting and laughing till tears rolled down .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 78]: And at last , sure enough , all the circus men could do , the horse broke loose , and away he went like the very nation , round and round the ring , with that sot laying down on him and hanging to his neck , with first one leg hanging most to the ground on one side , and then t ` other one on t ` other side , and the people just crazy .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 20]: It war n't funny to me , though ; I was all of a tremble to see his danger .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 32]: But pretty soon he struggled up astraddle and grabbed the bridle , a-reeling this way and that ; and the next minute he sprung up and dropped the bridle and stood !
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 10]: and the horse a-going like a house afire too .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 36]: He just stood up there , a-sailing around as easy and comfortable as if he war n't ever drunk in his life -- and then he begun to pull off his clothes and sling them .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 20]: He shed them so thick they kind of clogged up the air , and altogether he shed seventeen suits .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 62]: And , then , there he was , slim and handsome , and dressed the gaudiest and prettiest you ever saw , and he lit into that horse with his whip and made him fairly hum -- and finally skipped off , and made his bow and danced off to the dressing-room , and everybody just a-howling with pleasure and astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 24]: Then the ringmaster he see how he had been fooled , and he WAS the sickest ringmaster you ever see , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 10]: Why , it was one of his own men !
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 20]: He had got up that joke all out of his own head , and never let on to nobody .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 30]: Well , I felt sheepish enough to be took in so , but I would n't a been in that ringmaster 's place , not for a thousand dollars .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 23]: I do n't know ; there may be bullier circuses than what that one was , but I never struck them yet .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 27]: Anyways , it was plenty good enough for ME ; and wherever I run across it , it can have all of MY custom every time .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 25]: Well , that night we had OUR show ; but there war n't only about twelve people there -- just enough to pay expenses .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 33]: And they laughed all the time , and that made the duke mad ; and everybody left , anyway , before the show was over , but one boy which was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 33]: So the duke said these Arkansaw lunkheads could n't come up to Shakespeare ; what they wanted was low comedy -- and maybe something ruther worse than low comedy , he reckoned .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 8]: He said he could size their style .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 31]: So next morning he got some big sheets of wrapping paper and some black paint , and drawed off some handbills , and stuck them up all over the village .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 9]: The bills said : AT THE COURT HOUSE !
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 5]: FOR 3 NIGHTS ONLY !
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 8]: The World-Renowned Tragedians DAVID GARRICK THE YOUNGER !
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 6]: AND EDMUND KEAN THE ELDER !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 24]: Of the London and Continental Theatres , In their Thrilling Tragedy of THE KING 'S CAMELEOPARD , OR THE ROYAL NONESUCH ! ! !
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 4]: Admission 50 cents .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 20]: Then at the bottom was the biggest line of all , which said : LADIES AND CHILDREN NOT ADMITTED .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 23]: `` There , '' says he , `` if that line do n't fetch them , I do n't know Arkansaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIII .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 42]: WELL , all day him and the king was hard at it , rigging up a stage and a curtain and a row of candles for footlights ; and that night the house was jam full of men in no time .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 142]: When the place could n't hold no more , the duke he quit tending door and went around the back way and come on to the stage and stood up before the curtain and made a little speech , and praised up this tragedy , and said it was the most thrillingest one that ever was ; and so he went on a-bragging about the tragedy , and about Edmund Kean the Elder , which was to play the main principal part in it ; and at last when he 'd got everybody 's expectations up high enough , he rolled up the curtain , and the next minute the king come a-prancing out on all fours , naked ; and he was painted all over , ring-streaked-and - striped , all sorts of colors , as splendid as a rainbow .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 22]: And -- but never mind the rest of his outfit ; it was just wild , but it was awful funny .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 50]: The people most killed themselves laughing ; and when the king got done capering and capered off behind the scenes , they roared and clapped and stormed and haw-hawed till he come back and done it over again , and after that they made him do it another time .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 17]: Well , it would make a cow laugh to see the shines that old idiot cut .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 91]: Then the duke he lets the curtain down , and bows to the people , and says the great tragedy will be performed only two nights more , on accounts of pressing London engagements , where the seats is all sold already for it in Drury Lane ; and then he makes them another bow , and says if he has succeeded in pleasing them and instructing them , he will be deeply obleeged if they will mention it to their friends and get them to come and see it .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 12]: Twenty people sings out : `` What , is it over ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 5]: Is that ALL ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 5]: The duke says yes .
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 7]: Then there was a fine time .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 8]: Everybody sings out , `` Sold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 15]: and rose up mad , and was a-going for that stage and them tragedians .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 19]: But a big , fine looking man jumps up on a bench and shouts : `` Hold on !
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 7]: Just a word , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 5]: They stopped to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 9]: `` We are sold -- mighty badly sold .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 32]: But we do n't want to be the laughing stock of this whole town , I reckon , and never hear the last of this thing as long as we live .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 2]: NO .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 25]: What we want is to go out of here quiet , and talk this show up , and sell the REST of the town !
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 10]: Then we 'll all be in the same boat .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 6]: Ai n't that sensible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 7]: -LRB- `` You bet it is !
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 7]: -- the jedge is right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 5]: everybody sings out . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 13]: `` All right , then -- not a word about any sell .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 15]: Go along home , and advise everybody to come and see the tragedy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 17]: Next day you could n't hear nothing around that town but how splendid that show was .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 16]: House was jammed again that night , and we sold this crowd the same way .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 58]: When me and the king and the duke got home to the raft we all had a supper ; and by and by , about midnight , they made Jim and me back her out and float her down the middle of the river , and fetch her in and hide her about two mile below town .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 29]: The third night the house was crammed again -- and they war n't new-comers this time , but people that was at the show the other two nights .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 48]: I stood by the duke at the door , and I see that every man that went in had his pockets bulging , or something muffled up under his coat -- and I see it war n't no perfumery , neither , not by a long sight .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 43]: I smelt sickly eggs by the barrel , and rotten cabbages , and such things ; and if I know the signs of a dead cat being around , and I bet I do , there was sixty-four of them went in .
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 22]: I shoved in there for a minute , but it was too various for me ; I could n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 85]: Well , when the place could n't hold no more people the duke he give a fellow a quarter and told him to tend door for him a minute , and then he started around for the stage door , I after him ; but the minute we turned the corner and was in the dark he says : `` Walk fast now till you get away from the houses , and then shin for the raft like the dickens was after you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 10]: I done it , and he done the same .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 40]: We struck the raft at the same time , and in less than two seconds we was gliding down stream , all dark and still , and edging towards the middle of the river , nobody saying a word .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 52]: I reckoned the poor king was in for a gaudy time of it with the audience , but nothing of the sort ; pretty soon he crawls out from under the wigwam , and says : `` Well , how 'd the old thing pan out this time , duke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 8]: He had n't been up-town at all .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 15]: We never showed a light till we was about ten mile below the village .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 29]: Then we lit up and had a supper , and the king and the duke fairly laughed their bones loose over the way they 'd served them people .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 9]: The duke says : `` Greenhorns , flatheads !
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 39]: I knew the first house would keep mum and let the rest of the town get roped in ; and I knew they 'd lay for us the third night , and consider it was THEIR turn now .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 22]: Well , it IS their turn , and I 'd give something to know how much they 'd take for it .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 14]: I WOULD just like to know how they 're putting in their opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 18]: They can turn it into a picnic if they want to -- they brought plenty provisions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 14]: Them rapscallions took in four hundred and sixty-five dollars in that three nights .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 13]: I never see money hauled in by the wagon-load like that before .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 32]: By and by , when they was asleep and snoring , Jim says : `` Do n't it s ` prise you de way dem kings carries on , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 13]: `` No , '' I says , `` it do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 9]: `` Why do n't it , Huck ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 14]: `` Well , it do n't , because it 's in the breed .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 35]: I reckon they 're all alike , '' `` But , Huck , dese kings o ' ourn is reglar rapscallions ; dat 's jist what dey is ; dey 's reglar rapscallions . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 25]: `` Well , that 's what I 'm a-saying ; all kings is mostly rapscallions , as fur as I can make out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 6]: `` Is dat so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 11]: `` You read about them once -- you 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 15]: Look at Henry the Eight ; this 'n 's a Sunday-school Superintendent to HIM .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 48]: And look at Charles Second , and Louis Fourteen , and Louis Fifteen , and James Second , and Edward Second , and Richard Third , and forty more ; besides all them Saxon heptarchies that used to rip around so in old times and raise Cain .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 16]: My , you ought to seen old Henry the Eight when he was in bloom .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 5]: He WAS a blossom .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 18]: He used to marry a new wife every day , and chop off her head next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 16]: And he would do it just as indifferent as if he was ordering up eggs .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 10]: ` Fetch up Nell Gwynn , ' he says .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 5]: They fetch her up .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 10]: Next morning , ` Chop off her head ! '
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 6]: And they chop it off .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 31]: ` Fetch up Jane Shore , ' he says ; and up she comes , Next morning , ` Chop off her head ' -- and they chop it off .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 7]: ` Ring up Fair Rosamun . '
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 6]: Fair Rosamun answers the bell .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 10]: Next morning , ` Chop off her head . '
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 57]: And he made every one of them tell him a tale every night ; and he kept that up till he had hogged a thousand and one tales that way , and then he put them all in a book , and called it Domesday Book -- which was a good name and stated the case .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 30]: You do n't know kings , Jim , but I know them ; and this old rip of ourn is one of the cleanest I 've struck in history .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 18]: Well , Henry he takes a notion he wants to get up some trouble with this country .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 10]: How does he go at it -- give notice ?
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 7]: -- give the country a show ?
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 29]: All of a sudden he heaves all the tea in Boston Harbor overboard , and whacks out a declaration of independence , and dares them to come on .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 12]: That was HIS style -- he never give anybody a chance .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 12]: He had suspicions of his father , the Duke of Wellington .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 7]: Well , what did he do ?
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 6]: Ask him to show up ?
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 14]: No -- drownded him in a butt of mamsey , like a cat .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 15]: S'pose people left money laying around where he was -- what did he do ?
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 4]: He collared it .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 31]: S'pose he contracted to do a thing , and you paid him , and did n't set down there and see that he done it -- what did he do ?
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 7]: He always done the other thing .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 9]: S'pose he opened his mouth -- what then ?
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 17]: If he did n't shut it up powerful quick he 'd lose a lie every time .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 36]: That 's the kind of a bug Henry was ; and if we 'd a had him along ` stead of our kings he 'd a fooled that town a heap worse than ourn done .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 36]: I do n't say that ourn is lambs , because they ai n't , when you come right down to the cold facts ; but they ai n't nothing to THAT old ram , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 16]: All I say is , kings is kings , and you got to make allowances .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 12]: Take them all around , they 're a mighty ornery lot .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 9]: It 's the way they 're raised . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 14]: `` But dis one do SMELL so like de nation , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 9]: `` Well , they all do , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 18]: We ca n't help the way a king smells ; history do n't tell no way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 16]: `` Now de duke , he 's a tolerble likely man in some ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 8]: `` Yes , a duke 's different .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 5]: But not very different .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 11]: This one 's a middling hard lot for a duke .
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 18]: When he 's drunk there ai n't no near-sighted man could tell him from a king . ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 18]: `` Well , anyways , I doan ' hanker for no mo ' un um , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 9]: Dese is all I kin stan ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 12]: `` It 's the way I feel , too , Jim .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 22]: But we 've got them on our hands , and we got to remember what they are , and make allowances .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 16]: Sometimes I wish we could hear of a country that 's out of kings . ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 15]: What was the use to tell Jim these war n't real kings and dukes ?
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 29]: It would n't a done no good ; and , besides , it was just as I said : you could n't tell them from the real kind .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 17]: I went to sleep , and Jim did n't call me when it was my turn .
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 5]: He often done that .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 25]: When I waked up just at daybreak he was sitting there with his head down betwixt his knees , moaning and mourning to himself .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 9]: I did n't take notice nor let on .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 7]: I knowed what it was about .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 56]: He was thinking about his wife and his children , away up yonder , and he was low and homesick ; because he had n't ever been away from home before in his life ; and I do believe he cared just as much for his people as white folks does for their ` n .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 13]: It do n't seem natural , but I reckon it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 27]: He was often moaning and mourning that way nights , when he judged I was asleep , and saying , `` Po ' little ` Lizabeth !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 5]: po ' little Johnny !
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 25]: it 's mighty hard ; I spec ' I ai n't ever gwyne to see you no mo ' , no mo ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 10]: He was a mighty good nigger , Jim was .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 71]: But this time I somehow got to talking to him about his wife and young ones ; and by and by he says : `` What makes me feel so bad dis time ` uz bekase I hear sumpn over yonder on de bank like a whack , er a slam , while ago , en it mine me er de time I treat my little ` Lizabeth so ornery .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 61]: She war n't on ' y ` bout fo ' year ole , en she tuck de sk ` yarlet fever , en had a powful rough spell ; but she got well , en one day she was a-stannin ' aroun ' , en I says to her , I says : '' ` Shet de do ' . '

Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 13]: `` She jis stood de same way , kiner smilin ' up .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 5]: I was a-bilin ' !
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 13]: I says : '' ' I lay I MAKE you mine ! '
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 19]: `` En wid dat I fetch ' her a slap side de head dat sont her a-sprawlin ' .

Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 26]: Oh , she was plumb deef en dumb , Huck , plumb deef en dumb -- en I 'd ben a-treat 'n her so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIV .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 48]: NEXT day , towards night , we laid up under a little willow towhead out in the middle , where there was a village on each side of the river , and the duke and the king begun to lay out a plan for working them towns .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 44]: Jim he spoke to the duke , and said he hoped it would n't take but a few hours , because it got mighty heavy and tiresome to him when he had to lay all day in the wigwam tied with the rope .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 43]: You see , when we left him all alone we had to tie him , because if anybody happened on to him all by himself and not tied it would n't look much like he was a runaway nigger , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 29]: So the duke said it WAS kind of hard to have to lay roped all day , and he 'd cipher out some way to get around it .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 15]: He was uncommon bright , the duke was , and he soon struck it .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 63]: He dressed Jim up in King Lear 's outfit -- it was a long curtain-calico gown , and a white horse-hair wig and whiskers ; and then he took his theater paint and painted Jim 's face and hands and ears and neck all over a dead , dull , solid blue , like a man that 's been drownded nine days .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 13]: Blamed if he war n't the horriblest looking outrage I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 26]: Then the duke took and wrote out a sign on a shingle so : Sick Arab -- but harmless when not out of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 24]: And he nailed that shingle to a lath , and stood the lath up four or five foot in front of the wigwam .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 4]: Jim was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 28]: He said it was a sight better than lying tied a couple of years every day , and trembling all over every time there was a sound .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 56]: The duke told him to make himself free and easy , and if anybody ever come meddling around , he must hop out of the wigwam , and carry on a little , and fetch a howl or two like a wild beast , and he reckoned they would light out and leave him alone .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 23]: Which was sound enough judgment ; but you take the average man , and he would n't wait for him to howl .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 19]: Why , he did n't only look like he was dead , he looked considerable more than that .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 40]: These rapscallions wanted to try the Nonesuch again , because there was so much money in it , but they judged it would n't be safe , because maybe the news might a worked along down by this time .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 81]: They could n't hit no project that suited exactly ; so at last the duke said he reckoned he 'd lay off and work his brains an hour or two and see if he could n't put up something on the Arkansaw village ; and the king he allowed he would drop over to t ` other village without any plan , but just trust in Providence to lead him the profitable way -- meaning the devil , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 29]: We had all bought store clothes where we stopped last ; and now the king put his 'n on , and he told me to put mine on .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 7]: I done it , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 17]: The king 's duds was all black , and he did look real swell and starchy .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 11]: I never knowed how clothes could change a body before .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 64]: Why , before , he looked like the orneriest old rip that ever was ; but now , when he 'd take off his new white beaver and make a bow and do a smile , he looked that grand and good and pious that you 'd say he had walked right out of the ark , and maybe was old Leviticus himself .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 13]: Jim cleaned up the canoe , and I got my paddle ready .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 33]: There was a big steamboat laying at the shore away up under the point , about three mile above the town -- been there a couple of hours , taking on freight .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 31]: Says the king : `` Seein ' how I 'm dressed , I reckon maybe I better arrive down from St. Louis or Cincinnati , or some other big place .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 18]: Go for the steamboat , Huckleberry ; we 'll come down to the village on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 16]: I did n't have to be ordered twice to go and take a steamboat ride .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 25]: I fetched the shore a half a mile above the village , and then went scooting along the bluff bank in the easy water .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 41]: Pretty soon we come to a nice innocent-looking young country jake setting on a log swabbing the sweat off of his face , for it was powerful warm weather ; and he had a couple of big carpet-bags by him .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 12]: `` Run her nose in shore , '' says the king .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 4]: I done it .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 11]: `` Wher ' you bound for , young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 10]: `` For the steamboat ; going to Orleans . ''
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 9]: `` Git aboard , '' says the king .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 17]: `` Hold on a minute , my servant 'll he ' p you with them bags .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 18]: Jump out and he ' p the gentleman , Adolphus '' -- meaning me , I see .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 13]: I done so , and then we all three started on again .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 18]: The young chap was mighty thankful ; said it was tough work toting his baggage such weather .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 49]: He asked the king where he was going , and the king told him he 'd come down the river and landed at the other village this morning , and now he was going up a few mile to see an old friend on a farm up there .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 35]: The young fellow says : `` When I first see you I says to myself , ` It 's Mr. Wilks , sure , and he come mighty near getting here in time . '
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 28]: But then I says again , ` No , I reckon it ai n't him , or else he would n't be paddling up the river . '
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 9]: You AI N'T him , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 35]: `` No , my name 's Blodgett -- Elexander Blodgett -- REVEREND Elexander Blodgett , I s ` pose I must say , as I 'm one o ' the Lord 's poor servants .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 39]: But still I 'm jist as able to be sorry for Mr. Wilks for not arriving in time , all the same , if he 's missed anything by it -- which I hope he has n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 108]: `` Well , he do n't miss any property by it , because he 'll get that all right ; but he 's missed seeing his brother Peter die -- which he may n't mind , nobody can tell as to that -- but his brother would a give anything in this world to see HIM before he died ; never talked about nothing else all these three weeks ; had n't seen him since they was boys together -- and had n't ever seen his brother William at all -- that 's the deef and dumb one -- William ai n't more than thirty or thirty-five .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 27]: Peter and George were the only ones that come out here ; George was the married brother ; him and his wife both died last year .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 28]: Harvey and William 's the only ones that 's left now ; and , as I was saying , they have n't got here in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 8]: `` Did anybody send 'em word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 36]: `` Oh , yes ; a month or two ago , when Peter was first took ; because Peter said then that he sorter felt like he war n't going to get well this time .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 55]: You see , he was pretty old , and George 's g ` yirls was too young to be much company for him , except Mary Jane , the red-headed one ; and so he was kinder lonesome after George and his wife died , and did n't seem to care much to live .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 33]: He most desperately wanted to see Harvey -- and William , too , for that matter -- because he was one of them kind that ca n't bear to make a will .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 50]: He left a letter behind for Harvey , and said he 'd told in it where his money was hid , and how he wanted the rest of the property divided up so George 's g ` yirls would be all right -- for George did n't leave nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 16]: And that letter was all they could get him to put a pen to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 10]: `` Why do you reckon Harvey do n't come ?
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 7]: Wher ' does he live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 21]: `` Oh , he lives in England -- Sheffield -- preaches there -- has n't ever been in this country .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 25]: He has n't had any too much time -- and besides he might n't a got the letter at all , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 19]: `` Too bad , too bad he could n't a lived to see his brothers , poor soul .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 9]: You going to Orleans , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 13]: `` Yes , but that ai n't only a part of it .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 20]: I 'm going in a ship , next Wednesday , for Ryo Janeero , where my uncle lives . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 8]: `` It 's a pretty long journey .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 11]: But it 'll be lovely ; wisht I was a-going .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 6]: Is Mary Jane the oldest ?
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 7]: How old is the others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 32]: `` Mary Jane 's nineteen , Susan 's fifteen , and Joanna 's about fourteen -- that 's the one that gives herself to good works and has a hare-lip . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 4]: `` Poor things !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 11]: to be left alone in the cold world so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 9]: `` Well , they could be worse off .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 18]: Old Peter had friends , and they ai n't going to let them come to no harm .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 91]: There 's Hobson , the Babtis ' preacher ; and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , the lawyer ; and Dr. Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley , and -- well , there 's a lot of them ; but these are the ones that Peter was thickest with , and used to write about sometimes , when he wrote home ; so Harvey 'll know where to look for friends when he gets here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 18]: Well , the old man went on asking questions till he just fairly emptied that young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 61]: Blamed if he did n't inquire about everybody and everything in that blessed town , and all about the Wilkses ; and about Peter 's business -- which was a tanner ; and about George 's -- which was a carpenter ; and about Harvey 's -- which was a dissentering minister ; and so on , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 21]: Then he says : `` What did you want to walk all the way up to the steamboat for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 19]: `` Because she 's a big Orleans boat , and I was afeard she might n't stop there .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 12]: When they 're deep they wo n't stop for a hail .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 14]: A Cincinnati boat will , but this is a St. Louis one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 8]: `` Was Peter Wilks well off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , pretty well off .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 25]: He had houses and land , and it 's reckoned he left three or four thousand in cash hid up som ` ers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 9]: `` When did you say he died ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 13]: `` I did n't say , but it was last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 7]: `` Funeral to-morrow , likely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 12]: `` Yes , ` bout the middle of the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 22]: `` Well , it 's all terrible sad ; but we 've all got to go , one time or another .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 18]: So what we want to do is to be prepared ; then we 're all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , it 's the best way .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 8]: Ma used to always say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 18]: When we struck the boat she was about done loading , and pretty soon she got off .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 18]: The king never said nothing about going aboard , so I lost my ride , after all .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 46]: When the boat was gone the king made me paddle up another mile to a lonesome place , and then he got ashore and says : `` Now hustle back , right off , and fetch the duke up here , and the new carpet-bags .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 19]: And if he 's gone over to t ` other side , go over there and git him .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 9]: And tell him to git himself up regardless .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 6]: Shove along , now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 17]: I see what HE was up to ; but I never said nothing , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 43]: When I got back with the duke we hid the canoe , and then they set down on a log , and the king told him everything , just like the young fellow had said it -- every last word of it .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 29]: And all the time he was a-doing it he tried to talk like an Englishman ; and he done it pretty well , too , for a slouch .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 24]: I ca n't imitate him , and so I ai n't a-going to try to ; but he really done it pretty good .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 17]: Then he says : `` How are you on the deef and dumb , Bilgewater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 24]: The duke said , leave him alone for that ; said he had played a deef and dumb person on the histronic boards .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 8]: So then they waited for a steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 40]: About the middle of the afternoon a couple of little boats come along , but they did n't come from high enough up the river ; but at last there was a big one , and they hailed her .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 49]: She sent out her yawl , and we went aboard , and she was from Cincinnati ; and when they found we only wanted to go four or five mile they was booming mad , and gave us a cussing , and said they would n't land us .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 7]: But the king was ca 'm .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 39]: He says : `` If gentlemen kin afford to pay a dollar a mile apiece to be took on and put off in a yawl , a steamboat kin afford to carry 'em , ca n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 23]: So they softened down and said it was all right ; and when we got to the village they yawled us ashore .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 35]: About two dozen men flocked down when they see the yawl a-coming , and when the king says : `` Kin any of you gentlemen tell me wher ' Mr. Peter Wilks lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 27]: they give a glance at one another , and nodded their heads , as much as to say , `` What d' I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 36]: Then one of them says , kind of soft and gentle : `` I 'm sorry sir , but the best we can do is to tell you where he DID live yesterday evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 65]: Sudden as winking the ornery old cretur went an to smash , and fell up against the man , and put his chin on his shoulder , and cried down his back , and says : `` Alas , alas , our poor brother -- gone , and we never got to see him ; oh , it 's too , too hard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 35]: Then he turns around , blubbering , and makes a lot of idiotic signs to the duke on his hands , and blamed if he did n't drop a carpet-bag and bust out a-crying .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 17]: If they war n't the beatenest lot , them two frauds , that ever I struck .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 86]: Well , the men gathered around and sympathized with them , and said all sorts of kind things to them , and carried their carpet-bags up the hill for them , and let them lean on them and cry , and told the king all about his brother 's last moments , and the king he told it all over again on his hands to the duke , and both of them took on about that dead tanner like they 'd lost the twelve disciples .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 15]: Well , if ever I struck anything like it , I 'm a nigger .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 13]: It was enough to make a body ashamed of the human race .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXV .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 37]: THE news was all over town in two minutes , and you could see the people tearing down on the run from every which way , some of them putting on their coats as they come .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 23]: Pretty soon we was in the middle of a crowd , and the noise of the tramping was like a soldier march .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 24]: The windows and dooryards was full ; and every minute somebody would say , over a fence : `` Is it THEM ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 20]: And somebody trotting along with the gang would answer back and say : `` You bet it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 25]: When we got to the house the street in front of it was packed , and the three girls was standing in the door .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 41]: Mary Jane WAS red-headed , but that do n't make no difference , she was most awful beautiful , and her face and her eyes was all lit up like glory , she was so glad her uncles was come .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 29]: The king he spread his arms , and Mary Jane she jumped for them , and the hare-lip jumped for the duke , and there they HAD it !
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 22]: Everybody most , leastways women , cried for joy to see them meet again at last and have such good times .
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 87]: Then the king he hunched the duke private -- I see him do it -- and then he looked around and see the coffin , over in the corner on two chairs ; so then him and the duke , with a hand across each other 's shoulder , and t ` other hand to their eyes , walked slow and solemn over there , everybody dropping back to give them room , and all the talk and noise stopping , people saying `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 22]: and all the men taking their hats off and drooping their heads , so you could a heard a pin fall .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 79]: And when they got there they bent over and looked in the coffin , and took one sight , and then they bust out a-crying so you could a heard them to Orleans , most ; and then they put their arms around each other 's necks , and hung their chins over each other 's shoulders ; and then for three minutes , or maybe four , I never see two men leak the way they done .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 24]: And , mind you , everybody was doing the same ; and the place was that damp I never see anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 43]: Then one of them got on one side of the coffin , and t ` other on t ` other side , and they kneeled down and rested their foreheads on the coffin , and let on to pray all to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 105]: Well , when it come to that it worked the crowd like you never see anything like it , and everybody broke down and went to sobbing right out loud -- the poor girls , too ; and every woman , nearly , went up to the girls , without saying a word , and kissed them , solemn , on the forehead , and then put their hand on their head , and looked up towards the sky , with the tears running down , and then busted out and went off sobbing and swabbing , and give the next woman a show .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 7]: I never see anything so disgusting .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 155]: Well , by and by the king he gets up and comes forward a little , and works himself up and slobbers out a speech , all full of tears and flapdoodle about its being a sore trial for him and his poor brother to lose the diseased , and to miss seeing diseased alive after the long journey of four thousand mile , but it 's a trial that 's sweetened and sanctified to us by this dear sympathy and these holy tears , and so he thanks them out of his heart and out of his brother 's heart , because out of their mouths they ca n't , words being too weak and cold , and all that kind of rot and slush , till it was just sickening ; and then he blubbers out a pious goody-goody Amen , and turns himself loose and goes to crying fit to bust .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 46]: And the minute the words were out of his mouth somebody over in the crowd struck up the doxolojer , and everybody joined in with all their might , and it just warmed you up and made you feel as good as church letting out .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 29]: Music is a good thing ; and after all that soul-butter and hogwash I never see it freshen up things so , and sound so honest and bully .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 138]: Then the king begins to work his jaw again , and says how him and his nieces would be glad if a few of the main principal friends of the family would take supper here with them this evening , and help set up with the ashes of the diseased ; and says if his poor brother laying yonder could speak he knows who he would name , for they was names that was very dear to him , and mentioned often in his letters ; and so he will name the same , to wit , as follows , vizz. : -- Rev. Mr. Hobson , and Deacon Lot Hovey , and Mr. Ben Rucker , and Abner Shackleford , and Levi Bell , and Dr. Robinson , and their wives , and the widow Bartley .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 42]: Rev. Hobson and Dr. Robinson was down to the end of the town a-hunting together -- that is , I mean the doctor was shipping a sick man to t ` other world , and the preacher was pinting him right .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 10]: Lawyer Bell was away up to Louisville on business .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 82]: But the rest was on hand , and so they all come and shook hands with the king and thanked him and talked to him ; and then they shook hands with the duke and did n't say nothing , but just kept a-smiling and bobbing their heads like a passel of sapheads whilst he made all sorts of signs with his hands and said `` Goo-goo -- goo-goo-goo '' all the time , like a baby that ca n't talk .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 51]: So the king he blattered along , and managed to inquire about pretty much everybody and dog in town , by his name , and mentioned all sorts of little things that happened one time or another in the town , or to George 's family , or to Peter .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 38]: And he always let on that Peter wrote him the things ; but that was a lie : he got every blessed one of them out of that young flathead that we canoed up to the steamboat .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 25]: Then Mary Jane she fetched the letter her father left behind , and the king he read it out loud and cried over it .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 66]: It give the dwelling-house and three thousand dollars , gold , to the girls ; and it give the tanyard -LRB- which was doing a good business -RRB- , along with some other houses and land -LRB- worth about seven thousand -RRB- , and three thousand dollars in gold to Harvey and William , and told where the six thousand cash was hid down cellar .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 29]: So these two frauds said they 'd go and fetch it up , and have everything square and above-board ; and told me to come with a candle .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 33]: We shut the cellar door behind us , and when they found the bag they spilt it out on the floor , and it was a lovely sight , all them yaller-boys .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 11]: My , the way the king 's eyes did shine !
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 22]: He slaps the duke on the shoulder and says : `` Oh , THIS ai n't bully nor noth ` n !
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 8]: Oh , no , I reckon not !
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 14]: Why , Biljy , it beats the Nonesuch , DO N'T it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 6]: The duke allowed it did .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 61]: They pawed the yaller-boys , and sifted them through their fingers and let them jingle down on the floor ; and the king says : `` It ai n't no use talkin ' ; bein ' brothers to a rich dead man and representatives of furrin heirs that 's got left is the line for you and me , Bilge .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 9]: Thish yer comes of trust 'n to Providence .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 11]: It 's the best way , in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 16]: I 've tried 'em all , and ther ' ai n't no better way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 24]: Most everybody would a been satisfied with the pile , and took it on trust ; but no , they must count it .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 16]: So they counts it , and it comes out four hundred and fifteen dollars short .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 22]: Says the king : `` Dern him , I wonder what he done with that four hundred and fifteen dollars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 13]: They worried over that awhile , and ransacked all around for it .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 31]: Then the duke says : `` Well , he was a pretty sick man , and likely he made a mistake -- I reckon that 's the way of it .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 15]: The best way 's to let it go , and keep still about it .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 6]: We can spare it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 12]: `` Oh , shucks , yes , we can SPARE it .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 22]: I do n't k ` yer noth 'n ` bout that -- it 's the COUNT I 'm thinkin ' about .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 15]: We want to be awful square and open and above-board here , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 24]: We want to lug this h-yer money up stairs and count it before everybody -- then ther ' ai n't noth 'n suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 32]: But when the dead man says ther 's six thous 'n dollars , you know , we do n't want to -- '' `` Hold on , '' says the duke .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 21]: `` Le 's make up the deffisit , '' and he begun to haul out yaller-boys out of his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 28]: `` It 's a most amaz 'n' good idea , duke -- you HAVE got a rattlin ' clever head on you , '' says the king .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 28]: `` Blest if the old Nonesuch ai n't a heppin ' us out agin , '' and HE begun to haul out yaller-jackets and stack them up .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 16]: It most busted them , but they made up the six thousand clean and clear .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 14]: `` Say , '' says the duke , `` I got another idea .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 21]: Le 's go up stairs and count this money , and then take and GIVE IT TO THE GIRLS . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 11]: `` Good land , duke , lem me hug you !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 13]: It 's the most dazzling idea ` at ever a man struck .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 15]: You have cert ` nly got the most astonishin ' head I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 18]: Oh , this is the boss dodge , ther ' ai n't no mistake ` bout it .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 19]: Let 'em fetch along their suspicions now if they want to -- this 'll lay 'em out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 33]: When we got up-stairs everybody gethered around the table , and the king he counted it and stacked it up , three hundred dollars in a pile -- twenty elegant little piles .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 11]: Everybody looked hungry at it , and licked their chops .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 23]: Then they raked it into the bag again , and I see the king begin to swell himself up for another speech .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 28]: He says : `` Friends all , my poor brother that lays yonder has done generous by them that 's left behind in the vale of sorrers .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 24]: He has done generous by these yer poor little lambs that he loved and sheltered , and that 's left fatherless and motherless .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 33]: Yes , and we that knowed him knows that he would a done MORE generous by 'em if he had n't ben afeard o ' woundin ' his dear William and me .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 6]: Now , WOULD N'T he ?
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 13]: Ther ' ai n't no question ` bout it in MY mind .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 23]: Well , then , what kind o ' brothers would it be that 'd stand in his way at sech a time ?
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 33]: And what kind o ' uncles would it be that 'd rob -- yes , ROB -- sech poor sweet lambs as these ` at he loved so at sech a time ?
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 22]: If I know William -- and I THINK I do -- he -- well , I 'll jest ask him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 68]: He turns around and begins to make a lot of signs to the duke with his hands , and the duke he looks at him stupid and leather-headed a while ; then all of a sudden he seems to catch his meaning , and jumps for the king , goo-gooing with all his might for joy , and hugs him about fifteen times before he lets up .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 23]: Then the king says , `` I knowed it ; I reckon THAT 'll convince anybody the way HE feels about it .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 17]: Here , Mary Jane , Susan , Joanner , take the money -- take it ALL .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 15]: It 's the gift of him that lays yonder , cold but joyful . ''
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 28]: Mary Jane she went for him , Susan and the hare-lip went for the duke , and then such another hugging and kissing I never see yet .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 32]: And everybody crowded up with the tears in their eyes , and most shook the hands off of them frauds , saying all the time : `` You DEAR good souls !
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 4]: -- how LOVELY !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 6]: -- how COULD you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 78]: Well , then , pretty soon all hands got to talking about the diseased again , and how good he was , and what a loss he was , and all that ; and before long a big iron-jawed man worked himself in there from outside , and stood a-listening and looking , and not saying anything ; and nobody saying anything to him either , because the king was talking and they was all busy listening .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 28]: The king was saying -- in the middle of something he 'd started in on -- '' -- they bein ' partickler friends o ' the diseased .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 45]: That 's why they 're invited here this evenin ' ; but tomorrow we want ALL to come -- everybody ; for he respected everybody , he liked everybody , and so it 's fitten that his funeral orgies sh 'd be public . ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 75]: And so he went a-mooning on and on , liking to hear himself talk , and every little while he fetched in his funeral orgies again , till the duke he could n't stand it no more ; so he writes on a little scrap of paper , `` OBSEQUIES , you old fool , '' and folds it up , and goes to goo-gooing and reaching it over people 's heads to him .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 30]: The king he reads it and puts it in his pocket , and says : `` Poor William , afflicted as he is , his HEART 'S aluz right .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 19]: Asks me to invite everybody to come to the funeral -- wants me to make 'em all welcome .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 16]: But he need n't a worried -- it was jest what I was at . ''
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 30]: Then he weaves along again , perfectly ca 'm , and goes to dropping in his funeral orgies again every now and then , just like he done before .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 44]: And when he done it the third time he says : `` I say orgies , not because it 's the common term , because it ai n't -- obsequies bein ' the common term -- but because orgies is the right term .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 15]: Obsequies ai n't used in England no more now -- it 's gone out .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 7]: We say orgies now in England .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 15]: Orgies is better , because it means the thing you 're after more exact .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 34]: It 's a word that 's made up out 'n the Greek ORGO , outside , open , abroad ; and the Hebrew JEESUM , to plant , cover up ; hence inTER .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 15]: So , you see , funeral orgies is an open er public funeral . ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 8]: He was the WORST I ever struck .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 12]: Well , the iron-jawed man he laughed right in his face .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 4]: Everybody was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 9]: Everybody says , `` Why , DOCTOR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 17]: and Abner Shackleford says : `` Why , Robinson , hai n't you heard the news ?
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 6]: This is Harvey Wilks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 28]: The king he smiled eager , and shoved out his flapper , and says : `` Is it my poor brother 's dear good friend and physician ?
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 12]: I -- '' `` Keep your hands off of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 4]: says the doctor .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 11]: `` YOU talk like an Englishman , DO N'T you ?
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 9]: It 's the worst imitation I ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 6]: YOU Peter Wilks 's brother !
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 12]: You 're a fraud , that 's what you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 8]: Well , how they all took on !
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 69]: They crowded around the doctor and tried to quiet him down , and tried to explain to him and tell him how Harvey 'd showed in forty ways that he WAS Harvey , and knowed everybody by name , and the names of the very dogs , and begged and BEGGED him not to hurt Harvey 's feelings and the poor girl 's feelings , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 41]: But it war n't no use ; he stormed right along , and said any man that pretended to be an Englishman and could n't imitate the lingo no better than what he did was a fraud and a liar .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 24]: The poor girls was hanging to the king and crying ; and all of a sudden the doctor ups and turns on THEM .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 74]: He says : `` I was your father 's friend , and I 'm your friend ; and I warn you as a friend , and an honest one that wants to protect you and keep you out of harm and trouble , to turn your backs on that scoundrel and have nothing to do with him , the ignorant tramp , with his idiotic Greek and Hebrew , as he calls it .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 51]: He is the thinnest kind of an impostor -- has come here with a lot of empty names and facts which he picked up somewheres , and you take them for PROOFS , and are helped to fool yourselves by these foolish friends here , who ought to know better .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 19]: Mary Jane Wilks , you know me for your friend , and for your unselfish friend , too .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 18]: Now listen to me ; turn this pitiful rascal out -- I BEG you to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 4]: Will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 14]: Mary Jane straightened herself up , and my , but she was handsome !
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 10]: She says : `` HERE is my answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 50]: She hove up the bag of money and put it in the king 's hands , and says , `` Take this six thousand dollars , and invest for me and my sisters any way you want to , and do n't give us no receipt for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 24]: Then she put her arm around the king on one side , and Susan and the hare-lip done the same on the other .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 25]: Everybody clapped their hands and stomped on the floor like a perfect storm , whilst the king held up his head and smiled proud .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 16]: The doctor says : `` All right ; I wash MY hands of the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 25]: But I warn you all that a time 's coming when you 're going to feel sick whenever you think of this day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 5]: And away he went .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 44]: `` All right , doctor , '' says the king , kinder mocking him ; `` we 'll try and get 'em to send for you ; '' which made them all laugh , and they said it was a prime good hit .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVI .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 84]: WELL , when they was all gone the king he asks Mary Jane how they was off for spare rooms , and she said she had one spare room , which would do for Uncle William , and she 'd give her own room to Uncle Harvey , which was a little bigger , and she would turn into the room with her sisters and sleep on a cot ; and up garret was a little cubby , with a pallet in it .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 14]: The king said the cubby would do for his valley -- meaning me .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 20]: So Mary Jane took us up , and she showed them their rooms , which was plain but nice .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 34]: She said she 'd have her frocks and a lot of other traps took out of her room if they was in Uncle Harvey 's way , but he said they war n't .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 25]: The frocks was hung along the wall , and before them was a curtain made out of calico that hung down to the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 34]: There was an old hair trunk in one corner , and a guitar-box in another , and all sorts of little knickknacks and jimcracks around , like girls brisken up a room with .
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 23]: The king said it was all the more homely and more pleasanter for these fixings , and so do n't disturb them .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 19]: The duke 's room was pretty small , but plenty good enough , and so was my cubby .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 41]: That night they had a big supper , and all them men and women was there , and I stood behind the king and the duke 's chairs and waited on them , and the niggers waited on the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 86]: Mary Jane she set at the head of the table , with Susan alongside of her , and said how bad the biscuits was , and how mean the preserves was , and how ornery and tough the fried chickens was -- and all that kind of rot , the way women always do for to force out compliments ; and the people all knowed everything was tiptop , and said so -- said `` How DO you get biscuits to brown so nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 19]: and `` Where , for the land 's sake , DID you get these amaz 'n pickles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 21]: and all that kind of humbug talky-talk , just the way people always does at a supper , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 32]: And when it was all done me and the hare-lip had supper in the kitchen off of the leavings , whilst the others was helping the niggers clean up the things .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 25]: The hare-lip she got to pumping me about England , and blest if I did n't think the ice was getting mighty thin sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 12]: She says : `` Did you ever see the king ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 3]: William Fourth ?
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 14]: Well , I bet I have -- he goes to our church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 14]: I knowed he was dead years ago , but I never let on .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 19]: So when I says he goes to our church , she says : `` What -- regular ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 5]: `` Yes -- regular .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 17]: His pew 's right over opposite ourn -- on t ` other side the pulpit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 9]: `` I thought he lived in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 6]: `` Well , he does .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 6]: Where WOULD he live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 10]: `` But I thought YOU lived in Sheffield ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 8]: I see I was up a stump .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 26]: I had to let on to get choked with a chicken bone , so as to get time to think how to get down again .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 19]: Then I says : `` I mean he goes to our church regular when he 's in Sheffield .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 19]: That 's only in the summer time , when he comes there to take the sea baths . ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 15]: `` Why , how you talk -- Sheffield ai n't on the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 9]: `` Well , who said it was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 7]: `` Why , you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 7]: `` I DID N'T nuther . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 5]: `` You did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 6]: `` I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 5]: `` You did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 10]: `` I never said nothing of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 11]: `` Well , what DID you say , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 17]: `` Said he come to take the sea BATHS -- that 's what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 23]: `` Well , then , how 's he going to take the sea baths if it ai n't on the sea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 17]: `` Looky here , '' I says ; `` did you ever see any Congress-water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 15]: `` Well , did you have to go to Congress to get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 6]: `` Why , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 20]: `` Well , neither does William Fourth have to go to the sea to get a sea bath . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 10]: `` How does he get it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 14]: `` Gets it the way people down here gets Congress-water -- in barrels .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 18]: There in the palace at Sheffield they 've got furnaces , and he wants his water hot .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 15]: They ca n't bile that amount of water away off there at the sea .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 10]: They have n't got no conveniences for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 8]: `` Oh , I see , now .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 14]: You might a said that in the first place and saved time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 22]: When she said that I see I was out of the woods again , and so I was comfortable and glad .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 15]: Next , she says : `` Do you go to church , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 6]: `` Yes -- regular . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 7]: `` Where do you set ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 8]: `` Why , in our pew . ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 5]: `` WHOSE pew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 11]: `` Why , OURN -- your Uncle Harvey 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 5]: `` His ` n ?
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 9]: What does HE want with a pew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 7]: `` Wants it to set in .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 10]: What did you RECKON he wanted with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 13]: `` Why , I thought he 'd be in the pulpit . ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 10]: Rot him , I forgot he was a preacher .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 20]: I see I was up a stump again , so I played another chicken bone and got another think .
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 22]: Then I says : `` Blame it , do you suppose there ai n't but one preacher to a church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 11]: `` Why , what do they want with more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 7]: -- to preach before a king ?
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 10]: I never did see such a girl as you .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 10]: They do n't have no less than seventeen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 3]: `` Seventeen !
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 3]: My land !
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 21]: Why , I would n't set out such a string as that , not if I NEVER got to glory .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 8]: It must take 'em a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: `` Shucks , they do n't ALL of 'em preach the same day -- only ONE of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 14]: `` Well , then , what does the rest of 'em do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 6]: `` Oh , nothing much .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 13]: Loll around , pass the plate -- and one thing or another .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 9]: But mainly they do n't do nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 11]: `` Well , then , what are they FOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 8]: `` Why , they 're for STYLE .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 7]: Do n't you know nothing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 15]: `` Well , I do n't WANT to know no such foolishness as that .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 7]: How is servants treated in England ?
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: Do they treat 'em better 'n we treat our niggers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 3]: `` NO !
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 7]: A servant ai n't nobody there .
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 8]: They treat them worse than dogs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 26]: `` Do n't they give 'em holidays , the way we do , Christmas and New Year 's week , and Fourth of July ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 6]: `` Oh , just listen !
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 14]: A body could tell YOU hai n't ever been to England by that .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 39]: Why , Hare-l -- why , Joanna , they never see a holiday from year 's end to year 's end ; never go to the circus , nor theater , nor nigger shows , nor nowheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 5]: `` Nor church ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 5]: `` Nor church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 9]: `` But YOU always went to church . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 8]: Well , I was gone up again .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 10]: I forgot I was the old man 's servant .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 48]: But next minute I whirled in on a kind of an explanation how a valley was different from a common servant and HAD to go to church whether he wanted to or not , and set with the family , on account of its being the law .
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 21]: But I did n't do it pretty good , and when I got done I see she war n't satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 21]: She says : `` Honest injun , now , hai n't you been telling me a lot of lies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 15]: `` Honest injun , '' says I. `` None of it at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 7]: `` None of it at all .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 21]: Not a lie in it , '' says I. `` Lay your hand on this book and say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 21]: I see it war n't nothing but a dictionary , so I laid my hand on it and said it .
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 37]: So then she looked a little better satisfied , and says : `` Well , then , I 'll believe some of it ; but I hope to gracious if I 'll believe the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 12]: `` What is it you wo n't believe , Joe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 11]: says Mary Jane , stepping in with Susan behind her .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 26]: `` It ai n't right nor kind for you to talk so to him , and him a stranger and so far from his people .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 10]: How would you like to be treated so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 20]: `` That 's always your way , Maim -- always sailing in to help somebody before they 're hurt .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 8]: I hai n't done nothing to him .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 30]: He 's told some stretchers , I reckon , and I said I would n't swallow it all ; and that 's every bit and grain I DID say .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 16]: I reckon he can stand a little thing like that , ca n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 36]: `` I do n't care whether 't was little or whether 't was big ; he 's here in our house and a stranger , and it was n't good of you to say it .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 33]: If you was in his place it would make you feel ashamed ; and so you ought n't to say a thing to another person that will make THEM feel ashamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 26]: `` Why , Maim , he said -- '' `` It do n't make no difference what he SAID -- that ai n't the thing .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 33]: The thing is for you to treat him KIND , and not be saying things to make him remember he ai n't in his own country and amongst his own folks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 22]: I says to myself , THIS is a girl that I 'm letting that old reptle rob her of her money !
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 22]: Then Susan SHE waltzed in ; and if you 'll believe me , she did give Hare-lip hark from the tomb !
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 21]: Says I to myself , and this is ANOTHER one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 37]: Then Mary Jane she took another inning , and went in sweet and lovely again -- which was her way ; but when she got done there war n't hardly anything left o ' poor Hare-lip .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 4]: So she hollered .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 20]: `` All right , then , '' says the other girls ; `` you just ask his pardon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 12]: She done it , too ; and she done it beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 29]: She done it so beautiful it was good to hear ; and I wished I could tell her a thousand lies , so she could do it again .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 20]: I says to myself , this is ANOTHER one that I 'm letting him rob her of her money .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 24]: And when she got through they all jest laid theirselves out to make me feel at home and know I was amongst friends .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 31]: I felt so ornery and low down and mean that I says to myself , my mind 's made up ; I 'll hive that money for them or bust .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 18]: So then I lit out -- for bed , I said , meaning some time or another .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 13]: When I got by myself I went to thinking the thing over .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 20]: I says to myself , shall I go to that doctor , private , and blow on these frauds ?
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 7]: No -- that wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 20]: He might tell who told him ; then the king and the duke would make it warm for me .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 11]: Shall I go , private , and tell Mary Jane ?
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 8]: No -- I das n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 28]: Her face would give them a hint , sure ; they 've got the money , and they 'd slide right out and get away with it .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 24]: If she was to fetch in help I 'd get mixed up in the business before it was done with , I judge .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 11]: No ; there ai n't no good way but one .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 27]: I got to steal that money , somehow ; and I got to steal it some way that they wo n't suspicion that I done it .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 39]: They 've got a good thing here , and they ai n't a-going to leave till they 've played this family and this town for all they 're worth , so I 'll find a chance time enough .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 35]: I 'll steal it and hide it ; and by and by , when I 'm away down the river , I 'll write a letter and tell Mary Jane where it 's hid .
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 36]: But I better hive it tonight if I can , because the doctor maybe has n't let up as much as he lets on he has ; he might scare them out of here yet .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 13]: So , thinks I , I 'll go and search them rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 63]: Upstairs the hall was dark , but I found the duke 's room , and started to paw around it with my hands ; but I recollected it would n't be much like the king to let anybody else take care of that money but his own self ; so then I went to his room and begun to paw around there .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 22]: But I see I could n't do nothing without a candle , and I das n't light one , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 18]: So I judged I 'd got to do the other thing -- lay for them and eavesdrop .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 65]: About that time I hears their footsteps coming , and was going to skip under the bed ; I reached for it , but it was n't where I thought it would be ; but I touched the curtain that hid Mary Jane 's frocks , so I jumped in behind that and snuggled in amongst the gowns , and stood there perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 25]: They come in and shut the door ; and the first thing the duke done was to get down and look under the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 15]: Then I was glad I had n't found the bed when I wanted it .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 24]: And yet , you know , it 's kind of natural to hide under the bed when you are up to anything private .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 17]: They sets down then , and the king says : `` Well , what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 37]: And cut it middlin ' short , because it 's better for us to be down there a-whoopin ' up the mournin ' than up here givin ' 'em a chance to talk us over . ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 9]: `` Well , this is it , Capet .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 10]: I ai n't easy ; I ai n't comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 7]: That doctor lays on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: I wanted to know your plans .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 16]: I 've got a notion , and I think it 's a sound one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: `` What is it , duke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 26]: `` That we better glide out of this before three in the morning , and clip it down the river with what we 've got .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 36]: Specially , seeing we got it so easy -- GIVEN back to us , flung at our heads , as you may say , when of course we allowed to have to steal it back .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 10]: I 'm for knocking off and lighting out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 7]: That made me feel pretty bad .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 34]: About an hour or two ago it would a been a little different , but now it made me feel bad and disappointed , The king rips out and says : `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 11]: And not sell out the rest o ' the property ?
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 31]: March off like a passel of fools and leave eight or nine thous 'n' dollars ' worth o ' property layin ' around jest sufferin ' to be scooped in ?
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 11]: -- and all good , salable stuff , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 37]: The duke he grumbled ; said the bag of gold was enough , and he did n't want to go no deeper -- did n't want to rob a lot of orphans of EVERYTHING they had .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 8]: `` Why , how you talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 4]: says the king .
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 16]: `` We sha 'n' t rob 'em of nothing at all but jest this money .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 55]: The people that BUYS the property is the suff ` rers ; because as soon 's it 's found out ` at we did n't own it -- which wo n't be long after we 've slid -- the sale wo n't be valid , and it 'll all go back to the estate .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 32]: These yer orphans 'll git their house back agin , and that 's enough for THEM ; they 're young and spry , and k 'n easy earn a livin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 7]: THEY ai n't a-goin to suffer .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 22]: Why , jest think -- there 's thous 'n' s and thous 'n' s that ai n't nigh so well off .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 14]: Bless you , THEY ai n't got noth 'n' to complain of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 39]: Well , the king he talked him blind ; so at last he give in , and said all right , but said he believed it was blamed foolishness to stay , and that doctor hanging over them .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 10]: But the king says : `` Cuss the doctor !
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 9]: What do we k ` yer for HIM ?
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 13]: Hai n't we got all the fools in town on our side ?
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 13]: And ai n't that a big enough majority in any town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 10]: So they got ready to go down stairs again .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 19]: The duke says : `` I do n't think we put that money in a good place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 5]: That cheered me up .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 20]: I 'd begun to think I war n't going to get a hint of no kind to help me .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 8]: The king says : `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 55]: `` Because Mary Jane 'll be in mourning from this out ; and first you know the nigger that does up the rooms will get an order to box these duds up and put 'em away ; and do you reckon a nigger can run across money and not borrow some of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 30]: `` Your head 's level agin , duke , '' says the king ; and he comes a-fumbling under the curtain two or three foot from where I was .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 45]: I stuck tight to the wall and kept mighty still , though quivery ; and I wondered what them fellows would say to me if they catched me ; and I tried to think what I 'd better do if they did catch me .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 27]: But the king he got the bag before I could think more than about a half a thought , and he never suspicioned I was around .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 74]: They took and shoved the bag through a rip in the straw tick that was under the feather-bed , and crammed it in a foot or two amongst the straw and said it was all right now , because a nigger only makes up the feather-bed , and do n't turn over the straw tick only about twice a year , and so it war n't in no danger of getting stole now .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 5]: But I knowed better .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 13]: I had it out of there before they was half-way down stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 22]: I groped along up to my cubby , and hid it there till I could get a chance to do better .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 32]: I judged I better hide it outside of the house somewheres , because if they missed it they would give the house a good ransacking : I knowed that very well .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 39]: Then I turned in , with my clothes all on ; but I could n't a gone to sleep if I 'd a wanted to , I was in such a sweat to get through with the business .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 42]: By and by I heard the king and the duke come up ; so I rolled off my pallet and laid with my chin at the top of my ladder , and waited to see if anything was going to happen .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 4]: But nothing did .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 28]: So I held on till all the late sounds had quit and the early ones had n't begun yet ; and then I slipped down the ladder .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVII .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 12]: I CREPT to their doors and listened ; they was snoring .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 12]: So I tiptoed along , and got down stairs all right .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 7]: There war n't a sound anywheres .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 26]: I peeped through a crack of the dining-room door , and see the men that was watching the corpse all sound asleep on their chairs .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 23]: The door was open into the parlor , where the corpse was laying , and there was a candle in both rooms .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 46]: I passed along , and the parlor door was open ; but I see there war n't nobody in there but the remainders of Peter ; so I shoved on by ; but the front door was locked , and the key was n't there .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 14]: Just then I heard somebody coming down the stairs , back behind me .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 27]: I run in the parlor and took a swift look around , and the only place I see to hide the bag was in the coffin .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 31]: The lid was shoved along about a foot , showing the dead man 's face down in there , with a wet cloth over it , and his shroud on .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 42]: I tucked the money-bag in under the lid , just down beyond where his hands was crossed , which made me creep , they was so cold , and then I run back across the room and in behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 7]: The person coming was Mary Jane .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 45]: She went to the coffin , very soft , and kneeled down and looked in ; then she put up her handkerchief , and I see she begun to cry , though I could n't hear her , and her back was to me .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 36]: I slid out , and as I passed the dining-room I thought I 'd make sure them watchers had n't seen me ; so I looked through the crack , and everything was all right .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 5]: They had n't stirred .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 34]: I slipped up to bed , feeling ruther blue , on accounts of the thing playing out that way after I had took so much trouble and run so much resk about it .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 80]: Says I , if it could stay where it is , all right ; because when we get down the river a hundred mile or two I could write back to Mary Jane , and she could dig him up again and get it ; but that ai n't the thing that 's going to happen ; the thing that 's going to happen is , the money 'll be found when they come to screw on the lid .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 27]: Then the king 'll get it again , and it 'll be a long day before he gives anybody another chance to smouch it from him .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 21]: Of course I WANTED to slide down and get it out of there , but I das n't try it .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 45]: Every minute it was getting earlier now , and pretty soon some of them watchers would begin to stir , and I might get catched -- catched with six thousand dollars in my hands that nobody had n't hired me to take care of .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 20]: I do n't wish to be mixed up in no such business as that , I says to myself .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 20]: When I got down stairs in the morning the parlor was shut up , and the watchers was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 16]: There war n't nobody around but the family and the widow Bartley and our tribe .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 18]: I watched their faces to see if anything had been happening , but I could n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 57]: Towards the middle of the day the undertaker come with his man , and they set the coffin in the middle of the room on a couple of chairs , and then set all our chairs in rows , and borrowed more from the neighbors till the hall and the parlor and the dining-room was full .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 27]: I see the coffin lid was the way it was before , but I das n't go to look in under it , with folks around .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 93]: Then the people begun to flock in , and the beats and the girls took seats in the front row at the head of the coffin , and for a half an hour the people filed around slow , in single rank , and looked down at the dead man 's face a minute , and some dropped in a tear , and it was all very still and solemn , only the girls and the beats holding handkerchiefs to their eyes and keeping their heads bent , and sobbing a little .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 37]: There war n't no other sound but the scraping of the feet on the floor and blowing noses -- because people always blows them more at a funeral than they do at other places except church .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 46]: When the place was packed full the undertaker he slid around in his black gloves with his softy soothering ways , putting on the last touches , and getting people and things all ship-shape and comfortable , and making no more sound than a cat .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 32]: He never spoke ; he moved people around , he squeezed in late ones , he opened up passageways , and done it with nods , and signs with his hands .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 10]: Then he took his place over against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 29]: He was the softest , glidingest , stealthiest man I ever see ; and there war n't no more smile to him than there is to a ham .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 56]: They had borrowed a melodeum -- a sick one ; and when everything was ready a young woman set down and worked it , and it was pretty skreeky and colicky , and everybody joined in and sung , and Peter was the only one that had a good thing , according to my notion .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 77]: Then the Reverend Hobson opened up , slow and solemn , and begun to talk ; and straight off the most outrageous row busted out in the cellar a body ever heard ; it was only one dog , but he made a most powerful racket , and he kept it up right along ; the parson he had to stand there , over the coffin , and wait -- you could n't hear yourself think .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 17]: It was right down awkward , and nobody did n't seem to know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 32]: But pretty soon they see that long-legged undertaker make a sign to the preacher as much as to say , `` Do n't you worry -- just depend on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 22]: Then he stooped down and begun to glide along the wall , just his shoulders showing over the people 's heads .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 39]: So he glided along , and the powwow and racket getting more and more outrageous all the time ; and at last , when he had gone around two sides of the room , he disappears down cellar .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 43]: Then in about two seconds we heard a whack , and the dog he finished up with a most amazing howl or two , and then everything was dead still , and the parson begun his solemn talk where he left off .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 78]: In a minute or two here comes this undertaker 's back and shoulders gliding along the wall again ; and so he glided and glided around three sides of the room , and then rose up , and shaded his mouth with his hands , and stretched his neck out towards the preacher , over the people 's heads , and says , in a kind of a coarse whisper , `` HE HAD A RAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 14]: Then he drooped down and glided along the wall again to his place .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 19]: You could see it was a great satisfaction to the people , because naturally they wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 29]: A little thing like that do n't cost nothing , and it 's just the little things that makes a man to be looked up to and liked .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 15]: There war n't no more popular man in town than what that undertaker was .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 53]: Well , the funeral sermon was very good , but pison long and tiresome ; and then the king he shoved in and got off some of his usual rubbage , and at last the job was through , and the undertaker begun to sneak up on the coffin with his screw-driver .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 13]: I was in a sweat then , and watched him pretty keen .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 25]: But he never meddled at all ; just slid the lid along as soft as mush , and screwed it down tight and fast .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 5]: So there I was !
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 13]: I did n't know whether the money was in there or not .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 17]: So , says I , s ` pose somebody has hogged that bag on the sly ?
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 15]: -- now how do I know whether to write to Mary Jane or not ?
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 18]: S'pose she dug him up and did n't find nothing , what would she think of me ?
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 67]: Blame it , I says , I might get hunted up and jailed ; I 'd better lay low and keep dark , and not write at all ; the thing 's awful mixed now ; trying to better it , I 've worsened it a hundred times , and I wish to goodness I 'd just let it alone , dad fetch the whole business !
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 31]: They buried him , and we come back home , and I went to watching faces again -- I could n't help it , and I could n't rest easy .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 14]: But nothing come of it ; the faces did n't tell me nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 57]: The king he visited around in the evening , and sweetened everybody up , and made himself ever so friendly ; and he give out the idea that his congregation over in England would be in a sweat about him , so he must hurry and settle up the estate right away and leave for home .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 33]: He was very sorry he was so pushed , and so was everybody ; they wished he could stay longer , but they said they could see it could n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 77]: And he said of course him and William would take the girls home with them ; and that pleased everybody too , because then the girls would be well fixed and amongst their own relations ; and it pleased the girls , too -- tickled them so they clean forgot they ever had a trouble in the world ; and told him to sell out as quick as he wanted to , they would be ready .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 42]: Them poor things was that glad and happy it made my heart ache to see them getting fooled and lied to so , but I did n't see no safe way for me to chip in and change the general tune .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 41]: Well , blamed if the king did n't bill the house and the niggers and all the property for auction straight off -- sale two days after the funeral ; but anybody could buy private beforehand if they wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 21]: So the next day after the funeral , along about noon-time , the girls ' joy got the first jolt .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 48]: A couple of nigger traders come along , and the king sold them the niggers reasonable , for three-day drafts as they called it , and away they went , the two sons up the river to Memphis , and their mother down the river to Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 35]: I thought them poor girls and them niggers would break their hearts for grief ; they cried around each other , and took on so it most made me down sick to see it .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 20]: The girls said they had n't ever dreamed of seeing the family separated or sold away from the town .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 76]: I ca n't ever get it out of my memory , the sight of them poor miserable girls and niggers hanging around each other 's necks and crying ; and I reckon I could n't a stood it all , but would a had to bust out and tell on our gang if I had n't knowed the sale war n't no account and the niggers would be back home in a week or two .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 34]: The thing made a big stir in the town , too , and a good many come out flatfooted and said it was scandalous to separate the mother and the children that way .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 35]: It injured the frauds some ; but the old fool he bulled right along , spite of all the duke could say or do , and I tell you the duke was powerful uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 6]: Next day was auction day .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 32]: About broad day in the morning the king and the duke come up in the garret and woke me up , and I see by their look that there was trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 15]: The king says : `` Was you in my room night before last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 24]: `` No , your majesty '' -- which was the way I always called him when nobody but our gang war n't around .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 11]: `` Was you in there yisterday er last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 7]: `` No , your majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 10]: `` Honor bright , now -- no lies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 14]: `` Honor bright , your majesty , I 'm telling you the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 23]: I hai n't been a-near your room since Miss Mary Jane took you and the duke and showed it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 15]: The duke says : `` Have you seen anybody else go in there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 15]: `` No , your grace , not as I remember , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 6]: `` Stop and think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 26]: I studied awhile and see my chance ; then I says : `` Well , I see the niggers go in there several times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 24]: Both of them gave a little jump , and looked like they had n't ever expected it , and then like they HAD .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 13]: Then the duke says : `` What , all of them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 32]: `` No -- leastways , not all at once -- that is , I do n't think I ever see them all come OUT at once but just one time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 3]: `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 5]: When was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 10]: `` It was the day we had the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 4]: In the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 9]: It war n't early , because I overslept .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 14]: I was just starting down the ladder , and I see them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 9]: `` Well , go on , GO on !
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 5]: What did they do ?
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 6]: How 'd they act ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 7]: `` They did n't do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 14]: And they did n't act anyway much , as fur as I see .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 70]: They tiptoed away ; so I seen , easy enough , that they 'd shoved in there to do up your majesty 's room , or something , s ` posing you was up ; and found you WAR N'T up , and so they was hoping to slide out of the way of trouble without waking you up , if they had n't already waked you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 10]: `` Great guns , THIS is a go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 15]: says the king ; and both of them looked pretty sick and tolerable silly .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 41]: They stood there a-thinking and scratching their heads a minute , and the duke he bust into a kind of a little raspy chuckle , and says : `` It does beat all how neat the niggers played their hand .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 14]: They let on to be SORRY they was going out of this region !
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 17]: And I believed they WAS sorry , and so did you , and so did everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 17]: Do n't ever tell ME any more that a nigger ai n't got any histrionic talent .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 13]: Why , the way they played that thing it would fool ANYBODY .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 11]: In my opinion , there 's a fortune in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 30]: If I had capital and a theater , I would n't want a better lay-out than that -- and here we 've gone and sold 'em for a song .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 12]: Yes , and ai n't privileged to sing the song yet .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 11]: Say , where IS that song -- that draft ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 9]: `` In the bank for to be collected .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 6]: Where WOULD it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 13]: `` Well , THAT 'S all right then , thank goodness . ''
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 14]: Says I , kind of timid-like : `` Is something gone wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 16]: The king whirls on me and rips out : `` None o ' your business !
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 18]: You keep your head shet , and mind y' r own affairs -- if you got any .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 17]: Long as you 're in this town do n't you forgit THAT -- you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 27]: Then he says to the duke , `` We got to jest swaller it and say noth 'n' : mum 's the word for US . ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 23]: As they was starting down the ladder the duke he chuckles again , and says : `` Quick sales AND small profits !
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 9]: It 's a good business -- yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 26]: The king snarls around on him and says : `` I was trying to do for the best in sellin ' 'em out so quick .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 31]: If the profits has turned out to be none , lackin ' considable , and none to carry , is it my fault any more 'n it 's yourn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 25]: `` Well , THEY 'D be in this house yet and we WOULD N'T if I could a got my advice listened to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 22]: The king sassed back as much as was safe for him , and then swapped around and lit into ME again .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 35]: He give me down the banks for not coming and TELLING him I see the niggers come out of his room acting that way -- said any fool would a KNOWED something was up .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 40]: And then waltzed in and cussed HIMSELF awhile , and said it all come of him not laying late and taking his natural rest that morning , and he 'd be blamed if he 'd ever do it again .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 34]: So they went off a-jawing ; and I felt dreadful glad I 'd worked it all off on to the niggers , and yet had n't done the niggers no harm by it .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 8]: BY and by it was getting-up time .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 56]: So I come down the ladder and started for down-stairs ; but as I come to the girls ' room the door was open , and I see Mary Jane setting by her old hair trunk , which was open and she 'd been packing things in it -- getting ready to go to England .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 23]: But she had stopped now with a folded gown in her lap , and had her face in her hands , crying .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 13]: I felt awful bad to see it ; of course anybody would .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 30]: I went in there and says : `` Miss Mary Jane , you ca n't a-bear to see people in trouble , and I ca n't -- most always .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 6]: Tell me about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 5]: So she done it .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 11]: And it was the niggers -- I just expected it .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 84]: She said the beautiful trip to England was most about spoiled for her ; she did n't know HOW she was ever going to be happy there , knowing the mother and the children war n't ever going to see each other no more -- and then busted out bitterer than ever , and flung up her hands , and says : `` Oh , dear , dear , to think they ai n't EVER going to see each other any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 17]: `` But they WILL -- and inside of two weeks -- and I KNOW it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 12]: says I. Laws , it was out before I could think !
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 28]: And before I could budge she throws her arms around my neck and told me to say it AGAIN , say it AGAIN , say it AGAIN !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 19]: I see I had spoke too sudden and said too much , and was in a close place .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 41]: I asked her to let me think a minute ; and she set there , very impatient and excited and handsome , but looking kind of happy and eased-up , like a person that 's had a tooth pulled out .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: So I went to studying it out .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 81]: I says to myself , I reckon a body that ups and tells the truth when he is in a tight place is taking considerable many resks , though I ai n't had no experience , and ca n't say for certain ; but it looks so to me , anyway ; and yet here 's a case where I 'm blest if it do n't look to me like the truth is better and actuly SAFER than a lie .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 27]: I must lay it by in my mind , and think it over some time or other , it 's so kind of strange and unregular .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 7]: I never see nothing like it .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 52]: Well , I says to myself at last , I 'm a-going to chance it ; I 'll up and tell the truth this time , though it does seem most like setting down on a kag of powder and touching it off just to see where you 'll go to .
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 31]: Then I says : `` Miss Mary Jane , is there any place out of town a little ways where you could go and stay three or four days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 7]: `` Yes ; Mr. Lothrop 's .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 6]: `` Never mind why yet .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 45]: If I 'll tell you how I know the niggers will see each other again inside of two weeks -- here in this house -- and PROVE how I know it -- will you go to Mr. Lothrop 's and stay four days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 5]: `` Four days ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 11]: she says ; `` I 'll stay a year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 34]: `` All right , '' I says , `` I do n't want nothing more out of YOU than just your word -- I druther have it than another man 's kiss-the-Bible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 31]: She smiled and reddened up very sweet , and I says , `` If you do n't mind it , I 'll shut the door -- and bolt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 18]: Then I come back and set down again , and says : `` Do n't you holler .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 10]: Just set still and take it like a man .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 41]: I got to tell the truth , and you want to brace up , Miss Mary , because it 's a bad kind , and going to be hard to take , but there ai n't no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 21]: These uncles of yourn ai n't no uncles at all ; they 're a couple of frauds -- regular dead-beats .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 20]: There , now we 're over the worst of it , you can stand the rest middling easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 102]: It jolted her up like everything , of course ; but I was over the shoal water now , so I went right along , her eyes a-blazing higher and higher all the time , and told her every blame thing , from where we first struck that young fool going up to the steamboat , clear through to where she flung herself on to the king 's breast at the front door and he kissed her sixteen or seventeen times -- and then up she jumps , with her face afire like sunset , and says : `` The brute !
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 27]: Come , do n't waste a minute -- not a SECOND -- we 'll have them tarred and feathered , and flung in the river ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 8]: Says I : `` Cert ` nly .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 30]: But do you mean BEFORE you go to Mr. Lothrop 's , or -- '' `` Oh , '' she says , `` what am I THINKING about ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 9]: she says , and set right down again .
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 22]: `` Do n't mind what I said -- please do n't -- you WO N'T , now , WILL you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 20]: Laying her silky hand on mine in that kind of a way that I said I would die first .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 29]: `` I never thought , I was so stirred up , '' she says ; `` now go on , and I wo n't do so any more .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 17]: You tell me what to do , and whatever you say I 'll do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 91]: `` Well , '' I says , `` it 's a rough gang , them two frauds , and I 'm fixed so I got to travel with them a while longer , whether I want to or not -- I druther not tell you why ; and if you was to blow on them this town would get me out of their claws , and I 'd be all right ; but there 'd be another person that you do n't know about who 'd be in big trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 12]: Well , we got to save HIM , hai n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 12]: Well , then , we wo n't blow on them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 11]: Saying them words put a good idea in my head .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 24]: I see how maybe I could get me and Jim rid of the frauds ; get them jailed here , and then leave .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 36]: But I did n't want to run the raft in the daytime without anybody aboard to answer questions but me ; so I did n't want the plan to begin working till pretty late to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 33]: I says : `` Miss Mary Jane , I 'll tell you what we 'll do , and you wo n't have to stay at Mr. Lothrop 's so long , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 6]: How fur is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 18]: `` A little short of four miles -- right out in the country , back here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 7]: `` Well , that 'll answer .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 34]: Now you go along out there , and lay low till nine or half-past to-night , and then get them to fetch you home again -- tell them you 've thought of something .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 47]: If you get here before eleven put a candle in this window , and if I do n't turn up wait TILL eleven , and THEN if I do n't turn up it means I 'm gone , and out of the way , and safe .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 17]: Then you come out and spread the news around , and get these beats jailed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 14]: `` Good , '' she says , `` I 'll do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 46]: `` And if it just happens so that I do n't get away , but get took up along with them , you must up and say I told you the whole thing beforehand , and you must stand by me all you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 5]: `` Stand by you !
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 4]: indeed I will .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 12]: They sha 'n' t touch a hair of your head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 20]: she says , and I see her nostrils spread and her eyes snap when she said it , too .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 37]: `` If I get away I sha 'n' t be here , '' I says , `` to prove these rapscallions ai n't your uncles , and I could n't do it if I WAS here .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 19]: I could swear they was beats and bummers , that 's all , though that 's worth something .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 32]: Well , there 's others can do that better than what I can , and they 're people that ai n't going to be doubted as quick as I 'd be .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 9]: I 'll tell you how to find them .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 10]: Gim me a pencil and a piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 9]: There -- ` Royal Nonesuch , Bricksville . '
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 10]: Put it away , and do n't lose it .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 56]: When the court wants to find out something about these two , let them send up to Bricksville and say they 've got the men that played the Royal Nonesuch , and ask for some witnesses -- why , you 'll have that entire town down here before you can hardly wink , Miss Mary .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 9]: And they 'll come a-biling , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 11]: I judged we had got everything fixed about right now .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 18]: So I says : `` Just let the auction go right along , and do n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 64]: Nobody do n't have to pay for the things they buy till a whole day after the auction on accounts of the short notice , and they ai n't going out of this till they get that money ; and the way we 've fixed it the sale ai n't going to count , and they ai n't going to get no money .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 27]: It 's just like the way it was with the niggers -- it war n't no sale , and the niggers will be back before long .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 27]: Why , they ca n't collect the money for the NIGGERS yet -- they 're in the worst kind of a fix , Miss Mary . ''
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 29]: `` Well , '' she says , `` I 'll run down to breakfast now , and then I 'll start straight for Mr. Lothrop 's . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 29]: ` Deed , THAT ai n't the ticket , Miss Mary Jane , '' I says , `` by no manner of means ; go BEFORE breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 18]: `` What did you reckon I wanted you to go at all for , Miss Mary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 17]: `` Well , I never thought -- and come to think , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 5]: What was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 15]: `` Why , it 's because you ai n't one of these leather-face people .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 13]: I do n't want no better book than what your face is .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 13]: A body can set down and read it off like coarse print .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 30]: Do you reckon you can go and face your uncles when they come to kiss you good-morning , and never -- '' `` There , there , do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 14]: Yes , I 'll go before breakfast -- I 'll be glad to .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 8]: And leave my sisters with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 8]: `` Yes ; never mind about them .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 10]: They 've got to stand it yet a while .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 12]: They might suspicion something if all of you was to go .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 37]: I do n't want you to see them , nor your sisters , nor nobody in this town ; if a neighbor was to ask how is your uncles this morning your face would tell something .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 21]: No , you go right along , Miss Mary Jane , and I 'll fix it with all of them .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 50]: I 'll tell Miss Susan to give your love to your uncles and say you 've went away for a few hours for to get a little rest and change , or to see a friend , and you 'll be back to-night or early in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 22]: `` Gone to see a friend is all right , but I wo n't have my love given to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 12]: `` Well , then , it sha 'n' t be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 14]: It was well enough to tell HER so -- no harm in it .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 45]: It was only a little thing to do , and no trouble ; and it 's the little things that smooths people 's roads the most , down here below ; it would make Mary Jane comfortable , and it would n't cost nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 17]: Then I says : `` There 's one more thing -- that bag of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 23]: `` Well , they 've got that ; and it makes me feel pretty silly to think HOW they got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 9]: `` No , you 're out , there .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 7]: They hai n't got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 9]: `` Why , who 's got it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 11]: `` I wish I knowed , but I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 39]: I HAD it , because I stole it from them ; and I stole it to give to you ; and I know where I hid it , but I 'm afraid it ai n't there no more .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 31]: I 'm awful sorry , Miss Mary Jane , I 'm just as sorry as I can be ; but I done the best I could ; I did honest .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 32]: I come nigh getting caught , and I had to shove it into the first place I come to , and run -- and it war n't a good place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 34]: `` Oh , stop blaming yourself -- it 's too bad to do it , and I wo n't allow it -- you could n't help it ; it was n't your fault .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 7]: Where did you hide it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 46]: I did n't want to set her to thinking about her troubles again ; and I could n't seem to get my mouth to tell her what would make her see that corpse laying in the coffin with that bag of money on his stomach .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 70]: So for a minute I did n't say nothing ; then I says : `` I 'd ruther not TELL you where I put it , Miss Mary Jane , if you do n't mind letting me off ; but I 'll write it for you on a piece of paper , and you can read it along the road to Mr. Lothrop 's , if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 8]: Do you reckon that 'll do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 12]: So I wrote : `` I put it in the coffin .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 15]: It was in there when you was crying there , away in the night .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 19]: I was behind the door , and I was mighty sorry for you , Miss Mary Jane . ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 74]: It made my eyes water a little to remember her crying there all by herself in the night , and them devils laying there right under her own roof , shaming her and robbing her ; and when I folded it up and give it to her I see the water come into her eyes , too ; and she shook me by the hand , hard , and says : `` GOOD-bye .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 54]: I 'm going to do everything just as you 've told me ; and if I do n't ever see you again , I sha 'n' t ever forget you and I 'll think of you a many and a many a time , and I 'll PRAY for you , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 6]: -- and she was gone .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 4]: Pray for me !
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 18]: I reckoned if she knowed me she 'd take a job that was more nearer her size .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 17]: But I bet she done it , just the same -- she was just that kind .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 25]: She had the grit to pray for Judus if she took the notion -- there war n't no back-down to her , I judge .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 35]: You may say what you want to , but in my opinion she had more sand in her than any girl I ever see ; in my opinion she was just full of sand .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 12]: It sounds like flattery , but it ai n't no flattery .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 18]: And when it comes to beauty -- and goodness , too -- she lays over them all .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 86]: I hai n't ever seen her since that time that I see her go out of that door ; no , I hai n't ever seen her since , but I reckon I 've thought of her a many and a many a million times , and of her saying she would pray for me ; and if ever I 'd a thought it would do any good for me to pray for HER , blamed if I would n't a done it or bust .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 20]: Well , Mary Jane she lit out the back way , I reckon ; because nobody see her go .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 37]: When I struck Susan and the hare-lip , I says : `` What 's the name of them people over on t ` other side of the river that you all goes to see sometimes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 17]: They says : `` There 's several ; but it 's the Proctors , mainly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 16]: `` That 's the name , '' I says ; `` I most forgot it .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 28]: Well , Miss Mary Jane she told me to tell you she 's gone over there in a dreadful hurry -- one of them 's sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 31]: `` I do n't know ; leastways , I kinder forget ; but I thinks it 's -- '' `` Sakes alive , I hope it ai n't HANNER ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 21]: `` I 'm sorry to say it , '' I says , `` but Hanner 's the very one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 12]: `` My goodness , and she so well only last week !
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 6]: Is she took bad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 9]: `` It ai n't no name for it .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 25]: They set up with her all night , Miss Mary Jane said , and they do n't think she 'll last many hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 8]: `` Only think of that , now !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 8]: What 's the matter with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 21]: I could n't think of anything reasonable , right off that way , so I says : `` Mumps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 5]: `` Mumps your granny !
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 14]: They do n't set up with people that 's got the mumps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 9]: `` They do n't , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 9]: You better bet they do with THESE mumps .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 5]: These mumps is different .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 12]: It 's a new kind , Miss Mary Jane said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 9]: `` How 's it a new kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 11]: `` Because it 's mixed up with other things . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 6]: `` What other things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 30]: `` Well , measles , and whooping-cough , and erysiplas , and consumption , and yaller janders , and brain-fever , and I do n't know what all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 4]: `` My land !
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 8]: And they call it the MUMPS ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 10]: `` That 's what Miss Mary Jane said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 16]: `` Well , what in the nation do they call it the MUMPS for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 9]: `` Why , because it IS the mumps .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 8]: That 's what it starts with . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 12]: `` Well , ther ' ai n't no sense in it .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 54]: A body might stump his toe , and take pison , and fall down the well , and break his neck , and bust his brains out , and somebody come along and ask what killed him , and some numskull up and say , ` Why , he stumped his TOE . '
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 9]: Would ther ' be any sense in that ?
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 2]: NO .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 12]: And ther ' ai n't no sense in THIS , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 5]: Is it ketching ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 5]: `` Is it KETCHING ?
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 6]: Why , how you talk .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 9]: Is a HARROW catching -- in the dark ?
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 21]: If you do n't hitch on to one tooth , you 're bound to on another , ai n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 19]: And you ca n't get away with that tooth without fetching the whole harrow along , can you ?
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 40]: Well , these kind of mumps is a kind of a harrow , as you may say -- and it ai n't no slouch of a harrow , nuther , you come to get it hitched on good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 15]: `` Well , it 's awful , I think , '' says the hare-lip .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 23]: `` I 'll go to Uncle Harvey and -- '' `` Oh , yes , '' I says , `` I WOULD .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 5]: Of COURSE I would .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 8]: I would n't lose no time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 9]: `` Well , why would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 14]: `` Just look at it a minute , and maybe you can see .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 17]: Hai n't your uncles obleegd to get along home to England as fast as they can ?
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 23]: And do you reckon they 'd be mean enough to go off and leave you to go all that journey by yourselves ?
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 8]: YOU know they 'll wait for you .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 6]: So fur , so good .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 11]: Your uncle Harvey 's a preacher , ai n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 15]: Very well , then ; is a PREACHER going to deceive a steamboat clerk ?
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 9]: is he going to deceive a SHIP CLERK ?
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 14]: -- so as to get them to let Miss Mary Jane go aboard ?
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 7]: Now YOU know he ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 7]: What WILL he do , then ?
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 69]: Why , he 'll say , ` It 's a great pity , but my church matters has got to get along the best way they can ; for my niece has been exposed to the dreadful pluribus-unum mumps , and so it 's my bounden duty to set down here and wait the three months it takes to show on her if she 's got it . '
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 51]: But never mind , if you think it 's best to tell your uncle Harvey -- '' `` Shucks , and stay fooling around here when we could all be having good times in England whilst we was waiting to find out whether Mary Jane 's got it or not ?
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 9]: Why , you talk like a muggins . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 16]: `` Well , anyway , maybe you 'd better tell some of the neighbors . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 7]: `` Listen at that , now .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 8]: You do beat all for natural stupidness .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 11]: Ca n't you SEE that THEY 'D go and tell ?
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 16]: Ther ' ai n't no way but just to not tell anybody at ALL . ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 17]: `` Well , maybe you 're right -- yes , I judge you ARE right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 29]: `` But I reckon we ought to tell Uncle Harvey she 's gone out a while , anyway , so he wo n't be uneasy about her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 13]: `` Yes , Miss Mary Jane she wanted you to do that .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 51]: She says , ` Tell them to give Uncle Harvey and William my love and a kiss , and say I 've run over the river to see Mr. ' -- Mr. -- what IS the name of that rich family your uncle Peter used to think so much of ?
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 22]: -- I mean the one that -- '' `` Why , you must mean the Apthorps , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 26]: `` Of course ; bother them kind of names , a body ca n't ever seem to remember them , half the time , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 87]: Yes , she said , say she has run over for to ask the Apthorps to be sure and come to the auction and buy this house , because she allowed her uncle Peter would ruther they had it than anybody else ; and she 's going to stick to them till they say they 'll come , and then , if she ai n't too tired , she 's coming home ; and if she is , she 'll be home in the morning anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 48]: She said , do n't say nothing about the Proctors , but only about the Apthorps -- which 'll be perfectly true , because she is going there to speak about their buying the house ; I know it , because she told me so herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 32]: `` All right , '' they said , and cleared out to lay for their uncles , and give them the love and the kisses , and tell them the message .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 6]: Everything was all right now .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 38]: The girls would n't say nothing because they wanted to go to England ; and the king and the duke would ruther Mary Jane was off working for the auction than around in reach of Doctor Robinson .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 27]: I felt very good ; I judged I had done it pretty neat -- I reckoned Tom Sawyer could n't a done it no neater himself .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 27]: Of course he would a throwed more style into it , but I ca n't do that very handy , not being brung up to it .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 88]: Well , they held the auction in the public square , along towards the end of the afternoon , and it strung along , and strung along , and the old man he was on hand and looking his level pisonest , up there longside of the auctioneer , and chipping in a little Scripture now and then , or a little goody-goody saying of some kind , and the duke he was around goo-gooing for sympathy all he knowed how , and just spreading himself generly .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 25]: But by and by the thing dragged through , and everything was sold -- everything but a little old trifling lot in the graveyard .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 25]: So they 'd got to work that off -- I never see such a girafft as the king was for wanting to swallow EVERYTHING .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 40]: Well , whilst they was at it a steamboat landed , and in about two minutes up comes a crowd a-whooping and yelling and laughing and carrying on , and singing out : `` HERE 'S your opposition line !
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 25]: here 's your two sets o ' heirs to old Peter Wilks -- and you pays your money and you takes your choice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXIX .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 24]: THEY was fetching a very nice-looking old gentleman along , and a nice-looking younger one , with his right arm in a sling .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 17]: And , my souls , how the people yelled and laughed , and kept it up .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 26]: But I did n't see no joke about it , and I judged it would strain the duke and the king some to see any .
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 7]: I reckoned they 'd turn pale .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 10]: But no , nary a pale did THEY turn .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 71]: The duke he never let on he suspicioned what was up , but just went a goo-gooing around , happy and satisfied , like a jug that 's googling out buttermilk ; and as for the king , he just gazed and gazed down sorrowful on them new-comers like it give him the stomach-ache in his very heart to think there could be such frauds and rascals in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 7]: Oh , he done it admirable .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 20]: Lots of the principal people gethered around the king , to let him see they was on his side .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 13]: That old gentleman that had just come looked all puzzled to death .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 35]: Pretty soon he begun to speak , and I see straight off he pronounced LIKE an Englishman -- not the king 's way , though the king 's WAS pretty good for an imitation .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 103]: I ca n't give the old gent 's words , nor I ca n't imitate him ; but he turned around to the crowd , and says , about like this : `` This is a surprise to me which I was n't looking for ; and I 'll acknowledge , candid and frank , I ai n't very well fixed to meet it and answer it ; for my brother and me has had misfortunes ; he 's broke his arm , and our baggage got put off at a town above here last night in the night by a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 47]: I am Peter Wilks ' brother Harvey , and this is his brother William , which ca n't hear nor speak -- and ca n't even make signs to amount to much , now ' t he 's only got one hand to work them with .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 26]: We are who we say we are ; and in a day or two , when I get the baggage , I can prove it .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 20]: But up till then I wo n't say nothing more , but go to the hotel and wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 31]: So him and the new dummy started off ; and the king he laughs , and blethers out : `` Broke his arm -- VERY likely , AI N'T it ?
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 23]: -- and very convenient , too , for a fraud that 's got to make signs , and ai n't learnt how .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 4]: Lost their baggage !
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 5]: That 's MIGHTY good !
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 10]: -- and mighty ingenious -- under the CIRCUMSTANCES ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 22]: So he laughed again ; and so did everybody else , except three or four , or maybe half a dozen .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 99]: One of these was that doctor ; another one was a sharp-looking gentleman , with a carpet-bag of the old-fashioned kind made out of carpet-stuff , that had just come off of the steamboat and was talking to him in a low voice , and glancing towards the king now and then and nodding their heads -- it was Levi Bell , the lawyer that was gone up to Louisville ; and another one was a big rough husky that come along and listened to all the old gentleman said , and was listening to the king now .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 33]: And when the king got done this husky up and says : `` Say , looky here ; if you are Harvey Wilks , when 'd you come to this town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 14]: `` The day before the funeral , friend , '' says the king .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 9]: `` But what time o ' day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 16]: `` In the evenin ' -- ` bout an hour er two before sundown . ''
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 7]: `` HOW 'D you come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 12]: `` I come down on the Susan Powell from Cincinnati . ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 25]: `` Well , then , how 'd you come to be up at the Pint in the MORNIN ' -- in a canoe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 14]: `` I war n't up at the Pint in the mornin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 7]: `` It 's a lie . ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 22]: Several of them jumped for him and begged him not to talk that way to an old man and a preacher .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 13]: `` Preacher be hanged , he 's a fraud and a liar .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 10]: He was up at the Pint that mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 9]: I live up there , do n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 13]: Well , I was up there , and he was up there .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 5]: I see him there .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 15]: He come in a canoe , along with Tim Collins and a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 24]: The doctor he up and says : `` Would you know the boy again if you was to see him , Hines ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 12]: `` I reckon I would , but I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 8]: Why , yonder he is , now .
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 7]: I know him perfectly easy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 7]: It was me he pointed at .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 37]: The doctor says : `` Neighbors , I do n't know whether the new couple is frauds or not ; but if THESE two ai n't frauds , I am an idiot , that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 24]: I think it 's our duty to see that they do n't get away from here till we 've looked into this thing .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 13]: Come along , Hines ; come along , the rest of you .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 31]: We 'll take these fellows to the tavern and affront them with t ` other couple , and I reckon we 'll find out SOMETHING before we get through . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 21]: It was nuts for the crowd , though maybe not for the king 's friends ; so we all started .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 5]: It was about sundown .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 24]: The doctor he led me along by the hand , and was plenty kind enough , but he never let go my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 24]: We all got in a big room in the hotel , and lit up some candles , and fetched in the new couple .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 40]: First , the doctor says : `` I do n't wish to be too hard on these two men , but I think they 're frauds , and they may have complices that we do n't know nothing about .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 19]: If they have , wo n't the complices get away with that bag of gold Peter Wilks left ?
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 5]: It ai n't unlikely .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 35]: If these men ai n't frauds , they wo n't object to sending for that money and letting us keep it till they prove they 're all right -- ai n't that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 5]: Everybody agreed to that .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 17]: So I judged they had our gang in a pretty tight place right at the outstart .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 71]: But the king he only looked sorrowful , and says : `` Gentlemen , I wish the money was there , for I ai n't got no disposition to throw anything in the way of a fair , open , out-and-out investigation o ' this misable business ; but , alas , the money ai n't there ; you k 'n send and see , if you want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 8]: `` Where is it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 73]: `` Well , when my niece give it to me to keep for her I took and hid it inside o ' the straw tick o ' my bed , not wishin ' to bank it for the few days we 'd be here , and considerin ' the bed a safe place , we not bein ' used to niggers , and suppos 'n' 'em honest , like servants in England .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 37]: The niggers stole it the very next mornin ' after I had went down stairs ; and when I sold 'em I had n't missed the money yit , so they got clean away with it .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 14]: My servant here k 'n tell you ` bout it , gentlemen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 9]: The doctor and several said `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 10]: and I see nobody did n't altogether believe him .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 12]: One man asked me if I see the niggers steal it .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 48]: I said no , but I see them sneaking out of the room and hustling away , and I never thought nothing , only I reckoned they was afraid they had waked up my master and was trying to get away before he made trouble with them .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 7]: That was all they asked me .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 17]: Then the doctor whirls on me and says : `` Are YOU English , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 18]: I says yes ; and him and some others laughed , and said , `` Stuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 67]: Well , then they sailed in on the general investigation , and there we had it , up and down , hour in , hour out , and nobody never said a word about supper , nor ever seemed to think about it -- and so they kept it up , and kept it up ; and it WAS the worst mixed-up thing you ever see .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 44]: They made the king tell his yarn , and they made the old gentleman tell his ` n ; and anybody but a lot of prejudiced chuckleheads would a SEEN that the old gentleman was spinning truth and t ` other one lies .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 14]: And by and by they had me up to tell what I knowed .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 28]: The king he give me a left-handed look out of the corner of his eye , and so I knowed enough to talk on the right side .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 64]: I begun to tell about Sheffield , and how we lived there , and all about the English Wilkses , and so on ; but I did n't get pretty fur till the doctor begun to laugh ; and Levi Bell , the lawyer , says : `` Set down , my boy ; I would n't strain myself if I was you .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 23]: I reckon you ai n't used to lying , it do n't seem to come handy ; what you want is practice .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 7]: You do it pretty awkward . ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 20]: I did n't care nothing for the compliment , but I was glad to be let off , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 61]: The doctor he started to say something , and turns and says : `` If you 'd been in town at first , Levi Bell -- '' The king broke in and reached out his hand , and says : `` Why , is this my poor dead brother 's old friend that he 's wrote so often about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 48]: The lawyer and him shook hands , and the lawyer smiled and looked pleased , and they talked right along awhile , and then got to one side and talked low ; and at last the lawyer speaks up and says : `` That 'll fix it .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 26]: I 'll take the order and send it , along with your brother 's , and then they 'll know it 's all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 54]: So they got some paper and a pen , and the king he set down and twisted his head to one side , and chawed his tongue , and scrawled off something ; and then they give the pen to the duke -- and then for the first time the duke looked sick .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 8]: But he took the pen and wrote .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 30]: So then the lawyer turns to the new old gentleman and says : `` You and your brother please write a line or two and sign your names . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 12]: The old gentleman wrote , but nobody could n't read it .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 142]: The lawyer looked powerful astonished , and says : `` Well , it beats ME '' -- and snaked a lot of old letters out of his pocket , and examined them , and then examined the old man 's writing , and then THEM again ; and then says : `` These old letters is from Harvey Wilks ; and here 's THESE two handwritings , and anybody can see they did n't write them '' -LRB- the king and the duke looked sold and foolish , I tell you , to see how the lawyer had took them in -RRB- , `` and here 's THIS old gentleman 's hand writing , and anybody can tell , easy enough , HE did n't write them -- fact is , the scratches he makes ai n't properly WRITING at all .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 24]: Now , here 's some letters from -- '' The new old gentleman says : `` If you please , let me explain .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 16]: Nobody can read my hand but my brother there -- so he copies for me .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 13]: It 's HIS hand you 've got there , not mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 4]: `` WELL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 12]: says the lawyer , `` this IS a state of things .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 44]: I 've got some of William 's letters , too ; so if you 'll get him to write a line or so we can com -- '' `` He CA N'T write with his left hand , '' says the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 22]: `` If he could use his right hand , you would see that he wrote his own letters and mine too .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 14]: Look at both , please -- they 're by the same hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 36]: The lawyer done it , and says : `` I believe it 's so -- and if it ai n't so , there 's a heap stronger resemblance than I 'd noticed before , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 6]: Well , well , well !
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 21]: I thought we was right on the track of a solution , but it 's gone to grass , partly .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 30]: But anyway , one thing is proved -- THESE two ai n't either of 'em Wilkses '' -- and he wagged his head towards the king and the duke .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 7]: Well , what do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 10]: That muleheaded old fool would n't give in THEN !
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 5]: Indeed he would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 8]: Said it war n't no fair test .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 39]: Said his brother William was the cussedest joker in the world , and had n't tried to write -- HE see William was going to play one of his jokes the minute he put the pen to paper .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 44]: And so he warmed up and went warbling and warbling right along till he was actuly beginning to believe what he was saying HIMSELF ; but pretty soon the new gentleman broke in , and says : `` I 've thought of something .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 24]: Is there anybody here that helped to lay out my br -- helped to lay out the late Peter Wilks for burying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' says somebody , `` me and Ab Turner done it .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 6]: We 're both here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 27]: Then the old man turns towards the king , and says : `` Perhaps this gentleman can tell me what was tattooed on his breast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 80]: Blamed if the king did n't have to brace up mighty quick , or he 'd a squshed down like a bluff bank that the river has cut under , it took him so sudden ; and , mind you , it was a thing that was calculated to make most ANYBODY sqush to get fetched such a solid one as that without any notice , because how was HE going to know what was tattooed on the man ?
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 30]: He whitened a little ; he could n't help it ; and it was mighty still in there , and everybody bending a little forwards and gazing at him .
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 20]: Says I to myself , NOW he 'll throw up the sponge -- there ai n't no more use .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 5]: Well , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 13]: A body ca n't hardly believe it , but he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 35]: I reckon he thought he 'd keep the thing up till he tired them people out , so they 'd thin out , and him and the duke could break loose and get away .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 20]: Anyway , he set there , and pretty soon he begun to smile , and says : `` Mf !
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 11]: It 's a VERY tough question , AI N'T it !
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 16]: YES , sir , I k 'n tell you what 's tattooed on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 31]: It 's jest a small , thin , blue arrow -- that 's what it is ; and if you do n't look clost , you ca n't see it .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 9]: NOW what do you say -- hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 15]: Well , I never see anything like that old blister for clean out-and-out cheek .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 42]: The new old gentleman turns brisk towards Ab Turner and his pard , and his eye lights up like he judged he 'd got the king THIS time , and says : `` There -- you 've heard what he said !
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 12]: Was there any such mark on Peter Wilks ' breast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 18]: Both of them spoke up and says : `` We did n't see no such mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 5]: says the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 62]: `` Now , what you DID see on his breast was a small dim P , and a B -LRB- which is an initial he dropped when he was young -RRB- , and a W , with dashes between them , so : P -- B -- W '' -- and he marked them that way on a piece of paper .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 11]: `` Come , ai n't that what you saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 17]: Both of them spoke up again , and says : `` No , we DID N'T .
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 9]: We never seen any marks at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 26]: Well , everybody WAS in a state of mind now , and they sings out : `` The whole BILIN ' of 'm 's frauds !
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 5]: Le 's duck 'em !
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 5]: le 's drown 'em !
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 9]: le 's ride 'em on a rail ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 14]: and everybody was whooping at once , and there was a rattling powwow .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 19]: But the lawyer he jumps on the table and yells , and says : `` Gentlemen -- gentleMEN !
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 15]: Hear me just a word -- just a SINGLE word -- if you PLEASE !
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 18]: There 's one way yet -- let 's go and dig up the corpse and look . ''
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 4]: That took them .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 4]: `` Hooray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 26]: they all shouted , and was starting right off ; but the lawyer and the doctor sung out : `` Hold on , hold on !
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 17]: Collar all these four men and the boy , and fetch THEM along , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 7]: `` We 'll do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 21]: they all shouted ; `` and if we do n't find them marks we 'll lynch the whole gang ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 10]: I WAS scared , now , I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 11]: But there war n't no getting away , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 50]: They gripped us all , and marched us right along , straight for the graveyard , which was a mile and a half down the river , and the whole town at our heels , for we made noise enough , and it was only nine in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 41]: As we went by our house I wished I had n't sent Mary Jane out of town ; because now if I could tip her the wink she 'd light out and save me , and blow on our dead-beats .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 46]: Well , we swarmed along down the river road , just carrying on like wildcats ; and to make it more scary the sky was darking up , and the lightning beginning to wink and flitter , and the wind to shiver amongst the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 89]: This was the most awful trouble and most dangersome I ever was in ; and I was kinder stunned ; everything was going so different from what I had allowed for ; stead of being fixed so I could take my own time if I wanted to , and see all the fun , and have Mary Jane at my back to save me and set me free when the close-fit come , here was nothing in the world betwixt me and sudden death but just them tattoo-marks .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 29]: If they did n't find them -- I could n't bear to think about it ; and yet , somehow , I could n't think about nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 44]: It got darker and darker , and it was a beautiful time to give the crowd the slip ; but that big husky had me by the wrist -- Hines -- and a body might as well try to give Goliar the slip .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 20]: He dragged me right along , he was so excited , and I had to run to keep up .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 17]: When they got there they swarmed into the graveyard and washed over it like an overflow .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 32]: And when they got to the grave they found they had about a hundred times as many shovels as they wanted , but nobody had n't thought to fetch a lantern .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 32]: But they sailed into digging anyway by the flicker of the lightning , and sent a man to the nearest house , a half a mile off , to borrow one .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 105]: So they dug and dug like everything ; and it got awful dark , and the rain started , and the wind swished and swushed along , and the lightning come brisker and brisker , and the thunder boomed ; but them people never took no notice of it , they was so full of this business ; and one minute you could see everything and every face in that big crowd , and the shovelfuls of dirt sailing up out of the grave , and the next second the dark wiped it all out , and you could n't see nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 51]: At last they got out the coffin and begun to unscrew the lid , and then such another crowding and shouldering and shoving as there was , to scrouge in and get a sight , you never see ; and in the dark , that way , it was awful .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 30]: Hines he hurt my wrist dreadful pulling and tugging so , and I reckon he clean forgot I was in the world , he was so excited and panting .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 37]: All of a sudden the lightning let go a perfect sluice of white glare , and somebody sings out : `` By the living jingo , here 's the bag of gold on his breast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 50]: Hines let out a whoop , like everybody else , and dropped my wrist and give a big surge to bust his way in and get a look , and the way I lit out and shinned for the road in the dark there ai n't nobody can tell .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 64]: I had the road all to myself , and I fairly flew -- leastways , I had it all to myself except the solid dark , and the now-and-then glares , and the buzzing of the rain , and the thrashing of the wind , and the splitting of the thunder ; and sure as you are born I did clip it along !
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 51]: When I struck the town I see there war n't nobody out in the storm , so I never hunted for no back streets , but humped it straight through the main one ; and when I begun to get towards our house I aimed my eye and set it .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 23]: No light there ; the house all dark -- which made me feel sorry and disappointed , I did n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 21]: But at last , just as I was sailing by , FLASH comes the light in Mary Jane 's window !
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 41]: and my heart swelled up sudden , like to bust ; and the same second the house and all was behind me in the dark , and was n't ever going to be before me no more in this world .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 15]: She WAS the best girl I ever see , and had the most sand .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 47]: The minute I was far enough above the town to see I could make the towhead , I begun to look sharp for a boat to borrow , and the first time the lightning showed me one that was n't chained I snatched it and shoved .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 15]: It was a canoe , and war n't fastened with nothing but a rope .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 55]: The towhead was a rattling big distance off , away out there in the middle of the river , but I did n't lose no time ; and when I struck the raft at last I was so fagged I would a just laid down to blow and gasp if I could afforded it .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 5]: But I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 20]: As I sprung aboard I sung out : `` Out with you , Jim , and set her loose !
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 12]: Glory be to goodness , we 're shut of them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 70]: Jim lit out , and was a-coming for me with both arms spread , he was so full of joy ; but when I glimpsed him in the lightning my heart shot up in my mouth and I went overboard backwards ; for I forgot he was old King Lear and a drownded A-rab all in one , and it most scared the livers and lights out of me .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 56]: But Jim fished me out , and was going to hug me and bless me , and so on , he was so glad I was back and we was shut of the king and the duke , but I says : `` Not now ; have it for breakfast , have it for breakfast !
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 8]: Cut loose and let her slide ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 37]: So in two seconds away we went a-sliding down the river , and it DID seem so good to be free again and all by ourselves on the big river , and nobody to bother us .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 67]: I had to skip around a bit , and jump up and crack my heels a few times -- I could n't help it ; but about the third crack I noticed a sound that I knowed mighty well , and held my breath and listened and waited ; and sure enough , when the next flash busted out over the water , here they come !
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 13]: -- and just a-laying to their oars and making their skiff hum !
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 8]: It was the king and the duke .
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 27]: So I wilted right down on to the planks then , and give up ; and it was all I could do to keep from crying .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXX .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 35]: WHEN they got aboard the king went for me , and shook me by the collar , and says : `` Tryin ' to give us the slip , was ye , you pup !
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 8]: Tired of our company , hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 21]: I says : `` No , your majesty , we war n't -- PLEASE do n't , your majesty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 25]: `` Quick , then , and tell us what WAS your idea , or I 'll shake the insides out o ' you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 16]: `` Honest , I 'll tell you everything just as it happened , your majesty .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 87]: The man that had a-holt of me was very good to me , and kept saying he had a boy about as big as me that died last year , and he was sorry to see a boy in such a dangerous fix ; and when they was all took by surprise by finding the gold , and made a rush for the coffin , he lets go of me and whispers , ` Heel it now , or they 'll hang ye , sure ! '
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 5]: and I lit out .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 31]: It did n't seem no good for ME to stay -- I could n't do nothing , and I did n't want to be hung if I could get away .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 77]: So I never stopped running till I found the canoe ; and when I got here I told Jim to hurry , or they 'd catch me and hang me yet , and said I was afeard you and the duke was n't alive now , and I was awful sorry , and so was Jim , and was awful glad when we see you coming ; you may ask Jim if I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 29]: Jim said it was so ; and the king told him to shut up , and said , `` Oh , yes , it 's MIGHTY likely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 15]: and shook me up again , and said he reckoned he 'd drownd me .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 14]: But the duke says : `` Leggo the boy , you old idiot !
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 7]: Would YOU a done any different ?
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 11]: Did you inquire around for HIM when you got loose ?
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 7]: I do n't remember it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 19]: So the king let go of me , and begun to cuss that town and everybody in it .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 30]: But the duke says : `` You better a blame ' sight give YOURSELF a good cussing , for you 're the one that 's entitled to it most .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 29]: You hai n't done a thing from the start that had any sense in it , except coming out so cool and cheeky with that imaginary blue-arrow mark .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 19]: That WAS bright -- it was right down bully ; and it was the thing that saved us .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 29]: For if it had n't been for that they 'd a jailed us till them Englishmen 's baggage come -- and then -- the penitentiary , you bet !
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 62]: But that trick took 'em to the graveyard , and the gold done us a still bigger kindness ; for if the excited fools had n't let go all holts and made that rush to get a look we 'd a slept in our cravats to-night -- cravats warranted to WEAR , too -- longer than WE 'D need 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 21]: They was still a minute -- thinking ; then the king says , kind of absent-minded like : `` Mf !
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 9]: And we reckoned the NIGGERS stole it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 5]: That made me squirm !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' says the duke , kinder slow and deliberate and sarcastic , `` WE did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 18]: After about a half a minute the king drawls out : `` Leastways , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 17]: The duke says , the same way : `` On the contrary , I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 25]: The king kind of ruffles up , and says : `` Looky here , Bilgewater , what ' r you referrin ' to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 28]: The duke says , pretty brisk : `` When it comes to that , maybe you 'll let me ask , what was YOU referring to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 29]: says the king , very sarcastic ; `` but I do n't know -- maybe you was asleep , and did n't know what you was about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 29]: The duke bristles up now , and says : `` Oh , let UP on this cussed nonsense ; do you take me for a blame ' fool ?
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 15]: Do n't you reckon I know who hid that money in that coffin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 5]: `` YES , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 13]: I know you DO know , because you done it yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 7]: `` It 's a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 8]: -- and the duke went for him .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 12]: The king sings out : `` Take y' r hands off !
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 5]: -- leggo my throat !
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 8]: -- I take it all back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 49]: The duke says : `` Well , you just own up , first , that you DID hide that money there , intending to give me the slip one of these days , and come back and dig it up , and have it all to yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 46]: `` Wait jest a minute , duke -- answer me this one question , honest and fair ; if you did n't put the money there , say it , and I 'll b ` lieve you , and take back everything I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 16]: `` You old scoundrel , I did n't , and you know I did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 5]: There , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 11]: `` Well , then , I b ` lieve you .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 32]: But answer me only jest this one more -- now DO N'T git mad ; did n't you have it in your mind to hook the money and hide it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 33]: The duke never said nothing for a little bit ; then he says : `` Well , I do n't care if I DID , I did n't DO it , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 18]: But you not only had it in mind to do it , but you DONE it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 18]: `` I wisht I never die if I done it , duke , and that 's honest .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 32]: I wo n't say I war n't goin ' to do it , because I WAS ; but you -- I mean somebody -- got in ahead o ' me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 6]: `` It 's a lie !
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 32]: You done it , and you got to SAY you done it , or -- '' The king began to gurgle , and then he gasps out : '' ` Nough !
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 6]: -- I OWN UP ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 24]: I was very glad to hear him say that ; it made me feel much more easier than what I was feeling before .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 22]: So the duke took his hands off and says : `` If you ever deny it again I 'll drown you .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 27]: It 's WELL for you to set there and blubber like a baby -- it 's fitten for you , after the way you 've acted .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 28]: I never see such an old ostrich for wanting to gobble everything -- and I a-trusting you all the time , like you was my own father .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 31]: You ought to been ashamed of yourself to stand by and hear it saddled on to a lot of poor niggers , and you never say a word for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 16]: It makes me feel ridiculous to think I was soft enough to BELIEVE that rubbage .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 43]: Cuss you , I can see now why you was so anxious to make up the deffisit -- you wanted to get what money I 'd got out of the Nonesuch and one thing or another , and scoop it ALL ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 31]: The king says , timid , and still a-snuffling : `` Why , duke , it was you that said make up the deffisit ; it war n't me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 4]: `` Dry up !
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 13]: I do n't want to hear no more out of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 4]: says the duke .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 11]: `` And NOW you see what you GOT by it .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 20]: They 've got all their own money back , and all of OURN but a shekel or two BESIDES .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 20]: G'long to bed , and do n't you deffersit ME no more deffersits , long 's YOU live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 60]: So the king sneaked into the wigwam and took to his bottle for comfort , and before long the duke tackled HIS bottle ; and so in about a half an hour they was as thick as thieves again , and the tighter they got the lovinger they got , and went off a-snoring in each other 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 29]: They both got powerful mellow , but I noticed the king did n't get mellow enough to forget to remember to not deny about hiding the money-bag again .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: That made me feel easy and satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 19]: Of course when they got to snoring we had a long gabble , and I told Jim everything .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXI .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 20]: WE das n't stop again at any town for days and days ; kept right along down the river .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 18]: We was down south in the warm weather now , and a mighty long ways from home .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 23]: We begun to come to trees with Spanish moss on them , hanging down from the limbs like long , gray beards .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 20]: It was the first I ever see it growing , and it made the woods look solemn and dismal .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 20]: So now the frauds reckoned they was out of danger , and they begun to work the villages again .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 22]: First they done a lecture on temperance ; but they did n't make enough for them both to get drunk on .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 42]: Then in another village they started a dancing-school ; but they did n't know no more how to dance than a kangaroo does ; so the first prance they made the general public jumped in and pranced them out of town .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 34]: Another time they tried to go at yellocution ; but they did n't yellocute long till the audience got up and give them a solid good cussing , and made them skip out .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 30]: They tackled missionarying , and mesmerizing , and doctoring , and telling fortunes , and a little of everything ; but they could n't seem to have no luck .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 44]: So at last they got just about dead broke , and laid around the raft as she floated along , thinking and thinking , and never saying nothing , by the half a day at a time , and dreadful blue and desperate .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 30]: And at last they took a change and begun to lay their heads together in the wigwam and talk low and confidential two or three hours at a time .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 6]: Jim and me got uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 9]: We did n't like the look of it .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 14]: We judged they was studying up some kind of worse deviltry than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 38]: We turned it over and over , and at last we made up our minds they was going to break into somebody 's house or store , or was going into the counterfeit-money business , or something .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 50]: So then we was pretty scared , and made up an agreement that we would n't have nothing in the world to do with such actions , and if we ever got the least show we would give them the cold shake and clear out and leave them behind .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 66]: Well , early one morning we hid the raft in a good , safe place about two mile below a little bit of a shabby village named Pikesville , and the king he went ashore and told us all to stay hid whilst he went up to town and smelt around to see if anybody had got any wind of the Royal Nonesuch there yet .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 54]: -LRB- `` House to rob , you MEAN , '' says I to myself ; `` and when you get through robbing it you 'll come back here and wonder what has become of me and Jim and the raft -- and you 'll have to take it out in wondering . '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 28]: And he said if he war n't back by midday the duke and me would know it was all right , and we was to come along .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 7]: So we stayed where we was .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 16]: The duke he fretted and sweated around , and was in a mighty sour way .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 24]: He scolded us for everything , and we could n't seem to do nothing right ; he found fault with every little thing .
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 6]: Something was a-brewing , sure .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 32]: I was good and glad when midday come and no king ; we could have a change , anyway -- and maybe a chance for THE change on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 75]: So me and the duke went up to the village , and hunted around there for the king , and by and by we found him in the back room of a little low doggery , very tight , and a lot of loafers bullyragging him for sport , and he a-cussing and a-threatening with all his might , and so tight he could n't walk , and could n't do nothing to them .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 79]: The duke he begun to abuse him for an old fool , and the king begun to sass back , and the minute they was fairly at it I lit out and shook the reefs out of my hind legs , and spun down the river road like a deer , for I see our chance ; and I made up my mind that it would be a long day before they ever see me and Jim again .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 25]: I got down there all out of breath but loaded up with joy , and sung out : `` Set her loose , Jim !
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 7]: we 're all right now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 15]: But there war n't no answer , and nobody come out of the wigwam .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 4]: Jim was gone !
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 41]: I set up a shout -- and then another -- and then another one ; and run this way and that in the woods , whooping and screeching ; but it war n't no use -- old Jim was gone .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 13]: Then I set down and cried ; I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 8]: But I could n't set still long .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 48]: Pretty soon I went out on the road , trying to think what I better do , and I run across a boy walking , and asked him if he 'd seen a strange nigger dressed so and so , and he says : `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 4]: `` Whereabouts ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 15]: says I. `` Down to Silas Phelps ' place , two mile below here .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 12]: He 's a runaway nigger , and they 've got him .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 7]: Was you looking for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 7]: `` You bet I ai n't !
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 44]: I run across him in the woods about an hour or two ago , and he said if I hollered he 'd cut my livers out -- and told me to lay down and stay where I was ; and I done it .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 11]: Been there ever since ; afeard to come out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 22]: `` Well , '' he says , `` you need n't be afeard no more , becuz they 've got him .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 13]: He run off f 'm down South , som ` ers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 11]: `` It 's a good job they got him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 6]: `` Well , I RECKON !
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 9]: There 's two hunderd dollars reward on him .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 12]: It 's like picking up money out 'n the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 24]: `` Yes , it is -- and I could a had it if I 'd been big enough ; I see him FIRST .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 5]: Who nailed him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 36]: `` It was an old fellow -- a stranger -- and he sold out his chance in him for forty dollars , becuz he 's got to go up the river and ca n't wait .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 7]: Think o ' that , now !
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 13]: You bet I 'D wait , if it was seven year . ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 32]: `` That 's me , every time , '' says I. `` But maybe his chance ai n't worth no more than that , if he 'll sell it so cheap .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 11]: Maybe there 's something ai n't straight about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 12]: `` But it IS , though -- straight as a string .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 6]: I see the handbill myself .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 27]: It tells all about him , to a dot -- paints him like a picture , and tells the plantation he 's frum , below NewrLEANS .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 16]: No-sirree-BOB , they ai n't no trouble ` bout THAT speculation , you bet you .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 13]: Say , gim me a chaw tobacker , wo n't ye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 10]: I did n't have none , so he left .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 15]: I went to the raft , and set down in the wigwam to think .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 8]: But I could n't come to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 21]: I thought till I wore my head sore , but I could n't see no way out of the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 67]: After all this long journey , and after all we 'd done for them scoundrels , here it was all come to nothing , everything all busted up and ruined , because they could have the heart to serve Jim such a trick as that , and make him a slave again all his life , and amongst strangers , too , for forty dirty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 58]: Once I said to myself it would be a thousand times better for Jim to be a slave at home where his family was , as long as he 'd GOT to be a slave , and so I 'd better write a letter to Tom Sawyer and tell him to tell Miss Watson where he was .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 71]: But I soon give up that notion for two things : she 'd be mad and disgusted at his rascality and ungratefulness for leaving her , and so she 'd sell him straight down the river again ; and if she did n't , everybody naturally despises an ungrateful nigger , and they 'd make Jim feel it all the time , and so he 'd feel ornery and disgraced .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 6]: And then think of ME !
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 42]: It would get all around that Huck Finn helped a nigger to get his freedom ; and if I was ever to see anybody from that town again I 'd be ready to get down and lick his boots for shame .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 26]: That 's just the way : a person does a low-down thing , and then he do n't want to take no consequences of it .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 15]: Thinks as long as he can hide it , it ai n't no disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 6]: That was my fix exactly .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 28]: The more I studied about this the more my conscience went to grinding me , and the more wicked and low-down and ornery I got to feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 108]: And at last , when it hit me all of a sudden that here was the plain hand of Providence slapping me in the face and letting me know my wickedness was being watched all the time from up there in heaven , whilst I was stealing a poor old woman 's nigger that had n't ever done me no harm , and now was showing me there 's One that 's always on the lookout , and ai n't a-going to allow no such miserable doings to go only just so fur and no further , I most dropped in my tracks I was so scared .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 86]: Well , I tried the best I could to kinder soften it up somehow for myself by saying I was brung up wicked , and so I war n't so much to blame ; but something inside of me kept saying , `` There was the Sunday-school , you could a gone to it ; and if you 'd a done it they 'd a learnt you there that people that acts as I 'd been acting about that nigger goes to everlasting fire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 5]: It made me shiver .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 31]: And I about made up my mind to pray , and see if I could n't try to quit being the kind of a boy I was and be better .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: So I kneeled down .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 7]: But the words would n't come .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 5]: Why would n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 13]: It war n't no use to try and hide it from Him .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 6]: Nor from ME , neither .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 10]: I knowed very well why they would n't come .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 25]: It was because my heart war n't right ; it was because I war n't square ; it was because I was playing double .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 25]: I was letting ON to give up sin , but away inside of me I was holding on to the biggest one of all .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 51]: I was trying to make my mouth SAY I would do the right thing and the clean thing , and go and write to that nigger 's owner and tell where he was ; but deep down in me I knowed it was a lie , and He knowed it .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 12]: You ca n't pray a lie -- I found that out .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 21]: So I was full of trouble , full as I could be ; and did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 27]: At last I had an idea ; and I says , I 'll go and write the letter -- and then see if I can pray .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 25]: Why , it was astonishing , the way I felt as light as a feather right straight off , and my troubles all gone .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 56]: So I got a piece of paper and a pencil , all glad and excited , and set down and wrote : Miss Watson , your runaway nigger Jim is down here two mile below Pikesville , and Mr. Phelps has got him and he will give him up for the reward if you send .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 3]: HUCK FINN .
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 30]: I felt good and all washed clean of sin for the first time I had ever felt so in my life , and I knowed I could pray now .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 42]: But I did n't do it straight off , but laid the paper down and set there thinking -- thinking how good it was all this happened so , and how near I come to being lost and going to hell .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 5]: And went on thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 46]: And got to thinking over our trip down the river ; and I see Jim before me all the time : in the day and in the night-time , sometimes moonlight , sometimes storms , and we a-floating along , talking and singing and laughing .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 22]: But somehow I could n't seem to strike no places to harden me against him , but only the other kind .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 153]: I 'd see him standing my watch on top of his ` n , ` stead of calling me , so I could go on sleeping ; and see him how glad he was when I come back out of the fog ; and when I come to him again in the swamp , up there where the feud was ; and such-like times ; and would always call me honey , and pet me and do everything he could think of for me , and how good he always was ; and at last I struck the time I saved him by telling the men we had small-pox aboard , and he was so grateful , and said I was the best friend old Jim ever had in the world , and the ONLY one he 's got now ; and then I happened to look around and see that paper .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 6]: It was a close place .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 12]: I took it up , and held it in my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 22]: I was a-trembling , because I 'd got to decide , forever , betwixt two things , and I knowed it .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 35]: I studied a minute , sort of holding my breath , and then says to myself : `` All right , then , I 'll GO to hell '' -- and tore it up .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 13]: It was awful thoughts and awful words , but they was said .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 15]: And I let them stay said ; and never thought no more about reforming .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 37]: I shoved the whole thing out of my head , and said I would take up wickedness again , which was in my line , being brung up to it , and the other war n't .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 55]: And for a starter I would go to work and steal Jim out of slavery again ; and if I could think up anything worse , I would do that , too ; because as long as I was in , and in for good , I might as well go the whole hog .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 34]: Then I set to thinking over how to get at it , and turned over some considerable many ways in my mind ; and at last fixed up a plan that suited me .
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 47]: So then I took the bearings of a woody island that was down the river a piece , and as soon as it was fairly dark I crept out with my raft and went for it , and hid it there , and then turned in .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 49]: I slept the night through , and got up before it was light , and had my breakfast , and put on my store clothes , and tied up some others and one thing or another in a bundle , and took the canoe and cleared for shore .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 64]: I landed below where I judged was Phelps 's place , and hid my bundle in the woods , and then filled up the canoe with water , and loaded rocks into her and sunk her where I could find her again when I wanted her , about a quarter of a mile below a little steam sawmill that was on the bank .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 62]: Then I struck up the road , and when I passed the mill I see a sign on it , `` Phelps 's Sawmill , '' and when I come to the farm-houses , two or three hundred yards further along , I kept my eyes peeled , but did n't see nobody around , though it was good daylight now .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 28]: But I did n't mind , because I did n't want to see nobody just yet -- I only wanted to get the lay of the land .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 20]: According to my plan , I was going to turn up there from the village , not from below .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 15]: So I just took a look , and shoved along , straight for town .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 16]: Well , the very first man I see when I got there was the duke .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 19]: He was sticking up a bill for the Royal Nonesuch -- three-night performance -- like that other time .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 8]: They had the cheek , them frauds !
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 10]: I was right on him before I could shirk .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 10]: He looked astonished , and says : `` Hel-LO !
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 7]: Where 'd YOU come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 16]: Then he says , kind of glad and eager , `` Where 's the raft ?
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 9]: -- got her in a good place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 19]: I says : `` Why , that 's just what I was going to ask your grace . ''
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 21]: Then he did n't look so joyful , and says : `` What was your idea for asking ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 50]: `` Well , '' I says , `` when I see the king in that doggery yesterday I says to myself , we ca n't get him home for hours , till he 's soberer ; so I went a-loafing around town to put in the time and wait .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 75]: A man up and offered me ten cents to help him pull a skiff over the river and back to fetch a sheep , and so I went along ; but when we was dragging him to the boat , and the man left me a-holt of the rope and went behind him to shove him along , he was too strong for me and jerked loose and run , and we after him .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 24]: We did n't have no dog , and so we had to chase him all over the country till we tired him out .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 21]: We never got him till dark ; then we fetched him over , and I started down for the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 82]: When I got there and see it was gone , I says to myself , ` They 've got into trouble and had to leave ; and they 've took my nigger , which is the only nigger I 've got in the world , and now I 'm in a strange country , and ai n't got no property no more , nor nothing , and no way to make my living ; ' so I set down and cried .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 8]: I slept in the woods all night .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 10]: But what DID become of the raft , then ?
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 8]: -- and Jim -- poor Jim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 16]: `` Blamed if I know -- that is , what 's become of the raft .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 78]: That old fool had made a trade and got forty dollars , and when we found him in the doggery the loafers had matched half-dollars with him and got every cent but what he 'd spent for whisky ; and when I got him home late last night and found the raft gone , we said , ` That little rascal has stole our raft and shook us , and run off down the river . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 11]: `` I would n't shake my NIGGER , would I ?
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 16]: -- the only nigger I had in the world , and the only property . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 7]: `` We never thought of that .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 31]: Fact is , I reckon we 'd come to consider him OUR nigger ; yes , we did consider him so -- goodness knows we had trouble enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 28]: So when we see the raft was gone and we flat broke , there war n't anything for it but to try the Royal Nonesuch another shake .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 13]: And I 've pegged along ever since , dry as a powder-horn .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 6]: Where 's that ten cents ?
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 5]: Give it here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 48]: I had considerable money , so I give him ten cents , but begged him to spend it for something to eat , and give me some , because it was all the money I had , and I had n't had nothing to eat since yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 5]: He never said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 21]: The next minute he whirls on me and says : `` Do you reckon that nigger would blow on us ?
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 10]: We 'd skin him if he done that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 6]: `` How can he blow ?
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 7]: Hai n't he run off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 19]: That old fool sold him , and never divided with me , and the money 's gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 5]: `` SOLD him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 22]: I says , and begun to cry ; `` why , he was MY nigger , and that was my money .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 7]: -- I want my nigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 20]: `` Well , you ca n't GET your nigger , that 's all -- so dry up your blubbering .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 14]: Looky here -- do you think YOU 'D venture to blow on us ?
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 9]: Blamed if I think I 'd trust you .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 29]: Why , if you WAS to blow on us -- '' He stopped , but I never see the duke look so ugly out of his eyes before .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 30]: I went on a-whimpering , and says : `` I do n't want to blow on nobody ; and I ai n't got no time to blow , nohow .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 11]: I got to turn out and find my nigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 24]: He looked kinder bothered , and stood there with his bills fluttering on his arm , thinking , and wrinkling up his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 12]: At last he says : `` I 'll tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 8]: We got to be here three days .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 27]: If you 'll promise you wo n't blow , and wo n't let the nigger blow , I 'll tell you where to find him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 24]: So I promised , and he says : `` A farmer by the name of Silas Ph -- '' and then he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 34]: You see , he started to tell me the truth ; but when he stopped that way , and begun to study and think again , I reckoned he was changing his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 5]: And so he was .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 23]: He would n't trust me ; he wanted to make sure of having me out of the way the whole three days .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 39]: So pretty soon he says : `` The man that bought him is named Abram Foster -- Abram G. Foster -- and he lives forty mile back here in the country , on the road to Lafayette . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 17]: `` All right , '' I says , `` I can walk it in three days .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 9]: And I 'll start this very afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 30]: `` No you wont , you 'll start NOW ; and do n't you lose any time about it , neither , nor do any gabbling by the way .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 28]: Just keep a tight tongue in your head and move right along , and then you wo n't get into trouble with US , d'ye hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 16]: That was the order I wanted , and that was the one I played for .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 11]: I wanted to be left free to work my plans .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 21]: `` So clear out , '' he says ; `` and you can tell Mr. Foster whatever you want to .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 31]: Maybe you can get him to believe that Jim IS your nigger -- some idiots do n't require documents -- leastways I 've heard there 's such down South here .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 32]: And when you tell him the handbill and the reward 's bogus , maybe he 'll believe you when you explain to him what the idea was for getting 'em out .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 28]: Go ` long now , and tell him anything you want to ; but mind you do n't work your jaw any BETWEEN here and there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 11]: So I left , and struck for the back country .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 16]: I did n't look around , but I kinder felt like he was watching me .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 11]: But I knowed I could tire him out at that .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 27]: I went straight out in the country as much as a mile before I stopped ; then I doubled back through the woods towards Phelps ' .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 30]: I reckoned I better start in on my plan straight off without fooling around , because I wanted to stop Jim 's mouth till these fellows could get away .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 10]: I did n't want no trouble with their kind .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 19]: I 'd seen all I wanted to of them , and wanted to get entirely shut of them .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXII .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 98]: WHEN I got there it was all still and Sunday-like , and hot and sunshiny ; the hands was gone to the fields ; and there was them kind of faint dronings of bugs and flies in the air that makes it seem so lonesome and like everybody 's dead and gone ; and if a breeze fans along and quivers the leaves it makes you feel mournful , because you feel like it 's spirits whispering -- spirits that 's been dead ever so many years -- and you always think they 're talking about YOU .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 21]: As a general thing it makes a body wish HE was dead , too , and done with it all .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 17]: Phelps ' was one of these little one-horse cotton plantations , and they all look alike .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 259]: A rail fence round a two-acre yard ; a stile made out of logs sawed off and up-ended in steps , like barrels of a different length , to climb over the fence with , and for the women to stand on when they are going to jump on to a horse ; some sickly grass-patches in the big yard , but mostly it was bare and smooth , like an old hat with the nap rubbed off ; big double log-house for the white folks -- hewed logs , with the chinks stopped up with mud or mortar , and these mud-stripes been whitewashed some time or another ; round-log kitchen , with a big broad , open but roofed passage joining it to the house ; log smoke-house back of the kitchen ; three little log nigger-cabins in a row t ` other side the smoke-house ; one little hut all by itself away down against the back fence , and some outbuildings down a piece the other side ; ash-hopper and big kettle to bile soap in by the little hut ; bench by the kitchen door , with bucket of water and a gourd ; hound asleep there in the sun ; more hounds asleep round about ; about three shade trees away off in a corner ; some currant bushes and gooseberry bushes in one place by the fence ; outside of the fence a garden and a watermelon patch ; then the cotton fields begins , and after the fields the woods .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 19]: I went around and clumb over the back stile by the ash-hopper , and started for the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 46]: When I got a little ways I heard the dim hum of a spinning-wheel wailing along up and sinking along down again ; and then I knowed for certain I wished I was dead -- for that IS the lonesomest sound in the whole world .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 51]: I went right along , not fixing up any particular plan , but just trusting to Providence to put the right words in my mouth when the time come ; for I 'd noticed that Providence always did put the right words in my mouth if I left it alone .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 31]: When I got half-way , first one hound and then another got up and went for me , and of course I stopped and faced them , and kept still .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: And such another powwow as they made !
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 69]: In a quarter of a minute I was a kind of a hub of a wheel , as you may say -- spokes made out of dogs -- circle of fifteen of them packed together around me , with their necks and noses stretched up towards me , a-barking and howling ; and more a-coming ; you could see them sailing over fences and around corners from everywheres .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 24]: A nigger woman come tearing out of the kitchen with a rolling-pin in her hand , singing out , `` Begone YOU Tige !
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 3]: you Spot !
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 4]: begone sah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 45]: and she fetched first one and then another of them a clip and sent them howling , and then the rest followed ; and the next second half of them come back , wagging their tails around me , and making friends with me .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 11]: There ai n't no harm in a hound , nohow .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 48]: And behind the woman comes a little nigger girl and two little nigger boys without anything on but tow-linen shirts , and they hung on to their mother 's gown , and peeped out from behind her at me , bashful , the way they always do .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 46]: And here comes the white woman running from the house , about forty-five or fifty year old , bareheaded , and her spinning-stick in her hand ; and behind her comes her little white children , acting the same way the little niggers was doing .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 22]: She was smiling all over so she could hardly stand -- and says : `` It 's YOU , at last !
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 6]: -- AI N'T it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 12]: I out with a `` Yes 'm '' before I thought .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 83]: She grabbed me and hugged me tight ; and then gripped me by both hands and shook and shook ; and the tears come in her eyes , and run down over ; and she could n't seem to hug and shake enough , and kept saying , `` You do n't look as much like your mother as I reckoned you would ; but law sakes , I do n't care for that , I 'm so glad to see you !
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 14]: Dear , dear , it does seem like I could eat you up !
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 8]: Children , it 's your cousin Tom !
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 6]: -- tell him howdy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 19]: But they ducked their heads , and put their fingers in their mouths , and hid behind her .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 30]: So she run on : `` Lize , hurry up and get him a hot breakfast right away -- or did you get your breakfast on the boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 10]: I said I had got it on the boat .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 20]: So then she started for the house , leading me by the hand , and the children tagging after .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 77]: When we got there she set me down in a split-bottomed chair , and set herself down on a little low stool in front of me , holding both of my hands , and says : `` Now I can have a GOOD look at you ; and , laws-a-me , I 've been hungry for it a many and a many a time , all these long years , and it 's come at last !
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 11]: We been expecting you a couple of days and more .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 5]: What kep ' you ?
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 6]: -- boat get aground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 18]: `` Yes 'm -- she -- '' `` Do n't say yes 'm -- say Aunt Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 7]: Where 'd she get aground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 26]: I did n't rightly know what to say , because I did n't know whether the boat would be coming up the river or down .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 24]: But I go a good deal on instinct ; and my instinct said she would be coming up -- from down towards Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 22]: That did n't help me much , though ; for I did n't know the names of bars down that way .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 52]: I see I 'd got to invent a bar , or forget the name of the one we got aground on -- or -- Now I struck an idea , and fetched it out : `` It war n't the grounding -- that did n't keep us back but a little .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 7]: We blowed out a cylinder-head . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 4]: `` Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 4]: anybody hurt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 4]: `` No 'm .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 5]: Killed a nigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 14]: `` Well , it 's lucky ; because sometimes people do get hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 30]: Two years ago last Christmas your uncle Silas was coming up from Newrleans on the old Lally Rook , and she blowed out a cylinder-head and crippled a man .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 7]: And I think he died afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 5]: He was a Baptist .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 16]: Your uncle Silas knowed a family in Baton Rouge that knowed his people very well .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 10]: Yes , I remember now , he DID die .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 11]: Mortification set in , and they had to amputate him .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 7]: But it did n't save him .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 10]: Yes , it was mortification -- that was it .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 16]: He turned blue all over , and died in the hope of a glorious resurrection .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 10]: They say he was a sight to look at .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 14]: Your uncle 's been up to the town every day to fetch you .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 21]: And he 's gone again , not more 'n an hour ago ; he 'll be back any minute now .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 13]: You must a met him on the road , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 20]: -- oldish man , with a -- '' `` No , I did n't see nobody , Aunt Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 51]: The boat landed just at daylight , and I left my baggage on the wharf-boat and went looking around the town and out a piece in the country , to put in the time and not get here too soon ; and so I come down the back way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 10]: `` Who 'd you give the baggage to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 4]: `` Nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 11]: `` Why , child , it 'll be stole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 16]: `` Not where I hid it I reckon it wo n't , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 14]: `` How 'd you get your breakfast so early on the boat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 53]: It was kinder thin ice , but I says : `` The captain see me standing around , and told me I better have something to eat before I went ashore ; so he took me in the texas to the officers ' lunch , and give me all I wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 11]: I was getting so uneasy I could n't listen good .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 33]: I had my mind on the children all the time ; I wanted to get them out to one side and pump them a little , and find out who I was .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 18]: But I could n't get no show , Mrs. Phelps kept it up and run on so .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 43]: Pretty soon she made the cold chills streak all down my back , because she says : `` But here we 're a-running on this way , and you hai n't told me a word about Sis , nor any of them .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 61]: Now I 'll rest my works a little , and you start up yourn ; just tell me EVERYTHING -- tell me all about 'm all every one of 'm ; and how they are , and what they 're doing , and what they told you to tell me ; and every last thing you can think of . ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 15]: Well , I see I was up a stump -- and up it good .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 19]: Providence had stood by me this fur all right , but I was hard and tight aground now .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 24]: I see it war n't a bit of use to try to go ahead -- I 'd got to throw up my hand .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 18]: So I says to myself , here 's another place where I got to resk the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 27]: I opened my mouth to begin ; but she grabbed me and hustled me in behind the bed , and says : `` Here he comes !
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 19]: Stick your head down lower -- there , that 'll do ; you ca n't be seen now .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 9]: Do n't you let on you 're here .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 8]: I 'll play a joke on him .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 10]: Children , do n't you say a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 9]: I see I was in a fix now .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 34]: But it war n't no use to worry ; there war n't nothing to do but just hold still , and try and be ready to stand from under when the lightning struck .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 21]: I had just one little glimpse of the old gentleman when he come in ; then the bed hid him .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 16]: Mrs. Phelps she jumps for him , and says : `` Has he come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 8]: `` No , '' says her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 5]: `` Good-NESS gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 15]: she says , `` what in the warld can have become of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 24]: `` I ca n't imagine , '' says the old gentleman ; `` and I must say it makes me dreadful uneasy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 4]: `` Uneasy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 11]: she says ; `` I 'm ready to go distracted !
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 14]: He MUST a come ; and you 've missed him along the road .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 12]: I KNOW it 's so -- something tells me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 19]: `` Why , Sally , I COULD N'T miss him along the road -- YOU know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 13]: `` But oh , dear , dear , what WILL Sis say !
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 5]: He must a come !
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 6]: You must a missed him .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 18]: He -- '' `` Oh , do n't distress me any more 'n I 'm already distressed .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 13]: I do n't know what in the world to make of it .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 22]: I 'm at my wit 's end , and I do n't mind acknowledging ' t I 'm right down scared .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 20]: But there 's no hope that he 's come ; for he COULD N'T come and me miss him .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 19]: Sally , it 's terrible -- just terrible -- something 's happened to the boat , sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 5]: `` Why , Silas !
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 3]: Look yonder !
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 5]: -- up the road !
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 8]: -- ai n't that somebody coming ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 22]: He sprung to the window at the head of the bed , and that give Mrs. Phelps the chance she wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 50]: She stooped down quick at the foot of the bed and give me a pull , and out I come ; and when he turned back from the window there she stood , a-beaming and a-smiling like a house afire , and I standing pretty meek and sweaty alongside .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 16]: The old gentleman stared , and says : `` Why , who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 10]: `` Who do you reckon ' t is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 7]: `` I hai n't no idea .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 5]: Who IS it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 7]: `` It 's TOM SAWYER ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 10]: By jings , I most slumped through the floor !
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 63]: But there war n't no time to swap knives ; the old man grabbed me by the hand and shook , and kept on shaking ; and all the time how the woman did dance around and laugh and cry ; and then how they both did fire off questions about Sid , and Mary , and the rest of the tribe .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 34]: But if they was joyful , it war n't nothing to what I was ; for it was like being born again , I was so glad to find out who I was .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 52]: Well , they froze to me for two hours ; and at last , when my chin was so tired it could n't hardly go any more , I had told them more about my family -- I mean the Sawyer family -- than ever happened to any six Sawyer families .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 28]: And I explained all about how we blowed out a cylinder-head at the mouth of White River , and it took us three days to fix it .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 25]: Which was all right , and worked first-rate ; because THEY did n't know but what it would take three days to fix it .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 16]: If I 'd a called it a bolthead it would a done just as well .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 19]: Now I was feeling pretty comfortable all down one side , and pretty uncomfortable all up the other .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 28]: Being Tom Sawyer was easy and comfortable , and it stayed easy and comfortable till by and by I hear a steamboat coughing along down the river .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 17]: Then I says to myself , s ` pose Tom Sawyer comes down on that boat ?
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 27]: And s ` pose he steps in here any minute , and sings out my name before I can throw him a wink to keep quiet ?
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 17]: Well , I could n't HAVE it that way ; it would n't do at all .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 10]: I must go up the road and waylay him .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 20]: So I told the folks I reckoned I would go up to the town and fetch down my baggage .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 34]: The old gentleman was for going along with me , but I said no , I could drive the horse myself , and I druther he would n't take no trouble about me .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIII .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 38]: SO I started for town in the wagon , and when I was half-way I see a wagon coming , and sure enough it was Tom Sawyer , and I stopped and waited till he come along .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 7]: I says `` Hold on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 49]: and it stopped alongside , and his mouth opened up like a trunk , and stayed so ; and he swallowed two or three times like a person that 's got a dry throat , and then says : `` I hai n't ever done you no harm .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 4]: You know that .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 18]: So , then , what you want to come back and ha ` nt ME for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 17]: I says : `` I hai n't come back -- I hai n't been GONE . ''
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 19]: When he heard my voice it righted him up some , but he war n't quite satisfied yet .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 19]: He says : `` Do n't you play nothing on me , because I would n't on you .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 11]: Honest injun now , you ai n't a ghost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 12]: `` Honest injun , I ai n't , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 30]: `` Well -- I -- I -- well , that ought to settle it , of course ; but I ca n't somehow seem to understand it no way .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 12]: Looky here , war n't you ever murdered AT ALL ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 14]: I war n't ever murdered at all -- I played it on them .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 16]: You come in here and feel of me if you do n't believe me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 27]: So he done it ; and it satisfied him ; and he was that glad to see me again he did n't know what to do .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 30]: And he wanted to know all about it right off , because it was a grand adventure , and mysterious , and so it hit him where he lived .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 49]: But I said , leave it alone till by and by ; and told his driver to wait , and we drove off a little piece , and I told him the kind of a fix I was in , and what did he reckon we better do ?
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 15]: He said , let him alone a minute , and do n't disturb him .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 23]: So he thought and thought , and pretty soon he says : `` It 's all right ; I 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 80]: Take my trunk in your wagon , and let on it 's your ` n ; and you turn back and fool along slow , so as to get to the house about the time you ought to ; and I 'll go towards town a piece , and take a fresh start , and get there a quarter or a half an hour after you ; and you need n't let on to know me at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 12]: I says : `` All right ; but wait a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 16]: There 's one more thing -- a thing that NOBODY do n't know but me .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 32]: And that is , there 's a nigger here that I 'm a-trying to steal out of slavery , and his name is JIM -- old Miss Watson 's Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 6]: He says : `` What !
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 13]: Why , Jim is -- '' He stopped and went to studying .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 11]: I says : `` I know what you 'll say .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 16]: You 'll say it 's dirty , low-down business ; but what if it is ?
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 24]: I 'm low down ; and I 'm a-going to steal him , and I want you keep mum and not let on .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 4]: Will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 18]: His eye lit up , and he says : `` I 'll HELP you steal him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 14]: Well , I let go all holts then , like I was shot .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 24]: It was the most astonishing speech I ever heard -- and I 'm bound to say Tom Sawyer fell considerable in my estimation .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 7]: Only I could n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 5]: Tom Sawyer a NIGGER-STEALER !
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 6]: `` Oh , shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 9]: I says ; `` you 're joking . ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 9]: `` I ai n't joking , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 49]: `` Well , then , '' I says , `` joking or no joking , if you hear anything said about a runaway nigger , do n't forget to remember that YOU do n't know nothing about him , and I do n't know nothing about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 23]: Then we took the trunk and put it in my wagon , and he drove off his way and I drove mine .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 34]: But of course I forgot all about driving slow on accounts of being glad and full of thinking ; so I got home a heap too quick for that length of a trip .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 19]: The old gentleman was at the door , and he says : `` Why , this is wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 13]: Whoever would a thought it was in that mare to do it ?
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 8]: I wish we 'd a timed her .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 12]: And she hai n't sweated a hair -- not a hair .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 4]: It 's wonderful .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 41]: Why , I would n't take a hundred dollars for that horse now -- I would n't , honest ; and yet I 'd a sold her for fifteen before , and thought 't was all she was worth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 6]: That 's all he said .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 12]: He was the innocentest , best old soul I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 67]: But it war n't surprising ; because he war n't only just a farmer , he was a preacher , too , and had a little one-horse log church down back of the plantation , which he built it himself at his own expense , for a church and schoolhouse , and never charged nothing for his preaching , and it was worth it , too .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 17]: There was plenty other farmer-preachers like that , and done the same way , down South .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 44]: In about half an hour Tom 's wagon drove up to the front stile , and Aunt Sally she see it through the window , because it was only about fifty yards , and says : `` Why , there 's somebody come !
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: I wonder who 't is ?
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 10]: Why , I do believe it 's a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 24]: Jimmy '' -LRB- that 's one of the children -RRB- `` run and tell Lize to put on another plate for dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 38]: Everybody made a rush for the front door , because , of course , a stranger do n't come EVERY year , and so he lays over the yaller-fever , for interest , when he does come .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 32]: Tom was over the stile and starting for the house ; the wagon was spinning up the road for the village , and we was all bunched in the front door .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 20]: Tom had his store clothes on , and an audience -- and that was always nuts for Tom Sawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 21]: In them circumstances it war n't no trouble to him to throw in an amount of style that was suitable .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 28]: He war n't a boy to meeky along up that yard like a sheep ; no , he come ca 'm and important , like the ram .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 51]: When he got a-front of us he lifts his hat ever so gracious and dainty , like it was the lid of a box that had butterflies asleep in it and he did n't want to disturb them , and says : `` Mr. Archibald Nichols , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 38]: `` No , my boy , '' says the old gentleman , `` I 'm sorry to say ' t your driver has deceived you ; Nichols 's place is down a matter of three mile more .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 7]: Come in , come in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 24]: Tom he took a look back over his shoulder , and says , `` Too late -- he 's out of sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 37]: `` Yes , he 's gone , my son , and you must come in and eat your dinner with us ; and then we 'll hitch up and take you down to Nichols 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 19]: `` Oh , I CA N'T make you so much trouble ; I could n't think of it .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 12]: I 'll walk -- I do n't mind the distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 19]: `` But we wo n't LET you walk -- it would n't be Southern hospitality to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 5]: Come right in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 28]: `` Oh , DO , '' says Aunt Sally ; `` it ai n't a bit of trouble to us , not a bit in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 4]: You must stay .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 17]: It 's a long , dusty three mile , and we ca n't let you walk .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 27]: And , besides , I 've already told 'em to put on another plate when I see you coming ; so you must n't disappoint us .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 10]: Come right in and make yourself at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 49]: So Tom he thanked them very hearty and handsome , and let himself be persuaded , and come in ; and when he was in he said he was a stranger from Hicksville , Ohio , and his name was William Thompson -- and he made another bow .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 106]: Well , he run on , and on , and on , making up stuff about Hicksville and everybody in it he could invent , and I getting a little nervious , and wondering how this was going to help me out of my scrape ; and at last , still talking along , he reached over and kissed Aunt Sally right on the mouth , and then settled back again in his chair comfortable , and was going on talking ; but she jumped up and wiped it off with the back of her hand , and says : `` You owdacious puppy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 21]: He looked kind of hurt , and says : `` I 'm surprised at you , m ` am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 16]: `` You 're s ` rp -- Why , what do you reckon I am ?
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 20]: I 've a good notion to take and -- Say , what do you mean by kissing me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 20]: He looked kind of humble , and says : `` I did n't mean nothing , m ` am .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 7]: I did n't mean no harm .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 11]: I -- I -- thought you 'd like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 8]: `` Why , you born fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 27]: She took up the spinning stick , and it looked like it was all she could do to keep from giving him a crack with it .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 11]: `` What made you think I 'd like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 8]: `` Well , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 12]: Only , they -- they -- told me you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 7]: `` THEY told you I would .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 7]: Whoever told you 's ANOTHER lunatic .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 8]: I never heard the beat of it .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 5]: Who 's THEY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 5]: `` Why , everybody .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 10]: They all said so , m ` am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 37]: It was all she could do to hold in ; and her eyes snapped , and her fingers worked like she wanted to scratch him ; and she says : `` Who 's ` everybody ' ?
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 14]: Out with their names , or ther 'll be an idiot short . ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 27]: He got up and looked distressed , and fumbled his hat , and says : `` I 'm sorry , and I war n't expecting it .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 5]: They told me to .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 6]: They all told me to .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 14]: They all said , kiss her ; and said she 'd like it .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 10]: They all said it -- every one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 25]: But I 'm sorry , m ` am , and I wo n't do it no more -- I wo n't , honest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 9]: `` You wo n't , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 11]: Well , I sh 'd RECKON you wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 24]: `` No 'm , I 'm honest about it ; I wo n't ever do it again -- till you ask me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 6]: `` Till I ASK you !
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 14]: Well , I never see the beat of it in my born days !
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 22]: I lay you 'll be the Methusalem-numskull of creation before ever I ask you -- or the likes of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 14]: `` Well , '' he says , `` it does surprise me so .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 9]: I ca n't make it out , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 11]: They said you would , and I thought you would .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 50]: But -- '' He stopped and looked around slow , like he wished he could run across a friendly eye somewheres , and fetched up on the old gentleman 's , and says , `` Did n't YOU think she 'd like me to kiss her , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 22]: `` Why , no ; I -- I -- well , no , I b ` lieve I did n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 42]: Then he looks on around the same way to me , and says : `` Tom , did n't YOU think Aunt Sally 'd open out her arms and say , ` Sid Sawyer -- ' '' `` My land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 51]: she says , breaking in and jumping for him , `` you impudent young rascal , to fool a body so -- '' and was going to hug him , but he fended her off , and says : `` No , not till you 've asked me first . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 40]: So she did n't lose no time , but asked him ; and hugged him and kissed him over and over again , and then turned him over to the old man , and he took what was left .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 24]: And after they got a little quiet again she says : `` Why , dear me , I never see such a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 13]: We war n't looking for YOU at all , but only Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 12]: Sis never wrote to me about anybody coming but him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 88]: `` It 's because it war n't INTENDED for any of us to come but Tom , '' he says ; `` but I begged and begged , and at the last minute she let me come , too ; so , coming down the river , me and Tom thought it would be a first-rate surprise for him to come here to the house first , and for me to by and by tag along and drop in , and let on to be a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 9]: But it was a mistake , Aunt Sally .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 13]: This ai n't no healthy place for a stranger to come . ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 9]: `` No -- not impudent whelps , Sid .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 22]: You ought to had your jaws boxed ; I hai n't been so put out since I do n't know when .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 28]: But I do n't care , I do n't mind the terms -- I 'd be willing to stand a thousand such jokes to have you here .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 8]: Well , to think of that performance !
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 20]: I do n't deny it , I was most putrified with astonishment when you give me that smack . ''
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 66]: We had dinner out in that broad open passage betwixt the house and the kitchen ; and there was things enough on that table for seven families -- and all hot , too ; none of your flabby , tough meat that 's laid in a cupboard in a damp cellar all night and tastes like a hunk of old cold cannibal in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 42]: Uncle Silas he asked a pretty long blessing over it , but it was worth it ; and it did n't cool it a bit , neither , the way I 've seen them kind of interruptions do lots of times .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 55]: There was a considerable good deal of talk all the afternoon , and me and Tom was on the lookout all the time ; but it war n't no use , they did n't happen to say nothing about any runaway nigger , and we was afraid to try to work up to it .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 30]: But at supper , at night , one of the little boys says : `` Pa , may n't Tom and Sid and me go to the show ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 69]: `` No , '' says the old man , `` I reckon there ai n't going to be any ; and you could n't go if there was ; because the runaway nigger told Burton and me all about that scandalous show , and Burton said he would tell the people ; so I reckon they 've drove the owdacious loafers out of town before this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 5]: So there it was !
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: -- but I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 84]: Tom and me was to sleep in the same room and bed ; so , being tired , we bid good-night and went up to bed right after supper , and clumb out of the window and down the lightning-rod , and shoved for the town ; for I did n't believe anybody was going to give the king and the duke a hint , and so if I did n't hurry up and give them one they 'd get into trouble sure .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 195]: On the road Tom he told me all about how it was reckoned I was murdered , and how pap disappeared pretty soon , and did n't come back no more , and what a stir there was when Jim run away ; and I told Tom all about our Royal Nonesuch rapscallions , and as much of the raft voyage as I had time to ; and as we struck into the town and up through the middle of it -- it was as much as half-after eight , then -- here comes a raging rush of people with torches , and an awful whooping and yelling , and banging tin pans and blowing horns ; and we jumped to one side to let them go by ; and as they went by I see they had the king and the duke astraddle of a rail -- that is , I knowed it WAS the king and the duke , though they was all over tar and feathers , and did n't look like nothing in the world that was human -- just looked like a couple of monstrous big soldier - plumes .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 38]: Well , it made me sick to see it ; and I was sorry for them poor pitiful rascals , it seemed like I could n't ever feel any hardness against them any more in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 8]: It was a dreadful thing to see .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 10]: Human beings CAN be awful cruel to one another .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 13]: We see we was too late -- could n't do no good .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 57]: We asked some stragglers about it , and they said everybody went to the show looking very innocent ; and laid low and kept dark till the poor old king was in the middle of his cavortings on the stage ; then somebody give a signal , and the house rose up and went for them .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 40]: So we poked along back home , and I war n't feeling so brash as I was before , but kind of ornery , and humble , and to blame , somehow -- though I had n't done nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 37]: But that 's always the way ; it do n't make no difference whether you do right or wrong , a person 's conscience ai n't got no sense , and just goes for him anyway .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 23]: If I had a yaller dog that did n't know no more than a person 's conscience does I would pison him .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 24]: It takes up more room than all the rest of a person 's insides , and yet ai n't no good , nohow .
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 7]: Tom Sawyer he says the same .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIV .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 9]: WE stopped talking , and got to thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 23]: By and by Tom says : `` Looky here , Huck , what fools we are to not think of it before !
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 9]: I bet I know where Jim is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 3]: Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 9]: `` In that hut down by the ash-hopper .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 5]: Why , looky here .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 21]: When we was at dinner , did n't you see a nigger man go in there with some vittles ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 11]: `` What did you think the vittles was for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 6]: `` For a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 14]: `` So 'd I. Well , it was n't for a dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 9]: `` Because part of it was watermelon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 9]: `` So it was -- I noticed it .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 17]: Well , it does beat all that I never thought about a dog not eating watermelon .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 17]: It shows how a body can see and do n't see at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 23]: `` Well , the nigger unlocked the padlock when he went in , and he locked it again when he came out .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 20]: He fetched uncle a key about the time we got up from table -- same key , I bet .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 34]: Watermelon shows man , lock shows prisoner ; and it ai n't likely there 's two prisoners on such a little plantation , and where the people 's all so kind and good .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 5]: Jim 's the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 23]: All right -- I 'm glad we found it out detective fashion ; I would n't give shucks for any other way .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 36]: Now you work your mind , and study out a plan to steal Jim , and I will study out one , too ; and we 'll take the one we like the best . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 10]: What a head for just a boy to have !
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 37]: If I had Tom Sawyer 's head I would n't trade it off to be a duke , nor mate of a steamboat , nor clown in a circus , nor nothing I can think of .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 30]: I went to thinking out a plan , but only just to be doing something ; I knowed very well where the right plan was going to come from .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 9]: Pretty soon Tom says : `` Ready ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 9]: `` All right -- bring it out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 10]: `` My plan is this , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 13]: `` We can easy find out if it 's Jim in there .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 17]: Then get up my canoe to-morrow night , and fetch my raft over from the island .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 51]: Then the first dark night that comes steal the key out of the old man 's britches after he goes to bed , and shove off down the river on the raft with Jim , hiding daytimes and running nights , the way me and Jim used to do before .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 7]: Would n't that plan work ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 3]: `` WORK ?
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 13]: Why , cert ` nly it would work , like rats a-fighting .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 15]: But it 's too blame ' simple ; there ai n't nothing TO it .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 16]: What 's the good of a plan that ai n't no more trouble than that ?
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 7]: It 's as mild as goose-milk .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 19]: Why , Huck , it would n't make no more talk than breaking into a soap factory . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 36]: I never said nothing , because I war n't expecting nothing different ; but I knowed mighty well that whenever he got HIS plan ready it would n't have none of them objections to it .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 5]: And it did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 43]: He told me what it was , and I see in a minute it was worth fifteen of mine for style , and would make Jim just as free a man as mine would , and maybe get us all killed besides .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 14]: So I was satisfied , and said we would waltz in on it .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 22]: I need n't tell what it was here , because I knowed it would n't stay the way , it was .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 27]: I knowed he would be changing it around every which way as we went along , and heaving in new bullinesses wherever he got a chance .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 7]: And that is what he done .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 31]: Well , one thing was dead sure , and that was that Tom Sawyer was in earnest , and was actuly going to help steal that nigger out of slavery .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 11]: That was the thing that was too many for me .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 87]: Here was a boy that was respectable and well brung up ; and had a character to lose ; and folks at home that had characters ; and he was bright and not leather-headed ; and knowing and not ignorant ; and not mean , but kind ; and yet here he was , without any more pride , or rightness , or feeling , than to stoop to this business , and make himself a shame , and his family a shame , before everybody .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 10]: I COULD N'T understand it no way at all .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 38]: It was outrageous , and I knowed I ought to just up and tell him so ; and so be his true friend , and let him quit the thing right where he was and save himself .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 29]: And I DID start to tell him ; but he shut me up , and says : `` Do n't you reckon I know what I 'm about ?
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 11]: Do n't I generly know what I 'm about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 15]: `` Did n't I SAY I was going to help steal the nigger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 6]: `` WELL , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 13]: That 's all he said , and that 's all I said .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 25]: It war n't no use to say any more ; because when he said he 'd do a thing , he always done it .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 31]: But I could n't make out how he was willing to go into this thing ; so I just let it go , and never bothered no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 15]: If he was bound to have it so , I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 28]: When we got home the house was all dark and still ; so we went on down to the hut by the ash-hopper for to examine it .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 15]: We went through the yard so as to see what the hounds would do .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 25]: They knowed us , and did n't make no more noise than country dogs is always doing when anything comes by in the night .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 53]: When we got to the cabin we took a look at the front and the two sides ; and on the side I war n't acquainted with -- which was the north side -- we found a square window-hole , up tolerable high , with just one stout board nailed across it .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 9]: I says : `` Here 's the ticket .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 18]: This hole 's big enough for Jim to get through if we wrench off the board . ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 20]: Tom says : `` It 's as simple as tit-tat-toe , three-in-a-row , and as easy as playing hooky .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 21]: I should HOPE we can find a way that 's a little more complicated than THAT , Huck Finn . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 31]: `` Well , then , '' I says , `` how 'll it do to saw him out , the way I done before I was murdered that time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 10]: `` That 's more LIKE , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 31]: `` It 's real mysterious , and troublesome , and good , '' he says ; `` but I bet we can find a way that 's twice as long .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 14]: There ai n't no hurry ; le 's keep on looking around . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 30]: Betwixt the hut and the fence , on the back side , was a lean-to that joined the hut at the eaves , and was made out of plank .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 17]: It was as long as the hut , but narrow -- only about six foot wide .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 14]: The door to it was at the south end , and was padlocked .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 34]: Tom he went to the soap-kettle and searched around , and fetched back the iron thing they lift the lid with ; so he took it and prized out one of the staples .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 70]: The chain fell down , and we opened the door and went in , and shut it , and struck a match , and see the shed was only built against a cabin and had n't no connection with it ; and there war n't no floor to the shed , nor nothing in it but some old rusty played-out hoes and spades and picks and a crippled plow .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 27]: The match went out , and so did we , and shoved in the staple again , and the door was locked as good as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 4]: Tom was joyful .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 10]: He says ; `` Now we 're all right .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 6]: We 'll DIG him out .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 8]: It 'll take about a week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 54]: Then we started for the house , and I went in the back door -- you only have to pull a buckskin latch-string , they do n't fasten the doors -- but that war n't romantical enough for Tom Sawyer ; no way would do him but he must climb up the lightning-rod .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 64]: But after he got up half way about three times , and missed fire and fell every time , and the last time most busted his brains out , he thought he 'd got to give it up ; but after he was rested he allowed he would give her one more turn for luck , and this time he made the trip .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 40]: In the morning we was up at break of day , and down to the nigger cabins to pet the dogs and make friends with the nigger that fed Jim -- if it WAS Jim that was being fed .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 44]: The niggers was just getting through breakfast and starting for the fields ; and Jim 's nigger was piling up a tin pan with bread and meat and things ; and whilst the others was leaving , the key come from the house .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 22]: This nigger had a good-natured , chuckle-headed face , and his wool was all tied up in little bunches with thread .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 7]: That was to keep witches off .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 47]: He said the witches was pestering him awful these nights , and making him see all kinds of strange things , and hear all kinds of strange words and noises , and he did n't believe he was ever witched so long before in his life .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 28]: He got so worked up , and got to running on so about his troubles , he forgot all about what he 'd been a-going to do .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 11]: So Tom says : `` What 's the vittles for ?
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 7]: Going to feed the dogs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 34]: The nigger kind of smiled around gradually over his face , like when you heave a brickbat in a mud-puddle , and he says : `` Yes , Mars Sid , A dog .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 7]: Cur ` us dog , too .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 12]: Does you want to go en look at ` im ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 17]: I hunched Tom , and whispers : `` You going , right here in the daybreak ?
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 7]: THAT war n't the plan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 15]: `` No , it war n't ; but it 's the plan NOW . ''
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 17]: So , drat him , we went along , but I did n't like it much .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 39]: When we got in we could n't hardly see anything , it was so dark ; but Jim was there , sure enough , and could see us ; and he sings out : `` Why , HUCK !
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 5]: En good LAN ' !
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 7]: ain ' dat Misto Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 13]: I just knowed how it would be ; I just expected it .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 34]: I did n't know nothing to do ; and if I had I could n't a done it , because that nigger busted in and says : `` Why , de gracious sakes !
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 7]: do he know you genlmen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 7]: We could see pretty well now .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 23]: Tom he looked at the nigger , steady and kind of wondering , and says : `` Does WHO know us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 8]: `` Why , dis-yer runaway nigger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 17]: `` I do n't reckon he does ; but what put that into your head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 6]: `` What PUT it dar ?
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 15]: Didn ' he jis ' dis minute sing out like he knowed you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 18]: Tom says , in a puzzled-up kind of way : `` Well , that 's mighty curious .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 4]: WHO sung out ?
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 6]: WHEN did he sing out ?
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 7]: WHAT did he sing out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 21]: And turns to me , perfectly ca 'm , and says , `` Did YOU hear anybody sing out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 30]: Of course there war n't nothing to be said but the one thing ; so I says : `` No ; I ai n't heard nobody say nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 27]: Then he turns to Jim , and looks him over like he never see him before , and says : `` Did you sing out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 19]: `` No , sah , '' says Jim ; `` I hai n't said nothing , sah . ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 6]: `` Not a word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 13]: `` No , sah , I hai n't said a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 9]: `` Did you ever see us before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 12]: `` No , sah ; not as I knows on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 34]: So Tom turns to the nigger , which was looking wild and distressed , and says , kind of severe : `` What do you reckon 's the matter with you , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 9]: What made you think somebody sung out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 22]: `` Oh , it 's de dad-blame ' witches , sah , en I wisht I was dead , I do .
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 23]: Dey 's awluz at it , sah , en dey do mos ' kill me , dey sk ` yers me so .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 30]: Please to do n't tell nobody ` bout it sah , er ole Mars Silas he 'll scole me ; ` kase he say dey AI N'T no witches .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 17]: I jis ' wish to goodness he was heah now -- DEN what would he say !
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 18]: I jis ' bet he couldn ' fine no way to git aroun ' it DIS time .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 54]: But it 's awluz jis ' so ; people dat 's SOT , stays sot ; dey wo n't look into noth 'n' en fine it out f ' r deyselves , en when YOU fine it out en tell um ` bout it , dey doan ' b ` lieve you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 51]: Tom give him a dime , and said we would n't tell nobody ; and told him to buy some more thread to tie up his wool with ; and then looks at Jim , and says : `` I wonder if Uncle Silas is going to hang this nigger .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 28]: If I was to catch a nigger that was ungrateful enough to run away , I would n't give him up , I 'd hang him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 40]: And whilst the nigger stepped to the door to look at the dime and bite it to see if it was good , he whispers to Jim and says : `` Do n't ever let on to know us .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 23]: And if you hear any digging going on nights , it 's us ; we 're going to set you free . ''
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 70]: Jim only had time to grab us by the hand and squeeze it ; then the nigger come back , and we said we 'd come again some time if the nigger wanted us to ; and he said he would , more particular if it was dark , because the witches went for him mostly in the dark , and it was good to have folks around then .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXV .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 84]: IT would be most an hour yet till breakfast , so we left and struck down into the woods ; because Tom said we got to have SOME light to see how to dig by , and a lantern makes too much , and might get us into trouble ; what we must have was a lot of them rotten chunks that 's called fox-fire , and just makes a soft kind of a glow when you lay them in a dark place .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 43]: We fetched an armful and hid it in the weeds , and set down to rest , and Tom says , kind of dissatisfied : `` Blame it , this whole thing is just as easy and awkward as it can be .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 15]: And so it makes it so rotten difficult to get up a difficult plan .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 17]: There ai n't no watchman to be drugged -- now there OUGHT to be a watchman .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 12]: There ai n't even a dog to give a sleeping-mixture to .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 40]: And there 's Jim chained by one leg , with a ten-foot chain , to the leg of his bed : why , all you got to do is to lift up the bedstead and slip off the chain .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 25]: And Uncle Silas he trusts everybody ; sends the key to the punkin-headed nigger , and do n't send nobody to watch the nigger .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 29]: Jim could a got out of that window-hole before this , only there would n't be no use trying to travel with a ten-foot chain on his leg .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 16]: Why , drat it , Huck , it 's the stupidest arrangement I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 8]: You got to invent ALL the difficulties .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 23]: Well , we ca n't help it ; we got to do the best we can with the materials we 've got .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 58]: Anyhow , there 's one thing -- there 's more honor in getting him out through a lot of difficulties and dangers , where there war n't one of them furnished to you by the people who it was their duty to furnish them , and you had to contrive them all out of your own head .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 11]: Now look at just that one thing of the lantern .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 21]: When you come down to the cold facts , we simply got to LET ON that a lantern 's resky .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 17]: Why , we could work with a torchlight procession if we wanted to , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 27]: Now , whilst I think of it , we got to hunt up something to make a saw out of the first chance we get . ''
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 10]: `` What do we want of a saw ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 8]: `` What do we WANT of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 23]: Hai n't we got to saw the leg of Jim 's bed off , so as to get the chain loose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 20]: `` Why , you just said a body could lift up the bedstead and slip the chain off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 14]: `` Well , if that ai n't just like you , Huck Finn .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 13]: You CAN get up the infant-schooliest ways of going at a thing .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 12]: Why , hai n't you ever read any books at all ?
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 21]: -- Baron Trenck , nor Casanova , nor Benvenuto Chelleeny , nor Henri IV. , nor none of them heroes ?
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 16]: Who ever heard of getting a prisoner loose in such an old-maidy way as that ?
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 69]: No ; the way all the best authorities does is to saw the bed-leg in two , and leave it just so , and swallow the sawdust , so it ca n't be found , and put some dirt and grease around the sawed place so the very keenest seneskal ca n't see no sign of it 's being sawed , and thinks the bed-leg is perfectly sound .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 28]: Then , the night you 're ready , fetch the leg a kick , down she goes ; slip off your chain , and there you are .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 75]: Nothing to do but hitch your rope ladder to the battlements , shin down it , break your leg in the moat -- because a rope ladder is nineteen foot too short , you know -- and there 's your horses and your trusty vassles , and they scoop you up and fling you across a saddle , and away you go to your native Langudoc , or Navarre , or wherever it is .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 6]: It 's gaudy , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 10]: I wish there was a moat to this cabin .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 17]: If we get time , the night of the escape , we 'll dig one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 25]: I says : `` What do we want of a moat when we 're going to snake him out from under the cabin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 6]: But he never heard me .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 8]: He had forgot me and everything else .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 10]: He had his chin in his hand , thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 33]: Pretty soon he sighs and shakes his head ; then sighs again , and says : `` No , it would n't do -- there ai n't necessity enough for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 5]: `` For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 14]: `` Why , to saw Jim 's leg off , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 5]: `` Good land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 14]: I says ; `` why , there ai n't NO necessity for it .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 15]: And what would you want to saw his leg off for , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 12]: `` Well , some of the best authorities has done it .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 18]: They could n't get the chain off , so they just cut their hand off and shoved .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 8]: And a leg would be better still .
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 8]: But we got to let that go .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 43]: There ai n't necessity enough in this case ; and , besides , Jim 's a nigger , and would n't understand the reasons for it , and how it 's the custom in Europe ; so we 'll let it go .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 28]: But there 's one thing -- he can have a rope ladder ; we can tear up our sheets and make him a rope ladder easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 18]: And we can send it to him in a pie ; it 's mostly done that way .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 8]: And I 've et worse pies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 27]: `` Why , Tom Sawyer , how you talk , '' I says ; `` Jim ai n't got no use for a rope ladder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 8]: `` He HAS got use for it .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 16]: How YOU talk , you better say ; you do n't know nothing about it .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 14]: He 's GOT to have a rope ladder ; they all do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 12]: `` What in the nation can he DO with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 5]: `` DO with it ?
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 12]: He can hide it in his bed , ca n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 15]: That 's what they all do ; and HE 'S got to , too .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 27]: Huck , you do n't ever seem to want to do anything that 's regular ; you want to be starting something fresh all the time .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 9]: S'pose he DO N'T do nothing with it ?
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 17]: ai n't it there in his bed , for a clew , after he 's gone ?
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 10]: and do n't you reckon they 'll want clews ?
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 5]: Of course they will .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: And you would n't leave them any ?
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 11]: That would be a PRETTY howdy-do , WOULD N'T it !
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 9]: I never heard of such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 86]: `` Well , '' I says , `` if it 's in the regulations , and he 's got to have it , all right , let him have it ; because I do n't wish to go back on no regulations ; but there 's one thing , Tom Sawyer -- if we go to tearing up our sheets to make Jim a rope ladder , we 're going to get into trouble with Aunt Sally , just as sure as you 're born .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 101]: Now , the way I look at it , a hickry-bark ladder do n't cost nothing , and do n't waste nothing , and is just as good to load up a pie with , and hide in a straw tick , as any rag ladder you can start ; and as for Jim , he ai n't had no experience , and so he do n't care what kind of a -- '' `` Oh , shucks , Huck Finn , if I was as ignorant as you I 'd keep still -- that 's what I 'D do .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 13]: Who ever heard of a state prisoner escaping by a hickry-bark ladder ?
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 8]: Why , it 's perfectly ridiculous . ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 35]: `` Well , all right , Tom , fix it your own way ; but if you 'll take my advice , you 'll let me borrow a sheet off of the clothesline . ''
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 6]: He said that would do .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 19]: And that gave him another idea , and he says : `` Borrow a shirt , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 12]: `` What do we want of a shirt , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 12]: `` Want it for Jim to keep a journal on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 11]: `` Journal your granny -- JIM ca n't write . ''
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 41]: `` S'pose he CA N'T write -- he can make marks on the shirt , ca n't he , if we make him a pen out of an old pewter spoon or a piece of an old iron barrel-hoop ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 27]: `` Why , Tom , we can pull a feather out of a goose and make him a better one ; and quicker , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 19]: `` PRISONERS do n't have geese running around the donjon-keep to pull pens out of , you muggins .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 61]: They ALWAYS make their pens out of the hardest , toughest , troublesomest piece of old brass candlestick or something like that they can get their hands on ; and it takes them weeks and weeks and months and months to file it out , too , because they 've got to do it by rubbing it on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 11]: THEY would n't use a goose-quill if they had it .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 6]: It ai n't regular . ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 16]: `` Well , then , what 'll we make him the ink out of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 27]: `` Many makes it out of iron-rust and tears ; but that 's the common sort and women ; the best authorities uses their own blood .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 49]: Jim can do that ; and when he wants to send any little common ordinary mysterious message to let the world know where he 's captivated , he can write it on the bottom of a tin plate with a fork and throw it out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 19]: The Iron Mask always done that , and it 's a blame ' good way , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 9]: `` Jim ai n't got no tin plates .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 8]: They feed him in a pan . ''
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 13]: `` That ai n't nothing ; we can get him some . ''
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 9]: `` Ca n't nobody READ his plates . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 14]: `` That ai n't got anything to DO with it , Huck Finn .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 17]: All HE 'S got to do is to write on the plate and throw it out .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 11]: You do n't HAVE to be able to read it .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 23]: Why , half the time you ca n't read anything a prisoner writes on a tin plate , or anywhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 15]: `` Well , then , what 's the sense in wasting the plates ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 16]: `` Why , blame it all , it ai n't the PRISONER 'S plates . ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 13]: `` But it 's SOMEBODY 'S plates , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 8]: `` Well , spos 'n it is ?
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 20]: What does the PRISONER care whose -- '' He broke off there , because we heard the breakfast-horn blowing .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 8]: So we cleared out for the house .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 44]: Along during the morning I borrowed a sheet and a white shirt off of the clothes-line ; and I found an old sack and put them in it , and we went down and got the fox-fire , and put that in too .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 26]: I called it borrowing , because that was what pap always called it ; but Tom said it war n't borrowing , it was stealing .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 33]: He said we was representing prisoners ; and prisoners do n't care how they get a thing so they get it , and nobody do n't blame them for it , either .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 64]: It ai n't no crime in a prisoner to steal the thing he needs to get away with , Tom said ; it 's his right ; and so , as long as we was representing a prisoner , we had a perfect right to steal anything on this place we had the least use for to get ourselves out of prison with .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 32]: He said if we war n't prisoners it would be a very different thing , and nobody but a mean , ornery person would steal when he war n't a prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 13]: So we allowed we would steal everything there was that come handy .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 46]: And yet he made a mighty fuss , one day , after that , when I stole a watermelon out of the nigger-patch and eat it ; and he made me go and give the niggers a dime without telling them what it was for .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 15]: Tom said that what he meant was , we could steal anything we NEEDED .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 10]: Well , I says , I needed the watermelon .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 22]: But he said I did n't need it to get out of prison with ; there 's where the difference was .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 32]: He said if I 'd a wanted it to hide a knife in , and smuggle it to Jim to kill the seneskal with , it would a been all right .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 47]: So I let it go at that , though I could n't see no advantage in my representing a prisoner if I got to set down and chaw over a lot of gold-leaf distinctions like that every time I see a chance to hog a watermelon .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 46]: Well , as I was saying , we waited that morning till everybody was settled down to business , and nobody in sight around the yard ; then Tom he carried the sack into the lean-to whilst I stood off a piece to keep watch .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 19]: By and by he come out , and we went and set down on the woodpile to talk .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 19]: He says : `` Everything 's all right now except tools ; and that 's easy fixed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 4]: `` Tools ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 6]: `` Tools for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 7]: `` Why , to dig with .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 13]: We ai n't a-going to GNAW him out , are we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 21]: `` Ai n't them old crippled picks and things in there good enough to dig a nigger out with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 47]: He turns on me , looking pitying enough to make a body cry , and says : `` Huck Finn , did you EVER hear of a prisoner having picks and shovels , and all the modern conveniences in his wardrobe to dig himself out with ?
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 31]: Now I want to ask you -- if you got any reasonableness in you at all -- what kind of a show would THAT give him to be a hero ?
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 15]: Why , they might as well lend him the key and done with it .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 16]: Picks and shovels -- why , they would n't furnish 'em to a king . ''
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 26]: `` Well , then , '' I says , `` if we do n't want the picks and shovels , what do we want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 7]: `` A couple of case-knives . ''
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 13]: `` To dig the foundations out from under that cabin with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 11]: `` Confound it , it 's foolish , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 25]: `` It do n't make no difference how foolish it is , it 's the RIGHT way -- and it 's the regular way .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 29]: And there ai n't no OTHER way , that ever I heard of , and I 've read all the books that gives any information about these things .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 23]: They always dig out with a case-knife -- and not through dirt , mind you ; generly it 's through solid rock .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 16]: And it takes them weeks and weeks and weeks , and for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 41]: Why , look at one of them prisoners in the bottom dungeon of the Castle Deef , in the harbor of Marseilles , that dug himself out that way ; how long was HE at it , you reckon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 7]: `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 6]: `` Well , guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 7]: A month and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 11]: `` THIRTY-SEVEN YEAR -- and he come out in China .
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 5]: THAT 'S the kind .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 12]: I wish the bottom of THIS fortress was solid rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 10]: `` JIM do n't know nobody in China . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 10]: `` What 's THAT got to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 6]: Neither did that other fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 11]: But you 're always a-wandering off on a side issue .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 11]: Why ca n't you stick to the main point ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 28]: `` All right -- I do n't care where he comes out , so he COMES out ; and Jim do n't , either , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 20]: But there 's one thing , anyway -- Jim 's too old to be dug out with a case-knife .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 6]: He wo n't last . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 8]: `` Yes he will LAST , too .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 23]: You do n't reckon it 's going to take thirty-seven years to dig out through a DIRT foundation , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 10]: `` How long will it take , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 34]: `` Well , we ca n't resk being as long as we ought to , because it may n't take very long for Uncle Silas to hear from down there by New Orleans .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 9]: He 'll hear Jim ai n't from there .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 15]: Then his next move will be to advertise Jim , or something like that .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 16]: So we ca n't resk being as long digging him out as we ought to .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 18]: By rights I reckon we ought to be a couple of years ; but we ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 44]: Things being so uncertain , what I recommend is this : that we really dig right in , as quick as we can ; and after that , we can LET ON , to ourselves , that we was at it thirty-seven years .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 18]: Then we can snatch him out and rush him away the first time there 's an alarm .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 12]: Yes , I reckon that 'll be the best way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 13]: `` Now , there 's SENSE in that , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 38]: `` Letting on do n't cost nothing ; letting on ai n't no trouble ; and if it 's any object , I do n't mind letting on we was at it a hundred and fifty year .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 14]: It would n't strain me none , after I got my hand in .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 15]: So I 'll mosey along now , and smouch a couple of case-knives . ''
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 20]: `` Smouch three , '' he says ; `` we want one to make a saw out of . ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 36]: `` Tom , if it ai n't unregular and irreligious to sejest it , '' I says , `` there 's an old rusty saw-blade around yonder sticking under the weather-boarding behind the smoke-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 26]: He looked kind of weary and discouraged-like , and says : `` It ai n't no use to try to learn you nothing , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 12]: Run along and smouch the knives -- three of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 5]: So I done it .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVI .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 37]: AS soon as we reckoned everybody was asleep that night we went down the lightning-rod , and shut ourselves up in the lean-to , and got out our pile of fox-fire , and went to work .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 21]: We cleared everything out of the way , about four or five foot along the middle of the bottom log .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 66]: Tom said he was right behind Jim 's bed now , and we 'd dig in under it , and when we got through there could n't nobody in the cabin ever know there was any hole there , because Jim 's counter-pin hung down most to the ground , and you 'd have to raise it up and look under to see the hole .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 36]: So we dug and dug with the case-knives till most midnight ; and then we was dog-tired , and our hands was blistered , and yet you could n't see we 'd done anything hardly .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 25]: At last I says : `` This ai n't no thirty-seven year job ; this is a thirty-eight year job , Tom Sawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 5]: He never said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 25]: But he sighed , and pretty soon he stopped digging , and then for a good little while I knowed that he was thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 20]: Then he says : `` It ai n't no use , Huck , it ai n't a-going to work .
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 82]: If we was prisoners it would , because then we 'd have as many years as we wanted , and no hurry ; and we would n't get but a few minutes to dig , every day , while they was changing watches , and so our hands would n't get blistered , and we could keep it up right along , year in and year out , and do it right , and the way it ought to be done .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 21]: But WE ca n't fool along ; we got to rush ; we ai n't got no time to spare .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 36]: If we was to put in another night this way we 'd have to knock off for a week to let our hands get well -- could n't touch a case-knife with them sooner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 14]: `` Well , then , what we going to do , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 6]: `` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 49]: It ai n't right , and it ai n't moral , and I would n't like it to get out ; but there ai n't only just the one way : we got to dig him out with the picks , and LET ON it 's case-knives . ''
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 7]: `` NOW you 're TALKING ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 21]: I says ; `` your head gets leveler and leveler all the time , Tom Sawyer , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 29]: `` Picks is the thing , moral or no moral ; and as for me , I do n't care shucks for the morality of it , nohow .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 33]: When I start in to steal a nigger , or a watermelon , or a Sunday-school book , I ai n't no ways particular how it 's done so it 's done .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 71]: What I want is my nigger ; or what I want is my watermelon ; or what I want is my Sunday-school book ; and if a pick 's the handiest thing , that 's the thing I 'm a-going to dig that nigger or that watermelon or that Sunday-school book out with ; and I do n't give a dead rat what the authorities thinks about it nuther . ''
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 75]: `` Well , '' he says , `` there 's excuse for picks and letting-on in a case like this ; if it war n't so , I would n't approve of it , nor I would n't stand by and see the rules broke -- because right is right , and wrong is wrong , and a body ai n't got no business doing wrong when he ai n't ignorant and knows better .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 39]: It might answer for YOU to dig Jim out with a pick , WITHOUT any letting on , because you do n't know no better ; but it would n't for me , because I do know better .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 6]: Gim me a case-knife . ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 13]: He had his own by him , but I handed him mine .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 15]: He flung it down , and says : `` Gim me a CASE-KNIFE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 14]: I did n't know just what to do -- but then I thought .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 33]: I scratched around amongst the old tools , and got a pickaxe and give it to him , and he took it and went to work , and never said a word .
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 7]: He was always just that particular .
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 4]: Full of principle .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 23]: So then I got a shovel , and then we picked and shoveled , turn about , and made the fur fly .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 34]: We stuck to it about a half an hour , which was as long as we could stand up ; but we had a good deal of a hole to show for it .
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 35]: When I got up stairs I looked out at the window and see Tom doing his level best with the lightning-rod , but he could n't come it , his hands was so sore .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 18]: At last he says : `` It ai n't no use , it ca n't be done .
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 7]: What you reckon I better do ?
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 9]: Ca n't you think of no way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 16]: `` Yes , '' I says , `` but I reckon it ai n't regular .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 14]: Come up the stairs , and let on it 's a lightning-rod . ''
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 5]: So he done it .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 49]: Next day Tom stole a pewter spoon and a brass candlestick in the house , for to make some pens for Jim out of , and six tallow candles ; and I hung around the nigger cabins and laid for a chance , and stole three tin plates .
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 50]: Tom says it was n't enough ; but I said nobody would n't ever see the plates that Jim throwed out , because they 'd fall in the dog-fennel and jimpson weeds under the window-hole -- then we could tote them back and he could use them over again .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 5]: So Tom was satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 23]: Then he says : `` Now , the thing to study out is , how to get the things to Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 20]: `` Take them in through the hole , '' I says , `` when we get it done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 26]: He only just looked scornful , and said something about nobody ever heard of such an idiotic idea , and then he went to studying .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 28]: By and by he said he had ciphered out two or three ways , but there war n't no need to decide on any of them yet .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 9]: Said we 'd got to post Jim first .
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 44]: That night we went down the lightning-rod a little after ten , and took one of the candles along , and listened under the window-hole , and heard Jim snoring ; so we pitched it in , and it did n't wake him .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 23]: Then we whirled in with the pick and shovel , and in about two hours and a half the job was done .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 47]: We crept in under Jim 's bed and into the cabin , and pawed around and found the candle and lit it , and stood over Jim awhile , and found him looking hearty and healthy , and then we woke him up gentle and gradual .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 55]: He was so glad to see us he most cried ; and called us honey , and all the pet names he could think of ; and was for having us hunt up a cold-chisel to cut the chain off of his leg with right away , and clearing out without losing any time .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 56]: But Tom he showed him how unregular it would be , and set down and told him all about our plans , and how we could alter them in a minute any time there was an alarm ; and not to be the least afraid , because we would see he got away , SURE .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 87]: So Jim he said it was all right , and we set there and talked over old times awhile , and then Tom asked a lot of questions , and when Jim told him Uncle Silas come in every day or two to pray with him , and Aunt Sally come in to see if he was comfortable and had plenty to eat , and both of them was kind as they could be , Tom says : `` NOW I know how to fix it .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 10]: We 'll send you some things by them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 38]: I said , `` Do n't do nothing of the kind ; it 's one of the most jackass ideas I ever struck ; '' but he never paid no attention to me ; went right on .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 12]: It was his way when he 'd got his plans set .
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 101]: So he told Jim how we 'd have to smuggle in the rope-ladder pie and other large things by Nat , the nigger that fed him , and he must be on the lookout , and not be surprised , and not let Nat see him open them ; and we would put small things in uncle 's coat-pockets and he must steal them out ; and we would tie things to aunt 's apron-strings or put them in her apron-pocket , if we got a chance ; and told him what they would be and what they was for .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 19]: And told him how to keep a journal on the shirt with his blood , and all that .
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 5]: He told him everything .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 43]: Jim he could n't see no sense in the most of it , but he allowed we was white folks and knowed better than him ; so he was satisfied , and said he would do it all just as Tom said .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 42]: Jim had plenty corn-cob pipes and tobacco ; so we had a right down good sociable time ; then we crawled out through the hole , and so home to bed , with hands that looked like they 'd been chawed .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 6]: Tom was in high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 71]: He said it was the best fun he ever had in his life , and the most intellectural ; and said if he only could see his way to it we would keep it up all the rest of our lives and leave Jim to our children to get out ; for he believed Jim would come to like it better and better the more he got used to it .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 27]: He said that in that way it could be strung out to as much as eighty year , and would be the best time on record .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 16]: And he said it would make us all celebrated that had a hand in it .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 31]: In the morning we went out to the woodpile and chopped up the brass candlestick into handy sizes , and Tom put them and the pewter spoon in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 79]: Then we went to the nigger cabins , and while I got Nat 's notice off , Tom shoved a piece of candlestick into the middle of a corn-pone that was in Jim 's pan , and we went along with Nat to see how it would work , and it just worked noble ; when Jim bit into it it most mashed all his teeth out ; and there war n't ever anything could a worked better .
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 5]: Tom said so himself .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 52]: Jim he never let on but what it was only just a piece of rock or something like that that 's always getting into bread , you know ; but after that he never bit into nothing but what he jabbed his fork into it in three or four places first .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 52]: And whilst we was a-standing there in the dimmish light , here comes a couple of the hounds bulging in from under Jim 's bed ; and they kept on piling in till there was eleven of them , and there war n't hardly room in there to get your breath .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 11]: By jings , we forgot to fasten that lean-to door !
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 32]: The nigger Nat he only just hollered `` Witches '' once , and keeled over on to the floor amongst the dogs , and begun to groan like he was dying .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 49]: Tom jerked the door open and flung out a slab of Jim 's meat , and the dogs went for it , and in two seconds he was out himself and back again and shut the door , and I knowed he 'd fixed the other door too .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 28]: Then he went to work on the nigger , coaxing him and petting him , and asking him if he 'd been imagining he saw something again .
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 59]: He raised up , and blinked his eyes around , and says : `` Mars Sid , you 'll say I 's a fool , but if I did n't b ` lieve I see most a million dogs , er devils , er some ` n , I wisht I may die right heah in dese tracks .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 7]: I did , mos ' sholy .
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 19]: Mars Sid , I FELT um -- I FELT um , sah ; dey was all over me .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 37]: Dad fetch it , I jis ' wisht I could git my han 's on one er dem witches jis ' wunst -- on ' y jis ' wunst -- it 's all I 'd ast .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 17]: But mos ` ly I wisht dey 'd lem me ` lone , I does . ''
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 13]: Tom says : `` Well , I tell you what I think .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 13]: What makes them come here just at this runaway nigger 's breakfast-time ?
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 12]: It 's because they 're hungry ; that 's the reason .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 17]: You make them a witch pie ; that 's the thing for YOU to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 20]: `` But my lan ' , Mars Sid , how 's I gwyne to make 'm a witch pie ?
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 9]: I doan ' know how to make it .
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 15]: I hai n't ever hearn er sich a thing b ` fo ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 14]: `` Well , then , I 'll have to make it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 8]: `` Will you do it , honey ?
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 4]: -- will you ?
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 16]: I 'll wusshup de groun ' und ' yo ' foot , I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 28]: `` All right , I 'll do it , seeing it 's you , and you 've been good to us and showed us the runaway nigger .
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 8]: But you got to be mighty careful .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 31]: When we come around , you turn your back ; and then whatever we 've put in the pan , do n't you let on you see it at all .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 21]: And do n't you look when Jim unloads the pan -- something might happen , I do n't know what .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 12]: And above all , do n't you HANDLE the witch-things . ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 7]: `` HANNEL 'm , Mars Sid ?
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 8]: What IS you a-talkin ' ` bout ?
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 29]: I wouldn ' lay de weight er my finger on um , not f ' r ten hund 'd thous 'n billion dollars , I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVII .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 5]: THAT was all fixed .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 204]: So then we went away and went to the rubbage-pile in the back yard , where they keep the old boots , and rags , and pieces of bottles , and wore-out tin things , and all such truck , and scratched around and found an old tin washpan , and stopped up the holes as well as we could , to bake the pie in , and took it down cellar and stole it full of flour and started for breakfast , and found a couple of shingle-nails that Tom said would be handy for a prisoner to scrabble his name and sorrows on the dungeon walls with , and dropped one of them in Aunt Sally 's apron-pocket which was hanging on a chair , and t ` other we stuck in the band of Uncle Silas 's hat , which was on the bureau , because we heard the children say their pa and ma was going to the runaway nigger 's house this morning , and then went to breakfast , and Tom dropped the pewter spoon in Uncle Silas 's coat-pocket , and Aunt Sally was n't come yet , so we had to wait a little while .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 74]: And when she come she was hot and red and cross , and could n't hardly wait for the blessing ; and then she went to sluicing out coffee with one hand and cracking the handiest child 's head with her thimble with the other , and says : `` I 've hunted high and I 've hunted low , and it does beat all what HAS become of your other shirt . ''
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 119]: My heart fell down amongst my lungs and livers and things , and a hard piece of corn-crust started down my throat after it and got met on the road with a cough , and was shot across the table , and took one of the children in the eye and curled him up like a fishing-worm , and let a cry out of him the size of a warwhoop , and Tom he turned kinder blue around the gills , and it all amounted to a considerable state of things for about a quarter of a minute or as much as that , and I would a sold out for half price if there was a bidder .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 24]: But after that we was all right again -- it was the sudden surprise of it that knocked us so kind of cold .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 18]: Uncle Silas he says : `` It 's most uncommon curious , I ca n't understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 22]: I know perfectly well I took it OFF , because -- '' `` Because you hai n't got but one ON .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 6]: Just LISTEN at the man !
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 38]: I know you took it off , and know it by a better way than your wool-gethering memory , too , because it was on the clo 's - line yesterday -- I see it there myself .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 40]: But it 's gone , that 's the long and the short of it , and you 'll just have to change to a red flann ' l one till I can get time to make a new one .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 13]: And it 'll be the third I 've made in two years .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 32]: It just keeps a body on the jump to keep you in shirts ; and whatever you do manage to DO with 'm all is more 'n I can make out .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 22]: A body 'd think you WOULD learn to take some sort of care of 'em at your time of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 15]: `` I know it , Sally , and I do try all I can .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 51]: But it ought n't to be altogether my fault , because , you know , I do n't see them nor have nothing to do with them except when they 're on me ; and I do n't believe I 've ever lost one of them OFF of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 27]: `` Well , it ai n't YOUR fault if you have n't , Silas ; you 'd a done it if you could , I reckon .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 12]: And the shirt ai n't all that 's gone , nuther .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 12]: Ther 's a spoon gone ; and THAT ai n't all .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 11]: There was ten , and now ther 's only nine .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 22]: The calf got the shirt , I reckon , but the calf never took the spoon , THAT 'S certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 11]: `` Why , what else is gone , Sally ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 11]: `` Ther 's six CANDLES gone -- that 's what .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 81]: The rats could a got the candles , and I reckon they did ; I wonder they do n't walk off with the whole place , the way you 're always going to stop their holes and do n't do it ; and if they war n't fools they 'd sleep in your hair , Silas -- YOU 'D never find it out ; but you ca n't lay the SPOON on the rats , and that I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 35]: `` Well , Sally , I 'm in fault , and I acknowledge it ; I 've been remiss ; but I wo n't let to-morrow go by without stopping up them holes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 13]: `` Oh , I would n't hurry ; next year 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 6]: Matilda Angelina Araminta PHELPS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 20]: Whack comes the thimble , and the child snatches her claws out of the sugar-bowl without fooling around any .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 24]: Just then the nigger woman steps on to the passage , and says : `` Missus , dey 's a sheet gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 5]: `` A SHEET gone !
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 9]: Well , for the land 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 17]: `` I 'll stop up them holes to-day , '' says Uncle Silas , looking sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 7]: `` Oh , DO shet up !
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 10]: -- s ` pose the rats took the SHEET ?
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 8]: WHERE 'S it gone , Lize ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 14]: `` Clah to goodness I hai n't no notion , Miss ' Sally .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 24]: She wuz on de clo ` sline yistiddy , but she done gone : she ain ' dah no mo ' now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 11]: `` I reckon the world IS coming to an end .
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 13]: I NEVER see the beat of it in all my born days .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 55]: A shirt , and a sheet , and a spoon , and six can -- '' `` Missus , '' comes a young yaller wench , `` dey 's a brass cannelstick miss ` n. '' `` Cler out from here , you hussy , er I 'll take a skillet to ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 7]: Well , she was just a-biling .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 24]: I begun to lay for a chance ; I reckoned I would sneak out and go for the woods till the weather moderated .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 41]: She kept a-raging right along , running her insurrection all by herself , and everybody else mighty meek and quiet ; and at last Uncle Silas , looking kind of foolish , fishes up that spoon out of his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 26]: She stopped , with her mouth open and her hands up ; and as for me , I wished I was in Jeruslem or somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 16]: But not long , because she says : `` It 's JUST as I expected .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 25]: So you had it in your pocket all the time ; and like as not you 've got the other things there , too .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 7]: How 'd it get there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 25]: `` I reely do n't know , Sally , '' he says , kind of apologizing , `` or you know I would tell .
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 99]: I was a-studying over my text in Acts Seventeen before breakfast , and I reckon I put it in there , not noticing , meaning to put my Testament in , and it must be so , because my Testament ai n't in ; but I 'll go and see ; and if the Testament is where I had it , I 'll know I did n't put it in , and that will show that I laid the Testament down and took up the spoon , and -- '' `` Oh , for the land 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 6]: Give a body a rest !
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 31]: Go ` long now , the whole kit and biling of ye ; and do n't come nigh me again till I 've got back my peace of mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 36]: I 'd a heard her if she 'd a said it to herself , let alone speaking it out ; and I 'd a got up and obeyed her if I 'd a been dead .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 48]: As we was passing through the setting-room the old man he took up his hat , and the shingle-nail fell out on the floor , and he just merely picked it up and laid it on the mantel-shelf , and never said nothing , and went out .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 37]: Tom see him do it , and remembered about the spoon , and says : `` Well , it ai n't no use to send things by HIM no more , he ai n't reliable . ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 42]: Then he says : `` But he done us a good turn with the spoon , anyway , without knowing it , and so we 'll go and do him one without HIM knowing it -- stop up his rat-holes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 30]: There was a noble good lot of them down cellar , and it took us a whole hour , but we done the job tight and good and shipshape .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 47]: Then we heard steps on the stairs , and blowed out our light and hid ; and here comes the old man , with a candle in one hand and a bundle of stuff in t ` other , looking as absent-minded as year before last .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 22]: He went a mooning around , first to one rat-hole and then another , till he 'd been to them all .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 16]: Then he stood about five minutes , picking tallow-drip off of his candle and thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 30]: Then he turns off slow and dreamy towards the stairs , saying : `` Well , for the life of me I ca n't remember when I done it .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 17]: I could show her now that I war n't to blame on account of the rats .
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 8]: But never mind -- let it go .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 10]: I reckon it would n't do no good . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 14]: And so he went on a-mumbling up stairs , and then we left .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 8]: He was a mighty nice old man .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 4]: And always is .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 30]: Tom was a good deal bothered about what to do for a spoon , but he said we 'd got to have it ; so he took a think .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 75]: When he had ciphered it out he told me how we was to do ; then we went and waited around the spoon-basket till we see Aunt Sally coming , and then Tom went to counting the spoons and laying them out to one side , and I slid one of them up my sleeve , and Tom says : `` Why , Aunt Sally , there ai n't but nine spoons YET . ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 17]: She says : `` Go ` long to your play , and do n't bother me .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 10]: I know better , I counted 'm myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 20]: `` Well , I 've counted them twice , Aunty , and I ca n't make but nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 18]: She looked out of all patience , but of course she come to count -- anybody would .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 13]: `` I declare to gracious ther ' AI N'T but nine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 3]: she says .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 20]: `` Why , what in the world -- plague TAKE the things , I 'll count 'm again . ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 31]: So I slipped back the one I had , and when she got done counting , she says : `` Hang the troublesome rubbage , ther 's TEN now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 8]: and she looked huffy and bothered both .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 18]: But Tom says : `` Why , Aunty , I do n't think there 's ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 13]: `` You numskull , did n't you see me COUNT 'm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 17]: `` I know , but -- '' `` Well , I 'll count 'm AGAIN . ''
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 17]: So I smouched one , and they come out nine , same as the other time .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 19]: Well , she WAS in a tearing way -- just a-trembling all over , she was so mad .
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 41]: But she counted and counted till she got that addled she 'd start to count in the basket for a spoon sometimes ; and so , three times they come out right , and three times they come out wrong .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 49]: Then she grabbed up the basket and slammed it across the house and knocked the cat galley-west ; and she said cle ' r out and let her have some peace , and if we come bothering around her again betwixt that and dinner she 'd skin us .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 38]: So we had the odd spoon , and dropped it in her apron-pocket whilst she was a-giving us our sailing orders , and Jim got it all right , along with her shingle nail , before noon .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 91]: We was very well satisfied with this business , and Tom allowed it was worth twice the trouble it took , because he said NOW she could n't ever count them spoons twice alike again to save her life ; and would n't believe she 'd counted them right if she DID ; and said that after she 'd about counted her head off for the next three days he judged she 'd give it up and offer to kill anybody that wanted her to ever count them any more .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 86]: So we put the sheet back on the line that night , and stole one out of her closet ; and kept on putting it back and stealing it again for a couple of days till she did n't know how many sheets she had any more , and she did n't CARE , and war n't a-going to bullyrag the rest of her soul out about it , and would n't count them again not to save her life ; she druther die first .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 55]: So we was all right now , as to the shirt and the sheet and the spoon and the candles , by the help of the calf and the rats and the mixed-up counting ; and as to the candlestick , it war n't no consequence , it would blow over by and by .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 17]: But that pie was a job ; we had no end of trouble with that pie .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 102]: We fixed it up away down in the woods , and cooked it there ; and we got it done at last , and very satisfactory , too ; but not all in one day ; and we had to use up three wash-pans full of flour before we got through , and we got burnt pretty much all over , in places , and eyes put out with the smoke ; because , you see , we did n't want nothing but a crust , and we could n't prop it up right , and she would always cave in .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 25]: But of course we thought of the right way at last -- which was to cook the ladder , too , in the pie .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 43]: So then we laid in with Jim the second night , and tore up the sheet all in little strings and twisted them together , and long before daylight we had a lovely rope that you could a hung a person with .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: We let on it took nine months to make it .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 21]: And in the forenoon we took it down to the woods , but it would n't go into the pie .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 39]: Being made of a whole sheet , that way , there was rope enough for forty pies if we 'd a wanted them , and plenty left over for soup , or sausage , or anything you choose .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 8]: We could a had a whole dinner .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 7]: But we did n't need it .
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 18]: All we needed was just enough for the pie , and so we throwed the rest away .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 146]: We did n't cook none of the pies in the wash-pan -- afraid the solder would melt ; but Uncle Silas he had a noble brass warming-pan which he thought considerable of , because it belonged to one of his ancesters with a long wooden handle that come over from England with William the Conqueror in the Mayflower or one of them early ships and was hid away up garret with a lot of other old pots and things that was valuable , not on account of being any account , because they war n't , but on account of them being relicts , you know , and we snaked her out , private , and took her down there , but she failed on the first pies , because we did n't know how , but she come up smiling on the last one .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 75]: We took and lined her with dough , and set her in the coals , and loaded her up with rag rope , and put on a dough roof , and shut down the lid , and put hot embers on top , and stood off five foot , with the long handle , cool and comfortable , and in fifteen minutes she turned out a pie that was a satisfaction to look at .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 56]: But the person that et it would want to fetch a couple of kags of toothpicks along , for if that rope ladder would n't cramp him down to business I do n't know nothing what I 'm talking about , and lay him in enough stomach-ache to last him till next time , too .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 80]: Nat did n't look when we put the witch pie in Jim 's pan ; and we put the three tin plates in the bottom of the pan under the vittles ; and so Jim got everything all right , and as soon as he was by himself he busted into the pie and hid the rope ladder inside of his straw tick , and scratched some marks on a tin plate and throwed it out of the window-hole .
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXVIII .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 29]: MAKING them pens was a distressid tough job , and so was the saw ; and Jim allowed the inscription was going to be the toughest of all .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 14]: That 's the one which the prisoner has to scrabble on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 37]: But he had to have it ; Tom said he 'd GOT to ; there war n't no case of a state prisoner not scrabbling his inscription to leave behind , and his coat of arms .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 22]: `` Look at Lady Jane Grey , '' he says ; `` look at Gilford Dudley ; look at old Northumberland !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 12]: Why , Huck , s ` pose it IS considerble trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 7]: -- what you going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 9]: -- how you going to get around it ?
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 12]: Jim 's GOT to do his inscription and coat of arms .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 5]: They all do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 43]: Jim says : `` Why , Mars Tom , I hai n't got no coat o ' arm ; I hai n't got nuffn but dish yer ole shirt , en you knows I got to keep de journal on dat . ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 19]: `` Oh , you do n't understand , Jim ; a coat of arms is very different . ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 32]: `` Well , '' I says , `` Jim 's right , anyway , when he says he ai n't got no coat of arms , because he hai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 47]: `` I reckon I knowed that , '' Tom says , `` but you bet he 'll have one before he goes out of this -- because he 's going out RIGHT , and there ai n't going to be no flaws in his record . ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 44]: So whilst me and Jim filed away at the pens on a brickbat apiece , Jim a-making his 'n out of the brass and I making mine out of the spoon , Tom set to work to think out the coat of arms .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 33]: By and by he said he 'd struck so many good ones he did n't hardly know which to take , but there was one which he reckoned he 'd decide on .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 115]: He says : `` On the scutcheon we 'll have a bend OR in the dexter base , a saltire MURREY in the fess , with a dog , couchant , for common charge , and under his foot a chain embattled , for slavery , with a chevron VERT in a chief engrailed , and three invected lines on a field AZURE , with the nombril points rampant on a dancette indented ; crest , a runaway nigger , SABLE , with his bundle over his shoulder on a bar sinister ; and a couple of gules for supporters , which is you and me ; motto , MAGGIORE FRETTA , MINORE OTTO .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 16]: Got it out of a book -- means the more haste the less speed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 18]: `` Geewhillikins , '' I says , `` but what does the rest of it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 27]: `` We ai n't got no time to bother over that , '' he says ; `` we got to dig in like all git-out . ''
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 16]: `` Well , anyway , '' I says , `` what 's SOME of it ?
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 6]: What 's a fess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 19]: `` A fess -- a fess is -- YOU do n't need to know what a fess is .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 15]: I 'll show him how to make it when he gets to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 18]: `` Shucks , Tom , '' I says , `` I think you might tell a person .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 7]: What 's a bar sinister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 8]: But he 's got to have it .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 6]: All the nobility does . ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 6]: That was just his way .
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 19]: If it did n't suit him to explain a thing to you , he would n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 15]: You might pump at him a week , it would n't make no difference .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 49]: He 'd got all that coat of arms business fixed , so now he started in to finish up the rest of that part of the work , which was to plan out a mournful inscription -- said Jim got to have one , like they all done .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 23]: He made up a lot , and wrote them out on a paper , and read them off , so : 1 .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 6]: Here a captive heart busted .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 2]: 2 .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 17]: Here a poor prisoner , forsook by the world and friends , fretted his sorrowful life .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 2]: 3 .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 22]: Here a lonely heart broke , and a worn spirit went to its rest , after thirty-seven years of solitary captivity .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 2]: 4 .
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 24]: Here , homeless and friendless , after thirty-seven years of bitter captivity , perished a noble stranger , natural son of Louis XIV .
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 16]: Tom 's voice trembled whilst he was reading them , and he most broke down .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 44]: When he got done he could n't no way make up his mind which one for Jim to scrabble on to the wall , they was all so good ; but at last he allowed he would let him scrabble them all on .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 61]: Jim said it would take him a year to scrabble such a lot of truck on to the logs with a nail , and he did n't know how to make letters , besides ; but Tom said he would block them out for him , and then he would n't have nothing to do but just follow the lines .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 39]: Then pretty soon he says : `` Come to think , the logs ai n't a-going to do ; they do n't have log walls in a dungeon : we got to dig the inscriptions into a rock .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 7]: We 'll fetch a rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 34]: Jim said the rock was worse than the logs ; he said it would take him such a pison long time to dig them into a rock he would n't ever get out .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 12]: But Tom said he would let me help him do it .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 18]: Then he took a look to see how me and Jim was getting along with the pens .
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 49]: It was most pesky tedious hard work and slow , and did n't give my hands no show to get well of the sores , and we did n't seem to make no headway , hardly ; so Tom says : `` I know how to fix it .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 26]: We got to have a rock for the coat of arms and mournful inscriptions , and we can kill two birds with that same rock .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 38]: There 's a gaudy big grindstone down at the mill , and we 'll smouch it , and carve the things on it , and file out the pens and the saw on it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 28]: It war n't no slouch of an idea ; and it war n't no slouch of a grindstone nuther ; but we allowed we 'd tackle it .
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 20]: It war n't quite midnight yet , so we cleared out for the mill , leaving Jim at work .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 22]: We smouched the grindstone , and set out to roll her home , but it was a most nation tough job .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 26]: Sometimes , do what we could , we could n't keep her from falling over , and she come mighty near mashing us every time .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 18]: Tom said she was going to get one of us , sure , before we got through .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 20]: We got her half way ; and then we was plumb played out , and most drownded with sweat .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 16]: We see it war n't no use ; we got to go and fetch Jim .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 54]: So he raised up his bed and slid the chain off of the bed-leg , and wrapt it round and round his neck , and we crawled out through our hole and down there , and Jim and me laid into that grindstone and walked her along like nothing ; and Tom superintended .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 9]: He could out-superintend any boy I ever see .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 7]: He knowed how to do everything .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 31]: Our hole was pretty big , but it war n't big enough to get the grindstone through ; but Jim he took the pick and soon made it big enough .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 76]: Then Tom marked out them things on it with the nail , and set Jim to work on them , with the nail for a chisel and an iron bolt from the rubbage in the lean-to for a hammer , and told him to work till the rest of his candle quit on him , and then he could go to bed , and hide the grindstone under his straw tick and sleep on it .
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 19]: Then we helped him fix his chain back on the bed-leg , and was ready for bed ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 20]: But Tom thought of something , and says : `` You got any spiders in here , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 16]: `` No , sah , thanks to goodness I hai n't , Mars Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 11]: `` All right , we 'll get you some . ''
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 13]: `` But bless you , honey , I doan ' WANT none .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 6]: I 's afeard un um .
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 11]: I jis ' 's soon have rattlesnakes aroun ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 17]: Tom thought a minute or two , and says : `` It 's a good idea .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 8]: And I reckon it 's been done .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 11]: It MUST a been done ; it stands to reason .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 9]: Yes , it 's a prime good idea .
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 7]: Where could you keep it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 8]: `` Keep what , Mars Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 7]: `` Why , a rattlesnake . ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 9]: `` De goodness gracious alive , Mars Tom !
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 31]: Why , if dey was a rattlesnake to come in heah I 'd take en bust right out thoo dat log wall , I would , wid my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 16]: `` Why , Jim , you would n't be afraid of it after a little .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 6]: You could tame it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 5]: `` TAME it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 6]: `` Yes -- easy enough .
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 22]: Every animal is grateful for kindness and petting , and they would n't THINK of hurting a person that pets them .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 7]: Any book will tell you that .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 17]: You try -- that 's all I ask ; just try for two or three days .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 52]: Why , you can get him so , in a little while , that he 'll love you ; and sleep with you ; and wo n't stay away from you a minute ; and will let you wrap him round your neck and put his head in your mouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 11]: `` PLEASE , Mars Tom -- DOAN ' talk so !
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 7]: I ca n't STAN ' it !
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 19]: He 'd LET me shove his head in my mouf -- fer a favor , hai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 18]: I lay he 'd wait a pow ` ful long time ` fo ' I AST him .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 17]: En mo ' en dat , I doan ' WANT him to sleep wid me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 9]: `` Jim , do n't act so foolish .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 56]: A prisoner 's GOT to have some kind of a dumb pet , and if a rattlesnake hai n't ever been tried , why , there 's more glory to be gained in your being the first to ever try it than any other way you could ever think of to save your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 14]: `` Why , Mars Tom , I doan ' WANT no sich glory .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 15]: Snake take 'n bite Jim 's chin off , den WHAH is de glory ?
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 14]: No , sah , I doan ' want no sich doin 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 9]: `` Blame it , ca n't you TRY ?
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 20]: I only WANT you to try -- you need n't keep it up if it do n't work . ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 19]: `` But de trouble all DONE ef de snake bite me while I 's a tryin ' him .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 44]: Mars Tom , I 's willin ' to tackle mos ' anything ` at ai n't onreasonable , but ef you en Huck fetches a rattlesnake in heah for me to tame , I 's gwyne to LEAVE , dat 's SHORE . ''
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 21]: `` Well , then , let it go , let it go , if you 're so bull-headed about it .
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 34]: We can get you some garter-snakes , and you can tie some buttons on their tails , and let on they 're rattlesnakes , and I reckon that 'll have to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 29]: `` I k 'n stan ' DEM , Mars Tom , but blame ' ' f I couldn ' get along widout um , I tell you dat .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 21]: I never knowed b ` fo ' ' t was so much bother and trouble to be a prisoner . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 12]: `` Well , it ALWAYS is when it 's done right .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 8]: You got any rats around here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 12]: `` No , sah , I hai n't seed none . ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 11]: `` Well , we 'll get you some rats . ''
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 13]: `` Why , Mars Tom , I doan ' WANT no rats .

Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 15]: `` But , Jim , you GOT to have 'em -- they all do .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 10]: So do n't make no more fuss about it .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 7]: Prisoners ai n't ever without rats .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 8]: There ai n't no instance of it .
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 24]: And they train them , and pet them , and learn them tricks , and they get to be as sociable as flies .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 9]: But you got to play music to them .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 9]: You got anything to play music on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 36]: `` I ain ' got nuffn but a coase comb en a piece o ' paper , en a juice-harp ; but I reck 'n dey wouldn ' take no stock in a juice-harp . ''
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 5]: `` Yes they would .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 11]: THEY do n't care what kind of music 't is .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 10]: A jews-harp 's plenty good enough for a rat .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 13]: All animals like music -- in a prison they dote on it .
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 18]: Specially , painful music ; and you ca n't get no other kind out of a jews-harp .
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 17]: It always interests them ; they come out to see what 's the matter with you .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 13]: Yes , you 're all right ; you 're fixed very well .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 82]: You want to set on your bed nights before you go to sleep , and early in the mornings , and play your jews-harp ; play ` The Last Link is Broken ' -- that 's the thing that 'll scoop a rat quicker 'n anything else ; and when you 've played about two minutes you 'll see all the rats , and the snakes , and spiders , and things begin to feel worried about you , and come .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 17]: And they 'll just fairly swarm over you , and have a noble good time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 24]: `` Yes , DEY will , I reck ` n , Mars Tom , but what kine er time is JIM havin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 8]: Blest if I kin see de pint .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 10]: But I 'll do it ef I got to .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 20]: I reck 'n I better keep de animals satisfied , en not have no trouble in de house . ''
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 32]: Tom waited to think it over , and see if there was n't nothing else ; and pretty soon he says : `` Oh , there 's one thing I forgot .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 12]: Could you raise a flower here , do you reckon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 49]: `` I doan know but maybe I could , Mars Tom ; but it 's tolable dark in heah , en I ain ' got no use f ' r no flower , nohow , en she 'd be a pow ` ful sight o ' trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 9]: `` Well , you try it , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 8]: Some other prisoners has done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 35]: `` One er dem big cat-tail-lookin ' mullen-stalks would grow in heah , Mars Tom , I reck ` n , but she would n't be wuth half de trouble she 'd coss . ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 7]: `` Do n't you believe it .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 21]: We 'll fetch you a little one and you plant it in the corner over there , and raise it .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 23]: And do n't call it mullen , call it Pitchiola -- that 's its right name when it 's in a prison .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 11]: And you want to water it with your tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 13]: `` Why , I got plenty spring water , Mars Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 17]: `` You do n't WANT spring water ; you want to water it with your tears .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 9]: It 's the way they always do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 31]: `` Why , Mars Tom , I lay I kin raise one er dem mullen-stalks twyste wid spring water whiles another man 's a START 'N one wid tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 7]: `` That ai n't the idea .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 9]: You GOT to do it with tears . ''
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 25]: `` She 'll die on my han 's , Mars Tom , she sholy will ; kase I doan ' skasely ever cry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 5]: So Tom was stumped .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 23]: But he studied it over , and then said Jim would have to worry along the best he could with an onion .
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 24]: He promised he would go to the nigger cabins and drop one , private , in Jim 's coffee-pot , in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 149]: Jim said he would `` jis ' 's soon have tobacker in his coffee ; '' and found so much fault with it , and with the work and bother of raising the mullen , and jews-harping the rats , and petting and flattering up the snakes and spiders and things , on top of all the other work he had to do on pens , and inscriptions , and journals , and things , which made it more trouble and worry and responsibility to be a prisoner than anything he ever undertook , that Tom most lost all patience with him ; and said he was just loadened down with more gaudier chances than a prisoner ever had in the world to make a name for himself , and yet he did n't know enough to appreciate them , and they was just about wasted on him .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 25]: So Jim he was sorry , and said he would n't behave so no more , and then me and Tom shoved for bed .
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 3]: CHAPTER XXXIX .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 58]: IN the morning we went up to the village and bought a wire rat-trap and fetched it down , and unstopped the best rat-hole , and in about an hour we had fifteen of the bulliest kind of ones ; and then we took it and put it in a safe place under Aunt Sally 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 77]: But while we was gone for spiders little Thomas Franklin Benjamin Jefferson Elexander Phelps found it there , and opened the door of it to see if the rats would come out , and they did ; and Aunt Sally she come in , and when we got back she was a-standing on top of the bed raising Cain , and the rats was doing what they could to keep off the dull times for her .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 50]: So she took and dusted us both with the hickry , and we was as much as two hours catching another fifteen or sixteen , drat that meddlesome cub , and they war n't the likeliest , nuther , because the first haul was the pick of the flock .
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 15]: I never see a likelier lot of rats than what that first haul was .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 39]: We got a splendid stock of sorted spiders , and bugs , and frogs , and caterpillars , and one thing or another ; and we like to got a hornet 's nest , but we did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 6]: The family was at home .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 40]: We did n't give it right up , but stayed with them as long as we could ; because we allowed we 'd tire them out or they 'd got to tire us out , and they done it .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 25]: Then we got allycumpain and rubbed on the places , and was pretty near all right again , but could n't set down convenient .
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 52]: And so we went for the snakes , and grabbed a couple of dozen garters and house-snakes , and put them in a bag , and put it in our room , and by that time it was supper-time , and a rattling good honest day 's work : and hungry ?
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 9]: -- oh , no , I reckon not !
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 31]: And there war n't a blessed snake up there when we went back -- we did n't half tie the sack , and they worked out somehow , and left .
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 16]: But it did n't matter much , because they was still on the premises somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 11]: So we judged we could get some of them again .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 18]: No , there war n't no real scarcity of snakes about the house for a considerable spell .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 43]: You 'd see them dripping from the rafters and places every now and then ; and they generly landed in your plate , or down the back of your neck , and most of the time where you did n't want them .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 87]: Well , they was handsome and striped , and there war n't no harm in a million of them ; but that never made no difference to Aunt Sally ; she despised snakes , be the breed what they might , and she could n't stand them no way you could fix it ; and every time one of them flopped down on her , it did n't make no difference what she was doing , she would just lay that work down and light out .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 7]: I never see such a woman .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 9]: And you could hear her whoop to Jericho .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 16]: You could n't get her to take a-holt of one of them with the tongs .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 27]: And if she turned over and found one in bed she would scramble out and lift a howl that you would think the house was afire .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 22]: She disturbed the old man so that he said he could most wish there had n't ever been no snakes created .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 65]: Why , after every last snake had been gone clear out of the house for as much as a week Aunt Sally war n't over it yet ; she war n't near over it ; when she was setting thinking about something you could touch her on the back of her neck with a feather and she would jump right out of her stockings .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 5]: It was very curious .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 9]: But Tom said all women was just so .
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 13]: He said they was made that way for some reason or other .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 39]: We got a licking every time one of our snakes come in her way , and she allowed these lickings war n't nothing to what she would do if we ever loaded up the place again with them .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 28]: I did n't mind the lickings , because they did n't amount to nothing ; but I minded the trouble we had to lay in another lot .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 38]: But we got them laid in , and all the other things ; and you never see a cabin as blithesome as Jim 's was when they 'd all swarm out for music and go for him .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 31]: Jim did n't like the spiders , and the spiders did n't like Jim ; and so they 'd lay for him , and make it mighty warm for him .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 135]: And he said that between the rats and the snakes and the grindstone there war n't no room in bed for him , skasely ; and when there was , a body could n't sleep , it was so lively , and it was always lively , he said , because THEY never all slept at one time , but took turn about , so when the snakes was asleep the rats was on deck , and when the rats turned in the snakes come on watch , so he always had one gang under him , in his way , and t ` other gang having a circus over him , and if he got up to hunt a new place the spiders would take a chance at him as he crossed over .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 23]: He said if he ever got out this time he would n't ever be a prisoner again , not for a salary .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 15]: Well , by the end of three weeks everything was in pretty good shape .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 76]: The shirt was sent in early , in a pie , and every time a rat bit Jim he would get up and write a little in his journal whilst the ink was fresh ; the pens was made , the inscriptions and so on was all carved on the grindstone ; the bed-leg was sawed in two , and we had et up the sawdust , and it give us a most amazing stomach-ache .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 13]: We reckoned we was all going to die , but did n't .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 16]: It was the most undigestible sawdust I ever see ; and Tom said the same .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 33]: But as I was saying , we 'd got all the work done now , at last ; and we was all pretty much fagged out , too , but mainly Jim .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 79]: The old man had wrote a couple of times to the plantation below Orleans to come and get their runaway nigger , but had n't got no answer , because there war n't no such plantation ; so he allowed he would advertise Jim in the St. Louis and New Orleans papers ; and when he mentioned the St. Louis ones it give me the cold shivers , and I see we had n't no time to lose .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 10]: So Tom said , now for the nonnamous letters .
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 6]: `` What 's them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 10]: `` Warnings to the people that something is up .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 10]: Sometimes it 's done one way , sometimes another .
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 17]: But there 's always somebody spying around that gives notice to the governor of the castle .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 4]: When Louis XVI .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 14]: was going to light out of the Tooleries , a servant-girl done it .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 14]: It 's a very good way , and so is the nonnamous letters .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 6]: We 'll use them both .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 28]: And it 's usual for the prisoner 's mother to change clothes with him , and she stays in , and he slides out in her clothes .
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 8]: We 'll do that , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 20]: `` But looky here , Tom , what do we want to WARN anybody for that something 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 14]: Let them find it out for themselves -- it 's their lookout . ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 14]: `` Yes , I know ; but you ca n't depend on them .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 18]: It 's the way they 've acted from the very start -- left us to do EVERYTHING .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 16]: They 're so confiding and mullet-headed they do n't take notice of nothing at all .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 51]: So if we do n't GIVE them notice there wo n't be nobody nor nothing to interfere with us , and so after all our hard work and trouble this escape 'll go off perfectly flat ; wo n't amount to nothing -- wo n't be nothing TO it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 18]: `` Well , as for me , Tom , that 's the way I 'd like . ''
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 4]: `` Shucks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 7]: he says , and looked disgusted .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 15]: So I says : `` But I ai n't going to make no complaint .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 8]: Any way that suits you suits me .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 10]: What you going to do about the servant-girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 6]: `` You 'll be her .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 20]: You slide in , in the middle of the night , and hook that yaller girl 's frock . ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 30]: `` Why , Tom , that 'll make trouble next morning ; because , of course , she prob ` bly hai n't got any but that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 28]: `` I know ; but you do n't want it but fifteen minutes , to carry the nonnamous letter and shove it under the front door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 25]: `` All right , then , I 'll do it ; but I could carry it just as handy in my own togs . ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 14]: `` You would n't look like a servant-girl THEN , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 19]: `` No , but there wo n't be nobody to see what I look like , ANYWAY . ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 11]: `` That ai n't got nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 26]: The thing for us to do is just to do our DUTY , and not worry about whether anybody SEES us do it or not .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 10]: Hai n't you got no principle at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 15]: `` All right , I ai n't saying nothing ; I 'm the servant-girl .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 7]: Who 's Jim 's mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 6]: `` I 'm his mother .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 10]: I 'll hook a gown from Aunt Sally . ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 20]: `` Well , then , you 'll have to stay in the cabin when me and Jim leaves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 4]: `` Not much .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 45]: I 'll stuff Jim 's clothes full of straw and lay it on his bed to represent his mother in disguise , and Jim 'll take the nigger woman 's gown off of me and wear it , and we 'll all evade together .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 12]: When a prisoner of style escapes it 's called an evasion .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 14]: It 's always called so when a king escapes , f ` rinstance .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 27]: And the same with a king 's son ; it do n't make no difference whether he 's a natural one or an unnatural one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 39]: So Tom he wrote the nonnamous letter , and I smouched the yaller wench 's frock that night , and put it on , and shoved it under the front door , the way Tom told me to .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 5]: It said : Beware .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 4]: Trouble is brewing .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 5]: Keep a sharp lookout .
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 3]: UNKNOWN FRIEND .
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 36]: Next night we stuck a picture , which Tom drawed in blood , of a skull and crossbones on the front door ; and next night another one of a coffin on the back door .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 10]: I never see a family in such a sweat .
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 31]: They could n't a been worse scared if the place had a been full of ghosts laying for them behind everything and under the beds and shivering through the air .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 15]: If a door banged , Aunt Sally she jumped and said `` ouch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 12]: if anything fell , she jumped and said `` ouch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 86]: if you happened to touch her , when she war n't noticing , she done the same ; she could n't face noway and be satisfied , because she allowed there was something behind her every time -- so she was always a-whirling around sudden , and saying `` ouch , '' and before she 'd got two-thirds around she 'd whirl back again , and say it again ; and she was afraid to go to bed , but she das n't set up .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 22]: So the thing was working very well , Tom said ; he said he never see a thing work more satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 9]: He said it showed it was done right .
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 10]: So he said , now for the grand bulge !
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 48]: So the very next morning at the streak of dawn we got another letter ready , and was wondering what we better do with it , because we heard them say at supper they was going to have a nigger on watch at both doors all night .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 34]: Tom he went down the lightning-rod to spy around ; and the nigger at the back door was asleep , and he stuck it in the back of his neck and come back .
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 16]: This letter said : Do n't betray me , I wish to be your friend .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 42]: There is a desprate gang of cutthroats from over in the Indian Territory going to steal your runaway nigger to-night , and they have been trying to scare you so as you will stay in the house and not bother them .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 30]: I am one of the gang , but have got religgion and wish to quit it and lead an honest life again , and will betray the helish design .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 31]: They will sneak down from northards , along the fence , at midnight exact , with a false key , and go in the nigger 's cabin to get him .
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 64]: I am to be off a piece and blow a tin horn if I see any danger ; but stead of that I will BA like a sheep soon as they get in and not blow at all ; then whilst they are getting his chains loose , you slip there and lock them in , and can kill them at your leasure .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 24]: Do n't do anything but just the way I am telling you , if you do they will suspicion something and raise whoop-jamboreehoo .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 16]: I do not wish any reward but to know I have done the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 3]: UNKNOWN FRIEND .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 3]: CHAPTER XL .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 197]: WE was feeling pretty good after breakfast , and took my canoe and went over the river a-fishing , with a lunch , and had a good time , and took a look at the raft and found her all right , and got home late to supper , and found them in such a sweat and worry they did n't know which end they was standing on , and made us go right off to bed the minute we was done supper , and would n't tell us what the trouble was , and never let on a word about the new letter , but did n't need to , because we knowed as much about it as anybody did , and as soon as we was half up stairs and her back was turned we slid for the cellar cupboard and loaded up a good lunch and took it up to our room and went to bed , and got up about half-past eleven , and Tom put on Aunt Sally 's dress that he stole and was going to start with the lunch , but says : `` Where 's the butter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 22]: `` I laid out a hunk of it , '' I says , `` on a piece of a corn-pone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 17]: `` Well , you LEFT it laid out , then -- it ai n't here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 12]: `` We can get along without it , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 24]: `` We can get along WITH it , too , '' he says ; `` just you slide down cellar and fetch it .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 11]: And then mosey right down the lightning-rod and come along .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 35]: I 'll go and stuff the straw into Jim 's clothes to represent his mother in disguise , and be ready to BA like a sheep and shove soon as you get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 11]: So out he went , and down cellar went I .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 99]: The hunk of butter , big as a person 's fist , was where I had left it , so I took up the slab of corn-pone with it on , and blowed out my light , and started up stairs very stealthy , and got up to the main floor all right , but here comes Aunt Sally with a candle , and I clapped the truck in my hat , and clapped my hat on my head , and the next second she see me ; and she says : `` You been down cellar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 9]: `` What you been doing down there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 11]: `` Noth ` n. '' `` NOTH ` N ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 5]: `` No 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 18]: `` Well , then , what possessed you to go down there this time of night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 8]: `` I do n't know 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 6]: `` You do n't KNOW ?
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 7]: Do n't answer me that way .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 14]: Tom , I want to know what you been DOING down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 22]: `` I hai n't been doing a single thing , Aunt Sally , I hope to gracious if I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 67]: I reckoned she 'd let me go now , and as a generl thing she would ; but I s ` pose there was so many strange things going on she was just in a sweat about every little thing that war n't yard-stick straight ; so she says , very decided : `` You just march into that setting-room and stay there till I come .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 28]: You been up to something you no business to , and I lay I 'll find out what it is before I 'M done with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 15]: So she went away as I opened the door and walked into the setting-room .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 9]: My , but there was a crowd there !
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 12]: Fifteen farmers , and every one of them had a gun .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 15]: I was most powerful sick , and slunk to a chair and set down .
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 70]: They was setting around , some of them talking a little , in a low voice , and all of them fidgety and uneasy , but trying to look like they war n't ; but I knowed they was , because they was always taking off their hats , and putting them on , and scratching their heads , and changing their seats , and fumbling with their buttons .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 19]: I war n't easy myself , but I did n't take my hat off , all the same .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 78]: I did wish Aunt Sally would come , and get done with me , and lick me , if she wanted to , and let me get away and tell Tom how we 'd overdone this thing , and what a thundering hornet 's - nest we 'd got ourselves into , so we could stop fooling around straight off , and clear out with Jim before these rips got out of patience and come for us .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 213]: At last she come and begun to ask me questions , but I COULD N'T answer them straight , I did n't know which end of me was up ; because these men was in such a fidget now that some was wanting to start right NOW and lay for them desperadoes , and saying it war n't but a few minutes to midnight ; and others was trying to get them to hold on and wait for the sheep-signal ; and here was Aunty pegging away at the questions , and me a-shaking all over and ready to sink down in my tracks I was that scared ; and the place getting hotter and hotter , and the butter beginning to melt and run down my neck and behind my ears ; and pretty soon , when one of them says , `` I 'M for going and getting in the cabin FIRST and right NOW , and catching them when they come , '' I most dropped ; and a streak of butter come a-trickling down my forehead , and Aunt Sally she see it , and turns white as a sheet , and says : `` For the land 's sake , what IS the matter with the child ?
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 19]: He 's got the brain-fever as shore as you 're born , and they 're oozing out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 49]: And everybody runs to see , and she snatches off my hat , and out comes the bread and what was left of the butter , and she grabbed me , and hugged me , and says : `` Oh , what a turn you did give me !
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 84]: and how glad and grateful I am it ai n't no worse ; for luck 's against us , and it never rains but it pours , and when I see that truck I thought we 'd lost you , for I knowed by the color and all it was just like your brains would be if -- Dear , dear , whyd ` nt you TELL me that was what you 'd been down there for , I would n't a cared .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 20]: Now cler out to bed , and do n't lem me see no more of you till morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 25]: I was up stairs in a second , and down the lightning-rod in another one , and shinning through the dark for the lean-to .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 48]: I could n't hardly get my words out , I was so anxious ; but I told Tom as quick as I could we must jump for it now , and not a minute to lose -- the house full of men , yonder , with guns !
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 12]: His eyes just blazed ; and he says : `` No !
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 5]: -- is that so ?
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 5]: AI N'T it bully !
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 20]: Why , Huck , if it was to do over again , I bet I could fetch two hundred !
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 12]: If we could put it off till -- '' `` Hurry !
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 3]: HURRY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 6]: `` Where 's Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 17]: `` Right at your elbow ; if you reach out your arm you can touch him .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 9]: He 's dressed , and everything 's ready .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 11]: Now we 'll slide out and give the sheep-signal . ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 49]: But then we heard the tramp of men coming to the door , and heard them begin to fumble with the pad-lock , and heard a man say : `` I TOLD you we 'd be too soon ; they have n't come -- the door is locked .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 45]: Here , I 'll lock some of you into the cabin , and you lay for 'em in the dark and kill 'em when they come ; and the rest scatter around a piece , and listen if you can hear 'em coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 29]: So in they come , but could n't see us in the dark , and most trod on us whilst we was hustling to get under the bed .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 35]: But we got under all right , and out through the hole , swift but soft -- Jim first , me next , and Tom last , which was according to Tom 's orders .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 14]: Now we was in the lean-to , and heard trampings close by outside .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 61]: So we crept to the door , and Tom stopped us there and put his eye to the crack , but could n't make out nothing , it was so dark ; and whispered and said he would listen for the steps to get further , and when he nudged us Jim must glide out first , and him last .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 134]: So he set his ear to the crack and listened , and listened , and listened , and the steps a-scraping around out there all the time ; and at last he nudged us , and we slid out , and stooped down , not breathing , and not making the least noise , and slipped stealthy towards the fence in Injun file , and got to it all right , and me and Jim over it ; but Tom 's britches catched fast on a splinter on the top rail , and then he hear the steps coming , so he had to pull loose , which snapped the splinter and made a noise ; and as he dropped in our tracks and started somebody sings out : `` Who 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 8]: Answer , or I 'll shoot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 14]: But we did n't answer ; we just unfurled our heels and shoved .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 14]: Then there was a rush , and a BANG , BANG , BANG !
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 8]: and the bullets fairly whizzed around us !
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 11]: We heard them sing out : `` Here they are !
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 7]: They 've broke for the river !
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 12]: After 'em , boys , and turn loose the dogs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 8]: So here they come , full tilt .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 23]: We could hear them because they wore boots and yelled , but we did n't wear no boots and did n't yell .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 36]: We was in the path to the mill ; and when they got pretty close on to us we dodged into the bush and let them go by , and then dropped in behind them .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 152]: They 'd had all the dogs shut up , so they would n't scare off the robbers ; but by this time somebody had let them loose , and here they come , making powwow enough for a million ; but they was our dogs ; so we stopped in our tracks till they catched up ; and when they see it war n't nobody but us , and no excitement to offer them , they only just said howdy , and tore right ahead towards the shouting and clattering ; and then we up-steam again , and whizzed along after them till we was nearly to the mill , and then struck up through the bush to where my canoe was tied , and hopped in and pulled for dear life towards the middle of the river , but did n't make no more noise than we was obleeged to .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 49]: Then we struck out , easy and comfortable , for the island where my raft was ; and we could hear them yelling and barking at each other all up and down the bank , till we was so far away the sounds got dim and died out .
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 38]: And when we stepped on to the raft I says : `` NOW , old Jim , you 're a free man again , and I bet you wo n't ever be a slave no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 13]: `` En a mighty good job it wuz , too , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 37]: It ` uz planned beautiful , en it ` uz done beautiful ; en dey ai n't NOBODY kin git up a plan dat 's mo ' mixed-up en splendid den what dat one wuz . ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 28]: We was all glad as we could be , but Tom was the gladdest of all because he had a bullet in the calf of his leg .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 18]: When me and Jim heard that we did n't feel so brash as what we did before .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 46]: It was hurting him considerable , and bleeding ; so we laid him in the wigwam and tore up one of the duke 's shirts for to bandage him , but he says : `` Gim me the rags ; I can do it myself .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 28]: Do n't stop now ; do n't fool around here , and the evasion booming along so handsome ; man the sweeps , and set her loose !
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 7]: Boys , we done it elegant !
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 6]: -- ` deed we did .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 29]: I wish WE 'D a had the handling of Louis XVI. , there would n't a been no ` Son of Saint Louis , ascend to heaven ! '
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 42]: wrote down in HIS biography ; no , sir , we 'd a whooped him over the BORDER -- that 's what we 'd a done with HIM -- and done it just as slick as nothing at all , too .
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 9]: Man the sweeps -- man the sweeps ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 10]: But me and Jim was consulting -- and thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 18]: And after we 'd thought a minute , I says : `` Say it , Jim . ''
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 20]: So he says : `` Well , den , dis is de way it look to me , Huck .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 47]: Ef it wuz HIM dat ` uz bein ' sot free , en one er de boys wuz to git shot , would he say , ` Go on en save me , nemmine ` bout a doctor f ' r to save dis one ? '
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 7]: Is dat like Mars Tom Sawyer ?
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 5]: Would he say dat ?
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: You BET he would n't !
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 11]: WELL , den , is JIM gywne to say it ?
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 27]: No , sah -- I doan ' budge a step out 'n dis place ` dout a DOCTOR , not if it 's forty year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 36]: I knowed he was white inside , and I reckoned he 'd say what he did say -- so it was all right now , and I told Tom I was a-going for a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 39]: He raised considerable row about it , but me and Jim stuck to it and would n't budge ; so he was for crawling out and setting the raft loose himself ; but we would n't let him .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 18]: Then he give us a piece of his mind , but it did n't do no good .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 40]: So when he sees me getting the canoe ready , he says : `` Well , then , if you 're bound to go , I 'll tell you the way to do when you get to the village .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 109]: Shut the door and blindfold the doctor tight and fast , and make him swear to be silent as the grave , and put a purse full of gold in his hand , and then take and lead him all around the back alleys and everywheres in the dark , and then fetch him here in the canoe , in a roundabout way amongst the islands , and search him and take his chalk away from him , and do n't give it back to him till you get him back to the village , or else he will chalk this raft so he can find it again .
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 9]: It 's the way they all do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 29]: So I said I would , and left , and Jim was to hide in the woods when he see the doctor coming till he was gone again .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLI .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 20]: THE doctor was an old man ; a very nice , kind-looking old man when I got him up .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 87]: I told him me and my brother was over on Spanish Island hunting yesterday afternoon , and camped on a piece of a raft we found , and about midnight he must a kicked his gun in his dreams , for it went off and shot him in the leg , and we wanted him to go over there and fix it and not say nothing about it , nor let anybody know , because we wanted to come home this evening and surprise the folks .
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 7]: `` Who is your folks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 8]: `` The Phelpses , down yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 7]: `` Oh , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 18]: And after a minute , he says : `` How 'd you say he got shot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 17]: `` He had a dream , '' I says , `` and it shot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 8]: `` Singular dream , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 16]: So he lit up his lantern , and got his saddle-bags , and we started .
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 32]: But when he sees the canoe he did n't like the look of her -- said she was big enough for one , but did n't look pretty safe for two .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 24]: I says : `` Oh , you need n't be afeard , sir , she carried the three of us easy enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 5]: `` What three ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 22]: `` Why , me and Sid , and -- and -- and THE GUNS ; that 's what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 7]: `` Oh , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 30]: But he put his foot on the gunnel and rocked her , and shook his head , and said he reckoned he 'd look around for a bigger one .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 51]: But they was all locked and chained ; so he took my canoe , and said for me to wait till he come back , or I could hunt around further , or maybe I better go down home and get them ready for the surprise if I wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 23]: But I said I did n't ; so I told him just how to find the raft , and then he started .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 7]: I struck an idea pretty soon .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 28]: I says to myself , spos 'n he ca n't fix that leg just in three shakes of a sheep 's tail , as the saying is ?
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 10]: spos 'n it takes him three or four days ?
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 7]: What are we going to do ?
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 14]: -- lay around there till he lets the cat out of the bag ?
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 11]: No , sir ; I know what I 'LL do .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 78]: I 'll wait , and when he comes back if he says he 's got to go any more I 'll get down there , too , if I swim ; and we 'll take and tie him , and keep him , and shove out down the river ; and when Tom 's done with him we 'll give him what it 's worth , or all we got , and then let him get ashore .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 27]: So then I crept into a lumber-pile to get some sleep ; and next time I waked up the sun was away up over my head !
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 33]: I shot out and went for the doctor 's house , but they told me he 'd gone away in the night some time or other , and war n't back yet .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 23]: Well , thinks I , that looks powerful bad for Tom , and I 'll dig out for the island right off .
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 21]: So away I shoved , and turned the corner , and nearly rammed my head into Uncle Silas 's stomach !
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 8]: He says : `` Why , TOM !
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 11]: Where you been all this time , you rascal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 25]: `` I hai n't been nowheres , '' I says , `` only just hunting for the runaway nigger -- me and Sid . ''
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 10]: `` Why , where ever did you go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 9]: `` Your aunt 's been mighty uneasy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 16]: `` She need n't , '' I says , `` because we was all right .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 129]: We followed the men and the dogs , but they outrun us , and we lost them ; but we thought we heard them on the water , so we got a canoe and took out after them and crossed over , but could n't find nothing of them ; so we cruised along up-shore till we got kind of tired and beat out ; and tied up the canoe and went to sleep , and never waked up till about an hour ago ; then we paddled over here to hear the news , and Sid 's at the post-office to see what he can hear , and I 'm a-branching out to get something to eat for us , and then we 're going home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 80]: So then we went to the post-office to get `` Sid '' ; but just as I suspicioned , he war n't there ; so the old man he got a letter out of the office , and we waited awhile longer , but Sid did n't come ; so the old man said , come along , let Sid foot it home , or canoe it , when he got done fooling around -- but we would ride .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 41]: I could n't get him to let me stay and wait for Sid ; and he said there war n't no use in it , and I must come along , and let Aunt Sally see we was all right .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 50]: When we got home Aunt Sally was that glad to see me she laughed and cried both , and hugged me , and give me one of them lickings of hern that do n't amount to shucks , and said she 'd serve Sid the same when he come .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 25]: And the place was plum full of farmers and farmers ' wives , to dinner ; and such another clack a body never heard .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 15]: Old Mrs. Hotchkiss was the worst ; her tongue was a-going all the time .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 27]: She says : `` Well , Sister Phelps , I 've ransacked that-air cabin over , an ' I b ` lieve the nigger was crazy .

Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 11]: They stole that shirt right off o ' the line !

Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 18]: I hope to gracious if I war n't afraid they 'd steal some o ' the family !
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 16]: I was just to that pass I did n't have no reasoning faculties no more .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 54]: It looks foolish enough NOW , in the daytime ; but I says to myself , there 's my two poor boys asleep , ` way up stairs in that lonesome room , and I declare to goodness I was that uneasy ' t I crep ' up there and locked 'em in !
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 3]: I DID .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 4]: And anybody would .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 112]: Because , you know , when you get scared that way , and it keeps running on , and getting worse and worse all the time , and your wits gets to addling , and you get to doing all sorts o ' wild things , and by and by you think to yourself , spos 'n I was a boy , and was away up there , and the door ai n't locked , and you -- '' She stopped , looking kind of wondering , and then she turned her head around slow , and when her eye lit on me -- I got up and took a walk .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 34]: Says I to myself , I can explain better how we come to not be in that room this morning if I go out to one side and study over it a little .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 5]: So I done it .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 15]: But I das n't go fur , or she 'd a sent for me .
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 75]: And when it was late in the day the people all went , and then I come in and told her the noise and shooting waked up me and `` Sid , '' and the door was locked , and we wanted to see the fun , so we went down the lightning-rod , and both of us got hurt a little , and we did n't never want to try THAT no more .
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 104]: And then I went on and told her all what I told Uncle Silas before ; and then she said she 'd forgive us , and maybe it was all right enough anyway , and about what a body might expect of boys , for all boys was a pretty harum-scarum lot as fur as she could see ; and so , as long as no harm had n't come of it , she judged she better put in her time being grateful we was alive and well and she had us still , stead of fretting over what was past and done .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 48]: So then she kissed me , and patted me on the head , and dropped into a kind of a brown study ; and pretty soon jumps up , and says : `` Why , lawsamercy , it 's most night , and Sid not come yet !
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 8]: What HAS become of that boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 28]: I see my chance ; so I skips up and says : `` I 'll run right up to town and get him , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 10]: `` No you wo n't , '' she says .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 20]: `` You 'll stay right wher ' you are ; ONE 'S enough to be lost at a time .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 14]: If he ai n't here to supper , your uncle 'll go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 16]: Well , he war n't there to supper ; so right after supper uncle went .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 18]: He come back about ten a little bit uneasy ; had n't run across Tom 's track .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 45]: Aunt Sally was a good DEAL uneasy ; but Uncle Silas he said there war n't no occasion to be -- boys will be boys , he said , and you 'll see this one turn up in the morning all sound and right .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 7]: So she had to be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 24]: But she said she 'd set up for him a while anyway , and keep a light burning so he could see it .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 195]: And then when I went up to bed she come up with me and fetched her candle , and tucked me in , and mothered me so good I felt mean , and like I could n't look her in the face ; and she set down on the bed and talked with me a long time , and said what a splendid boy Sid was , and did n't seem to want to ever stop talking about him ; and kept asking me every now and then if I reckoned he could a got lost , or hurt , or maybe drownded , and might be laying at this minute somewheres suffering or dead , and she not by him to help him , and so the tears would drip down silent , and I would tell her that Sid was all right , and would be home in the morning , sure ; and she would squeeze my hand , or maybe kiss me , and tell me to say it again , and keep on saying it , because it done her good , and she was in so much trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 51]: And when she was going away she looked down in my eyes so steady and gentle , and says : `` The door ai n't going to be locked , Tom , and there 's the window and the rod ; but you 'll be good , WO N'T you ?
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 6]: And you wo n't go ?
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 5]: For MY sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 33]: Laws knows I WANTED to go bad enough to see about Tom , and was all intending to go ; but after that I would n't a went , not for kingdoms .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 19]: But she was on my mind and Tom was on my mind , so I slept very restless .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 71]: And twice I went down the rod away in the night , and slipped around front , and see her setting there by her candle in the window with her eyes towards the road and the tears in them ; and I wished I could do something for her , but I could n't , only to swear that I would n't never do nothing to grieve her any more .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 43]: And the third time I waked up at dawn , and slid down , and she was there yet , and her candle was most out , and her old gray head was resting on her hand , and she was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 3]: CHAPTER XLII .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 48]: THE old man was uptown again before breakfast , but could n't get no track of Tom ; and both of them set at the table thinking , and not saying nothing , and looking mournful , and their coffee getting cold , and not eating anything .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 18]: And by and by the old man says : `` Did I give you the letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 5]: `` What letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 12]: `` The one I got yesterday out of the post-office . ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 12]: `` No , you did n't give me no letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 10]: `` Well , I must a forgot it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 28]: So he rummaged his pockets , and then went off somewheres where he had laid it down , and fetched it , and give it to her .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 18]: She says : `` Why , it 's from St. Petersburg -- it 's from Sis . ''
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 15]: I allowed another walk would do me good ; but I could n't stir .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 18]: But before she could break it open she dropped it and run -- for she see something .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 5]: And so did I .
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 34]: It was Tom Sawyer on a mattress ; and that old doctor ; and Jim , in HER calico dress , with his hands tied behind him ; and a lot of people .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 15]: I hid the letter behind the first thing that come handy , and rushed .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 29]: She flung herself at Tom , crying , and says : `` Oh , he 's dead , he 's dead , I know he 's dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 43]: And Tom he turned his head a little , and muttered something or other , which showed he war n't in his right mind ; then she flung up her hands , and says : `` He 's alive , thank God !
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 6]: And that 's enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 46]: and she snatched a kiss of him , and flew for the house to get the bed ready , and scattering orders right and left at the niggers and everybody else , as fast as her tongue could go , every jump of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 29]: I followed the men to see what they was going to do with Jim ; and the old doctor and Uncle Silas followed after Tom into the house .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 60]: The men was very huffy , and some of them wanted to hang Jim for an example to all the other niggers around there , so they would n't be trying to run away like Jim done , and making such a raft of trouble , and keeping a whole family scared most to death for days and nights .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 38]: But the others said , do n't do it , it would n't answer at all ; he ai n't our nigger , and his owner would turn up and make us pay for him , sure .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 53]: So that cooled them down a little , because the people that 's always the most anxious for to hang a nigger that hai n't done just right is always the very ones that ai n't the most anxious to pay for him when they 've got their satisfaction out of him .
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 221]: They cussed Jim considerble , though , and give him a cuff or two side the head once in a while , but Jim never said nothing , and he never let on to know me , and they took him to the same cabin , and put his own clothes on him , and chained him again , and not to no bed-leg this time , but to a big staple drove into the bottom log , and chained his hands , too , and both legs , and said he war n't to have nothing but bread and water to eat after this till his owner come , or he was sold at auction because he did n't come in a certain length of time , and filled up our hole , and said a couple of farmers with guns must stand watch around about the cabin every night , and a bulldog tied to the door in the daytime ; and about this time they was through with the job and was tapering off with a kind of generl good-bye cussing , and then the old doctor comes and takes a look , and says : `` Do n't be no rougher on him than you 're obleeged to , because he ai n't a bad nigger .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 149]: When I got to where I found the boy I see I could n't cut the bullet out without some help , and he war n't in no condition for me to leave to go and get help ; and he got a little worse and a little worse , and after a long time he went out of his head , and would n't let me come a-nigh him any more , and said if I chalked his raft he 'd kill me , and no end of wild foolishness like that , and I see I could n't do anything at all with him ; so I says , I got to have HELP somehow ; and the minute I says it out crawls this nigger from somewheres and says he 'll help , and he done it , too , and done it very well .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 16]: Of course I judged he must be a runaway nigger , and there I WAS !
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 19]: and there I had to stick right straight along all the rest of the day and all night .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 9]: It was a fix , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 59]: I had a couple of patients with the chills , and of course I 'd of liked to run up to town and see them , but I das n't , because the nigger might get away , and then I 'd be to blame ; and yet never a skiff come close enough for me to hail .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 58]: So there I had to stick plumb until daylight this morning ; and I never see a nigger that was a better nuss or faithfuller , and yet he was risking his freedom to do it , and was all tired out , too , and I see plain enough he 'd been worked main hard lately .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 29]: I liked the nigger for that ; I tell you , gentlemen , a nigger like that is worth a thousand dollars -- and kind treatment , too .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 124]: I had everything I needed , and the boy was doing as well there as he would a done at home -- better , maybe , because it was so quiet ; but there I WAS , with both of 'm on my hands , and there I had to stick till about dawn this morning ; then some men in a skiff come by , and as good luck would have it the nigger was setting by the pallet with his head propped on his knees sound asleep ; so I motioned them in quiet , and they slipped up on him and grabbed him and tied him before he knowed what he was about , and we never had no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 49]: And the boy being in a kind of a flighty sleep , too , we muffled the oars and hitched the raft on , and towed her over very nice and quiet , and the nigger never made the least row nor said a word from the start .
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 18]: He ai n't no bad nigger , gentlemen ; that 's what I think about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 20]: Somebody says : `` Well , it sounds very good , doctor , I 'm obleeged to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 63]: Then the others softened up a little , too , and I was mighty thankful to that old doctor for doing Jim that good turn ; and I was glad it was according to my judgment of him , too ; because I thought he had a good heart in him and was a good man the first time I see him .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 25]: Then they all agreed that Jim had acted very well , and was deserving to have some notice took of it , and reward .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 21]: So every one of them promised , right out and hearty , that they would n't cuss him no more .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 9]: Then they come out and locked him up .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 126]: I hoped they was going to say he could have one or two of the chains took off , because they was rotten heavy , or could have meat and greens with his bread and water ; but they did n't think of it , and I reckoned it war n't best for me to mix in , but I judged I 'd get the doctor 's yarn to Aunt Sally somehow or other as soon as I 'd got through the breakers that was laying just ahead of me -- explanations , I mean , of how I forgot to mention about Sid being shot when I was telling how him and me put in that dratted night paddling around hunting the runaway nigger .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 6]: But I had plenty time .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 26]: Aunt Sally she stuck to the sick-room all day and all night , and every time I see Uncle Silas mooning around I dodged him .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 23]: Next morning I heard Tom was a good deal better , and they said Aunt Sally was gone to get a nap .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 28]: So I slips to the sick-room , and if I found him awake I reckoned we could put up a yarn for the family that would wash .
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 25]: But he was sleeping , and sleeping very peaceful , too ; and pale , not fire-faced the way he was when he come .
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 11]: So I set down and laid for him to wake .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 21]: In about half an hour Aunt Sally comes gliding in , and there I was , up a stump again !
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 68]: She motioned me to be still , and set down by me , and begun to whisper , and said we could all be joyful now , because all the symptoms was first-rate , and he 'd been sleeping like that for ever so long , and looking better and peacefuller all the time , and ten to one he 'd wake up in his right mind .
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 33]: So we set there watching , and by and by he stirs a bit , and opened his eyes very natural , and takes a look , and says : `` Hello !
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 8]: -- why , I 'm at HOME !
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 4]: How 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 6]: Where 's the raft ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 10]: `` It 's all right , '' I says .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 5]: `` And JIM ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 16]: `` The same , '' I says , but could n't say it pretty brash .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 11]: But he never noticed , but says : `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 2]: Splendid !
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 8]: NOW we 're all right and safe !
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 6]: Did you tell Aunty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 21]: I was going to say yes ; but she chipped in and says : `` About what , Sid ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 13]: `` Why , about the way the whole thing was done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 6]: `` What whole thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 7]: `` Why , THE whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 19]: There ai n't but one ; how we set the runaway nigger free -- me and Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 4]: `` Good land !
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 11]: Set the run -- What IS the child talking about !
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 11]: Dear , dear , out of his head again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 20]: `` NO , I ai n't out of my HEAD ; I know all what I 'm talking about .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 10]: We DID set him free -- me and Tom .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 12]: We laid out to do it , and we DONE it .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 9]: And we done it elegant , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 40]: He 'd got a start , and she never checked him up , just set and stared and stared , and let him clip along , and I see it war n't no use for ME to put in .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 30]: `` Why , Aunty , it cost us a power of work -- weeks of it -- hours and hours , every night , whilst you was all asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 84]: And we had to steal candles , and the sheet , and the shirt , and your dress , and spoons , and tin plates , and case-knives , and the warming-pan , and the grindstone , and flour , and just no end of things , and you ca n't think what work it was to make the saws , and pens , and inscriptions , and one thing or another , and you ca n't think HALF the fun it was .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 72]: And we had to make up the pictures of coffins and things , and nonnamous letters from the robbers , and get up and down the lightning-rod , and dig the hole into the cabin , and made the rope ladder and send it in cooked up in a pie , and send in spoons and things to work with in your apron pocket -- '' `` Mercy sakes ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 149]: -- and load up the cabin with rats and snakes and so on , for company for Jim ; and then you kept Tom here so long with the butter in his hat that you come near spiling the whole business , because the men come before we was out of the cabin , and we had to rush , and they heard us and let drive at us , and I got my share , and we dodged out of the path and let them go by , and when the dogs come they war n't interested in us , but went for the most noise , and we got our canoe , and made for the raft , and was all safe , and Jim was a free man , and we done it all by ourselves , and WAS N'T it bully , Aunty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 16]: `` Well , I never heard the likes of it in all my born days !
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 33]: So it was YOU , you little rapscallions , that 's been making all this trouble , and turned everybody 's wits clean inside out and scared us all most to death .
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 24]: I 've as good a notion as ever I had in my life to take it out o ' you this very minute .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 42]: To think , here I 've been , night after night , a -- YOU just get well once , you young scamp , and I lay I 'll tan the Old Harry out o ' both o ' ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 88]: But Tom , he WAS so proud and joyful , he just COULD N'T hold in , and his tongue just WENT it -- she a-chipping in , and spitting fire all along , and both of them going it at once , like a cat convention ; and she says : `` WELL , you get all the enjoyment you can out of it NOW , for mind I tell you if I catch you meddling with him again -- '' `` Meddling with WHO ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 10]: Tom says , dropping his smile and looking surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 4]: `` With WHO ?
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 9]: Why , the runaway nigger , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 6]: Who 'd you reckon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 24]: Tom looks at me very grave , and says : `` Tom , did n't you just tell me he was all right ?
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 7]: Has n't he got away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 4]: `` HIM ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 9]: says Aunt Sally ; `` the runaway nigger ?
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 6]: ` Deed he has n't .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 37]: They 've got him back , safe and sound , and he 's in that cabin again , on bread and water , and loaded down with chains , till he 's claimed or sold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 38]: Tom rose square up in bed , with his eye hot , and his nostrils opening and shutting like gills , and sings out to me : `` They hai n't no RIGHT to shut him up !
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 2]: SHOVE !
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 9]: -- and do n't you lose a minute .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 4]: Turn him loose !
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 19]: he ai n't no slave ; he 's as free as any cretur that walks this earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 8]: `` What DOES the child mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 22]: `` I mean every word I SAY , Aunt Sally , and if somebody do n't go , I 'LL go .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 15]: I 've knowed him all his life , and so has Tom , there .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 37]: Old Miss Watson died two months ago , and she was ashamed she ever was going to sell him down the river , and SAID so ; and she set him free in her will . ''
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 21]: `` Then what on earth did YOU want to set him free for , seeing he was already free ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 17]: `` Well , that IS a question , I must say ; and just like women !
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 26]: Why , I wanted the ADVENTURE of it ; and I 'd a waded neck-deep in blood to -- goodness alive , AUNT POLLY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 32]: If she war n't standing right there , just inside the door , looking as sweet and contented as an angel half full of pie , I wish I may never !
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 46]: Aunt Sally jumped for her , and most hugged the head off of her , and cried over her , and I found a good enough place for me under the bed , for it was getting pretty sultry for us , seemed to me .
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 39]: And I peeped out , and in a little while Tom 's Aunt Polly shook herself loose and stood there looking across at Tom over her spectacles -- kind of grinding him into the earth , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 26]: And then she says : `` Yes , you BETTER turn y' r head away -- I would if I was you , Tom . ''
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 7]: `` Oh , deary me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 10]: says Aunt Sally ; `` IS he changed so ?
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 23]: Why , that ai n't TOM , it 's Sid ; Tom 's -- Tom 's -- why , where is Tom ?
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 8]: He was here a minute ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 14]: `` You mean where 's Huck FINN -- that 's what you mean !
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 24]: I reckon I hai n't raised such a scamp as my Tom all these years not to know him when I SEE him .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 7]: That WOULD be a pretty howdy-do .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 11]: Come out from under that bed , Huck Finn . ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 5]: So I done it .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 5]: But not feeling brash .
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 34]: Aunt Sally she was one of the mixed-upest-looking persons I ever see -- except one , and that was Uncle Silas , when he come in and they told it all to him .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 53]: It kind of made him drunk , as you may say , and he did n't know nothing at all the rest of the day , and preached a prayer-meeting sermon that night that gave him a rattling ruputation , because the oldest man in the world could n't a understood it .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 133]: So Tom 's Aunt Polly , she told all about who I was , and what ; and I had to up and tell how I was in such a tight place that when Mrs. Phelps took me for Tom Sawyer -- she chipped in and says , `` Oh , go on and call me Aunt Sally , I 'm used to it now , and ` tai n't no need to change '' -- that when Aunt Sally took me for Tom Sawyer I had to stand it -- there war n't no other way , and I knowed he would n't mind , because it would be nuts for him , being a mystery , and he 'd make an adventure out of it , and be perfectly satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 25]: And so it turned out , and he let on to be Sid , and made things as soft as he could for me .
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 44]: And his Aunt Polly she said Tom was right about old Miss Watson setting Jim free in her will ; and so , sure enough , Tom Sawyer had gone and took all that trouble and bother to set a free nigger free !
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 29]: and I could n't ever understand before , until that minute and that talk , how he COULD help a body set a nigger free with his bringing-up .
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 36]: Well , Aunt Polly she said that when Aunt Sally wrote to her that Tom and SID had come all right and safe , she says to herself : `` Look at that , now !
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 18]: I might have expected it , letting him go off that way without anybody to watch him .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 49]: So now I got to go and trapse all the way down the river , eleven hundred mile , and find out what that creetur 's up to THIS time , as long as I could n't seem to get any answer out of you about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 15]: `` Why , I never heard nothing from you , '' says Aunt Sally .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 6]: `` Well , I wonder !
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 19]: Why , I wrote you twice to ask you what you could mean by Sid being here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 11]: `` Well , I never got 'em , Sis . ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 18]: Aunt Polly she turns around slow and severe , and says : `` You , Tom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 6]: `` Well -- WHAT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 7]: he says , kind of pettish .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 17]: `` Don t you what ME , you impudent thing -- hand out them letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 5]: `` What letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 4]: `` THEM letters .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 23]: I be bound , if I have to take a-holt of you I 'll -- '' `` They 're in the trunk .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 4]: There , now .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 18]: And they 're just the same as they was when I got them out of the office .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 13]: I hai n't looked into them , I hai n't touched them .
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 39]: But I knowed they 'd make trouble , and I thought if you war n't in no hurry , I 'd -- '' `` Well , you DO need skinning , there ai n't no mistake about it .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 47]: And I wrote another one to tell you I was coming ; and I s ` pose he -- '' `` No , it come yesterday ; I hai n't read it yet , but IT 'S all right , I 've got that one . ''
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 25]: I wanted to offer to bet two dollars she had n't , but I reckoned maybe it was just as safe to not to .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 6]: So I never said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 23]: CHAPTER THE LAST THE first time I catched Tom private I asked him what was his idea , time of the evasion ?
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 29]: -- what it was he 'd planned to do if the evasion worked all right and he managed to set a nigger free that was already free before ?
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 117]: And he said , what he had planned in his head from the start , if we got Jim out all safe , was for us to run him down the river on the raft , and have adventures plumb to the mouth of the river , and then tell him about his being free , and take him back up home on a steamboat , in style , and pay him for his lost time , and write word ahead and get out all the niggers around , and have them waltz him into town with a torchlight procession and a brass-band , and then he would be a hero , and so would we .
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 13]: But I reckoned it was about as well the way it was .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 66]: We had Jim out of the chains in no time , and when Aunt Polly and Uncle Silas and Aunt Sally found out how good he helped the doctor nurse Tom , they made a heap of fuss over him , and fixed him up prime , and give him all he wanted to eat , and a good time , and nothing to do .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 63]: And we had him up to the sick-room , and had a high talk ; and Tom give Jim forty dollars for being prisoner for us so patient , and doing it up so good , and Jim was pleased most to death , and busted out , and says : `` DAH , now , Huck , what I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 12]: -- what I tell you up dah on Jackson islan ' ?
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 45]: I TOLE you I got a hairy breas ' , en what 's de sign un it ; en I TOLE you I ben rich wunst , en gwineter to be rich AGIN ; en it 's come true ; en heah she is !
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 4]: DAH , now !
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 41]: doan ' talk to ME -- signs is SIGNS , mine I tell you ; en I knowed jis ' 's well ` at I ` uz gwineter be rich agin as I 's a-stannin ' heah dis minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 111]: And then Tom he talked along and talked along , and says , le 's all three slide out of here one of these nights and get an outfit , and go for howling adventures amongst the Injuns , over in the Territory , for a couple of weeks or two ; and I says , all right , that suits me , but I ai n't got no money for to buy the outfit , and I reckon I could n't get none from home , because it 's likely pap 's been back before now , and got it all away from Judge Thatcher and drunk it up .
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 34]: `` No , he hai n't , '' Tom says ; `` it 's all there yet -- six thousand dollars and more ; and your pap hai n't ever been back since .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 10]: Had n't when I come away , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 21]: Jim says , kind of solemn : `` He ai n't a-comin ' back no mo ' , Huck . ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 9]: I says : `` Why , Jim ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 70]: `` Nemmine why , Huck -- but he ai n't comin ' back no mo. '' But I kept at him ; so at last he says : `` Doan ' you ` member de house dat was float 'n down de river , en dey wuz a man in dah , kivered up , en I went in en unkivered him and didn ' let you come in ?
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 21]: Well , den , you kin git yo ' money when you wants it , kase dat wuz him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 78]: Tom 's most well now , and got his bullet around his neck on a watch-guard for a watch , and is always seeing what time it is , and so there ai n't nothing more to write about , and I am rotten glad of it , because if I 'd a knowed what a trouble it was to make a book I would n't a tackled it , and ai n't a-going to no more .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 36]: But I reckon I got to light out for the Territory ahead of the rest , because Aunt Sally she 's going to adopt me and sivilize me , and I ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 5]: I been there before .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 3]: THE END .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 6]: YOURS TRULY , HUCK FINN .
