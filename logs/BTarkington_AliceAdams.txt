Parsing [sent. 1 len. 43]: ALICE ADAMS By Booth Tarkington CHAPTER I The patient , an old-fashioned man , thought the nurse made a mistake in keeping both of the windows open , and her sprightly disregard of his protests added something to his hatred of her .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 23]: Every evening he told her that anybody with ordinary gumption ought to realize that night air was bad for the human frame .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 19]: `` The human frame wo n't stand everything , Miss Perry , '' he warned her , resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 34]: `` Even a child , if it had just ordinary gumption , ought to know enough not to let the night air blow on sick people yes , nor well people , either !
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 16]: ` Keep out of the night air , no matter how well you feel . '
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 15]: That 's what my mother used to tell me when I was a boy .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 15]: ` Keep out of the night air , Virgil , ' she 'd say .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 10]: ` Keep out of the night air . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 17]: `` I expect probably her mother told her the same thing , '' the nurse suggested .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 6]: `` Of course she did .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 17]: My grandmother -- '' `` Oh , I guess your GRANDmother thought so , Mr. Adams !
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 18]: That was when all this flat central country was swampish and had n't been drained off yet .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 27]: I guess the truth must been the swamp mosquitoes bit people and gave 'em malaria , especially before they began to put screens in their windows .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 40]: Well , we got screens in these windows , and no mosquitoes are goin ' to bite us ; so just you be a good boy and rest your mind and go to sleep like you need to . ''
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 4]: `` Sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 4]: `` Likely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 24]: He thought the night air worst of all in April ; he had n't a doubt it would kill him , he declared .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 22]: `` It 's miraculous what the human frame WILL survive , '' he admitted on the last evening of that month .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 19]: `` But you and the doctor ought to both be taught it wo n't stand too dang much !
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 35]: You poison a man and poison and poison him with this April night air -- '' `` Ca n't poison you with much more of it , '' Miss Perry interrupted him , indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 25]: `` To-morrow it 'll be May night air , and I expect that 'll be a lot better for you , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 19]: Now let 's just sober down and be a good boy and get some nice sound sleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 33]: She gave him his medicine , and , having set the glass upon the center table , returned to her cot , where , after a still interval , she snored faintly .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 18]: Upon this , his expression became that of a man goaded out of overpowering weariness into irony .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 3]: `` Sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 8]: Oh , CERTAINLY , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 55]: However , he did sleep intermittently , drowsed between times , and even dreamed ; but , forgetting his dreams before he opened his eyes , and having some part of him all the while aware of his discomfort , he believed , as usual , that he lay awake the whole night long .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 21]: He was conscious of the city as of some single great creature resting fitfully in the dark outside his windows .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 42]: It lay all round about , in the damp cover of its night cloud of smoke , and tried to keep quiet for a few hours after midnight , but was too powerful a growing thing ever to lie altogether still .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 25]: Even while it strove to sleep it muttered with digestions of the day before , and these already merged with rumblings of the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 80]: `` Owl '' cars , bringing in last passengers over distant trolley-lines , now and then howled on a curve ; faraway metallic stirrings could be heard from factories in the sooty suburbs on the plain outside the city ; east , west , and south , switch-engines chugged and snorted on sidings ; and everywhere in the air there seemed to be a faint , voluminous hum as of innumerable wires trembling overhead to vibration of machinery underground .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 60]: In his youth Adams might have been less resentful of sounds such as these when they interfered with his night 's sleep : even during an illness he might have taken some pride in them as proof of his citizenship in a `` live town '' ; but at fifty-five he merely hated them because they kept him awake .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 24]: They `` pressed on his nerves , '' as he put it ; and so did almost everything else , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 17]: He heard the milk-wagon drive into the cross-street beneath his windows and stop at each house .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 30]: The milkman carried his jars round to the `` back porch , '' while the horse moved slowly ahead to the gate of the next customer and waited there .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 16]: `` He 's gone into Pollocks ' , '' Adams thought , following this progress .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 11]: `` I hope it 'll sour on 'em before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 5]: Delivered the Andersons ' .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 7]: Now he 's getting out ours .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 6]: Listen to the darn brute !
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 10]: What 's HE care who wants to sleep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 46]: His complaint was of the horse , who casually shifted weight with a clink of steel shoes on the worn brick pavement of the street , and then heartily shook himself in his harness , perhaps to dislodge a fly far ahead of its season .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 34]: Light had just filmed the windows ; and with that the first sparrow woke , chirped instantly , and roused neighbours in the trees of the small yard , including a loud-voiced robin .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 9]: Vociferations began irregularly , but were soon unanimous .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 3]: `` Sleep ?
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 9]: Dang likely now , ai n't it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 22]: Night sounds were becoming day sounds ; the far-away hooting of freight-engines seemed brisker than an hour ago in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 61]: A cheerful whistler passed the house , even more careless of sleepers than the milkman 's horse had been ; then a group of coloured workmen came by , and although it was impossible to be sure whether they were homeward bound from night-work or on their way to day-work , at least it was certain that they were jocose .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 20]: Loose , aboriginal laughter preceded them afar , and beat on the air long after they had gone by .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 28]: The sick-room night-light , shielded from his eyes by a newspaper propped against a water-pitcher , still showed a thin glimmering that had grown offensive to Adams .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 43]: In his wandering and enfeebled thoughts , which were much more often imaginings than reasonings , the attempt of the night-light to resist the dawn reminded him of something unpleasant , though he could not discover just what the unpleasant thing was .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 27]: Here was a puzzle that irritated him the more because he could not solve it , yet always seemed just on the point of a solution .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 70]: However , he may have lost nothing cheerful by remaining in the dark upon the matter ; for if he had been a little sharper in this introspection he might have concluded that the squalor of the night-light , in its seeming effort to show against the forerunning of the sun itself , had stimulated some half-buried perception within him to sketch the painful little synopsis of an autobiography .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 31]: In spite of noises without , he drowsed again , not knowing that he did ; and when he opened his eyes the nurse was just rising from her cot .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 13]: He took no pleasure in the sight , it may be said .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 27]: She exhibited to him a face mismodelled by sleep , and set like a clay face left on its cheek in a hot and dry studio .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 32]: She was still only in part awake , however , and by the time she had extinguished the night-light and given her patient his tonic , she had recovered enough plasticity .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 8]: `` Well , is n't that grand !
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 19]: We 've had another good night , '' she said as she departed to dress in the bathroom .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 8]: `` Yes , you had another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 13]: he retorted , though not until after she had closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 23]: Presently he heard his daughter moving about in her room across the narrow hall , and so knew that she had risen .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 45]: He hoped she would come in to see him soon , for she was the one thing that did n't press on his nerves , he felt ; though the thought of her hurt him , as , indeed , every thought hurt him .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 9]: But it was his wife who came first .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 45]: She wore a lank cotton wrapper , and a crescent of gray hair escaped to one temple from beneath the handkerchief she had worn upon her head for the night and still retained ; but she did everything possible to make her expression cheering .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 8]: `` Oh , you 're better again !
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 17]: I can see that , as soon as I look at you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 13]: `` Miss Perry tells me you 've had another splendid night . ''
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 39]: He made a sound of irony , which seemed to dispose unfavourably of Miss Perry , and then , in order to be more certainly intelligible , he added , `` She slept well , as usual ! ''
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 7]: But his wife 's smile persisted .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 20]: `` It 's a good sign to be cross ; it means you 're practically convalescent right now . ''
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 10]: `` Oh , I am , am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 8]: `` No doubt in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 31]: `` Why , you 're practically a well man , Virgil -- all except getting your strength back , of course , and that is n't going to take long .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 16]: You 'll be right on your feet in a couple of weeks from now . ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 7]: `` Oh , I will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 7]: `` Of course you will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 74]: She laughed briskly , and , going to the table in the center of the room , moved his glass of medicine an inch or two , turned a book over so that it lay upon its other side , and for a few moments occupied herself with similar futilities , having taken on the air of a person who makes things neat , though she produced no such actual effect upon them .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 12]: `` Of course you will , '' she repeated , absently .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 15]: `` You 'll be as strong as you ever were ; maybe stronger . ''
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 33]: She paused for a moment , not looking at him , then added , cheerfully , `` So that you can fly around and find something really good to get into . ''
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 44]: Something important between them came near the surface here , for though she spoke with what seemed but a casual cheerfulness , there was a little betraying break in her voice , a trembling just perceptible in the utterance of the final word .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 58]: And she still kept up the affectation of being helpfully preoccupied with the table , and did not look at her husband -- perhaps because they had been married so many years that without looking she knew just what his expression would be , and preferred to avoid the actual sight of it as long as possible .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 28]: Meanwhile , he stared hard at her , his lips beginning to move with little distortions not lacking in the pathos of a sick man 's agitation .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 10]: `` So that 's it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 11]: `` That 's what you 're hinting at . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 5]: ` Hinting ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams looked surprised and indulgent .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 13]: `` Why , I 'm not doing any hinting , Virgil . ''
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 17]: `` What did you say about my finding ` something good to get into ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 5]: he asked , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 9]: `` Do n't you call that hinting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 28]: Mrs. Adams turned toward him now ; she came to the bedside and would have taken his hand , but he quickly moved it away from her .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 13]: `` You must n't let yourself get nervous , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 16]: `` But of course when you get well there 's only one thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 13]: You must n't go back to that old hole again . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 5]: ` Old hole ? '
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 11]: That 's what you call it , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 21]: In spite of his weakness , anger made his voice strident , and upon this stimulation she spoke more urgently .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 12]: `` You just must n't go back to it , Virgil .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 17]: It 's not fair to any of us , and you know it is n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 12]: `` Do n't tell me what I know , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 13]: She clasped her hands , suddenly carrying her urgency to plaintive entreaty .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 13]: `` Virgil , you WO N'T go back to that hole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 12]: `` That 's a nice word to use to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 10]: `` Call a man 's business a hole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 26]: `` Virgil , if you do n't owe it to me to look for something different , do n't you owe it to your children ?
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 26]: Do n't tell me you wo n't do what we all want you to , and what you know in your heart you ought to !
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 43]: And if you HAVE got into one of your stubborn fits and are bound to go back there for no other reason except to have your own way , do n't tell me so , for I ca n't bear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 7]: He looked up at her fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 14]: `` You 've got a fine way to cure a sick man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 45]: he said ; but she had concluded her appeal -- for that time -- and instead of making any more words in the matter , let him see that there were tears in her eyes , shook her head , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 22]: Alone , he lay breathing rapidly , his emaciated chest proving itself equal to the demands his emotion put upon it .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 4]: `` Fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 7]: he repeated , with husky indignation .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 9]: `` Fine way to cure a sick man !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 3]: Fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 26]: Then , after a silence , he gave forth whispering sounds as of laughter , his expression the while remaining sore and far from humour .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 9]: `` And give us our daily bread ! ''
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 14]: he added , meaning that his wife 's little performance was no novelty .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 45]: CHAPTER II In fact , the agitation of Mrs. Adams was genuine , but so well under her control that its traces vanished during the three short steps she took to cross the narrow hall between her husband 's door and the one opposite .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 40]: Her expression was matter-of-course , rather than pathetic , as she entered the pretty room where her daughter , half dressed , sat before a dressing-table and played with the reflections of a three-leafed mirror framed in blue enamel .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 95]: That is , just before the moment of her mother 's entrance , Alice had been playing with the mirror 's reflections -- posturing her arms and her expressions , clasping her hands behind her neck , and tilting back her head to foreshorten the face in a tableau conceived to represent sauciness , then one of smiling weariness , then one of scornful toleration , and all very piquant ; but as the door opened she hurriedly resumed the practical , and occupied her hands in the arrangement of her plentiful brownish hair .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 12]: They were pretty hands , of a shapeliness delicate and fine .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 9]: `` The best things she 's got ! ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 29]: a cold-blooded girl friend said of them , and meant to include Alice 's mind and character in the implied list of possessions surpassed by the notable hands .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 14]: However that may have been , the rest of her was well enough .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 31]: She was often called `` a right pretty girl '' -- temperate praise meaning a girl rather pretty than otherwise , and this she deserved , to say the least .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 24]: Even in repose she deserved it , though repose was anything but her habit , being seldom seen upon her except at home .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 57]: On exhibition she led a life of gestures , the unkind said to make her lovely hands more memorable ; but all of her usually accompanied the gestures of the hands , the shoulders ever giving them their impulses first , and even her feet being called upon , at the same time , for eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 53]: So much liveliness took proper place as only accessory to that of the face , where her vivacity reached its climax ; and it was unfortunate that an ungifted young man , new in the town , should have attempted to define the effect upon him of all this generosity of emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 28]: He said that `` the way she used her cute hazel eyes and the wonderful glow of her facial expression gave her a mighty spiritual quality . ''
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 41]: His actual rendition of the word was `` spirichul '' ; but it was not his pronunciation that embalmed this outburst in the perennial laughter of Alice 's girl friends ; they made the misfortune far less his than hers .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 85]: Her mother comforted her too heartily , insisting that Alice had `` plenty enough spiritual qualities , '' certainly more than possessed by the other girls who flung the phrase at her , wooden things , jealous of everything they were incapable of themselves ; and then Alice , getting more championship than she sought , grew uneasy lest Mrs. Adams should repeat such defenses `` outside the family '' ; and Mrs. Adams ended by weeping because the daughter so distrusted her intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 10]: Alice frequently thought it necessary to instruct her mother .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 44]: Her morning greeting was an instruction to-day ; or , rather , it was an admonition in the style of an entreaty , the more petulant as Alice thought that Mrs. Adams might have had a glimpse of the posturings to the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 29]: This was a needless worry ; the mother had caught a thousand such glimpses , with Alice unaware , and she thought nothing of the one just flitted .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 18]: `` For heaven 's sake , mama , come clear inside the room and shut the door !
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 14]: PLEASE do n't leave it open for everybody to look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 16]: `` There is n't anybody to see you , '' Mrs. Adams explained , obeying .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 32]: `` Miss Perry 's gone downstairs , and -- '' `` Mama , I heard you in papa 's room , '' Alice said , not dropping the note of complaint .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 32]: `` I could hear both of you , and I do n't think you ought to get poor old papa so upset -- not in his present condition , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 11]: Mrs. Adams seated herself on the edge of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 15]: `` He 's better all the time , '' she said , not disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 6]: `` He 's almost well .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 28]: The doctor says so and Miss Perry says so ; and if we do n't get him into the right frame of mind now we never will .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 19]: The first day he 's outdoors he 'll go back to that old hole -- you 'll see !
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 27]: And if he once does that , he 'll settle down there and it 'll be too late and we 'll never get him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 18]: `` Well , anyhow , I think you could use a little more tact with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 11]: `` I do try to , '' the mother sighed .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 9]: `` It never was much use with him .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 16]: I do n't think you understand him as well as I do , Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 20]: `` There 's one thing I do n't understand about either of you , '' Alice returned , crisply .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 16]: `` Before people get married they can do anything they want to with each other .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 13]: Why ca n't they do the same thing after they 're married ?
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 20]: When you and papa were young people and engaged , he 'd have done anything you wanted him to .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 13]: That must have been because you knew how to manage him then .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 13]: Why ca n't you go at him the same way now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 19]: Mrs. Adams sighed again , and laughed a little , making no other response ; but Alice persisted .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 8]: `` Well , WHY ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 26]: Why ca n't you ask him to do things the way you used to ask him when you were just in love with each other ?
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 18]: Why do n't you anyhow try it , mama , instead of ding-donging at him ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 9]: ` Ding-donging at him , ' Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 10]: Mrs. Adams said , with a pathos somewhat emphasized .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 17]: `` Is that how my trying to do what I can for you strikes you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 14]: `` Never mind that ; it 's nothing to hurt your feelings . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 7]: Alice disposed of the pathos briskly .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you answer my question ?
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 13]: What 's the matter with using a little more tact on papa ?
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 22]: Why ca n't you treat him the way you probably did when you were young people , before you were married ?
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 12]: I never have understood why people ca n't do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 15]: `` Perhaps you WILL understand some day , '' her mother said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 13]: `` Maybe you will when you 've been married twenty-five years . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 5]: `` You keep evading .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 12]: Why do n't you answer my question right straight out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 15]: `` There are questions you ca n't answer to young people , Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 13]: `` You mean because we 're too young to understand the answer ?
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 8]: I do n't see that at all .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 15]: At twenty-two a girl 's supposed to have some intelligence , is n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 12]: And intelligence is the ability to understand , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 27]: Why do I have to wait till I 've lived with a man twenty-five years to understand why you ca n't be tactful with papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 16]: `` You may understand some things before that , '' Mrs. Adams said , tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 10]: `` You may understand how you hurt me sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 34]: Youth ca n't know everything by being intelligent , and by the time you could understand the answer you 're asking for you 'd know it , and would n't need to ask .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 31]: You do n't understand your father , Alice ; you do n't know what it takes to change him when he 's made up his mind to be stubborn . ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 11]: Alice rose and began to get herself into a skirt .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 17]: `` Well , I do n't think making scenes ever changes anybody , '' she grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 17]: `` I think a little jolly persuasion goes twice as far , myself . '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 7]: A little jolly persuasion ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 13]: Her mother turned the echo of this phrase into an ironic lament .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 14]: `` Yes , there was a time when I thought that , too !
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 10]: It did n't work ; that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 16]: `` Perhaps you left the ` jolly ' part of it out , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 27]: For the second time that morning -- it was now a little after seven o'clock -- tears seemed about to offer their solace to Mrs. Adams .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 25]: `` I might have expected you to say that , Alice ; you never do miss a chance , '' she said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 15]: `` It seems queer you do n't some time miss just ONE chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 14]: But Alice , progressing with her toilet , appeared to be little concerned .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 22]: `` Oh , well , I think there are better ways of managing a man than just hammering at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 10]: Mrs. Adams uttered a little cry of pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 7]: ` Hammering , ' Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 35]: `` If you 'd left it entirely to me , '' her daughter went on , briskly , `` I believe papa 'd already be willing to do anything we want him to . ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: `` That 's it ; tell me I spoil everything .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 18]: Well , I wo n't interfere from now on , you can be sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 14]: `` Please do n't talk like that , '' Alice said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 29]: `` I 'm old enough to realize that papa may need pressure of all sorts ; I only think it makes him more obstinate to get him cross .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 21]: You probably do understand him better , but that 's one thing I 've found out and you have n't .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 16]: She gave her mother a friendly tap on the shoulder and went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 13]: `` I 'll hop in and say hello to him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 35]: As she went , she continued the fastening of her blouse , and appeared in her father 's room with one hand still thus engaged , but she patted his forehead with the other .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 6]: `` Poor old papa-daddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 5]: she said , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 18]: `` Every time he 's better somebody talks him into getting so mad he has a relapse .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 6]: It 's a shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 16]: Her father 's eyes , beneath their melancholy brows , looked up at her wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 15]: `` I suppose you heard your mother going for me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 11]: `` I heard you going for her , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 8]: `` What was it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 10]: `` Oh , the same danged old story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 16]: `` You mean she wants you to try something new when you get well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 7]: Alice asked , with cheerful innocence .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 12]: `` So we could all have a lot more money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: At this his sorrowful forehead was more sorrowful than ever .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 28]: The deep horizontal lines moved upward to a pattern of suffering so familiar to his daughter that it meant nothing to her ; but he spoke quietly .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 17]: `` Yes ; so we would n't have any money at all , most likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 17]: she laughed , and , finishing with her blouse , patted his cheeks with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 21]: `` Just think how many grand openings there must be for a man that knows as much as you do !
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 17]: I always did believe you could get rich if you only cared to , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 10]: But upon his forehead the painful pattern still deepened .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 19]: `` Do n't you think we 've always had enough , the way things are , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 8]: `` Not the way things ARE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 9]: She patted his cheeks again ; laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 54]: `` It used to be enough , maybe anyway we did skimp along on it -- but the way things are now I expect mama 's really pretty practical in her ideas , though , I think it 's a shame for her to bother you about it while you 're so weak .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 20]: Do n't you worry about it , though ; just think about other things till you get strong . ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 36]: `` You know , '' he said ; `` you know it is n't exactly the easiest thing in the world for a man of my age to find these grand openings you speak of .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 32]: And when you 've passed half-way from fifty to sixty you 're apt to see some risk in giving up what you know how to do and trying something new . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 8]: `` My , what a frown ! ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 5]: she cried , blithely .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 18]: `` Did n't I tell you to stop thinking about it till you get ALL well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 18]: She bent over him , giving him a gay little kiss on the bridge of his nose .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 6]: I must run to breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 4]: Cheer up now !
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 5]: Au ` voir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 17]: And with her pretty hand she waved further encouragement from the closing door as she departed .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 43]: Lightsomely descending the narrow stairway , she whistled as she went , her fingers drumming time on the rail ; and , still whistling , she came into the dining-room , where her mother and her brother were already at the table .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 22]: The brother , a thin and sallow boy of twenty , greeted her without much approval as she took her place .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 8]: `` Nothing seems to trouble you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 12]: `` No ; nothing much , '' she made airy response .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 9]: `` What 's troubling yourself , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 9]: `` Do n't let that worry you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 43]: he returned , seeming to consider this to be repartee of an effective sort ; for he furnished a short laugh to go with it , and turned to his coffee with the manner of one who has satisfactorily closed an episode .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 11]: `` Walter always seems to have so many secrets ! ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 17]: Alice said , studying him shrewdly , but with a friendly enough amusement in her scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 27]: `` Everything he does or says seems to be acted for the benefit of some mysterious audience inside himself , and he always gets its applause .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 37]: Take what he said just now : he seems to think it means something , but if it does , why , that 's just another secret between him and the secret audience inside of him !
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 17]: We do n't really know anything about Walter at all , do we , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 74]: Walter laughed again , in a manner that sustained her theory well enough ; then after finishing his coffee , he took from his pocket a flattened packet in glazed blue paper ; extracted with stained fingers a bent and wrinkled little cigarette , lighted it , hitched up his belted trousers with the air of a person who turns from trifles to things better worth his attention , and left the room .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 7]: Alice laughed as the door closed .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 10]: `` He 's ALL secrets , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 17]: `` Do n't you think you really ought to know more about him , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 17]: `` I 'm sure he 's a good boy , '' Mrs. Adams returned , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 26]: `` He 's been very brave about not being able to have the advantages that are enjoyed by the boys he 's grown up with .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 12]: I 've never heard a word of complaint from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 10]: `` About his not being sent to college ? ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 8]: `` I should think you would n't !
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 13]: He did n't even have enough ambition to finish high school ! ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams sighed .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 37]: `` It seemed to me Walter lost his ambition when nearly all the boys he 'd grown up with went to Eastern schools to prepare for college , and we could n't afford to send him .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 16]: If only your father would have listened -- '' Alice interrupted : `` What nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 15]: Walter hated books and studying , and athletics , too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 13]: He does n't care for anything nice that I ever heard of .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 10]: What do you suppose he does like , mama ?
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 16]: He must like something or other somewhere , but what do you suppose it is ?
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 9]: What does he do with his time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 15]: `` Why , the poor boy 's at Lamb and Company 's all day .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 19]: He does n't get through until five in the afternoon ; he does n't HAVE much time . ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 31]: `` Well , we never have dinner until about seven , and he 's always late for dinner , and goes out , heaven knows where , right afterward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 5]: Alice shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 21]: `` He used to go with our friends ' boys , but I do n't think he does now . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 8]: `` Why , how could he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams protested .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 10]: `` That is n't his fault , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 16]: The boys he knew when he was younger are nearly all away at college . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 20]: `` Yes , but he does n't see anything of 'em when they 're here at holiday-time or vacation .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 11]: None of 'em come to the house any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 9]: `` I suppose he 's made other friends .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 14]: It 's natural for him to want companions , at his age . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' Alice said , with disapproving emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 6]: `` But who are they ?
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 15]: I 've got an idea he plays pool at some rough place down-town . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 60]: `` Oh , no ; I 'm sure he 's a steady boy , '' Mrs. Adams protested , but her tone was not that of thoroughgoing conviction , and she added , `` Life might be a very different thing for him if only your father can be brought to see -- '' `` Never mind , mama !
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 36]: It is n't me that has to be convinced , you know ; and we can do a lot more with papa if we just let him alone about it for a day or two .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 24]: Promise me you wo n't say any more to him until -- well , until he 's able to come downstairs to table .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 4]: Will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 12]: Mrs. Adams bit her lip , which had begun to tremble .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 19]: `` I think you can trust me to know a FEW things , Alice , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 13]: `` I 'm a little older than you , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 8]: `` That 's a good girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 6]: Alice jumped up , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 21]: `` Do n't forget it 's the same as a promise , and do just cheer him up a little .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 12]: I 'll say good-bye to him before I go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 10]: `` Oh , I 've got lots to do .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 64]: I thought I 'd run out to Mildred 's to see what she 's going to wear to-night , and then I want to go down and buy a yard of chiffon and some narrow ribbon to make new bows for my slippers -- you 'll have to give me some money -- '' `` If he 'll give it to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 30]: her mother lamented , as they went toward the front stairs together ; but an hour later she came into Alice 's room with a bill in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 14]: `` He has some money in his bureau drawer , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 10]: `` He finally told me where it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 23]: There were traces of emotion in her voice , and Alice , looking shrewdly at her , saw moisture in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 4]: `` Mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 22]: `` You did n't do what you promised me you would n't , did you -- NOT before Miss Perry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 16]: `` Miss Perry 's getting him some broth , '' Mrs. Adams returned , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 28]: `` Besides , you 're mistaken in saying I promised you anything ; I said I thought you could trust me to know what is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 10]: `` So you did bring it up again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 33]: And Alice swung away from her , strode to her father 's door , flung it open , went to him , and put a light hand soothingly over his unrelaxed forehead .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 6]: `` Poor old papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 12]: `` It 's a shame how everybody wants to trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 10]: He sha n't be bothered any more at all !
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 33]: He does n't need to have everybody telling him how to get away from that old hole he 's worked in so long and begin to make us all nice and rich .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 5]: HE knows how ! ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 31]: Thereupon she kissed him a consoling good-bye , and made another gay departure , the charming hand again fluttering like a white butterfly in the shadow of the closing door .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 29]: CHAPTER III Mrs. Adams had remained in Alice 's room , but her mood seemed to have changed , during her daughter 's little more than momentary absence .
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 7]: `` What did he SAY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 12]: she asked , quickly , and her tone was hopeful . ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 5]: ` Say ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 5]: Alice repeated , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 5]: `` Why , nothing .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 6]: I did n't let him .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 57]: Really , mama , I think the best thing for you to do would be to just keep out of his room , because I do n't believe you can go in there and not talk to him about it , and if you do talk we 'll never get him to do the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 3]: Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 20]: The mother 's response was a grieving silence ; she turned from her daughter and walked to the door .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 9]: `` Now , for goodness ' sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 17]: `` Do n't go making tragedy out of my offering you a little practical advice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 12]: `` I 'm not , '' Mrs. Adams gulped , halting .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 15]: `` I 'm just -- just going to dust the downstairs , Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 21]: And with her face still averted , she went out into the little hallway , closing the door behind her .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 23]: A moment later she could be heard descending the stairs , the sound of her footsteps carrying somehow an effect of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 17]: Alice listened , sighed , and , breathing the words , `` Oh , murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 5]: turned to cheerier matters .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 51]: She put on a little apple-green turban with a dim gold band round it , and then , having shrouded the turban in a white veil , which she kept pushed up above her forehead , she got herself into a tan coat of soft cloth fashioned with rakish severity .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 36]: After that , having studied herself gravely in a long glass , she took from one of the drawers of her dressing-table a black leather card-case cornered in silver filigree , but found it empty .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 37]: She opened another drawer wherein were two white pasteboard boxes of cards , the one set showing simply `` Miss Adams , '' the other engraved in Gothic characters , `` Miss Alys Tuttle Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 63]: The latter belonged to Alice 's `` Alys '' period -- most girls go through it ; and Alice must have felt that she had graduated , for , after frowning thoughtfully at the exhibit this morning , she took the box with its contents , and let the white shower fall from her fingers into the waste-basket beside her small desk .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 36]: She replenished the card-case from the `` Miss Adams '' box ; then , having found a pair of fresh white gloves , she tucked an ivory-topped Malacca walking-stick under her arm and set forth .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 28]: She went down the stairs , buttoning her gloves and still wearing the frown with which she had put `` Alys '' finally out of her life .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 27]: She descended slowly , and paused on the lowest step , looking about her with an expression that needed but a slight deepening to betoken bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 14]: Its connection with her dropping `` Alys '' forever was slight , however .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 20]: The small frame house , about fifteen years old , was already inclining to become a new Colonial relic .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 27]: The Adamses had built it , moving into it from the `` Queen Anne '' house they had rented until they took this step in fashion .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 45]: But fifteen years is a long time to stand still in the midland country , even for a house , and this one was lightly made , though the Adamses had not realized how flimsily until they had lived in it for some time .
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 23]: `` Solid , compact , and convenient '' were the instructions to the architect , and he had made it compact successfully .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 51]: Alice , pausing at the foot of the stairway , was at the same time fairly in the `` living-room , '' for the only separation between the `` living room '' and the hall was a demarcation suggested to willing imaginations by a pair of wooden columns painted white .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 64]: These columns , pine under the paint , were bruised and chipped at the base ; one of them showed a crack that threatened to become a split ; the `` hard-wood '' floor had become uneven ; and in a corner the walls apparently failed of solidity , where the wall-paper had declined to accompany some staggerings of the plaster beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 45]: The furniture was in great part an accumulation begun with the wedding gifts ; though some of it was older , two large patent rocking-chairs and a footstool having belonged to Mrs. Adams 's mother in the days of hard brown plush and veneer .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 8]: For decoration there were pictures and vases .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 45]: Mrs. Adams had always been fond of vases , she said , and every year her husband 's Christmas present to her was a vase of one sort or another -- whatever the clerk showed him , marked at about twelve or fourteen dollars .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 46]: The pictures were some of them etchings framed in gilt : Rheims , Canterbury , schooners grouped against a wharf ; and Alice could remember how , in her childhood , her father sometimes pointed out the watery reflections in this last as very fine .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 26]: But it was a long time since he had shown interest in such things -- `` or in anything much , '' as she thought .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 45]: Other pictures were two water-colours in baroque frames ; one being the Amalfi monk on a pergola wall , while the second was a yard-wide display of iris blossoms , painted by Alice herself at fourteen , as a birthday gift to her mother .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 24]: Alice 's glance paused upon it now with no great pride , but showed more approval of an enormous photograph of the Colosseum .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 47]: This she thought of as `` the only good thing in the room '' ; it possessed and bestowed distinction , she felt ; and she did not regret having won her struggle to get it hung in its conspicuous place of honour over the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 23]: Formerly that place had been held for years by a steel-engraving , an accurate representation of the Suspension Bridge at Niagara Falls .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 33]: It was almost as large as its successor , the `` Colosseum , '' and it had been presented to Mr. Adams by colleagues in his department at Lamb and Company 's .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 48]: Adams had shown some feeling when Alice began to urge its removal to obscurity in the `` upstairs hall '' ; he even resisted for several days after she had the `` Colosseum '' charged to him , framed in oak , and sent to the house .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 35]: She cheered him up , of course , when he gave way ; and her heart never misgave her that there might be a doubt which of the two pictures was the more dismaying .
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 46]: Over the pictures , the vases , the old brown plush rocking-chairs and the stool , over the three gilt chairs , over the new chintz-covered easy chair and the gray velure sofa -- over everything everywhere , was the familiar coating of smoke grime .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 49]: It had worked into every fibre of the lace curtains , dingying them to an unpleasant gray ; it lay on the window-sills and it dimmed the glass panes ; it covered the walls , covered the ceiling , and was smeared darker and thicker in all corners .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 27]: Yet here was no fault of housewifery ; the curse could not be lifted , as the ingrained smudges permanent on the once white woodwork proved .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 12]: The grime was perpetually renewed ; scrubbing only ground it in .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 27]: This particular ugliness was small part of Alice 's discontent , for though the coating grew a little deeper each year she was used to it .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 43]: Moreover , she knew that she was not likely to find anything better in a thousand miles , so long as she kept to cities , and that none of her friends , however opulent , had any advantage of her here .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 35]: Indeed , throughout all the great soft-coal country , people who consider themselves comparatively poor may find this consolation : cleanliness has been added to the virtues and beatitudes that money can not buy .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 25]: Alice brightened a little as she went forward to the front door , and she brightened more when the spring breeze met her there .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 52]: Then all depression left her as she walked down the short brick path to the sidewalk , looked up and down the street , and saw how bravely the maple shade-trees , in spite of the black powder they breathed , were flinging out their thousands of young green particles overhead .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 46]: She turned north , treading the new little shadows on the pavement briskly , and , having finished buttoning her gloves , swung down her Malacca stick from under her arm to let it tap a more leisurely accompaniment to her quick , short step .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 49]: She had to step quickly if she was to get anywhere ; for the closeness of her skirt , in spite of its little length , permitted no natural stride ; but she was pleased to be impeded , these brevities forming part of her show of fashion .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 43]: Other pedestrians found them not without charm , though approval may have been lacking here and there , and at the first crossing Alice suffered what she might have accounted an actual injury , had she allowed herself to be so sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 45]: An elderly woman in fussy black silk stood there , waiting for a streetcar ; she was all of a globular modelling , with a face patterned like a frost-bitten peach ; and that the approaching gracefulness was uncongenial she naively made too evident .
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 54]: Her round , wan eyes seemed roused to bitter life as they rose from the curved high heels of the buckled slippers to the tight little skirt , and thence with startled ferocity to the Malacca cane , which plainly appeared to her as a decoration not more astounding than it was insulting .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 21]: Perceiving that the girl was bowing to her , the globular lady hurriedly made shift to alter her injurious expression .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 13]: `` Good morning , Mrs. Dowling , '' Alice said , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 40]: Mrs. Dowling returned the salutation with a smile as convincingly benevolent as the ghastly smile upon a Santa Claus face ; and then , while Alice passed on , exploded toward her a single compacted breath through tightened lips .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 59]: The sound was eloquently audible , though Mrs. Dowling remained unaware that in this or any manner whatever she had shed a light upon her thoughts ; for it was her lifelong innocent conviction that other people saw her only as she wished to be seen , and heard from her only what she intended to be heard .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 17]: At home it was always her husband who pulled down the shades of their bedroom window .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 32]: Alice looked serious for a few moments after the little encounter , then found some consolation in the behaviour of a gentleman of forty or so who was coming toward her .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 32]: Like Mrs. Dowling , he had begun to show consciousness of Alice 's approach while she was yet afar off ; but his tokens were of a kind pleasanter to her .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 24]: He was like Mrs. Dowling again , however , in his conception that Alice would not realize the significance of what he did .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 87]: He passed his hand over his neck-scarf to see that it lay neatly to his collar , smoothed a lapel of his coat , and adjusted his hat , seeming to be preoccupied the while with problems that kept his eyes to the pavement ; then , as he came within a few feet of her , he looked up , as in a surprised recognition almost dramatic , smiled winningly , lifted his hat decisively , and carried it to the full arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 10]: Alice 's response was all he could have asked .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 45]: The cane in her right hand stopped short in its swing , while her left hand moved in a pretty gesture as if an impulse carried it toward the heart ; and she smiled , with her under lip caught suddenly between her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 58]: Months ago she had seen an actress use this smile in a play , and it came perfectly to Alice now , without conscious direction , it had been so well acquired ; but the pretty hand 's little impulse toward the heart was an original bit all her own , on the spur of the moment .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 16]: The gentleman went on , passing from her forward vision as he replaced his hat .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 24]: Of himself he was nothing to Alice , except for the gracious circumstance that he had shown strong consciousness of a pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 57]: He was middle-aged , substantial , a family man , securely married ; and Alice had with him one of those long acquaintances that never become emphasized by so much as five minutes of talk ; yet for this inconsequent meeting she had enacted a little part like a fragment in a pantomime of Spanish wooing .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 17]: It was not for him -- not even to impress him , except as a messenger .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 27]: Alice was herself almost unaware of her thought , which was one of the running thousands of her thoughts that took no deliberate form in words .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 35]: Nevertheless , she had it , and it was the impulse of all her pretty bits of pantomime when she met other acquaintances who made their appreciation visible , as this substantial gentleman did .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 49]: In Alice 's unworded thought , he was to be thus encouraged as in some measure a champion to speak well of her to the world ; but more than this : he was to tell some magnificent unknown bachelor how wonderful , how mysterious , she was .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 71]: She hastened on gravely , a little stirred reciprocally with the supposed stirrings in the breast of that shadowy ducal mate , who must be somewhere `` waiting , '' or perhaps already seeking her ; for she more often thought of herself as `` waiting '' while he sought her ; and sometimes this view of things became so definite that it shaped into a murmur on her lips .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 3]: `` Waiting .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 4]: Just waiting . ''
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 10]: And she might add , `` For him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 25]: Then , being twenty-two , she was apt to conclude the mystic interview by laughing at herself , though not without a continued wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 37]: She came to a group of small coloured children playing waywardly in a puddle at the mouth of a muddy alley ; and at sight of her they gave over their pastime in order to stare .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 49]: She smiled brilliantly upon them , but they were too struck with wonder to comprehend that the manifestation was friendly ; and as Alice picked her way in a little detour to keep from the mud , she heard one of them say , `` Lady got cane !
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 4]: Jeez ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 16]: She knew that many coloured children use impieties familiarly , and she was not startled .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 16]: She was disturbed , however , by an unfavourable hint in the speaker 's tone .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 37]: He was six , probably , but the sting of a criticism is not necessarily allayed by knowledge of its ignoble source , and Alice had already begun to feel a slight uneasiness about her cane .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 44]: Mrs. Dowling 's stare had been strikingly projected at it ; other women more than merely glanced , their brows and lips contracting impulsively ; and Alice was aware that one or two of them frankly halted as soon as she had passed .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 39]: She had seen in several magazines pictures of ladies with canes , and on that account she had bought this one , never questioning that fashion is recognized , even in the provinces , as soon as beheld .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 32]: On the contrary , these staring women obviously failed to realize that what they were being shown was not an eccentric outburst , but the bright harbinger of an illustrious mode .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 41]: Alice had applied a bit of artificial pigment to her lips and cheeks before she set forth this morning ; she did not need it , having a ready colour of her own , which now mounted high with annoyance .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 22]: Then a splendidly shining closed black automobile , with windows of polished glass , came silently down the street toward her .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 29]: Within it , as in a luxurious little apartment , three comely ladies in mourning sat and gossiped ; but when they saw Alice they clutched one another .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 53]: They instantly recovered , bowing to her solemnly as they were borne by , yet were not gone from her sight so swiftly but the edge of her side glance caught a flash of teeth in mouths suddenly opened , and the dark glisten of black gloves again clutching to share mirth .
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 34]: The colour that outdid the rouge on Alice 's cheek extended its area and grew warmer as she realized how all too cordial had been her nod and smile to these humorous ladies .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 40]: But in their identity lay a significance causing her a sharper smart , for they were of the family of that Lamb , chief of Lamb and Company , who had employed her father since before she was born .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 6]: `` And know his salary !
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 11]: They 'd be SURE to find out about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 34]: was her thought , coupled with another bitter one to the effect that they had probably made instantaneous financial estimates of what she wore though certainly her walking-stick had most fed their hilarity .
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 24]: She tucked it under her arm , not swinging it again ; and her breath became quick and irregular as emotion beset her .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 55]: She had been enjoying her walk , but within the space of the few blocks she had gone since she met the substantial gentleman , she found that more than the walk was spoiled : suddenly her life seemed to be spoiled , too ; though she did not view the ruin with complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 13]: These Lamb women thought her and her cane ridiculous , did they ?
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 5]: she said to herself .
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 36]: That was their parvenu blood : to think because a girl 's father worked for their grandfather she had no right to be rather striking in style , especially when the striking WAS her style .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 41]: Probably all the other girls and women would agree with them and would laugh at her when they got together , and , what might be fatal , would try to make all the men think her a silly pretender .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 25]: Men were just like sheep , and nothing was easier than for women to set up as shepherds and pen them in a fold .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 10]: `` To keep out outsiders , '' Alice thought .
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 10]: `` And make 'em believe I AM an outsider .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 8]: What 's the use of living ? ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 31]: All seemed lost when a trim young man appeared , striding out of a cross-street not far before her , and , turning at the corner , came toward her .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 45]: Visibly , he slackened his gait to lengthen the time of his approach , and , as he was a stranger to her , no motive could be ascribed to him other than a wish to have a longer time to look at her .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 43]: She lifted a pretty hand to a pin at her throat , bit her lip -- not with the smile , but mysteriously -- and at the last instant before her shadow touched the stranger , let her eyes gravely meet his .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 32]: A moment later , having arrived before the house which was her destination , she halted at the entrance to a driveway leading through fine lawns to the intentionally important mansion .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 20]: It was a pleasant and impressive place to be seen entering , but Alice did not enter at once .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 26]: She paused , examining a tiny bit of mortar which the masons had forgotten to scrape from a brick in one of the massive gate-posts .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 29]: She frowned at this tiny defacement , and with an air of annoyance scraped it away , using the ferrule of her cane an act of fastidious proprietorship .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 19]: If any one had looked back over his shoulder he would not have doubted that she lived there .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 24]: Alice did not turn to see whether anything of the sort happened or not , but she may have surmised that it did .
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 31]: At all events , it was with an invigorated step that she left the gateway behind her and went cheerfully up the drive to the house of her friend Mildred .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 28]: CHAPTER IV Adams had a restless morning , and toward noon he asked Miss Perry to call his daughter ; he wished to say something to her .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 24]: `` I thought I heard her leaving the house a couple of hours ago -- maybe longer , '' the nurse told him .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 7]: `` I 'll go see . ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 17]: And she returned from the brief errand , her impression confirmed by information from Mrs. Adams .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 19]: She went up to Miss Mildred Palmer 's to see what she 's going to wear to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 44]: Adams looked at Miss Perry wearily , but remained passive , making no inquiries ; for he was long accustomed to what seemed to him a kind of jargon among ladies , which became the more incomprehensible when they tried to explain it .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 21]: A man 's best course , he had found , was just to let it go as so much sound .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 52]: His sorrowful eyes followed the nurse as she went back to her rocking-chair by the window , and her placidity showed him that there was no mystery for her in the fact that Alice walked two miles to ask so simple a question when there was a telephone in the house .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 18]: Obviously Miss Perry also comprehended why Alice thought it important to know what Mildred meant to wear .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 64]: Adams understood why Alice should be concerned with what she herself wore `` to look neat and tidy and at her best , why , of course she 'd want to , '' he thought -- but he realized that it was forever beyond him to understand why the clothing of other people had long since become an absorbing part of her life .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 60]: Her excursion this morning was no novelty ; she was continually going to see what Mildred meant to wear , or what some other girl meant to wear ; and when Alice came home from wherever other girls or women had been gathered , she always hurried to her mother with earnest descriptions of the clothing she had seen .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 61]: At such times , if Adams was present , he might recognize `` organdie , '' or `` taffeta , '' or `` chiffon , '' as words defining certain textiles , but the rest was too technical for him , and he was like a dismal boy at a sermon , just waiting for it to get itself finished .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 56]: Not the least of the mystery was his wife 's interest : she was almost indifferent about her own clothes , and when she consulted Alice about them spoke hurriedly and with an air of apology ; but when Alice described other people 's clothes , Mrs. Adams listened as eagerly as the daughter talked .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 6]: `` There they go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 25]: he muttered to-day , a moment after he heard the front door closing , a sound recognizable throughout most of the thinly built house .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 23]: Alice had just returned , and Mrs. Adams called to her from the upper hallway , not far from Adams 's door .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 7]: `` What did she SAY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 17]: `` She was sort of snippy about it , '' Alice returned , ascending the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 33]: `` She gets that way sometimes , and pretended she had n't made up her mind , but I 'm pretty sure it 'll be the maize Georgette with Malines flounces . ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 14]: `` Did n't you say she wore that at the Pattersons ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 14]: Mrs. Adams inquired , as Alice arrived at the top of the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 26]: `` And did n't you tell me she wore it again at the -- '' `` Certainly not , '' Alice interrupted , rather petulantly .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 30]: `` She 's never worn it but once , and of course she would n't want to wear anything to-night that people have seen her in a lot . ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 13]: Miss Perry opened the door of Adams 's room and stepped out .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 20]: `` Your father wants to know if you 'll come and see him a minute , Miss Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 5]: `` Poor old thing !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 4]: Of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 15]: Alice exclaimed , and went quickly into the room , Miss Perry remaining outside .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter , papa ?
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 15]: Getting awful sick of lying on his tired old back , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 21]: `` I 've had kind of a poor morning , '' Adams said , as she patted his hand comfortingly .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 16]: `` I been thinking -- '' `` Did n't I tell you not to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 5]: she cried , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 22]: `` Of course you 'll have poor times when you go and do just exactly what I say you must n't .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 8]: You stop thinking this very minute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 23]: He smiled ruefully , closing his eyes ; was silent for a moment , then asked her to sit beside the bed .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 15]: `` I been thinking of something I wanted to say , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 7]: `` What like , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 32]: `` Well , it 's nothing -- much , '' he said , with something deprecatory in his tone , as if he felt vague impulses toward both humour and apology .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 38]: `` I just thought maybe I ought to 've said more to you some time or other about -- well , about the way things ARE , down at Lamb and Company 's , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 6]: `` Now , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 18]: She leaned forward in the chair she had taken , and pretended to slap his hand crossly .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 23]: `` Is n't that exactly what I said you could n't think one single think about till you get ALL well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 22]: `` Well -- '' he said , and went on slowly , not looking at her , but at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 33]: `` I just thought maybe it would n't been any harm if some time or other I told you something about the way they sort of depend on me down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 11]: `` Why do n't they show it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 5]: she asked , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 21]: `` That 's just what mama and I have been feeling so much ; they do n't appreciate you . ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 12]: `` Why , yes , they do , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 6]: `` Yes , they do .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 36]: They began h ` isting my salary the second year I went in there , and they 've h ` isted it a little every two years all the time I 've worked for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 34]: I 've been head of the sundries department for seven years now , and I could hardly have more authority in that department unless I was a member of the firm itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 15]: `` Well , why do n't they make you a member of the firm ?
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 9]: That 's what they ought to 've done !
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: Yes , and long ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 13]: Adams laughed , but sighed with more heartiness than he had laughed .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 13]: `` They call me their ` oldest stand-by ' down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 20]: He laughed again , apologetically , as if to excuse himself for taking a little pride in this title .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 68]: `` Yes , sir ; they say I 'm their ` oldest stand-by ' ; and I guess they know they can count on my department 's turning in as good a report as they look for , at the end of every month ; but they do n't have to take a man into the firm to get him to do my work , dearie . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 12]: `` But you said they depended on you , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 20]: `` So they do ; but of course not so 's they could n't get along without me . ''
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 5]: He paused , reflecting .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 25]: `` I do n't just seem to know how to put it -- I mean how to put what I started out to say .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 32]: I kind of wanted to tell you -- well , it seems funny to me , these last few years , the way your mother 's taken to feeling about it .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 62]: I 'd like to see a better established wholesale drug business than Lamb and Company this side the Alleghanies -- I do n't say bigger , I say better established -- and it 's kind of funny for a man that 's been with a business like that as long as I have to hear it called a ` hole . '
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 85]: It 's kind of funny when you think , yourself , you 've done pretty fairly well in a business like that , and the men at the head of it seem to think so , too , and put your salary just about as high as anybody could consider customary -- well , what I mean , Alice , it 's kind of funny to have your mother think it 's mostly just -- mostly just a failure , so to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 23]: His voice had become tremulous in spite of him ; and this sign of weakness and emotion had sufficient effect upon Alice .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 17]: She bent over him suddenly , with her arm about him and her cheek against his .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 5]: `` Poor papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 5]: `` Poor papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 10]: `` I did n't mean anything to trouble you .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 8]: I just thought -- '' He hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 25]: `` I just wondered -- I thought maybe it would n't be any harm if I said something about how things ARE down there .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 16]: I got to thinking maybe you did n't understand it 's a pretty good place .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 39]: They 're fine people to work for ; and they 've always seemed to think something of me ; -- the way they took Walter on , for instance , soon as I asked 'em , last year .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 20]: Do n't you think that looked a good deal as if they thought something of me , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 12]: `` Yes , papa , '' she said , not moving .
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 13]: `` And the work 's right pleasant , '' he went on .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 10]: `` Mighty nice boys in our department , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 13]: Well , they are in all the departments , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 13]: We have a good deal of fun down there some days . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: She lifted her head .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 18]: `` More than you do at home ` some days , ' I expect , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 4]: He protested feebly .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 26]: `` Now , I did n't mean that -- I did n't want to trouble you -- '' She looked at him through winking eyelashes .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 15]: `` I 'm sorry I called it a ` hole , ' papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 11]: `` No , no , '' he protested , gently .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 9]: `` It was your mother said that . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 6]: I did , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 17]: `` Well , if you did , it was only because you 'd heard her . ''
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 9]: She shook her head , then kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 17]: `` I 'm going to talk to her , '' she said , and rose decisively .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 20]: But at this , her father 's troubled voice became quickly louder : `` You better let her alone .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 11]: I just wanted to have a little talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 20]: I did n't mean to start any -- your mother wo n't -- '' `` Now , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 10]: Alice spoke cheerfully again , and smiled upon him .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: `` I want you to quit worrying !
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 19]: Everything 's going to be all right and nobody 's going to bother you any more about anything .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 5]: You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 37]: She carried her smile out into the hall , but after she had closed the door her face was all pity ; and her mother , waiting for her in the opposite room , spoke sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter , Alice ?
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 10]: What did he say that 's upset you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 8]: `` Wait a minute , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 24]: Alice found a handkerchief , used it for eyes and suffused nose , gulped , then suddenly and desolately sat upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 9]: `` Poor , poor , POOR papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams inquired , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter with him ?
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 11]: Sometimes you act as if he were n't getting well .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 8]: What 's he been talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 12]: `` Mama -- well , I think I 'm pretty selfish .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 6]: Oh , I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 8]: `` Did he say you were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 3]: `` Papa ?
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 4]: No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 27]: What I mean is , maybe we 're both a little selfish to try to make him go out and hunt around for something new . ''
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 12]: `` Oh , that 's what he was up to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 12]: `` Mama , I think we ought to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 11]: I did n't dream it had really hurt him . ''
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 10]: `` Well , does n't he hurt us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 10]: `` Never that I know of , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 16]: `` I do n't mean by SAYING things , '' Mrs. Adams explained , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 11]: `` There are more ways than that of hurting people .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 22]: When a man sticks to a salary that does n't provide for his family , is n't that hurting them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 14]: `` Oh , it ` provides ' for us well enough , mama .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 13]: We have what we need -- if I were n't so extravagant .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 10]: Oh , _ I _ know I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 11]: But at this admission her mother cried out sharply . ''
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 4]: ` Extravagant ! '
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 15]: You have n't one tenth of what the other girls you go with have .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 22]: And you CA N'T have what you ought to as long as he does n't get out of that horrible place .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 15]: It provides bare food and shelter for us , but what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: `` I do n't think we ought to try any more to change him . ''
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 6]: `` You do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 8]: Mrs. Adams came and stood before her .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 24]: `` Listen , Alice : your father 's asleep ; that 's his trouble , and he 's got to be waked up .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 9]: He does n't know that things have changed .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 29]: When you and Walter were little children we did have enough -- at least it seemed to be about as much as most of the people we knew .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 31]: But the town is n't what it was in those days , and times are n't what they were then , and these fearful PRICES are n't the old prices .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 17]: Everything else but your father has changed , and all the time he 's stood still .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 27]: He does n't know it ; he thinks because they 've given him a hundred dollars more every two years he 's quite a prosperous man !
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 24]: And he thinks that because his children cost him more than he and I cost our parents he gives them -- enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 8]: `` But Walter -- '' Alice faltered .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 13]: `` Walter does n't cost him anything at all any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 17]: And she concluded , in a stricken voice , `` It 's all -- me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 8]: `` Why should n't it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 4]: her mother cried .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 23]: `` You 're young -- you 're just at the time when your life should be fullest of good things and happiness .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 7]: Yet what do you get ? ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 23]: Alice 's lip quivered ; she was not unsusceptible to such an appeal , but she contrived the semblance of a protest .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 19]: `` I do n't have such a bad time not a good DEAL of the time , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 19]: I 've got a good MANY of the things other girls have -- '' `` You have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams was piteously satirical .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 15]: `` I suppose you 've got a limousine to go to that dance to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 19]: I suppose you 've only got to call a florist and tell him to send you some orchids ?
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 12]: I suppose you 've -- '' But Alice interrupted this list .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 28]: Apparently in a single instant all emotion left her , and she became businesslike , as one in the midst of trifles reminded of really serious matters .
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 20]: She got up from the bed and went to the door of the closet where she kept her dresses .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 12]: `` Oh , see here , '' she said , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 20]: `` I 've decided to wear my white organdie if you could put in a new lining for me .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 12]: I 'm afraid it 'll take you nearly all afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 19]: She brought forth the dress , displayed it upon the bed , and Mrs. Adams examined it attentively .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 13]: `` Do you think you could get it done , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 21]: `` I do n't see why not , '' Mrs. Adams answered , passing a thoughtful hand over the fabric .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 14]: `` It ought n't to take more than four or five hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 35]: `` It 's a shame to have you sit at the machine that long , '' Alice said , absently , adding , `` And I 'm sure we ought to let papa alone .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 10]: Let 's just give it up , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 10]: Mrs. Adams continued her thoughtful examination of the dress .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 12]: `` Did you buy the chiffon and ribbon , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 18]: I 'm sure we ought n't to talk to him about it any more , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 8]: `` Well , we 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 22]: `` Let 's both agree that we 'll NEVER say another single word to him about it , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 21]: `` It 'll be a great deal better if we just let him make up his mind for himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 41]: CHAPTER V With this , having more immediately practical questions before them , they dropped the subject , to bend their entire attention upon the dress ; and when the lunch-gong sounded downstairs Alice was still sketching repairs and alterations .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 11]: She continued to sketch them , not heeding the summons .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 18]: `` I suppose we 'd better go down to lunch , '' Mrs. Adams said , absently .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 9]: `` She 's at the gong again . ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 7]: `` In a minute , mama .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 14]: Now about the sleeves -- '' And she went on with her planning .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 16]: Unfortunately the gong was inexpressive of the mood of the person who beat upon it .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 34]: It consisted of three little metal bowls upon a string ; they were unequal in size , and , upon being tapped with a padded stick , gave forth vibrations almost musically pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 46]: It was Alice who had substituted this contrivance for the brass `` dinner-bell '' in use throughout her childhood ; and neither she nor the others of her family realized that the substitution of sweeter sounds had made the life of that household more difficult .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 47]: In spite of dismaying increases in wages , the Adamses still strove to keep a cook ; and , as they were unable to pay the higher rates demanded by a good one , what they usually had was a whimsical coloured woman of nomadic impulses .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 52]: In the hands of such a person the old-fashioned `` dinner-bell '' was satisfying ; life could instantly be made intolerable for any one dawdling on his way to a meal ; the bell was capable of every desirable profanity and left nothing bottled up in the breast of the ringer .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 40]: But the chamois-covered stick might whack upon Alice 's little Chinese bowls for a considerable length of time and produce no great effect of urgency upon a hearer , nor any other effect , except fury in the cook .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 43]: The ironical impossibility of expressing indignation otherwise than by sounds of gentle harmony proved exasperating ; the cook was apt to become surcharged , so that explosive resignations , never rare , were somewhat more frequent after the introduction of the gong .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 21]: Mrs. Adams took this increased frequency to be only another manifestation of the inexplicable new difficulties that beset all housekeeping .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 30]: You paid a cook double what you had paid one a few years before ; and the cook knew half as much of cookery , and had no gratitude .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 43]: The more you gave these people , it seemed , the worse they behaved -- a condition not to be remedied by simply giving them less , because you could n't even get the worst unless you paid her what she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 12]: Nevertheless , Mrs. Adams remained fitfully an optimist in the matter .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 42]: Brought up by her mother to speak of a female cook as `` the girl , '' she had been instructed by Alice to drop that definition in favour of one not an improvement in accuracy : `` the maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 63]: Almost always , during the first day or so after every cook came , Mrs. Adams would say , at intervals , with an air of triumph : `` I believe -- of course it 's a little soon to be sure -- but I do really believe this new maid is the treasure we 've been looking for so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 64]: Much in the same way that Alice dreamed of a mysterious perfect mate for whom she `` waited , '' her mother had a fairy theory that hidden somewhere in the universe there was the treasure , the perfect `` maid , '' who would come and cook in the Adamses ' kitchen , not four days or four weeks , but forever .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 7]: The present incumbent was not she .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 36]: Alice , profoundly interested herself , kept her mother likewise so preoccupied with the dress that they were but vaguely conscious of the gong 's soft warnings , though these were repeated and protracted unusually .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 16]: Finally the sound of a hearty voice , independent and enraged , reached the pair .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 7]: It came from the hall below .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 9]: `` I says goo ' - BYE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 3]: it called .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 7]: `` Da ` ss all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 6]: Then the front door slammed .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 10]: `` Why , what -- '' Mrs. Adams began .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 8]: They went down hurriedly to find out .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 5]: Miss Perry informed them .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 14]: `` I could n't make her listen to reason , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 29]: `` She rang the gong four or five times and got to talking to herself ; and then she went up to her room and packed her bag .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 17]: I told her she had no business to go out the front door , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams took the news philosophically .
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 24]: `` I thought she had something like that in her eye when I paid her this morning , and I 'm not surprised .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 21]: Well , we wo n't let Mr. Adams know anything 's the matter till I get a new one . ''
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 40]: They lunched upon what the late incumbent had left chilling on the table , and then Mrs. Adams prepared to wash the dishes ; she would `` have them done in a jiffy , '' she said , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 9]: But it was Alice who washed the dishes .
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 24]: `` I DO N'T like to have you do that , Alice , '' her mother protested , following her into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 23]: `` It roughens the hands , and when a girl has hands like yours -- '' `` I know , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 9]: Alice looked troubled , but shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 21]: `` It ca n't be helped this time ; you 'll need every minute to get that dress done . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 26]: Mrs. Adams went away lamenting , while Alice , no expert , began to splash the plates and cups and saucers in the warm water .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 38]: After a while , as she worked , her eyes grew dreamy : she was making little gay-coloured pictures of herself , unfounded prophecies of how she would look and what would happen to her that evening .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 95]: She saw herself , charming and demure , wearing a fluffy idealization of the dress her mother now determinedly struggled with upstairs ; she saw herself framed in a garlanded archway , the entrance to a ballroom , and saw the people on the shining floor turning dramatically to look at her ; then from all points a rush of young men shouting for dances with her ; and she constructed a superb stranger , tall , dark , masterfully smiling , who swung her out of the clamouring group as the music began .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 30]: She saw herself dancing with him , saw the half-troubled smile she would give him ; and she accurately smiled that smile as she rinsed the knives and forks .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 28]: These hopeful fragments of drama were not to be realized , she knew ; but she played that they were true , and went on creating them .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 81]: In all of them she wore or carried flowers -- her mother 's sorrow for her in this detail but made it the more important -- and she saw herself glamorous with orchids ; discarded these for an armful of long-stemmed , heavy roses ; tossed them away for a great bouquet of white camellias ; and so wandered down a lengthening hothouse gallery of floral beauty , all costly and beyond her reach except in such a wistful day-dream .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 24]: And upon her present whole horizon , though she searched it earnestly , she could discover no figure of a sender of flowers .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 32]: Out of her fancies the desire for flowers to wear that night emerged definitely and became poignant ; she began to feel that it might be particularly important to have them .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 8]: `` This might be the night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 22]: She was still at the age to dream that the night of any dance may be the vital point in destiny .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 19]: No matter how commonplace or disappointing other dance nights have been this one may bring the great meeting .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 7]: The unknown magnifico may be there .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 28]: Alice was almost unaware of her own reveries in which this being appeared -- reveries often so transitory that they developed and passed in a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 100]: And in some of them the being was not wholly a stranger ; there were moments when he seemed to be composed of recognizable fragments of young men she knew -- a smile she had liked , from one ; the figure of another , the hair of another -- and sometimes she thought he might be concealed , so to say , within the person of an actual acquaintance , someone she had never suspected of being the right seeker for her , someone who had never suspected that it was she who `` waited '' for him .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 32]: Anything might reveal them to each other : a look , a turn of the head , a singular word -- perhaps some flowers upon her breast or in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 25]: She wiped the dishes slowly , concluding the operation by dropping a saucer upon the floor and dreamily sweeping the fragments under the stove .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 20]: She sighed and replaced the broom near a window , letting her glance wander over the small yard outside .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 41]: The grass , repulsively besooted to the colour of coal-smoke all winter , had lately come to life again and now sparkled with green , in the midst of which a tiny shot of blue suddenly fixed her absent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 12]: They remained upon it for several moments , becoming less absent .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 5]: It was a violet .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 19]: Alice ran upstairs , put on her hat , went outdoors and began to search out the violets .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 22]: She found twenty-two , a bright omen -- since the number was that of her years -- but not enough violets .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 14]: There were no more ; she had ransacked every foot of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 56]: She looked dubiously at the little bunch in her hand , glanced at the lawn next door , which offered no favourable prospect ; then went thoughtfully into the house , left her twenty-two violets in a bowl of water , and came quickly out again , her brow marked with a frown of decision .
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 23]: She went to a trolley-line and took a car to the outskirts of the city where a new park had been opened .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 27]: Here she resumed her search , but it was not an easily rewarded one , and for an hour after her arrival she found no violets .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 62]: She walked conscientiously over the whole stretch of meadow , her eyes roving discontentedly ; there was never a blue dot in the groomed expanse ; but at last , as she came near the borders of an old grove of trees , left untouched by the municipal landscapers , the little flowers appeared , and she began to gather them .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 55]: She picked them carefully , loosening the earth round each tiny plant , so as to bring the roots up with it , that it might live the longer ; and she had brought a napkin , which she drenched at a hydrant , and kept loosely wrapped about the stems of her collection .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 57]: The turf was too damp for her to kneel ; she worked patiently , stooping from the waist ; and when she got home in a drizzle of rain at five o'clock her knees were tremulous with strain , her back ached , and she was tired all over , but she had three hundred violets .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 17]: Her mother moaned when Alice showed them to her , fragrant in a basin of water .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 7]: `` Oh , you POOR child !
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 26]: To think of your having to : work so hard to get things that other girls only need ; lift their little fingers for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 10]: `` Never mind , '' said Alice , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 17]: `` I 've got 'em and I AM going to have a good time to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 8]: `` You 've just got to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams agreed , intensely sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 30]: `` The Lord knows you deserve to , after picking all these violets , poor thing , and He would n't be mean enough to keep you from it .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 33]: I may have to get dinner before I finish the dress , but I can get it done in a few minutes afterward , and it 's going to look right pretty .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 7]: Do n't you worry about THAT !
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 57]: And with all these lovely violets -- '' `` I wonder -- '' Alice began , paused , then went on , fragmentarily : `` I suppose -- well , I wonder -- do you suppose it would have been better policy to have told Walter before -- '' `` No , '' said her mother .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 12]: `` It would only have given him longer to grumble . ''
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 17]: `` But he might -- '' `` Do n't worry , '' Mrs. Adams reassured her .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 37]: `` He 'll be a little cross , but he wo n't be stubborn ; just let me talk to him and do n't you say anything at all , no matter what HE says . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 31]: These references to Walter concerned some necessary manoeuvres which took place at dinner , and were conducted by the mother , Alice having accepted her advice to sit in silence .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams began by laughing cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 22]: `` I wonder how much longer it took me to cook this dinner than it does Walter to eat it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 7]: `` Do n't gobble , child !
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 6]: There 's no hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 13]: In contact with his own family Walter was no squanderer of words .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 9]: `` Is for me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 5]: `` Got date . ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 14]: `` I know you have , but there 's plenty of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 6]: He smiled in benevolent pity .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 7]: `` YOU know , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 14]: If you made any coffee -- do n't bother if you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 5]: Get some down-town . ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 23]: He seemed about to rise and depart ; whereupon Alice , biting her lip , sent a panic-stricken glance at her mother .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 13]: But Mrs. Adams seemed not at all disturbed ; and laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 8]: `` Why , what nonsense , Walter !
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 20]: I 'll bring your coffee in a few minutes , but we 're going to have dessert first . ''
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 5]: `` What sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: `` Some lovely peaches . ''
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 20]: `` Doe ' want ` ny canned peaches , '' said the frank Walter , moving back his chair .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 7]: `` G ' - night . ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 3]: `` Walter !
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 13]: It does n't begin till about nine o'clock at the earliest . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 5]: He paused , mystified .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 6]: `` What does n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 5]: `` The dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 5]: `` What dance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 12]: `` Why , Mildred Palmer 's dance , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 4]: Walter laughed briefly .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 8]: `` What 's that to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 15]: `` Why , you have n't forgotten it 's TO-NIGHT , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams cried .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 6]: `` What a boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 22]: `` I told you a week ago I was n't going to that ole dance , '' he returned , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 6]: `` You heard me . ''
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 4]: `` Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 7]: `` Of COURSE you 're going .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 15]: I got your clothes all out this afternoon , and brushed them for you .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 22]: They 'll look very nice , and -- '' `` They wo n't look nice on ME , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: `` Got date down-town , I tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 13]: `` But of course you 'll -- '' `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 5]: Walter said , decisively .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 11]: `` Do n't get any wrong ideas in your head .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 30]: I 'm just as liable to go up to that ole dance at the Palmers ' as I am to eat a couple of barrels of broken glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 14]: `` But , Walter -- '' Walter was beginning to be seriously annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 8]: `` Do n't ` Walter ' me !
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 8]: I 'm no s ` ciety snake .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 16]: I would n't jazz with that Palmer crowd if they coaxed me with diamonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 21]: `` Walter -- '' `` Did n't I tell you it 's no use to ` Walter ' me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 12]: `` My dear child -- '' `` Oh , Glory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 24]: At this Mrs. Adams abandoned her air of amusement , looked hurt , and glanced at the demure Miss Perry across the table .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid Miss Perry wo n't think you have very good manners , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 14]: `` You 're right she wo n't , '' he agreed , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 44]: `` Not if I haf to hear any more about me goin ' to -- '' But his mother interrupted him with some asperity : `` It seems very strange that you always object to going anywhere among OUR friends , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 5]: `` YOUR friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 19]: he said , and , rising from his chair , gave utterance to an ironical laugh strictly monosyllabic .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 5]: `` Your friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 8]: he repeated , going to the door .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 2]: Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 3]: Good-NIGHT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 25]: And looking back over his shoulder to offer a final brief view of his derisive face , he took himself out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 14]: Alice gasped : `` Mama -- '' `` I 'll stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 25]: her mother responded , sharply ; and hurried after the truant , catching him at the front door with his hat and raincoat on .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 34]: `` Walter -- '' `` Told you had a date down-town , '' he said , gruffly , and would have opened the door , but she caught his arm and detained him .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 11]: `` Walter , please come back and finish your dinner .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 26]: When I take all the trouble to cook it for you , I think you might at least -- '' `` Now , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 10]: `` That is n't what you 're up to .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 17]: You do n't want to make me eat ; you want to make me listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 8]: `` Well , you MUST listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 13]: She retained her grasp upon his arm , and made it tighter .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 6]: `` Walter , please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 8]: she entreated , her voice becoming tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 11]: `` PLEASE do n't make me so much trouble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 20]: He drew back from her as far as her hold upon him permitted , and looked at her sharply .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 8]: `` I get you , all right !
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 15]: What 's the matter of Alice GOIN ' to that party by herself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 7]: `` She just CA N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 11]: `` It makes things too MEAN for her , Walter .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 15]: All the other girls have somebody to depend on after they get there . ''
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 11]: `` Well , why does n't she have somebody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 5]: he asked , testily .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 8]: `` Somebody besides ME , I mean !
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 9]: Why has n't somebody asked her to go ?
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 19]: She ought to be THAT popular , anyhow , I sh 'd think -- she TRIES enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 19]: `` I do n't understand how you can be so hard , '' his mother wailed , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 23]: `` You know why they do n't run after her the way they do the other girls she goes with , Walter .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 16]: It 's because we 're poor , and she has n't got any background . ''
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 5]: ` Background ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 4]: Walter repeated . ''
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 4]: ` Background ? '
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 8]: What kind of talk is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 11]: `` You WILL go with her to-night , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 10]: his mother pleaded , not stopping to enlighten him .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 27]: `` You do n't understand how hard things are for her and how brave she is about them , or you COULD N'T be so selfish !
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 14]: It 'd be more than I can bear to see her disappointed to-night !
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 22]: She went clear out to Belleview Park this afternoon , Walter , and spent hours and hours picking violets to wear .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 22]: You WILL -- '' Walter 's heart was not iron , and the episode of the violets may have reached it .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 6]: `` Oh , BLUB ! ''
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 13]: he said , and flung his soft hat violently at the wall .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 6]: His mother beamed with delight .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 9]: `` THAT 'S a good boy , darling !
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 17]: You 'll never be sorry you -- '' `` Cut it out , '' he requested .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 14]: `` If I take her , will you pay for a taxi ? ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 6]: `` Oh , Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 7]: And again Mrs. Adams showed distress .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 6]: `` Could n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 43]: `` No , I could n't ; I 'm not goin ' to throw away my good money like that , and you ca n't tell what time o ' night it 'll be before she 's willin ' to come home .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 11]: What 's the matter you payin ' for one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 8]: `` I have n't any money . ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 12]: `` Well , father -- '' She shook her head dolefully .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 23]: `` I got some from him this morning , and I ca n't bother him for any more ; it upsets him .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 24]: He 's ALWAYS been so terribly close with money -- '' `` I guess he could n't help that , '' Walter observed .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 14]: `` We 're liable to go to the poorhouse the way it is .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 15]: Well , what 's the matter our walkin ' to this rotten party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 8]: `` In the rain , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 23]: `` Well , it 's only a drizzle and we can take a streetcar to within a block of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 7]: Again his mother shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 7]: `` It would n't do . ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 11]: `` Well , darn the luck , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 5]: he consented , explosively .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 10]: `` I 'll get her something to ride in .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 6]: It means seventy-five cents . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 6]: `` Why , Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams cried , much pleased .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 13]: `` Do you know how to get a cab for that little ?
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 4]: How splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 12]: `` Tai n't a cab , '' Walter informed her crossly .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 30]: `` It 's a tin Lizzie , but you do n't haf ' to tell her what it is till I get her into it , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 8]: Mrs. Adams agreed that she did n't .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 34]: CHAPTER VI Alice was busy with herself for two hours after dinner ; but a little before nine o'clock she stood in front of her long mirror , completed , bright-eyed and solemn .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 58]: Her hair , exquisitely arranged , gave all she asked of it ; what artificialities in colour she had used upon her face were only bits of emphasis that made her prettiness the more distinct ; and the dress , not rumpled by her mother 's careful hours of work , was a white cloud of loveliness .
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 41]: Finally there were two triumphant bouquets of violets , each with the stems wrapped in tin-foil shrouded by a bow of purple chiffon ; and one bouquet she wore at her waist and the other she carried in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 27]: Miss Perry , called in by a rapturous mother for the free treat of a look at this radiance , insisted that Alice was a vision .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 8]: `` Purely and simply a vision ! ''
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 13]: she said , meaning that no other definition whatever would satisfy her .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 22]: `` I never saw anybody look a vision if she do n't look one to-night , '' the admiring nurse declared .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 12]: `` Her papa 'll think the same I do about it .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 16]: You see if he does n't say she 's purely and simply a vision . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 32]: Adams did not fulfil the prediction quite literally when Alice paid a brief visit to his room to `` show '' him and bid him good-night ; but he chuckled feebly .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 8]: `` Well , well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 10]: `` You look mighty fine -- MIGHTY fine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 11]: And he waggled a bony finger at her two bouquets .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 11]: `` Why , Alice , who 's your beau ? ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 6]: `` Never you mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 14]: she laughed , archly brushing his nose with the violets in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 12]: `` He treats me pretty well , does n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 9]: `` Must like to throw his money around !
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 21]: These violets smell mighty sweet , and they ought to , if they 're going to a party with YOU .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 8]: Have a good time , dearie . ''
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 6]: `` I mean to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 21]: she cried ; and she repeated this gaily , but with an emphasis expressing sharp determination as she left him .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 6]: `` I MEAN to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 8]: `` What was he talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 20]: her mother inquired , smoothing the rather worn and old evening wrap she had placed on Alice 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 13]: `` What were you telling him you ` mean to ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 19]: Alice went back to her triple mirror for the last time , then stood before the long one .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 47]: `` That I mean to have a good time to-night , '' she said ; and as she turned from her reflection to the wrap Mrs. Adams held up for her , `` It looks as though I COULD , do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 17]: `` You 'll just be a queen to-night , '' her mother whispered in fond emotion .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 8]: `` You must n't doubt yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 12]: `` Well , there 's one thing , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 20]: `` I think I do look nice enough to get along without having to dance with that Frank Dowling !
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 31]: All I ask is for it to happen just once ; and if he comes near me to-night I 'm going to treat him the way the other girls do .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 13]: Do you suppose Walter 's got the taxi out in front ? ''
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 30]: `` He -- he 's waiting down in the hall , '' Mrs. Adams answered , nervously ; and she held up another garment to go over the wrap .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 5]: Alice frowned at it .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 8]: `` What 's that , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 11]: `` It 's -- it 's your father 's raincoat .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 22]: I thought you 'd put it on over -- '' `` But I wo n't need it in a taxicab . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 20]: `` You will to get in and out , and you need n't take it into the Palmers ' .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 21]: You can leave it in the -- in the -- It 's drizzling , and you 'll need it . ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 37]: `` Oh , well , '' Alice consented ; and a few minutes later , as with Walter 's assistance she climbed into the vehicle he had provided , she better understood her mother 's solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 10]: `` What on earth IS this , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 25]: `` Never mind ; it 'll keep you dry enough with the top up , '' he returned , taking his seat beside her .
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 33]: Then for a time , as they went rather jerkily up the street , she was silent ; but finally she repeated her question : `` What IS it , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 6]: `` What 's what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 7]: `` This -- this CAR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 7]: `` It 's a ottomobile . ''
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 10]: `` I mean -- what kind is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 8]: `` Have n't you got eyes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: `` It 's too dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 12]: `` It 's a second-hand tin Lizzie , '' said Walter .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 7]: `` D'you know what that means ?
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 6]: It means a flivver . ''
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: `` Yes , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 8]: `` Got ` ny ` bjections ? ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 13]: `` Why , no , dear , '' she said , placatively .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 7]: `` Is it yours , Walter ?
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 6]: Have you bought it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 4]: he laughed . ''
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 10]: _ I _ could n't buy a used wheelbarrow .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 13]: I rent this sometimes when I 'm goin ' out among 'em .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 13]: Costs me seventy-five cents and the price o ' the gas . ''
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 7]: `` That seems very moderate . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 6]: `` I guess it is !
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 22]: The feller owes me some money , and this is the only way I 'd ever get it off him . ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 7]: `` Is he a garage-keeper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 5]: `` Not exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 7]: Walter uttered husky sounds of amusement .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 24]: `` You 'll be just as happy , I guess , if you do n't know who he is , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 21]: His tone misgave her ; and she said truthfully that she was content not to know who owned the car .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 30]: `` I joke sometimes about how you keep things to yourself , '' she added , `` but I really never do pry in your affairs , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , you do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 8]: `` Indeed , I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 22]: `` Yes , you 're mighty nice and cooing when you got me where you want me , '' he jeered .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 18]: `` Well , _ I _ just as soon tell you where I get this car . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 18]: `` I 'd just as soon you would n't , Walter , '' she said , hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 6]: `` Please do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 7]: But Walter meant to tell her .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 16]: `` Why , there 's nothin ' exactly CRIMINAL about it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 10]: `` It belongs to old J. A. Lamb himself .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 8]: He keeps it for their coon chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 7]: I rent it from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 6]: `` From Mr. LAMB ? ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 9]: `` No ; from the coon chauffeur . ''
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 4]: `` Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 5]: `` Sure I do !
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 18]: I can get it any night when the coon is n't goin ' to use it himself .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 34]: He 's drivin ' their limousine to-night -- that little Henrietta Lamb 's goin ' to the party , no matter if her father HAS only been dead less 'n a year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 15]: He paused , then inquired : `` Well , how d'you like it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 28]: She did not speak , and he began to be remorseful for having imparted so much information , though his way of expressing regret was his own .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 16]: `` Well , you WILL make the folks make me take you to parties ! ''
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 17]: `` I got to do it the best way I CAN , do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 20]: Then as she made no response , `` Oh , the car 's CLEAN enough , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 21]: `` This coon , he 's as particular as any white man ; you need n't worry about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 25]: And as she still said nothing , he added gruffly , `` I 'd of had a better car if I could afforded it .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 10]: You need n't get so upset about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 26]: `` I do n't understand -- '' she said in a low voice -- `` I do n't understand how you know such people . ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 7]: `` Such people as who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 7]: `` As -- coloured chauffeurs . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 9]: `` Oh , look here , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 5]: he protested , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: `` Do n't you know this is a democratic country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 12]: `` Not quite that democratic , is it , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 27]: `` The trouble with you , '' he retorted , `` you do n't know there 's anybody in town except just this silk-shirt crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 26]: He paused , seeming to await a refutation ; but as none came , he expressed himself definitely : `` They make me sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 26]: They were coming near their destination , and the glow of the big , brightly lighted house was seen before them in the wet night .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 78]: Other cars , not like theirs , were approaching this center of brilliance ; long triangles of light near the ground swept through the fine drizzle ; small red tail-lights gleamed again from the moist pavement of the street ; and , through the myriads of little glistening leaves along the curving driveway , glimpses were caught of lively colours moving in a white glare as the limousines released their occupants under the shelter of the porte-cochere .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 17]: Alice clutched Walter 's arm in a panic ; they were just at the driveway entrance .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 11]: `` Walter , we must n't go in there . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 8]: `` Leave this awful car outside . ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 10]: `` Why , I -- '' `` Stop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: she insisted , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 6]: `` You 've got to !
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 4]: Go back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 6]: `` Oh , Glory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 48]: The little car was between the entrance posts ; but Walter backed it out , avoiding a collision with an impressive machine which swerved away from them and passed on toward the porte-cochere , showing a man 's face grinning at the window as it went by .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 9]: `` Flivver runabout got the wrong number ! ''
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 7]: `` Did he SEE us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 7]: `` Did who see us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 10]: `` Harvey Malone -- in that foreign coupe . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 36]: `` No ; he could n't tell who we were under this top , '' Walter assured her as he brought the little car to a standstill beside the curbstone , out in the street .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 14]: `` What 's it matter if he did , the big fish ? ''
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 11]: Alice responded with a loud sigh , and sat still .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 10]: `` Well , want to go on back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 3]: Walter inquired .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 8]: `` You bet I 'm willing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 18]: `` Well , then , what 's the matter our drivin ' on up to the porte-cochere ?
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 15]: There 's room for me to park just the other side of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 6]: `` No , NO ! ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 7]: `` What you expect to do ?
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 6]: Sit HERE all night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 10]: `` No , leave the car here . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 15]: _ I _ do n't care where we leave it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 23]: `` Sit still till I lock her , so none o ' these millionaires around here 'll run off with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 22]: He got out with a padlock and chain ; and , having put these in place , offered Alice his hand .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 10]: `` Come on , if you 're ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 20]: `` Wait , '' she said , and , divesting herself of the raincoat , handed it to Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 27]: `` Please leave this with your things in the men 's dressing-room , as if it were an extra one of your own , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 14]: He nodded ; she jumped out ; and they scurried through the drizzle .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 23]: As they reached the porte-cochere she began to laugh airily , and spoke to the impassive man in livery who stood there .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 6]: `` Joke on us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 13]: she said , hurrying by him toward the door of the house .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 10]: `` Our car broke down outside the gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 40]: The man remained impassive , though he responded with a faint gleam as Walter , looking back at him , produced for his benefit a cynical distortion of countenance which offered little confirmation of Alice 's account of things .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 42]: Then the door was swiftly opened to the brother and sister ; and they came into a marble-floored hall , where a dozen sleeked young men lounged , smoked cigarettes and fastened their gloves , as they waited for their ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 32]: Alice nodded to one or another of these , and went quickly on , her face uplifted and smiling ; but Walter detained her at the door to which she hastened .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 8]: `` Listen here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 28]: `` I suppose you want me to dance the first dance with you -- '' `` If you please , Walter , '' she said , meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 20]: `` How long you goin ' to hang around fixin ' up in that dressin ' - room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 32]: `` I 'll be out before you 're ready yourself , '' she promised him ; and kept her word , she was so eager for her good time to begin .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 36]: When he came for her , they went down the hall to a corridor opening upon three great rooms which had been thrown open together , with the furniture removed and the broad floors waxed .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 39]: At one end of the corridor musicians sat in a green grove , and Walter , with some interest , turned toward these ; but his sister , pressing his arm , impelled him in the opposite direction .
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 16]: `` That 's Jazz Louie and his half-breed bunch -- three white and four mulatto .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 5]: Let 's -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 14]: `` We must speak to Mildred and Mr. and Mrs. Palmer . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 6]: ` Speak ' to 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 13]: I have n't got a thing to say to THOSE berries ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 10]: `` Walter , wo n't you PLEASE behave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 35]: He seemed to consent , for the moment , at least , and suffered her to take him down the corridor toward a floral bower where the hostess stood with her father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 83]: Other couples and groups were moving in the same direction , carrying with them a hubbub of laughter and fragmentary chatterings ; and Alice , smiling all the time , greeted people on every side of her eagerly -- a little more eagerly than most of them responded -- while Walter nodded in a noncommittal manner to one or two , said nothing , and yawned audibly , the last resource of a person who finds himself nervous in a false situation .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 28]: He repeated his yawn and was beginning another when a convulsive pressure upon his arm made him understand that he must abandon this method of reassuring himself .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: They were close upon the floral bower .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 59]: Mildred was giving her hand to one and another of her guests as rapidly as she could , passing them on to her father and mother , and at the same time resisting the efforts of three or four detached bachelors who besought her to give over her duty in favour of the dance-music just beginning to blare .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 49]: She was a large , fair girl , with a kindness of eye somewhat withheld by an expression of fastidiousness ; at first sight of her it was clear that she would never in her life do anything `` incorrect , '' or wear anything `` incorrect . ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 50]: But her correctness was of the finer sort , and had no air of being studied or achieved ; conduct would never offer her a problem to be settled from a book of rules , for the rules were so deep within her that she was unconscious of them .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 19]: And behind this perfection there was an even ampler perfection of what Mrs. Adams called `` background . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 23]: The big , rich , simple house was part of it , and Mildred 's father and mother were part of it .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 49]: They stood beside her , large , serene people , murmuring graciously and gently inclining their handsome heads as they gave their hands to the guests ; and even the youngest and most ebullient of these took on a hushed mannerliness with a closer approach to the bower .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 28]: When the opportunity came for Alice and Walter to pass within this precinct , Alice , going first , leaned forward and whispered in Mildred 's ear .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 9]: `` You DID N'T wear the maize georgette !
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 10]: That 's what I thought you were going to .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 6]: But you look simply DARLING !
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 36]: And those pearls -- '' Others were crowding decorously forward , anxious to be done with ceremony and get to the dancing ; and Mildred did not prolong the intimacy of Alice 's enthusiastic whispering .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 29]: With a faint accession of colour and a smile tending somewhat in the direction of rigidity , she carried Alice 's hand immediately onward to Mrs. Palmer 's .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 59]: Alice 's own colour showed a little heightening as she accepted the suggestion thus implied ; nor was that emotional tint in any wise decreased , a moment later , by an impression that Walter , in concluding the brief exchange of courtesies between himself and the stately Mr. Palmer , had again reassured himself with a yawn .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 32]: But she did not speak of it to Walter ; she preferred not to confirm the impression and to leave in her mind a possible doubt that he had done it .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 31]: He followed her out upon the waxed floor , said resignedly : `` Well , come on , '' put his arm about her , and they began to dance .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 13]: Alice danced gracefully and well , but not so well as Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 56]: Of all the steps and runs , of all the whimsical turns and twirlings , of all the rhythmic swayings and dips commanded that season by such blarings as were the barbaric product , loud and wild , of the Jazz Louies and their half-breed bunches , the thin and sallow youth was a master .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 64]: Upon his face could be seen contempt of the easy marvels he performed as he moved in swift precision from one smooth agility to another ; and if some too-dainty or jealous cavalier complained that to be so much a stylist in dancing was `` not quite like a gentleman , '' at least Walter 's style was what the music called for .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 13]: No other dancer in the room could be thought comparable to him .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 5]: Alice told him so .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 6]: `` It 's wonderful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 14]: `` And the mystery is , where you ever learned to DO it !
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 22]: You never went to dancing-school , but there is n't a man in the room who can dance half so well .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 24]: I do n't see why , when you dance like this , you always make such a fuss about coming to parties . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 30]: He sounded his brief laugh , a jeering bark out of one side of the mouth , and swung her miraculously through a closing space between two other couples .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 14]: `` You know a lot about what goes on , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 22]: You prob ` ly think there 's no other place to dance in this town except these frozen-face joints . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 6]: ` Frozen face ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 5]: she echoed , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 10]: `` Why , everybody 's having a splendid time .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 5]: Look at them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 12]: `` Oh , they holler loud enough , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 17]: `` They do it to make each other think they 're havin ' a good time .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 15]: You do n't call that Palmer family frozen-face berries , I s ` pose .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 3]: No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 11]: They 're just dignified and -- '' `` Yeuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 3]: said Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 31]: `` They 're dignified , ` specially when you tried to whisper to Mildred to show how IN with her you were , and she moved you on that way .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 11]: SHE 'S a hot friend , is n't she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 9]: `` She did n't mean anything by it .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 39]: She -- '' `` Ole Palmer 's a hearty , slap you-on-the-back ole berry , '' Walter interrupted ; adding in a casual tone , `` All I 'd like , I 'd like to hit him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 3]: `` Walter !
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 21]: By the way , you must n't forget to ask Mildred for a dance before the evening is over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 4]: `` Me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 15]: He produced the lop-sided appearance of his laugh , but without making it vocal .
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 8]: `` You watch me do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 18]: `` She probably wo n't have one left , but you must ask her , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 6]: `` Why must I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 28]: `` Because , in the first place , you 're supposed to , and , in the second place , she 's my most intimate friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 3]: `` Yeuh ?
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 3]: Is she ?
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 15]: I 've heard you pull that ` most-intimate-friend ' stuff often enough about her .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 11]: What 's SHE ever do to show she is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 4]: `` Never mind .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 8]: You really must ask her , Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 23]: I want you to ; and I want you to ask several other girls afterwhile ; I 'll tell you who . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 12]: `` Keep on wanting ; it 'll do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 12]: `` Oh , but you really -- '' `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 28]: `` I 'm just as liable to dance with any of these fairies as I am to buy a bucket o ' rusty tacks and eat 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 3]: Forget it !
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 29]: Soon as I get rid of you I 'm goin ' back to that room where I left my hat and overcoat and smoke myself to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 44]: `` Well , '' she said , a little ruefully , as the frenzy of Jazz Louie and his half-breeds was suddenly abated to silence , `` you must n't -- you must n't get rid of me TOO soon , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 15]: They stood near one of the wide doorways , remaining where they had stopped .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 44]: Other couples , everywhere , joined one another , forming vivacious clusters , but none of these groups adopted the brother and sister , nor did any one appear to be hurrying in Alice 's direction to ask her for the next dance .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 68]: She looked about her , still maintaining that jubilance of look and manner she felt so necessary -- for it is to the girls who are `` having a good time '' that partners are attracted -- and , in order to lend greater colour to her impersonation of a lively belle , she began to chatter loudly , bringing into play an accompaniment of frolicsome gesture .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 45]: She brushed Walter 's nose saucily with the bunch of violets in her hand , tapped him on the shoulder , shook her pretty forefinger in his face , flourished her arms , kept her shoulders moving , and laughed continuously as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 7]: `` You NAUGHTY old Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 21]: `` ARE N'T you ashamed to be such a wonderful dancer and then only dance with your own little sister !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 11]: You could dance on the stage if you wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 10]: Why , you could made your FORTUNE that way !
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 5]: Why do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 24]: Would n't it be just lovely to have all the rows and rows of people clapping their hands and shouting , ` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 6]: Hurrah , for Walter Adams !
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 2]: Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 3]: Hurrah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 9]: He stood looking at her in stolid pity .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 9]: `` Cut it out , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 21]: `` You better be givin ' some of these berries the eye so they 'll ask you to dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 21]: She was not to be so easily checked , and laughed loudly , flourishing her violets in his face again .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 16]: `` You WOULD like it ; you know you would ; you need n't pretend !
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 3]: Just think !
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 9]: A whole big audience shouting , ` Hurrah !
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 2]: HURRAH !
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 23]: HUR -- ' '' `` The place 'll be pulled if you get any noisier , '' he interrupted , not ungently .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 10]: `` Besides , I 'm no muley cow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 7]: `` A ` COW ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 18]: `` What on earth -- '' `` I ca n't eat dead violets , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 14]: `` So do n't keep tryin ' to make me do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 36]: This had the effect he desired , and subdued her ; she abandoned her unsisterly coquetries , and looked beamingly about her , but her smile was more mechanical than it had been at first .
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 36]: At home she had seemed beautiful ; but here , where the other girls competed , things were not as they had been there , with only her mother and Miss Perry to give contrast .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 34]: These crowds of other girls had all done their best , also , to look beautiful , though not one of them had worked so hard for such a consummation as Alice had .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 31]: They did not need to ; they did not need to get their mothers to make old dresses over ; they did not need to hunt violets in the rain .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 48]: At home her dress had seemed beautiful ; but that was different , too , where there were dozens of brilliant fabrics , fashioned in new ways -- some of these new ways startling , which only made the wearers centers of interest and shocked no one .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 20]: And Alice remembered that she had heard a girl say , not long before , `` Oh , ORGANDIE !
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 11]: Nobody wears organdie for evening gowns except in midsummer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 38]: Alice had thought little of this ; but as she looked about her and saw no organdie except her own , she found greater difficulty in keeping her smile as arch and spontaneous as she wished it .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 14]: In fact , it was beginning to make her face ache a little .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 10]: Mildred came in from the corridor , heavily attended .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 40]: She carried a great bouquet of violets laced with lilies of-the-valley ; and the violets were lusty , big purple things , their stems wrapped in cloth of gold , with silken cords dependent , ending in long tassels .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 70]: She and her convoy passed near the two young Adamses ; and it appeared that one of the convoy besought his hostess to permit `` cutting in '' ; they were `` doing it other places '' of late , he urged ; but he was denied and told to console himself by holding the bouquet , at intervals , until his third of the sixteenth dance should come .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 8]: Alice looked dubiously at her own bouquet .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 42]: Suddenly she felt that the violets betrayed her ; that any one who looked at them could see how rustic , how innocent of any florist 's craft they were `` I ca n't eat dead violets , '' Walter said .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 37]: The little wild flowers , dying indeed in the warm air , were drooping in a forlorn mass ; and it seemed to her that whoever noticed them would guess that she had picked them herself .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 8]: She decided to get rid of them .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 5]: Walter was becoming restive .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 20]: `` Ca n't you flag one o ' these long-tailed birds to take you on for the next dance ?
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 18]: You came to have a good time ; why do n't you get busy and have it ?
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 9]: I want to get out and smoke . ''
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 15]: `` You MUST N'T leave me , Walter , '' she whispered , hastily .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 25]: `` Somebody 'll come for me before long , but until they do -- '' `` Well , could n't you sit somewhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 5]: `` No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 11]: There is n't any one I could sit with . ''
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 6]: `` Well , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 9]: Look at those ole dames in the corners .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 18]: What 's the matter your tyin ' up with some o ' them for a while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 8]: `` PLEASE , Walter ; no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 24]: In fact , that indomitable smile of hers was the more difficult to maintain because of these very elders to whom Walter referred .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 70]: They were mothers of girls among the dancers , and they were there to fend and contrive for their offspring ; to keep them in countenance through any trial ; to lend them diplomacy in the carrying out of all enterprises ; to be `` background '' for them ; and in these essentially biological functionings to imitate their own matings and renew the excitement of their nuptial periods .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 32]: Older men , husbands of these ladies and fathers of eligible girls , were also to be seen , most of them with Mr. Palmer in a billiard-room across the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 9]: Mr. and Mrs. Adams had not been invited .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 69]: `` Of course papa and mama just barely know Mildred Palmer , '' Alice thought , `` and most of the other girls ' fathers and mothers are old friends of Mr. and Mrs. Palmer , but I do think she might have ASKED papa and mama , anyway -- she need n't have been afraid just to ask them ; she knew they could n't come . ''
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 16]: And her smiling lip twitched a little threateningly , as she concluded the silent monologue .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 16]: `` I suppose she thinks I ought to be glad enough she asked Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 9]: Walter was , in fact , rather noticeable .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 52]: He was not Mildred 's only guest to wear a short coat and to appear without gloves ; but he was singular -LRB- at least in his present surroundings -RRB- on account of a kind of coiffuring he favoured , his hair having been shaped after what seemed a Mongol inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 19]: Only upon the top of the head was actual hair perceived , the rest appearing to be nudity .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 52]: And even more than by any difference in mode he was set apart by his look and manner , in which there seemed to be a brooding , secretive and jeering superiority and this was most vividly expressed when he felt called upon for his loud , short , lop-sided laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 19]: Whenever he uttered it Alice laughed , too , as loudly as she could , to cover it .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 7]: `` Well , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 10]: `` How long we goin ' to stand here ?
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 8]: My feet are sproutin ' roots . ''
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 63]: Alice took his arm , and they began to walk aimlessly through the rooms , though she tried to look as if they had a definite destination , keeping her eyes eager and her lips parted ; -- people had called jovially to them from the distance , she meant to imply , and they were going to join these merry friends .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 23]: She was still upon this ghostly errand when a furious outbreak of drums and saxophones sounded a prelude for the second dance .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 13]: Walter danced with her again , but he gave her a warning .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 25]: `` I do n't want to leave you high and dry , '' he told her , `` but I ca n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 33]: I got to get somewhere I do n't haf ' to hurt my eyes with these berries ; I 'll go blind if I got to look at any more of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 26]: I 'm goin ' out to smoke as soon as the music begins the next time , and you better get fixed for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 8]: Alice tried to get fixed for it .
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 45]: As they danced she nodded sunnily to every man whose eye she caught , smiled her smile with the under lip caught between her teeth ; but it was not until the end of the intermission after the dance that she saw help coming .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 32]: Across the room sat the globular lady she had encountered that morning , and beside the globular lady sat a round-headed , round-bodied girl ; her daughter , at first glance .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 39]: The family contour was also as evident a characteristic of the short young man who stood in front of Mrs. Dowling , engaged with her in a discussion which was not without evidences of an earnestness almost impassioned .
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 20]: Like Walter , he was declining to dance a third time with sister ; he wished to go elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 61]: Alice from a sidelong eye watched the controversy : she saw the globular young man glance toward her , over his shoulder ; whereupon Mrs. Dowling , following this glance , gave Alice a look of open fury , became much more vehement in the argument , and even struck her knee with a round , fat fist for emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 11]: `` I 'm on my way , '' said Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 20]: `` There 's the music startin ' up again , and I told you -- '' She nodded gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 15]: `` It 's all right -- but come back before long , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 24]: The globular young man , red with annoyance , had torn himself from his family and was hastening across the room to her .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 9]: `` C 'n I have this dance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 9]: `` Why , you nice Frank Dowling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 5]: `` How lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 5]: CHAPTER VII They danced .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 12]: Mr. Dowling should have found other forms of exercise and pastime .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 22]: Nature has not designed everyone for dancing , though sometimes those she has denied are the last to discover her niggardliness .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 49]: But the round young man was at least vigorous enough -- too much so , when his knees collided with Alice 's -- and he was too sturdy to be thrown off his feet , himself , or to allow his partner to fall when he tripped her .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 22]: He held her up valiantly , and continued to beat a path through the crowd of other dancers by main force .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 69]: He paid no attention to anything suggested by the efforts of the musicians , and appeared to be unaware that there should have been some connection between what they were doing and what he was doing ; but he may have listened to other music of his own , for his expression was of high content ; he seemed to feel no doubt whatever that he was dancing .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 53]: Alice kept as far away from him as under the circumstances she could ; and when they stopped she glanced down , and found the execution of unseen manoeuvres , within the protection of her skirt , helpful to one of her insteps and to the toes of both of her slippers .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 13]: Her cheery partner was paddling his rosy brows with a fine handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 6]: `` That was great ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 21]: `` Let 's go out and sit in the corridor ; they 've got some comfortable chairs out there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 11]: `` Well -- let 's not , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 16]: `` I believe I 'd rather stay in here and look at the crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 19]: `` No ; that is n't it , '' he said , chiding her with a waggish forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 35]: `` You think if you go out there you 'll miss a chance of someone else asking you for the next dance , and so you 'll have to give it to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 5]: `` How absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 28]: Then , after a look about her that revealed nothing encouraging , she added graciously , `` You can have the next if you want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 4]: `` Great ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 5]: he exclaimed , mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 17]: `` Now let 's get out of here -- out of THIS room , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 16]: What 's the matter with -- '' `` My mother , '' Mr. Dowling explained .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 8]: `` But do n't look at her .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 25]: She keeps motioning me to come and see after Ella , and I 'm simply NOT going to do it , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 40]: `` I do n't believe it 's so much that , '' she said , and consented to walk with him to a point in the next room from which Mrs. Dowling 's continuous signalling could not be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 7]: `` Your mother hates me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 11]: `` Oh , no ; I would n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 12]: No , she do n't , '' he protested , innocently .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 16]: `` She do n't know you more than just to speak to , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 6]: So how could she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 6]: `` Well , she does .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 5]: I can tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 8]: A frown appeared upon his rounded brow .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 12]: `` No ; I 'll tell you the way she feels .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 46]: It 's like this : Ella is n't TOO popular , you know -- it 's hard to see why , because she 's a right nice girl , in her way -- and mother thinks I ought to look after her , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 40]: She thinks I ought to dance a whole lot with her myself , and stir up other fellows to dance with her -- it 's simply impossible to make mother understand you CA N'T do that , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 32]: And then about me , you see , if she had her way I would n't get to dance with anybody at all except girls like Mildred Palmer and Henrietta Lamb .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 83]: Mother wants to run my whole programme for me , you understand , but the trouble of it is -- about girls like that , you see well , I could n't do what she wants , even if I wanted to myself , because you take those girls , and by the time I get Ella off my hands for a minute , why , their dances are always every last one taken , and where do I come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 7]: Alice nodded , her amiability undamaged .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 10]: So that 's why you dance with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 11]: `` No , I like to , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 14]: `` I rather dance with you than I do with those girls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 24]: And he added with a retrospective determination which showed that he had been through quite an experience with Mrs. Dowling in this matter .
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 10]: `` I TOLD mother I would , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 11]: `` Did it take all your courage , Frank ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 6]: He looked at her shrewdly .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 13]: `` Now you 're trying to tease me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 13]: `` I do n't care ; I WOULD rather dance with you !
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 35]: In the first place , you 're a perfectly beautiful dancer , you see , and in the second , a man feels a lot more comfortable with you than he does with them .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 32]: Of course I know almost all the other fellows get along with those girls all right ; but I do n't waste any time on 'em I do n't have to .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 21]: _ I _ like people that are always cordial to everybody , you see -- the way you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 10]: `` Thank you , '' she said , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 11]: `` Oh , I MEAN it , '' he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 7]: `` There goes the band again .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 4]: Shall we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 8]: `` Suppose we sit it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 3]: she suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 24]: `` I believe I 'd like to go out in the corridor , after all -- it 's pretty warm in here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 41]: Assenting cheerfully , Dowling conducted her to a pair of easy-chairs within a secluding grove of box-trees , and when they came to this retreat they found Mildred Palmer just departing , under escort of a well-favoured gentleman about thirty .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 70]: As these two walked slowly away , in the direction of the dancing-floor , they left it not to be doubted that they were on excellent terms with each other ; Mildred was evidently willing to make their progress even slower , for she halted momentarily , once or twice ; and her upward glances to her tall companion 's face were of a gentle , almost blushing deference .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 14]: Never before had Alice seen anything like this in her friend 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 5]: `` How queer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 6]: `` What 's queer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 7]: Dowling inquired as they sat down .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 7]: `` Who was that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 8]: `` Have n't you met him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 7]: `` I never saw him before .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 5]: Who is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: `` Why , it 's this Arthur Russell . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 5]: `` What Arthur Russell ?
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 7]: I never heard of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 5]: Mr. Dowling was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 7]: `` Why , THAT 'S funny !
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 21]: Only the last time I saw you , you were telling me how awfully well you knew Mildred Palmer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 12]: `` Why , certainly I do , '' Alice informed him .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 9]: `` She 's my most intimate friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 41]: `` That 's what makes it seem so funny you have n't heard anything about this Russell , because everybody says even if she is n't engaged to him right now , she most likely will be before very long .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 16]: I must say it looks a good deal that way to me , myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 5]: `` What nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 3]: Alice exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 11]: `` She 's never even mentioned him to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 25]: The young man glanced at her dubiously and passed a finger over the tiny prong that dashingly composed the whole substance of his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 15]: `` Well , you see , Mildred IS pretty reserved , '' he remarked .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 17]: `` This Russell is some kind of cousin of the Palmer family , I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 5]: `` He is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 13]: `` Yes -- second or third or something , the girls say .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 45]: You see , my sister Ella has n't got much to do at home , and do n't read anything , or sew , or play solitaire , you see ; and she hears about pretty much everything that goes on , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 27]: Well , Ella says a lot of the girls have been talking about Mildred and this Arthur Russell for quite a while back , you see .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 57]: They were all wondering what he was going to look like , you see ; because he only got here yesterday ; and that proves she must have been talking to some of 'em , or else how -- '' Alice laughed airily , but the pretty sound ended abruptly with an audible intake of breath .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 34]: `` Of course , while Mildred IS my most intimate friend , '' she said , `` I do n't mean she tells me everything -- and naturally she has other friends besides .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 15]: What else did your sister say she told them about this Mr. Russell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 20]: `` Well , it seems he 's VERY well off ; at least Henrietta Lamb told Ella he was .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 13]: Ella says -- '' Alice interrupted again , with an increased irritability .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 9]: `` Oh , never mind what Ella says !
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 13]: Let 's find something better to talk about than Mr. Russell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 14]: `` Well , I 'M willing , '' Mr. Dowling assented , ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 9]: `` What you want to talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 42]: But this liberal offer found her unresponsive ; she sat leaning back , silent , her arms along the arms of her chair , and her eyes , moist and bright , fixed upon a wide doorway where the dancers fluctuated .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 36]: She was disquieted by more than Mildred 's reserve , though reserve so marked had certainly the significance of a warning that Alice 's definition , `` my most intimate friend , '' lacked sanction .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 25]: Indirect notice to this effect could not well have been more emphatic , but the sting of it was left for a later moment .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 15]: Something else preoccupied Alice : she had just been surprised by an odd experience .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 46]: At first sight of this Mr. Arthur Russell , she had said to herself instantly , in words as definite as if she spoke them aloud , though they seemed more like words spoken to her by some unknown person within her : `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 15]: That 's exactly the kind of looking man I 'd like to marry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 55]: In the eyes of the restless and the longing , Providence often appears to be worse than inscrutable : an unreliable Omnipotence given to haphazard whimsies in dealing with its own creatures , choosing at random some among them to be rent with tragic deprivations and others to be petted with blessing upon blessing .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 26]: In Alice 's eyes , Mildred had been blessed enough ; something ought to be left over , by this time , for another girl .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 37]: The final touch to the heaping perfection of Christmas-in-everything for Mildred was that this Mr. Arthur Russell , good-looking , kind-looking , graceful , the perfect fiance , should be also `` VERY well off . ''
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 7]: These rich always married one another .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 38]: And while the Mildreds danced with their Arthur Russells the best an outsider could do for herself was to sit with Frank Dowling -- the one last course left her that was better than dancing with him .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 12]: `` Well , what DO you want to talk about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 7]: `` Nothing , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 9]: `` Suppose we just sit , Frank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 19]: But a moment later she remembered something , and , with a sudden animation , began to prattle .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 9]: She pointed to the musicians down the corridor .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 7]: `` Oh , look at them !
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 5]: Look at the leader !
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 5]: Are n't they FUNNY ?
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 15]: Someone told me they 're called ` Jazz Louie and his half-breed bunch . '
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 6]: Is n't that just crazy ?
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 6]: Do n't you love it ?
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 7]: Do watch them , Frank . ''
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 38]: She continued to chatter , and , while thus keeping his glance away from herself , she detached the forlorn bouquet of dead violets from her dress and laid it gently beside the one she had carried .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 19]: The latter already reposed in the obscurity selected for it at the base of one of the box-trees .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 6]: Then she was abruptly silent .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 12]: `` You certainly are a funny girl , '' Dowling remarked .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 47]: `` You say you do n't want to talk about anything at all , and all of a sudden you break out and talk a blue streak ; and just about the time I begin to get interested in what you 're saying you shut off !
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 17]: What 's the matter with girls , anyhow , when they do things like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 15]: `` I do n't know ; we 're just queer , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 5]: `` I say so !
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 8]: Well , what 'll we do NOW ?
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 7]: Talk , or just sit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 9]: `` Suppose we just sit some more . ''
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 9]: `` Anything to oblige , '' he assented .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 13]: `` I 'm willing to sit as long as you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 30]: But even as he made his amiability clear in this matter , the peace was threatened -- his mother came down the corridor like a rolling , ominous cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 27]: She was looking about her on all sides , in a fidget of annoyance , searching for him , and to his dismay she saw him .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 25]: She immediately made a horrible face at his companion , beckoned to him imperiously with a dumpy arm , and shook her head reprovingly .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 43]: The unfortunate young man tried to repulse her with an icy stare , but this effort having obtained little to encourage his feeble hope of driving her away , he shifted his chair so that his back was toward her discomfiting pantomime .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 19]: He should have known better , the instant result was Mrs. Dowling in motion at an impetuous waddle .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 39]: She entered the box-tree seclusion with the lower rotundities of her face hastily modelled into the resemblance of an over-benevolent smile a contortion which neglected to spread its intended geniality upward to the exasperated eyes and anxious forehead .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 21]: `` I think your mother wants to speak to you , Frank , '' Alice said , upon this advent .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 6]: Mrs. Dowling nodded to her .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: `` Good evening , Miss Adams , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 29]: `` I just thought as you and Frank were n't dancing you would n't mind my disturbing you -- '' `` Not at all , '' Alice murmured .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 8]: Mr. Dowling seemed of a different mind .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 9]: `` Well , what DO you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 13]: he inquired , whereupon his mother struck him roguishly with her fan .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 5]: `` Bad fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 5]: She turned to Alice .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 24]: `` I 'm sure you wo n't mind excusing him to let him do something for his old mother , Miss Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 7]: `` What DO you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 4]: the son repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 12]: `` Two very nice things , '' Mrs. Dowling informed him .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 53]: `` Everybody is so anxious for Henrietta Lamb to have a pleasant evening , because it 's the very first time she 's been anywhere since her father 's death , and of course her dear grandfather 's an old friend of ours , and -- '' `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 4]: her son interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 13]: `` Miss Adams is n't interested in all this , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 29]: `` But Henrietta came to speak to Ella and me , and I told her you were so anxious to dance with her -- '' `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 21]: I 'd rather do my own -- '' `` Yes ; that 's just it , '' Mrs. Dowling explained .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 38]: `` I just thought it was such a good opportunity ; and Henrietta said she had most of her dances taken , but she 'd give you one if you asked her before they were all gone .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 14]: So I thought you 'd better see her as soon as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 7]: Dowling 's face had become rosy .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 11]: `` I refuse to do anything of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: `` Bad fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 6]: said his mother , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 54]: `` I thought this would be the best time for you to see Henrietta , because it wo n't be long till all her dances are gone , and you 've promised on your WORD to dance the next with Ella , and you might n't have a chance to do it then .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 21]: I 'm sure Miss Adams wo n't mind if you -- '' `` Not at all , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 9]: `` Well , _ I _ mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 27]: `` I wish you COULD understand that when I want to dance with any girl I do n't need my mother to ask her for me .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 10]: I really AM more than six years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 19]: He spoke with too much vehemence , and Mrs. Dowling at once saw how to have her way .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 69]: As with husbands and wives , so with many fathers and daughters , and so with some sons and mothers : the man will himself be cross in public and think nothing of it , nor will he greatly mind a little crossness on the part of the woman ; but let her show agitation before any spectator , he is instantly reduced to a coward 's slavery .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 27]: Women understand that ancient weakness , of course ; for it is one of their most important means of defense , but can be used ignobly .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 12]: Mrs. Dowling permitted a tremulousness to become audible in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 24]: `` It is n't very -- very pleasant -- to be talked to like that by your own son -- before strangers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 5]: `` Oh , my !
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 4]: Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 6]: the stricken Dowling protested . ''
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 10]: _ I _ did n't say anything , mother .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 17]: I was just joking about how you never get over thinking I 'm a little boy .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 20]: I only -- '' Mrs. Dowling continued : `` I just thought I was doing you a little favour .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 12]: I did n't think it would make you so angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 8]: `` Mother , for goodness ' sake !
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 31]: Miss Adams 'll think -- '' `` I suppose , '' Mrs. Dowling interrupted , piteously , `` I suppose it does n't matter what _ I _ think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 6]: `` Oh , gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 16]: Alice interfered ; she perceived that the ruthless Mrs. Dowling meant to have her way .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 10]: `` I think you 'd better go , Frank .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 3]: Really . ''
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 4]: his mother cried .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 8]: `` Miss Adams says so , herself !
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 7]: What more do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 6]: `` Oh , gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 28]: he lamented again , and , with a sick look over his shoulder at Alice , permitted his mother to take his arm and propel him away .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 39]: Mrs. Dowling 's spirits had strikingly recovered even before the pair passed from the corridor : she moved almost bouncingly beside her embittered son , and her eyes and all the convolutions of her abundant face were blithe .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 15]: Alice went in search of Walter , but without much hope of finding him .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 29]: What he did with himself at frozen-face dances was one of his most successful mysteries , and her present excursion gave her no clue leading to its solution .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 28]: When the musicians again lowered their instruments for an interval she had returned , alone , to her former seat within the partial shelter of the box-trees .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 36]: She had now to practice an art that affords but a limited variety of methods , even to the expert : the art of seeming to have an escort or partner when there is none .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 75]: The practitioner must imply , merely by expression and attitude , that the supposed companion has left her for only a few moments , that she herself has sent him upon an errand ; and , if possible , the minds of observers must be directed toward a conclusion that this errand of her devising is an amusing one ; at all events , she is alone temporarily and of choice , not deserted .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 12]: She awaits a devoted man who may return at any instant .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 16]: Other people desired to sit in Alice 's nook , but discovered her in occupancy .
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 40]: She had moved the vacant chair closer to her own , and she sat with her arm extended so that her hand , holding her lace kerchief , rested upon the back of this second chair , claiming it .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 50]: Such a preemption , like that of a traveller 's bag in the rack , was unquestionable ; and , for additional evidence , sitting with her knees crossed , she kept one foot continuously moving a little , in cadence with the other , which tapped the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 57]: Moreover , she added a fine detail : her half-smile , with the under lip caught , seemed to struggle against repression , as if she found the service engaging her absent companion even more amusing than she would let him see when he returned : there was jovial intrigue of some sort afoot , evidently .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 75]: Her eyes , beaming with secret fun , were averted from intruders , but sometimes , when couples approached , seeking possession of the nook , her thoughts about the absentee appeared to threaten her with outright laughter ; and though one or two girls looked at her skeptically , as they turned away , their escorts felt no such doubts , and merely wondered what importantly funny affair Alice Adams was engaged in .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 8]: She had learned to do it perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 34]: She had learned it during the last two years ; she was twenty when for the first time she had the shock of finding herself without an applicant for one of her dances .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 56]: When she was sixteen `` all the nice boys in town , '' as her mother said , crowded the Adamses ' small veranda and steps , or sat near by , cross-legged on the lawn , on summer evenings ; and at eighteen she had replaced the boys with `` the older men . ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 53]: By this time most of `` the other girls , '' her contemporaries , were away at school or college , and when they came home to stay , they `` came out '' -- that feeble revival of an ancient custom offering the maiden to the ceremonial inspection of the tribe .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 42]: Alice neither went away nor `` came out , '' and , in contrast with those who did , she may have seemed to lack freshness of lustre -- jewels are richest when revealed all new in a white velvet box .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 23]: And Alice may have been too eager to secure new retainers , too kind in her efforts to keep the old ones .
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 8]: She had been a belle too soon .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 56]: CHAPTER VIII The device of the absentee partner has the defect that it can not be employed for longer than ten or fifteen minutes at a time , and it may not be repeated more than twice in one evening : a single repetition , indeed , is weak , and may prove a betrayal .
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 41]: Alice knew that her present performance could be effective during only this interval between dances ; and though her eyes were guarded , she anxiously counted over the partnerless young men who lounged together in the doorways within her view .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 45]: Every one of them ought to have asked her for dances , she thought , and although she might have been put to it to give a reason why any of them `` ought , '' her heart was hot with resentment against them .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 30]: For a girl who has been a belle , it is harder to live through these bad times than it is for one who has never known anything better .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 46]: Like a figure of painted and brightly varnished wood , Ella Dowling sat against the wall through dance after dance with glassy imperturbability ; it was easier to be wooden , Alice thought , if you had your mother with you , as Ella had .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 48]: You were left with at least the shred of a pretense that you came to sit with your mother as a spectator , and not to offer yourself to be danced with by men who looked you over and rejected you -- not for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 13]: `` Not for the first time '' : there lay a sting !
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 14]: Why had you thought this time might be different from the other times ?
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 12]: Why had you broken your back picking those hundreds of violets ?
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 42]: Hating the fatuous young men in the doorways more bitterly for every instant that she had to maintain her tableau , the smiling Alice knew fierce impulses to spring to her feet and shout at them , `` You IDIOTS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 35]: Hands in pockets , they lounged against the pilasters , or faced one another , laughing vaguely , each one of them seeming to Alice no more than so much mean beef in clothes .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 30]: She wanted to tell them they were no better than that ; and it seemed a cruel thing of heaven to let them go on believing themselves young lords .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 8]: They were doing nothing , killing time .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 15]: Was n't she at her lowest value at least a means of killing time ?
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 7]: Evidently the mean beeves thought not .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 27]: And when one of them finally lounged across the corridor and spoke to her , he was the very one to whom she preferred her loneliness .
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 9]: `` Waiting for somebody , Lady Alicia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 22]: he asked , negligently ; and his easy burlesque of her name was like the familiarity of the rest of him .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 36]: He was one of those full-bodied , grossly handsome men who are powerful and active , but never submit themselves to the rigour of becoming athletes , though they shoot and fish from expensive camps .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 11]: Gloss is the most shining outward mark of the type .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 36]: Nowadays these men no longer use brilliantine on their moustaches , but they have gloss bought from manicure-girls , from masseurs , and from automobile-makers ; and their eyes , usually large , are glossy .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 24]: None of this is allowed to interfere with business ; these are `` good business men , '' and often make large fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 28]: They are men of imagination about two things -- women and money , and , combining their imaginings about both , usually make a wise first marriage .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 24]: Later , however , they are apt to imagine too much about some little woman without whom life seems duller than need be .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 12]: They run away , leaving the first wife well enough dowered .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 29]: They are never intentionally unkind to women , and in the end they usually make the mistake of thinking they have had their money 's worth of life .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 41]: Here was Mr. Harvey Malone , a young specimen in an earlier stage of development , trying to marry Henrietta Lamb , and now sauntering over to speak to Alice , as a time-killer before his next dance with Henrietta .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 25]: Alice made no response to his question , and he dropped lazily into the vacant chair , from which she sharply withdrew her hand .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 17]: `` I might as well use his chair till he comes , do n't you think ?
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 12]: You do n't MIND , do you , old girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 11]: `` It does n't matter one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 8]: Please do n't call me that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 9]: `` So that 's how you feel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 9]: Mr. Malone laughed indulgently , without much interest .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 32]: `` I 've been meaning to come to see you for a long time honestly I have -- because I wanted to have a good talk with you about old times .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 49]: I know you think it was funny , after the way I used to come to your house two or three times a week , and sometimes oftener -- well , I do n't blame you for being hurt , the way I stopped without explaining or anything .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 28]: The truth is there was n't any reason : I just happened to have a lot of important things to do and could n't find the time .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 15]: But I AM going to call on you some evening -- honestly I am .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 17]: I do n't wonder you think -- '' `` You 're mistaken , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 12]: `` I 've never thought anything about it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 9]: he said , and looked at her languidly .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 13]: `` What 's the use of being cross with this old man ?
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 6]: He always means well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 22]: And , extending his arm , he would have given her a friendly pat upon the shoulder but she evaded it .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 10]: `` Seems to me you 're getting awful tetchy !
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 11]: Do n't you like your old friends any more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 7]: `` Not all of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 8]: `` Who 's the new one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 5]: he asked , teasingly .
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 9]: `` Come on and tell us , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 11]: Who is it you were holding this chair for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 5]: `` Never mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 27]: `` Well , all I 've got to do is to sit here till he comes back ; then I 'll see who it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 13]: `` He may not come back before you have to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 17]: `` Guess you got me THAT time , '' Malone admitted , laughing as he rose .
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 13]: `` They 're tuning up , and I 've got this dance .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 11]: I AM coming around to see you some evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 17]: He moved away , calling back over his shoulder , `` Honestly , I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 7]: Alice did not look at him .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 65]: She had held her tableau as long as she could ; it was time for her to abandon the box-trees ; and she stepped forth frowning , as if a little annoyed with the absentee for being such a time upon her errand ; whereupon the two chairs were instantly seized by a coquetting pair who intended to `` sit out '' the dance .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 26]: She walked quickly down the broad corridor , turned into the broader hall , and hurriedly entered the dressing-room where she had left her wraps .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 42]: She stayed here as long as she could , pretending to arrange her hair at a mirror , then fidgeting with one of her slipper-buckles ; but the intelligent elderly woman in charge of the room made an indefinite sojourn impracticable .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 18]: `` Perhaps I could help you with that buckle , Miss , '' she suggested , approaching .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 7]: `` Has it come loose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 9]: Alice wrenched desperately ; then it was loose .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 31]: The competent woman , producing needle and thread , deftly made the buckle fast ; and there was nothing for Alice to do but to express her gratitude and go .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 20]: She went to the door of the cloak-room opposite , where a coloured man stood watchfully in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 22]: `` I wonder if you know which of the gentlemen is my brother , Mr. Walter Adams , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm ; I know him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 10]: `` Could you tell me where he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 10]: `` No 'm ; I could n't say . ''
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 33]: `` Well , if you see him , would you please tell him that his sister , Miss Adams , is looking for him and very anxious to speak to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: Sho ` ly , sho ` ly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 17]: As she went away he stared after her and seemed to swell with some bursting emotion .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 22]: In fact , it was too much for him , and he suddenly retired within the room , releasing strangulated laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 3]: Walter remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 60]: Behind an excellent screen of coats and hats , in a remote part of the room , he was kneeling on the floor , engaged in a game of chance with a second coloured attendant ; and the laughter became so vehement that it not only interfered with the pastime in hand , but threatened to attract frozen-face attention .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 16]: `` I cain ' he ' p it , man , '' the laughter explained .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 9]: `` I cain ' he ' p it !
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 17]: You sut 'n' y the beatin ` es ' white boy 'n ` is city ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 20]: The dancers were swinging into an `` encore '' as Alice halted for an irresolute moment in a doorway .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 59]: Across the room , a cluster of matrons sat chatting absently , their eyes on their dancing daughters ; and Alice , finding a refugee 's courage , dodged through the scurrying couples , seated herself in a chair on the outskirts of this colony of elders , and began to talk eagerly to the matron nearest her .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 56]: The matron seemed unaccustomed to so much vivacity , and responded but dryly , whereupon Alice was more vivacious than ever ; for she meant now to present the picture of a jolly girl too much interested in these wise older women to bother about every foolish young man who asked her for a dance .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 35]: Her matron was constrained to go so far as to supply a tolerant nod , now and then , in complement to the girl 's animation , and Alice was grateful for the nods .
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 34]: In this fashion she supplemented the exhausted resources of the dressing-room and the box-tree nook ; and lived through two more dances , when again Mr. Frank Dowling presented himself as a partner .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 22]: She needed no pretense to seek the dressing-room for repairs after that number ; this time they were necessary and genuine .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 24]: Dowling waited for her , and when she came out he explained for the fourth or fifth time how the accident had happened .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 14]: `` It was entirely those other people 's fault , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 37]: `` They got me in a kind of a corner , because neither of those fellows knows the least thing about guiding ; they just jam ahead and expect everybody to get out of their way .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 35]: It was Charlotte Thom 's diamond crescent pin that got caught on your dress in the back and made such a -- '' `` Never mind , '' Alice said in a tired voice .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 16]: `` The maid fixed it so that she says it is n't very noticeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 11]: `` Well , it is n't , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 12]: `` You could hardly tell there 'd been anything the matter .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 7]: Where do you want to go ?
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 18]: Mother 's been interfering in my affairs some more and I 've got the next taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 9]: `` I was sitting with Mrs. George Dresser .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 8]: You might take me back there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 43]: He left her with the matron , and Alice returned to her picture-making , so that once more , while two numbers passed , whoever cared to look was offered the sketch of a jolly , clever girl preoccupied with her elders .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 23]: Then she found her friend Mildred standing before her , presenting Mr. Arthur Russell , who asked her to dance with him .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 30]: Alice looked uncertain , as though not sure what her engagements were ; but her perplexity cleared ; she nodded , and swung rhythmically away with the tall applicant .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 11]: She was not grateful to her hostess for this alms .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 22]: What a young hostess does with a fiance , Alice thought , is to make him dance with the unpopular girls .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 13]: She supposed that Mr. Arthur Russell had already danced with Ella Dowling .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 46]: The loan of a lover , under these circumstances , may be painful to the lessee , and Alice , smiling never more brightly , found nothing to say to Mr. Russell , though she thought he might have found something to say to her .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 12]: `` I wonder what Mildred told him , '' she thought .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 22]: `` Probably she said , ` Dearest , there 's one more girl you 've got to help me out with .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 20]: You would n't like her much , but she dances well enough and she 's having a rotten time .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 10]: Nobody ever goes near her any more . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 37]: When the music stopped , Russell added his applause to the hand-clapping that encouraged the uproarious instruments to continue , and as they renewed the tumult , he said heartily , `` That 's splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 19]: Alice gave him a glance , necessarily at short range , and found his eyes kindly and pleased .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 16]: Here was a friendly soul , it appeared , who probably `` liked everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 33]: No doubt he had applauded for an `` encore '' when he danced with Ella Dowling , gave Ella the same genial look , and said , `` That 's splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 17]: When the `` encore '' was over , Alice spoke to him for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 12]: `` Mildred will be looking for you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 16]: `` I think you 'd better take me back to where you found me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 4]: He looked surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 50]: `` Oh , if you -- '' `` I 'm sure Mildred will be needing you , '' Alice said , and as she took his arm and they walked toward Mrs. Dresser , she thought it might be just possible to make a further use of the loan .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 12]: `` Oh , I wonder if you -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 5]: he said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 15]: `` You do n't know my brother , Walter Adams , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 48]: `` But he 's somewhere I think possibly he 's in a smoking-room or some place where girls are n't expected , and if you would n't think it too much trouble to inquire -- '' `` I 'll find him , '' Russell said , promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: `` Thank you so much for that dance .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 10]: I 'll bring your brother in a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 13]: It was to be a long moment , Alice decided , presently .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 27]: Mrs. Dresser had grown restive ; and her nods and vague responses to her young dependent 's gaieties were as meager as they could well be .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 28]: Evidently the matron had no intention of appearing to her world in the light of a chaperone for Alice Adams ; and she finally made this clear .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 36]: With a word or two of excuse , breaking into something Alice was saying , she rose and went to sit next to Mildred 's mother , who had become the nucleus of the cluster .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 22]: So Alice was left very much against the wall , with short stretches of vacant chairs on each side of her .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 28]: She had come to the end of her picture-making , and could only pretend that there was something amusing the matter with the arm of her chair .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 14]: She supposed that Mildred 's Mr. Russell had forgotten Walter by this time .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 34]: `` I 'm not even an intimate enough friend of Mildred 's for him to have thought he ought to bother to tell me he could n't find him , '' she thought .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 17]: And then she saw Russell coming across the room toward her , with Walter beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 5]: She jumped up gaily .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 7]: `` Oh , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 14]: `` I know this naughty boy must have been terribly hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 6]: Mildred 'll NEVER forgive me !
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 31]: I 've put you to so much -- '' `` Not at all , '' he said , amiably , and went away , leaving the brother and sister together .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 19]: `` Walter , let 's dance just once more , '' Alice said , touching his arm placatively .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 14]: `` I thought -- well , perhaps we might go home then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 18]: But Walter 's expression was that of a person upon whom an outrage has just been perpetrated .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 21]: `` We 've stayed THIS long , I 'm goin ' to wait and see what they got to eat .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 6]: And you look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 6]: He turned upon her angrily .
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 10]: `` Do n't you ever do that again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 5]: `` Do what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 20]: `` Send somebody after me that pokes his nose into every corner of the house till he finds me !
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 8]: ` Are you Mr. Walter Adams ? '
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 16]: I guess he must asked everybody in the place if they were Mr. Walter Adams !
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 28]: Well , I 'll bet a few iron men you would n't send anybody to hunt for me again if you knew where he found me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 6]: `` Where was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 10]: Walter decided that her fit punishment was to know .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 14]: `` I was shootin ' dice with those coons in the cloak-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 7]: `` And he saw you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 7]: `` Unless he was blind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 3]: said Walter .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 14]: `` Come on , I 'll dance this one more dance with you .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 13]: Supper comes after that , and THEN we 'll go home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 20]: Mrs. Adams heard Alice 's key turning in the front door and hurried down the stairs to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: `` Did you get wet coming in , darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 9]: `` Did you have a good time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 5]: `` Just lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 37]: Alice said , cheerily , and after she had arranged the latch for Walter , who had gone to return the little car , she followed her mother upstairs and hummed a dance-tune on the way .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 30]: `` Oh , I 'm so glad you had a nice time , '' Mrs. Adams said , as they reached the door of her daughter 's room together .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 54]: `` You DESERVED to , and it 's lovely to think -- '' But at this , without warning , Alice threw herself into her mother 's arms , sobbing so loudly that in his room , close by , her father , half drowsing through the night , started to full wakefulness .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 73]: CHAPTER IX On a morning , a week after this collapse of festal hopes , Mrs. Adams and her daughter were concluding a three-days ' disturbance , the `` Spring house-cleaning '' -- postponed until now by Adams 's long illness -- and Alice , on her knees before a chest of drawers , in her mother 's room , paused thoughtfully after dusting a packet of letters wrapped in worn muslin .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 44]: She called to her mother , who was scrubbing the floor of the hallway just beyond the open door , `` These old letters you had in the bottom drawer , were n't they some papa wrote you before you were married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 9]: Mrs. Adams laughed and said , `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 21]: Just put 'em back where they were -- or else up in the attic -- anywhere you want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 12]: `` Do you mind if I read one , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 12]: `` Oh , I guess you can if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 8]: I expect they 're pretty funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 14]: Alice laughed in response , and chose the topmost letter of the packet .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 19]: `` My dear , beautiful girl , '' it began ; and she stared at these singular words .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 33]: They gave her a shock like that caused by overhearing some bewildering impropriety ; and , having read them over to herself several times , she went on to experience other shocks .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 51]: MY DEAR , BEAUTIFUL GIRL : This time yesterday I had a mighty bad case of blues because I had not had a word from you in two whole long days and when I do not hear from you every day things look mighty down in the mouth to me .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 31]: Now it is all so different because your letter has arrived and besides I have got a piece of news I believe you will think as fine as I do .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 20]: Darling , you will be surprised , so get ready to hear about a big effect on our future .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 5]: It is this way .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 64]: I had sort of a suspicion the head of the firm kind of took a fancy to me from the first when I went in there , and liked the way I attended to my work and so when he took me on this business trip with him I felt pretty sure of it and now it turns out I was about right .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 23]: In return I guess I have got about the best boss in this world and I believe you will think so too .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 49]: Yes , sweetheart , after the talk I have just had with him if J. A. Lamb asked me to cut my hand off for him I guess I would come pretty near doing it because what he says means the end of our waiting to be together .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 29]: From New Years on he is going to put me in entire charge of the sundries dept. and what do you think is going to be my salary ?
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 11]: Eleven hundred cool dollars a year -LRB- $ 1,100.00 -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 4]: That 's all !
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 9]: Just only a cool eleven hundred per annum !
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 19]: Well , I guess that will show your mother whether I can take care of you or not .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 21]: And oh how I would like to see your dear , beautiful , loving face when you get this news .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 73]: I would like to go out on the public streets and just dance and shout and it is all I can do to help doing it , especially when I know we will be talking it all over together this time next week , and oh my darling , now that your folks have no excuse for putting it off any longer we might be in our own little home before Xmas .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 5]: Would you be glad ?
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 22]: Well , darling , this settles everything and makes our future just about as smooth for us as anybody could ask .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 40]: I can hardly realize after all this waiting life 's troubles are over for you and me and we have nothing to do but to enjoy the happiness granted us by this wonderful , beautiful thing we call life .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 34]: I know I am not any poet and the one I tried to write about you the day of the picnic was fearful but the way I THINK about you is a poem .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 9]: Write me what you think of the news .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 7]: I know but write me anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 22]: I 'll get it before we start home and I can be reading it over all the time on the tram .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 5]: Your always loving VIRGIL .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 43]: The sound of her mother 's diligent scrubbing in the hall came back slowly to Alice 's hearing , as she restored the letter to the packet , wrapped the packet in its muslin covering , and returned it to the drawer .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 36]: She had remained upon her knees while she read the letter ; now she sank backward , sitting upon the floor with her hands behind her , an unconscious relaxing for better ease to think .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 11]: Upon her face there had fallen a look of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 14]: For the first time she was vaguely perceiving that life is everlasting movement .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 38]: Youth really believes what is running water to be a permanent crystallization and sees time fixed to a point : some people have dark hair , some people have blond hair , some people have gray hair .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 19]: Until this moment , Alice had no conviction that there was a universe before she came into it .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 25]: She had always thought of it as the background of herself : the moon was something to make her prettier on a summer night .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: But this old letter , through which she saw still flickering an ancient starlight of young love , astounded her .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 53]: Faintly before her it revealed the whole lives of her father and mother , who had been young , after all -- they REALLY had -- and their youth was now so utterly passed from them that the picture of it , in the letter , was like a burlesque of them .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 26]: And so she , herself , must pass to such changes , too , and all that now seemed vital to her would be nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 17]: When her work was finished , that afternoon , she went into her father 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 38]: His recovery had progressed well enough to permit the departure of Miss Perry ; and Adams , wearing one of Mrs. Adams 's wrappers over his night-gown , sat in a high-backed chair by a closed window .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 77]: The weather was warm , but the closed window and the flannel wrapper had not sufficed him : round his shoulders he had an old crocheted scarf of Alice 's ; his legs were wrapped in a heavy comfort ; and , with these swathings about him , and his eyes closed , his thin and grizzled head making but a slight indentation in the pillow supporting it , he looked old and little and queer .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 25]: Alice would have gone out softly , but without opening his eyes , he spoke to her : `` Do n't go , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 11]: Come sit with the old man a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 7]: She brought a chair near his .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 8]: `` I thought you were napping . ''
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 8]: I do n't hardly ever do that .
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 8]: I just drift a little sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 11]: `` How do you mean you drift , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 6]: He looked at her vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 8]: `` Oh , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 4]: Kind of pictures .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 23]: They get a little mixed up -- old times with times still ahead , like planning what to do , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 17]: That 's as near a nap as I get -- when the pictures mix up some .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 9]: I suppose it 's sort of drowsing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 10]: She took one of his hands and stroked it .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 20]: `` What do you mean when you say you have pictures like ` planning what to do ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 20]: `` I mean planning what to do when I get out and able to go to work again . ''
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 15]: `` But that does n't need any planning , '' Alice said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 17]: `` You 're going back to your old place at Lamb 's , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 15]: Adams closed his eyes again , sighing heavily , but made no other response .
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 9]: `` Why , of COURSE you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 8]: `` What are you talking about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 17]: His head turned slowly toward her , revealing the eyes , open in a haggard stare .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 18]: `` I heard you the other night when you came from the party , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 9]: `` I know what was the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 12]: `` Indeed , you do n't , '' she assured him .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 20]: `` You do n't know anything about it , because there was n't anything the matter at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 10]: `` Do n't you suppose I heard you crying ?
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 14]: What 'd you cry for if there was n't anything the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 6]: `` Just nerves , papa .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 10]: It was n't anything else in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 7]: `` Your mother told me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 8]: `` She promised me not to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 6]: At that Adams laughed mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 33]: `` It would n't be very likely I 'd hear you so upset and not ask about it , even if she did n't come and tell me on her own hook .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 19]: You need n't try to fool me ; I tell you I know what was the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 15]: `` The only matter was I had a silly fit , '' Alice protested .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 9]: `` It did me good , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 14]: `` Because I 've decided to do something about it , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 18]: `` That is n't the way your mother looks at it , '' Adams said , ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 13]: `` She thinks it 's our place to do something about it .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 19]: Well , I do n't know -- I do n't know ; everything seems so changed these days .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 36]: You 've always been a good daughter , Alice , and you ought to have as much as any of these girls you go with ; she 's convinced me she 's right about THAT .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 29]: The trouble is -- '' He faltered , apologetically , then went on , `` I mean the question is -- how to get it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 48]: `` I had no business to make such a fuss just because a lot of idiots did n't break their necks to get dances with me and because I got mortified about Walter -- Walter WAS pretty terrible -- '' `` Oh , me , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 3]: Adams lamented .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 15]: `` I guess that 's something we just have to leave work out itself .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 19]: What you going to do with a boy nineteen or twenty years old that makes his own living ?
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 5]: Ca n't whip him .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 10]: Ca n't keep him locked up in the house .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 13]: Just got to hope he 'll learn better , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 57]: `` Of course he did n't want to go to the Palmers ' , '' Alice explained , tolerantly -- `` and as mama and I made him take me , and he thought that was pretty selfish in me , why , he felt he had a right to amuse himself any way he could .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 25]: Of course it was awful that this -- that this Mr. Russell should -- '' In spite of her , the recollection choked her .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 11]: `` Yes , it was awful , '' Adams agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 4]: `` Just awful .
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 7]: Oh , me , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 14]: But Alice recovered herself at once , and showed him a cheerful face .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 17]: `` Well , just a few years from now I probably wo n't even remember it !
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 18]: I believe hardly anything amounts to as much as we think it does at the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 9]: `` Well -- sometimes it do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 20]: `` What I 've been thinking , papa : it seems to me I ought to DO something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 5]: `` What like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 30]: She looked dreamy , but was obviously serious as she told him : `` Well , I mean I ought to be something besides just a kind of nobody .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 8]: I ought to -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 6]: `` What , dearie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 13]: `` Well -- there 's one thing I 'd like to do .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 11]: I 'm sure I COULD do it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 16]: `` I want to go on the stage : I know I could act . ''
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 43]: At this , her father abruptly gave utterance to a feeble cackling of laughter ; and when Alice , surprised and a little offended , pressed him for his reason , he tried to evade , saying , `` Nothing , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 7]: I just thought of something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 9]: But she persisted until he had to explain .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 26]: `` It made me think of your mother 's sister , your Aunt Flora , that died when you were little , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 84]: `` She was always telling how she was going on the stage , and talking about how she was certain she 'd make a great actress , and all so on ; and one day your mother broke out and said she ought ` a ' gone on the stage , herself , because she always knew she had the talent for it -- and , well , they got into kind of a spat about which one 'd make the best actress .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 12]: I had to go out in the hall to laugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 12]: `` Maybe you were wrong , '' Alice said , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 21]: `` If they both felt it , why would n't that look as if there was talent in the family ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 20]: I 've ALWAYS thought -- '' `` No , dearie , '' he said , with a final chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 14]: `` Your mother and Flora were n't different from a good many others .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 6]: I expect ninety per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 23]: of all the women I ever knew were just sure they 'd be mighty fine actresses if they ever got the chance .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 25]: Well , I guess it 's a good thing ; they enjoy thinking about it and it do n't do anybody any harm . ''
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 4]: Alice was piqued .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 19]: For several days she had thought almost continuously of a career to be won by her own genius .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 19]: Not that she planned details , or concerned herself with first steps ; her picturings overleaped all that .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 36]: Principally , she saw her name great on all the bill-boards of that unkind city , and herself , unchanged in age but glamorous with fame and Paris clothes , returning in a private car .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 51]: No doubt the pleasantest development of her vision was a dialogue with Mildred ; and this became so real that , as she projected it , Alice assumed the proper expressions for both parties to it , formed words with her lips , and even spoke some of them aloud .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 12]: `` No , I have n't forgotten you , Mrs. Russell .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: I remember you quite pleasantly , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 15]: You were a Miss Palmer , I recall , in those funny old days .
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 9]: Very kind of you , I 'm shaw .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 15]: I appreciate your eagerness to do something for me in your own little home .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 36]: As you say , a reception WOULD renew my acquaintanceship with many old friends -- but I 'm shaw you wo n't mind my mentioning that I do n't find much inspiration in these provincials .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 10]: I really must ask you not to press me .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 58]: An artist 's time is not her own , though of course I could hardly expect you to understand -- '' Thus Alice illuminated the dull time ; but she retired from the interview with her father still manfully displaying an outward cheerfulness , while depression grew heavier within , as if she had eaten soggy cake .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 33]: Her father knew nothing whatever of the stage , and she was aware of his ignorance , yet for some reason his innocently skeptical amusement reduced her bright project almost to nothing .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 55]: Something like this always happened , it seemed ; she was continually making these illuminations , all gay with gildings and colourings ; and then as soon as anybody else so much as glanced at them -- even her father , who loved her -- the pretty designs were stricken with a desolating pallor .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 6]: `` Is this LIFE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 15]: Alice wondered , not doubting that the question was original and all her own .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 20]: `` Is it life to spend your time imagining things that are n't so , and never will be ?
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 21]: Beautiful things happen to other people ; why should I be the only one they never CAN happen to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 23]: The mood lasted overnight ; and was still upon her the next afternoon when an errand for her father took her down-town .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 43]: Adams had decided to begin smoking again , and Alice felt rather degraded , as well as embarrassed , when she went into the large shop her father had named , and asked for the cheap tobacco he used in his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 88]: She fell back upon an air of amused indulgence , hoping thus to suggest that her purchase was made for some faithful old retainer , now infirm ; and although the calmness of the clerk who served her called for no such elaboration of her sketch , she ornamented it with a little laugh and with the remark , as she dropped the package into her coat-pocket , `` I 'm sure it 'll please him ; they tell me it 's the kind he likes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 47]: Still playing Lady Bountiful , smiling to herself in anticipation of the joy she was bringing to the simple old negro or Irish follower of the family , she left the shop ; but as she came out upon the crowded pavement her smile vanished quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 49]: Next to the door of the tobacco-shop , there was the open entrance to a stairway , and , above this rather bleak and dark aperture , a sign-board displayed in begrimed gilt letters the information that Frincke 's Business College occupied the upper floors of the building .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 57]: Furthermore , Frincke here publicly offered `` personal instruction and training in practical mathematics , bookkeeping , and all branches of the business life , including stenography , typewriting , etc. '' Alice halted for a moment , frowning at this signboard as though it were something surprising and distasteful which she had never seen before .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 25]: Yet it was conspicuous in a busy quarter ; she almost always passed it when she came down-town , and never without noticing it .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 20]: Nor was this the first time she had paused to lift toward it that same glance of vague misgiving .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 33]: The building was not what the changeful city defined as a modern one , and the dusty wooden stairway , as seen from the pavement , disappeared upward into a smoky darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 28]: So would the footsteps of a girl ascending there lead to a hideous obscurity , Alice thought ; an obscurity as dreary and as permanent as death .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 55]: And like dry leaves falling about her she saw her wintry imaginings in the May air : pretty girls turning into withered creatures as they worked at typing-machines ; old maids `` taking dictation '' from men with double chins ; Alice saw old maids of a dozen different kinds `` taking dictation . ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 39]: Her mind 's eye was crowded with them , as it always was when she passed that stairway entrance ; and though they were all different from one another , all of them looked a little like herself .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 17]: She hated the place , and yet she seldom hurried by it or averted her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 21]: It had an unpleasant fascination for her , and a mysterious reproach , which she did not seek to fathom .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 30]: She walked on thoughtfully to-day ; and when , at the next corner , she turned into the street that led toward home , she was given a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 16]: Arthur Russell came rapidly from behind her , lifting his hat as she saw him .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 10]: `` Are you walking north , Miss Adams ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 11]: `` Do you mind if I walk with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 9]: She was not delighted , but seemed so .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 5]: `` How charming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 47]: she cried , giving him a little flourish of the shapely hands ; and then , because she wondered if he had seen her coming out of the tobacco-shop , she laughed and added , `` I 've just been on the most ridiculous errand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 9]: `` To order some cigars for my father .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 29]: He 's been quite ill , poor man , and he 's so particular -- but what in the world do _ I _ know about cigars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 3]: Russell laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 10]: `` Well , what DO you know about 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 8]: Did you select by the price ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 6]: `` Mercy , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 31]: she exclaimed , and added , with an afterthought , `` Of course he wrote down the name of the kind he wanted and I gave it to the shopman .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 8]: I could never have pronounced it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 47]: CHAPTER X In her pocket as she spoke her hand rested upon the little sack of tobacco , which responded accusingly to the touch of her restless fingers ; and she found time to wonder why she was building up this fiction for Mr. Arthur Russell .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 34]: His discovery of Walter 's device for whiling away the dull evening had shamed and distressed her ; but she would have suffered no less if almost any other had been the discoverer .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 43]: In this gentleman , after hearing that he was Mildred 's Mr. Arthur Russell , Alice felt not the slightest `` personal interest '' ; and there was yet to develop in her life such a thing as an interest not personal .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 10]: At twenty-two this state of affairs is not unique .
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 17]: So far as Alice was concerned Russell might have worn a placard , `` Engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 28]: She looked upon him as diners entering a restaurant look upon tables marked `` Reserved '' : the glance , slightly discontented , passes on at once .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 34]: Or so the eye of a prospector wanders querulously over staked and established claims on the mountainside , and seeks the virgin land beyond ; unless , indeed , the prospector be dishonest .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 17]: But Alice was no claim-jumper -- so long as the notice of ownership was plainly posted .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 44]: Though she was indifferent now , habit ruled her : and , at the very time she wondered why she created fictitious cigars for her father , she was also regretting that she had not boldly carried her Malacca stick down-town with her .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 5]: Her vivacity increased automatically .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 16]: `` Perhaps the clerk thought you wanted the cigars for yourself , '' Russell suggested .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 12]: `` He may have taken you for a Spanish countess . ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 8]: `` I 'm sure he did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 42]: Alice agreed , gaily ; and she hummed a bar or two of `` LaPaloma , '' snapping her fingers as castanets , and swaying her body a little , to suggest the accepted stencil of a `` Spanish Dancer . ''
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 13]: `` Would you have taken me for one , Mr. Russell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: she asked , as she concluded the impersonation .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 8]: Why , yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 13]: `` I 'D take you for anything you wanted me to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 8]: `` Why , what a speech ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 20]: she cried , and , laughing , gave him a quick glance in which there glimmered some real surprise .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 13]: He was looking at her quizzically , but with the liveliest appreciation .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 14]: Her surprise increased ; and she was glad that he had joined her .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 13]: To be seen walking with such a companion added to her pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 46]: She would have described him as `` altogether quite stunning-looking '' ; and she liked his tall , dark thinness , his gray clothes , his soft hat , and his clean brown shoes ; she liked his easy swing of the stick he carried .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 9]: `` Should n't I have said it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 13]: `` Would you rather not be taken for a Spanish countess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 10]: `` That is n't it , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 19]: `` You said -- '' `` I said I 'd take you for whatever you wanted me to .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 7]: Is n't that all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 11]: `` It would all depend , would n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 12]: `` Of course it would depend on what you wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 11]: `` It might depend on a lot of things . ''
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 5]: `` Such as ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 20]: `` Well -- '' She hesitated , having the mischievous impulse to say , `` Such as Mildred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 23]: But she decided to omit this reference , and became serious , remembering Russell 's service to her at Mildred 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 33]: `` Speaking of what I want to be taken for , '' she said ; -- `` I 've been wondering ever since the other night what you did take me for !
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 18]: You must have taken me for the sister of a professional gambler , I 'm afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 29]: Russell 's look of kindness was the truth about him , she was to discover ; and he reassured her now by the promptness of his friendly chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 15]: `` Then your young brother told you where I found him , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 17]: I kept my face straight at the time , but I laughed afterward -- to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 19]: It struck me as original , to say the least : his amusing himself with those darkies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 32]: `` Walter IS original , '' Alice said ; and , having adopted this new view of her brother 's eccentricities , she impulsively went on to make it more plausible .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 16]: `` He 's a very odd boy , and I was afraid you 'd misunderstand .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 52]: He tells wonderful ` darky stories , ' and he 'll do anything to draw coloured people out and make them talk ; and that 's what he was doing at Mildred 's when you found him for me -- he says he wins their confidence by playing dice with them .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 14]: In the family we think he 'll probably write about them some day .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 6]: He 's rather literary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 5]: `` Are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 5]: Russell asked , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 16]: Oh -- '' She paused , lifting both hands in a charming gesture of helplessness .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 10]: `` Oh , I 'm just -- me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 44]: His glance followed the lightly waved hands with keen approval , then rose to the lively and colourful face , with its hazel eyes , its small and pretty nose , and the lip-caught smile which seemed the climax of her decorative transition .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 12]: Never had he seen a creature so plastic or so wistful .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 26]: Here was a contrast to his cousin Mildred , who was not wistful , and controlled any impulses toward plasticity , if she had them .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 7]: `` But you ARE different ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 19]: With that , there leaped in her such an impulse of roguish gallantry as she could never resist .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 18]: She turned her head , and , laughing and bright-eyed , looked him full in the face .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 5]: `` From whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 6]: `` From -- everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 7]: `` Are you a mind-reader ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 19]: `` How did you know I was thinking you were different from my cousin , Mildred Palmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 11]: `` What makes you think I DID know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 14]: `` You knew what I was thinking and I knew you knew . ''
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' she said with cool humour .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 13]: `` How intimate that seems to make us all at once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 14]: Russell left no doubt that he was delighted with these gaieties of hers .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 4]: he exclaimed again .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: `` I thought you were this sort of girl the first moment I saw you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 6]: `` What sort of girl ?
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 21]: Did n't Mildred tell you what sort of girl I am when she asked you to dance with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 18]: `` She did n't ask me to dance with you -- I 'd been looking at you .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 17]: You were talking to some old ladies , and I asked Mildred who you were . ''
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 13]: `` Oh , so Mildred DID N'T -- '' Alice checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 10]: `` Who did she tell you I was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 22]: `` She just said you were a Miss Adams , so I -- '' '' ` A ' Miss Adams ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 3]: Alice interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 11]: Then I said I 'd like to meet you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 4]: `` I see .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: You thought you 'd save me from the old ladies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 19]: I thought I 'd save myself from some of the girls Mildred was getting me to dance with .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 12]: There was a Miss Dowling -- '' `` Poor man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 32]: Alice said , gently , and her impulsive thought was that Mildred had taken few chances , and that as a matter of self-defense her carefulness might have been well founded .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 15]: This Mr. Arthur Russell was a much more responsive person than one had supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 24]: `` So , Mr. Russell , you do n't know anything about me except what you thought when you first saw me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 14]: `` Yes , I know I was right when I thought it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 11]: `` You have n't told me what you thought . ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 12]: `` I thought you were like what you ARE like . ''
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 8]: `` Not very definite , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 25]: I 'm afraid you shed more light a minute or so ago , when you said how different from Mildred you thought I was .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 7]: That WAS definite , unfortunately ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 11]: `` I did n't say it , '' Russell explained .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 11]: `` I thought it , and you read my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 20]: That 's the sort of girl I thought you were -- one that could read a man 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 14]: Why do you say ` unfortunately ' you 're not like Mildred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 9]: Alice 's smooth gesture seemed to sketch Mildred .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 13]: `` Because she 's perfect -- why , she 's PERFECTLY perfect !
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 23]: She never makes a mistake , and everybody looks up to her -- oh , yes , we all fairly adore her !
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 29]: She 's like some big , noble , cold statue -- ` way above the rest of us -- and she hardly ever does anything mean or treacherous .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 17]: Of all the girls I know I believe she 's played the fewest really petty tricks .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 11]: She 's -- '' Russell interrupted ; he looked perplexed .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 26]: `` You say she 's perfectly perfect , but that she does play SOME -- '' Alice laughed , as if at his sweet innocence .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 7]: `` Men are so funny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 4]: she informed him .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 10]: `` Of course girls ALL do mean things sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 12]: My own career 's just one long brazen smirch of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 17]: What I mean is , Mildred 's perfectly perfect compared to the rest of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 19]: `` I see , '' he said , and seemed to need a moment or two of thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 15]: Then he inquired , `` What sort of treacherous things do YOU do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 3]: `` I ?
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 7]: Oh , the very worst kind !
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 17]: Most people bore me particularly the men in this town -- and I show it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 12]: `` But I should n't call that treacherous , exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 10]: `` Well , THEY do , '' Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 10]: `` It 's made me a terribly unpopular character !
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 9]: I do a lot of things they hate .
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 28]: For instance , at a dance I 'd a lot rather find some clever old woman and talk to her than dance with nine-tenths of these nonentities .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 8]: I usually do it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 10]: `` But you danced as if you liked it .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 29]: You danced better than any other girl I -- '' `` This flattery of yours does n't quite turn my head , Mr. Russell , '' Alice interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 15]: `` Particularly since Mildred only gave you Ella Dowling to compare with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , '' he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 13]: `` There were others -- and of course Mildred , herself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 8]: `` Oh , of course , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 4]: I forgot that .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 18]: Well -- '' She paused , then added , `` I certainly OUGHT to dance well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 10]: `` Why is it so much a duty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 13]: `` When I think of the dancing-teachers and the expense to papa !
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 22]: All sorts of fancy instructors -- I suppose that 's what daughters have fathers for , though , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 8]: To throw money away on them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 17]: `` You do n't -- '' Russell began , and his look was one of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 23]: `` You have n't taken up -- '' She understood his apprehension and responded merrily , `` Oh , murder , no !
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 42]: You mean you 're afraid I break out sometimes in a piece of cheesecloth and run around a fountain thirty times , and then , for an encore , show how much like snakes I can make my arms look . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 9]: `` I SAID you were a mind-reader ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 17]: `` That 's exactly what I was pretending to be afraid you might do . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 4]: ` Pretending ? '
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 6]: That 's nicer of you .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 9]: No ; it 's not my mania . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 13]: `` Oh , nothing in particular that I know of just now .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 18]: Of course I 've had the usual one : the one that every girl goes through . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 48]: `` Good heavens , Mr. Russell , you ca n't expect me to believe you 're really a man of the world if you do n't know that every girl has a time in her life when she 's positive she 's divinely talented for the stage !
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 15]: It 's the only universal rule about women that has n't got an exception .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 25]: I do n't mean we all want to go on the stage , but we all think we 'd be wonderful if we did .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 3]: Even Mildred .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 32]: Oh , she would n't confess it to you : you 'd have to know her a great deal better than any man can ever know her to find out . ''
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 8]: `` I see , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 12]: `` Girls are always telling us we ca n't know them .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 33]: I wonder if you -- '' She took up his thought before he expressed it , and again he was fascinated by her quickness , which indeed seemed to him almost telepathic .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 14]: `` Oh , but DO N'T we know one another , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 19]: `` Such things we have to keep secret -- things that go on right before YOUR eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 11]: `` Why do n't some of you tell us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 8]: `` We ca n't tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: `` Too much honour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 11]: Not even too much honour among thieves , Mr. Russell .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 23]: We do n't tell you about our tricks against one another because we know it would n't make any impression on you .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 21]: The tricks are n't played against you , and you have a soft side for cats with lovely manners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: `` What about your tricks against us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 6]: `` Oh , those ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: `` We think they 're rather cute ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 4]: `` Bravo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 14]: he cried , and hammered the ferrule of his stick upon the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 8]: `` What 's the applause for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 4]: `` For you .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 15]: What you said was like running up the black flag to the masthead . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 19]: It was just a modest little sign in a pretty flower-bed : ` Gentlemen , beware ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 12]: `` I see I must , '' he said , gallantly .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 3]: `` Thanks !
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 13]: But I mean , beware of the whole bloomin ' garden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 40]: Then , picking up a thread that had almost disappeared : `` You need n't think you 'll ever find out whether I 'm right about Mildred 's not being an exception by asking her , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 19]: `` She wo n't tell you : she 's not the sort that ever makes a confession . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: But Russell had not followed her shift to the former topic . ''
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 10]: ` Mildred 's not being an exception ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 5]: he said , vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 26]: `` I do n't -- '' `` An exception about thinking she could be a wonderful thing on the stage if she only cared to .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 17]: If you asked her I 'm pretty sure she 'd say , ` What nonsense ! '
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 24]: Mildred 's the dearest , finest thing anywhere , but you wo n't find out many things about her by asking her . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 18]: Russell 's expression became more serious , as it did whenever his cousin was made their topic .
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 6]: `` You think not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 10]: `` You think she 's -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 11]: But it 's not because she is n't sincere exactly .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 14]: It 's only because she has such a lot to live up to .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 23]: She has to live up to being a girl on the grand style to herself , I mean , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 20]: And without pausing Alice rippled on , `` You ought to have seen ME when I had the stage-fever !
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 14]: I used to play ` Juliet ' all alone in my room . '
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 71]: She lifted her arms in graceful entreaty , pleading musically , `` O , swear not by the moon , the inconstant moon , That monthly changes in her circled orb , Lest thy love prove -- '' She broke off abruptly with a little flourish , snapping thumb and finger of each outstretched hand , then laughed and said , `` Papa used to make such fun of me !
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 19]: Thank heaven , I was only fifteen ; I was all over it by the next year . ''
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 12]: `` No wonder you had the fever , '' Russell observed .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 6]: `` You do it beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: Why did n't you finish the line ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 4]: `` Which one ?
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 9]: ` Lest thy love prove likewise variable ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 11]: Juliet was saying it to a MAN , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 18]: She seems to have been ready to worry about his constancy pretty early in their affair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 6]: Her companion was again thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' he said , seeming to be rather irksomely impressed with Alice 's suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 9]: `` Yes ; it does appear so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 14]: Alice glanced at his serious face , and yielded to an audacious temptation .
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 15]: `` You must n't take it so hard , '' she said , flippantly .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 16]: `` It is n't about you : it 's only about Romeo and Juliet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 12]: `` You are n't at your mind-reading again , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 13]: There are times when it wo n't do , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 33]: She leaned toward him a little , as if companionably : they were walking slowly , and this geniality of hers brought her shoulder in light contact with his for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 8]: `` Do you dislike my mind-reading ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 21]: she asked , and , across their two just touching shoulders , gave him her sudden look of smiling wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 7]: `` Do you hate it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 13]: `` No , I do n't , '' he said , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 6]: `` It 's quite pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: But I think it says , ` Gentlemen , beware ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 27]: She instantly moved away from him , with the lawless and frank laugh of one who is delighted to be caught in a piece of hypocrisy .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 5]: `` How lovely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 5]: Then she pointed ahead .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 7]: `` Our walk is nearly over .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 12]: We 're coming to the foolish little house where I live .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 33]: It 's a queer little place , but my father 's so attached to it the family have about given up hope of getting him to build a real house farther out .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 28]: He does n't mind our being extravagant about anything else , but he wo n't let us alter one single thing about his precious little old house .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 3]: Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 9]: She halted , and gave him her hand .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 4]: `` Adieu ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 28]: `` I could n't , '' he began ; hesitated , then asked : `` I could n't come in with you for a little while ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 10]: `` Not now , '' she said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 9]: `` You can come -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 6]: `` Almost any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 13]: She turned and walked slowly up the path , but he waited .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 21]: `` You can come in the evening if you like , '' she called back to him over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 4]: `` Soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 8]: `` As soon as you like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 21]: She waved her hand ; then ran indoors and watched him from a window as he went up the street .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 20]: He walked rapidly , a fine , easy figure , swinging his stick in a way that suggested exhilaration .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 19]: Alice , staring after him through the irregular apertures of a lace curtain , showed no similar buoyancy .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 27]: Upon the instant she closed the door all sparkle left her : she had become at once the simple and sometimes troubled girl her family knew .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 9]: `` What is going on out there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 9]: her mother asked , approaching from the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 16]: `` Oh , nothing , '' Alice said , indifferently , as she turned away .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 14]: `` That Mr. Russell met me downtown and walked up with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 4]: `` Mr. Russell ?
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 11]: Oh , the one that 's engaged to Mildred ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 10]: `` Well -- I do n't know for certain .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 14]: He did n't seem so much like an engaged man to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 19]: And she added , in the tone of thoughtful preoccupation : `` Anyhow -- not so terribly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 25]: Then she ran upstairs , gave her father his tobacco , filled his pipe for him , and petted him as he lighted it .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 18]: CHAPTER XI After that , she went to her room and sat down before her three-leaved mirror .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 23]: There was where she nearly always sat when she came into her room , if she had nothing in mind to do .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 15]: She went to that chair as naturally as a dog goes to his corner .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 15]: She leaned forward , observing her profile ; gravity seemed to be her mood .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 55]: But after a long , almost motionless scrutiny , she began to produce dramatic sketches upon that ever-ready stage , her countenance : she showed gaiety , satire , doubt , gentleness , appreciation of a companion and love-in-hiding -- all studied in profile first , then repeated for a `` three-quarter view . ''
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 11]: Subsequently she ran through them , facing herself in full .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 33]: In this manner she outlined a playful scenario for her next interview with Arthur Russell ; but grew solemn again , thinking of the impression she had already sought to give him .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 38]: She had no twinges for any underminings of her `` most intimate friend '' -- in fact , she felt that her work on a new portrait of Mildred for Mr. Russell had been honest and accurate .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 18]: But why had it been her instinct to show him an Alice Adams who did n't exist ?
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 60]: Almost everything she had said to him was upon spontaneous impulse , springing to her lips on the instant ; yet it all seemed to have been founded upon a careful design , as if some hidden self kept such designs in stock and handed them up to her , ready-made , to be used for its own purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 44]: What appeared to be the desired result was a false-coloured image in Russell 's mind ; but if he liked that image he would n't be liking Alice Adams ; nor would anything he thought about the image be a thought about her .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 32]: Nevertheless , she knew she would go on with her false , fancy colourings of this nothing as soon as she saw him again ; she had just been practicing them .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 7]: `` What 's the idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 3]: she wondered .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 8]: `` What makes me tell such lies ?
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 9]: Why should n't I be just myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 13]: And then she thought , `` But which one is myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 34]: Her eyes dwelt on the solemn eyes in the mirror ; and her lips , disquieted by a deepening wonder , parted to whisper : `` Who in the world are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 37]: The apparition before her had obeyed her like an alert slave , but now , as she subsided to a complete stillness , that aspect changed to the old mockery with which mirrors avenge their wrongs .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 28]: The nucleus of some queer thing seemed to gather and shape itself behind the nothingness of the reflected eyes until it became almost an actual strange presence .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 48]: If it could be identified , perhaps the presence was that of the hidden designer who handed up the false , ready-made pictures , and , for unknown purposes , made Alice exhibit them ; but whatever it was , she suddenly found it monkey-like and terrifying .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 15]: In a flutter she jumped up and went to another part of the room .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 53]: A moment or two later she was whistling softly as she hung her light coat over a wooden triangle in her closet , and her musing now was quainter than the experience that led to it ; for what she thought was this , `` I certainly am a queer girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 47]: She took a little pride in so much originality , believing herself probably the only person in the world to have such thoughts as had been hers since she entered the room , and the first to be disturbed by a strange presence in the mirror .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 40]: In fact , the effect of the tiny episode became apparent in that look of preoccupied complacency to be seen for a time upon any girl who has found reason to suspect that she is a being without counterpart .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 21]: This slight glow , still faintly radiant , was observed across the dinner-table by Walter , but he misinterpreted it .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 10]: `` What YOU lookin ' so self-satisfied about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 21]: he inquired , and added in his knowing way , `` I saw you , all right , cutie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 8]: `` Where 'd you see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 4]: `` Down-town . ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 10]: `` This afternoon , you mean , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 33]: `` Yes , ` this afternoon , I mean , Walter , ' '' he returned , burlesquing her voice at least happily enough to please himself ; for he laughed applausively .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 8]: `` Oh , you never saw me !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 16]: I passed you close enough to pull a tooth , but you were awful busy .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 21]: I never did see anybody as busy as you get , Alice , when you 're towin ' a barge .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 10]: My , but you keep your hands goin ' !
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 9]: Looked like the air was full of 'em !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 23]: That 's why I 'm onto why you look so tickled this evening ; I saw you with that big fish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 13]: Mrs. Adams laughed benevolently ; she was not displeased with this rallying .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 10]: `` Well , what of it , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 29]: `` If you happen to see your sister on the street when some nice young man is being attentive to her -- '' Walter barked and then cackled .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 6]: `` Whoa , Sal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: `` You got the parts mixed .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 11]: It 's little Alice that was ` being attentive . '
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 16]: I know the big fish she was attentive to , all right , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' his sister retorted , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 13]: `` I should think you might have recognized him , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 4]: Walter looked annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 8]: `` Still harpin ' on THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 3]: he complained .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 26]: `` The kind of women I like , if they get sore they just hit you somewhere on the face and then they 're through .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 23]: By the way , I heard this Russell was supposed to be your dear , old , sweet friend Mildred 's steady .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 15]: What you doin ' walkin ' as close to him as all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 14]: Mrs. Adams addressed her son in gentle reproof , `` Why Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 12]: `` Oh , never mind , mama , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 10]: `` To the horrid all things are horrid . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 5]: `` Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 5]: Walter protested , carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 12]: `` I heard all about this Russell down at the shop .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 35]: Young Joe Lamb 's such a talker I wonder he do n't ruin his grandfather 's business ; he keeps all us cheap help standin ' round listening to him nine-tenths of our time .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 54]: Well , Joe told me this Russell 's some kin or other to the Palmer family , and he 's got some little money of his own , and he 's puttin ' it into ole Palmer 's trust company and Palmer 's goin ' to make him a vice-president of the company .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 11]: Sort of a keep-the-money-in-the-family arrangement , Joe Lamb says . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 10]: `` I do n't see -- '' she began .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 19]: `` Why , this Russell 's supposed to be tied up to Mildred , '' her son explained .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 36]: `` When ole Palmer dies this Russell will be his son-in-law , and all he 'll haf ' to do 'll be to barely lift his feet and step into the ole man 's shoes .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 11]: It 's certainly a mighty fat hand-me-out for this Russell !
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 10]: You better lay off o ' there , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 16]: Pick somebody that 's got less to lose and you 'll make better showing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 10]: Mrs. Adams 's air of thoughtfulness had not departed .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 18]: `` But you say this Mr. Russell is well off on his own account , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 15]: `` Oh , Joe Lamb says he 's got some little of his own .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 7]: Did n't know how much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 11]: `` Well , then -- '' Walter laughed his laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 10]: `` Cut it out , '' he bade her .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 10]: `` Alice would n't run in fourth place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 26]: Alice had been looking at him in a detached way , as though estimating the value of a specimen in a collection not her own .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' she said , indifferently .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 9]: `` You REALLY are vulgar , Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 25]: He had finished his meal ; and , rising , he came round the table to her and patted her good-naturedly on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 6]: `` Good ole Allie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 11]: `` HONEST , you would n't run in fourth place .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 13]: If I was you I 'd never even start in the class .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 17]: That frozen-face gang will rule you off the track soon as they see your colours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 4]: `` Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 5]: his mother said again .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 10]: `` Well , ai n't I her brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 19]: he returned , seeming to be entirely serious and direct , for the moment , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 10]: _ I _ like the ole girl all right .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 13]: Fact is , sometimes I 'm kind of sorry for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 9]: `` But what 's it all ABOUT ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 21]: `` Simply because you met me down-town with a man I never saw but once before and just barely know !
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 7]: Why all this palaver ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 5]: ` Why ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 5]: he repeated , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 14]: `` Well , I 've seen you start before , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 9]: He went to the door , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 7]: `` I got no date to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 12]: Take you to the movies , you care to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 4]: She declined crisply .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 6]: `` No , thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 15]: `` Come on , '' he said , as pleasantly as he knew how .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 20]: `` Give me a chance to show you a better time than we had up at that frozen-face joint .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 10]: I 'll get you some chop suey afterward . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 6]: `` No , thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 13]: `` All right , '' he responded and waved a flippant adieu .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 19]: `` As the barber says , ` The better the advice , the worse it 's wasted ! '
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 3]: Good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 33]: Alice shrugged her shoulders ; but a moment or two later , as the jar of the carelessly slammed front door went through the house , she shook her head , reconsidering .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I ought to have gone with him .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 21]: It might have kept him away from whatever dreadful people are his friends -- at least for one night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 37]: `` Oh , I 'm sure Walter 's a GOOD boy , '' Mrs. Adams said , soothingly ; and this was what she almost always said when either her husband or Alice expressed such misgivings .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 31]: `` He 's odd , and he 's picked up right queer manners ; but that 's only because we have n't given him advantages like the other young men .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 11]: But I 'm sure he 's a GOOD boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 19]: She reverted to the subject a little later , while she washed the dishes and Alice wiped them .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 23]: `` Of course Walter could take his place with the other nice boys of the town even yet , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 13]: `` I mean , if we could afford to help him financially .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 32]: They all belong to the country clubs and have cars and -- '' `` Let 's do n't go into that any more , mama , '' the daughter begged her .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 7]: `` What 's the use ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 12]: `` It COULD be of use , '' Mrs. Adams insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 15]: `` It could if your father -- '' `` But papa CA N'T . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 7]: `` Yes , he can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 6]: `` But how can he ?
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 38]: He told me a man of his age CA N'T give up a business he 's been in practically all his life , and just go groping about for something that might never turn up at all .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 14]: I think he 's right about it , too , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 16]: Mrs. Adams splashed among the plates with a new vigour heightened by an old bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 12]: `` He talks that way ; but he knows better . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 12]: `` How could he ` know better , ' mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 6]: `` HE knows how ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 8]: `` But what does he know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 27]: `` You do n't suppose I 'm such a fool I 'd be urging him to give up something for nothing , do you , Alice ?
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 20]: Do you suppose I 'd want him to just go ` groping around ' like he was telling you ?
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 8]: That would be crazy , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 34]: Little as his work at Lamb 's brings in , I would n't be so silly as to ask him to give it up just on a CHANCE he could find something else .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 20]: Good gracious , Alice , you must give me credit for a little intelligence once in a while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 4]: Alice was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 11]: `` But what else could there be except a chance ?
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 19]: I do n't see -- '' `` Well , I do , '' her mother interrupted , decisively .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 16]: `` That man could make us all well off right now if he wanted to .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 22]: We could have been rich long ago if he 'd ever really felt as he ought to about his family . ''
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 23]: Why , how could -- '' `` You know how as well as I do , '' Mrs. Adams said , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 21]: `` I guess you have n't forgotten how he treated me about it the Sunday before he got sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 32]: She went on with her work , putting into it a sudden violence inspired by the recollection ; but Alice , enlightened , gave utterance to a laugh of lugubrious derision .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 9]: `` Oh , the GLUE factory again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 5]: `` How silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 6]: And she renewed her laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: So often do the great projects of parents appear ignominious to their children .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 27]: Mrs. Adams 's conception of a glue factory as a fairy godmother of this family was an absurd old story which Alice had never taken seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 41]: She remembered that when she was about fifteen her mother began now and then to say something to Adams about a `` glue factory , '' rather timidly , and as a vague suggestion , but never without irritating him .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 32]: Then , for years , the preposterous subject had not been mentioned ; possibly because of some explosion on the part of Adams , when his daughter had not been present .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 28]: But during the last year Mrs. Adams had quietly gone back to these old hints , reviving them at intervals and also reviving her husband 's irritation .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 41]: Alice 's bored impression was that her mother wanted him to found , or buy , or do something , or other , about a glue factory ; and that he considered the proposal so impracticable as to be insulting .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 48]: The parental conversations took place when neither Alice nor Walter was at hand , but sometimes Alice had come in upon the conclusion of one , to find her father in a shouting mood , and shocking the air behind him with profane monosyllables as he departed .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 52]: Mrs. Adams would be left quiet and troubled ; and when Alice , sympathizing with the goaded man , inquired of her mother why these tiresome bickerings had been renewed , she always got the brooding and cryptic answer , `` He COULD do it -- if he wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 56]: Alice failed to comprehend the desirability of a glue factory -- to her mind a father engaged in a glue factory lacked impressiveness ; had no advantage over a father employed by Lamb and Company ; and she supposed that Adams knew better than her mother whether such an enterprise would be profitable or not .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 54]: Emphatically , he thought it would not , for she had heard him shouting at the end of one of these painful interviews , `` You can keep up your dang talk till YOU die and _ I _ die , but I 'll never make one God 's cent that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 6]: There had been a culmination .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 46]: Returning from church on the Sunday preceding the collapse with which Adams 's illness had begun , Alice found her mother downstairs , weeping and intimidated , while her father 's stamping footsteps were loudly audible as he strode up and down his room overhead .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 14]: So were his endless repetitions of invective loudly audible : `` That woman !
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 12]: Oh , that woman ; Oh , that danged woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 43]: Mrs. Adams admitted to her daughter that it was `` the old glue factory '' and that her husband 's wildness had frightened her into a `` solemn promise '' never to mention the subject again so long as she had breath .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 38]: The `` glue factory '' idea was not only a bore , but ridiculous , and her mother 's evident seriousness about it one of those inexplicable vagaries we sometimes discover in the people we know best .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 29]: But this Sunday rampage appeared to be the end of it , and when Adams came down to dinner , an hour later , he was unusually cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 64]: Alice was glad he had gone wild enough to settle the glue factory once and for all ; and she had ceased to think of the episode long before Friday of that week , when Adams was brought home in the middle of the afternoon by his old employer , the `` great J. A. Lamb , '' in the latter 's car .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 48]: During the long illness the `` glue factory '' was completely forgotten , by Alice at least ; and her laugh was rueful as well as derisive now , in the kitchen , when she realized that her mother 's mind again dwelt upon this abandoned nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 17]: `` I thought you 'd got over all that nonsense , mama , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams smiled , pathetically .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 11]: `` Of course you think it 's nonsense , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 15]: Young people think everything 's nonsense that they do n't know anything about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 22]: `` I should think I used to hear enough about that horrible old glue factory to know something about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 9]: `` No , '' her mother returned patiently .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 12]: `` You 've never heard anything about it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 6]: `` I have n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 12]: Your father and I did n't discuss it before you children .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 33]: All you ever heard was when he 'd get in such a rage , after we 'd been speaking of it , that he could n't control himself when you came in .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 8]: Was n't _ I _ always quiet ?
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 12]: Did _ I _ ever go on talking about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 6]: `` No ; perhaps not .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 20]: But you 're talking about it now , mama , after you promised never to mention it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 18]: `` I promised not to mention it to your father , '' said Mrs. Adams , gently .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 13]: `` I have n't mentioned it to him , have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 20]: `` Ah , but if you mention it to me I 'm afraid you WILL mention it to him .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 37]: You always do speak of things that you have on your mind , and you might get papa all stirred up again about -- '' Alice paused , a light of divination flickering in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 5]: `` I SEE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 7]: `` What do you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 10]: `` You HAVE been at him about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 7]: `` Not one single word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 15]: `` Not a WORD , but that 's what you 've meant all along !
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 61]: You have n't spoken the words to him , but all this urging him to change , to ` find something better to go into ' -- it 's all been about nothing on earth but your foolish old glue factory that you know upsets him , and you gave your solemn word never to speak to him about again !
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 20]: You did n't say it , but you meant it -- and he KNOWS that 's what you meant !
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 5]: Oh , mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 21]: Mrs. Adams , with her hands still automatically at work in the flooded dishpan , turned to face her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 18]: `` Alice , '' she said , tremulously , `` what do I ask for myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 11]: `` I say , What do I ask for myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 9]: Do you suppose _ I _ want anything ?
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 25]: Do n't you know I 'd be perfectly content on your father 's present income if I were the only person to be considered ?
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 10]: What do I care about any pleasure for myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 21]: I 'd be willing never to have a maid again ; _ I _ do n't mind doing the work .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 35]: If we did n't have any children I 'd be glad to do your father 's cooking and the housework and the washing and ironing , too , for the rest of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 5]: I would n't care .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 29]: I 'm a poor cook and a poor housekeeper ; I do n't do anything well ; but it would be good enough for just him and me .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 17]: I would n't ever utter one word of com -- '' `` Oh , goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 3]: Alice lamented .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 8]: `` What IS it all about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 13]: `` It 's about this , '' said Mrs. Adams , swallowing .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 24]: `` You and Walter are a new generation and you ought to have the same as the rest of the new generation get .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 22]: Poor Walter -- asking you to go to the movies and a Chinese restaurant : the best he had to offer !
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 15]: Do n't you suppose _ I _ see how the poor boy is deteriorating ?
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 15]: Do n't you suppose I know what YOU have to go through , Alice ?
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 16]: And when I think of that man upstairs -- '' The agitated voice grew louder .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 62]: `` When I think of him and know that nothing in the world but his STUBBORNNESS keeps my children from having all they want and what they OUGHT to have , do you suppose I 'm going to hold myself bound to keep to the absolute letter of a silly promise he got from me by behaving like a crazy man ?
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 4]: I ca n't !
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 6]: I ca n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 26]: No mother could sit by and see him lock up a horn of plenty like that in his closet when the children were starving ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 9]: `` Oh , goodness , goodness me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 3]: Alice protested .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 13]: `` We are n't precisely ` starving , ' are we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams began to weep .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 7]: `` It 's just the same .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 28]: Did n't I see how flushed and pretty you looked , this afternoon , after you 'd been walking with this young man that 's come here ?
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 21]: Do you suppose he 'd LOOK at a girl like Mildred Palmer if you had what you ought to have ?
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 36]: Do you suppose he 'd be going into business with her father if YOUR father -- '' `` Good heavens , mama ; you 're worse than Walter : I just barely know the man !
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 7]: DO N'T be so absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 15]: `` Yes , I 'm always ` absurd , ' '' Mrs. Adams moaned .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 31]: `` All I can do is cry , while your father sits upstairs , and his horn of plenty -- '' But Alice interrupted with a peal of desperate laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 10]: `` Oh , that ` horn of plenty ! '
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 8]: Do come down to earth , mama .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 24]: How can you call a GLUE factory , that does n't exist except in your mind , a ` horn of plenty ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: Do let 's be a little rational ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 16]: `` It COULD be a horn of plenty , '' the tearful Mrs. Adams insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 4]: `` It could !
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 10]: You do n't understand a thing about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 15]: `` Well , I 'm willing , '' Alice said , with tired skepticism .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 7]: `` Make me understand , then .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 9]: Where 'd you ever get the idea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 24]: Mrs. Adams withdrew her hands from the water , dried them on a towel , and then wiped her eyes with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 18]: `` Your father could make a fortune if he wanted to , '' she said , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 23]: `` At least , I do n't say a fortune , but anyhow a great deal more than he does make . ''
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 24]: `` Yes , I 've heard that before , mama , and you think he could make it out of a glue factory .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 9]: What I 'm asking is : How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 3]: `` How ?
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: Why , by making glue and selling it .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 16]: Do n't you know how bad most glue is when you try to mend anything ?
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 24]: A good glue is one of the rarest things there is ; and it would just sell itself , once it got started .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 20]: Well , your father knows how to make as good a glue as there is in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 5]: Alice was not interested .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 5]: `` What of it ?
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 13]: I suppose probably anybody could make it if they wanted to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 11]: `` I SAID you did n't know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 6]: Nobody else could make it .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 10]: Your father knows a formula for making it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 6]: `` What of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 7]: `` It 's a secret formula .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 8]: It is n't even down on paper .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 10]: It 's worth any amount of money . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 6]: ` Any amount ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 6]: Alice said , remaining incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 10]: `` Why has n't papa sold it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 16]: `` Just because he 's too stubborn to do anything with it at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 8]: `` How did papa get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 15]: `` He got it before you were born , just after we were married .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 40]: I did n't think much about it then : it was n't till you were growing up and I saw how much we needed money that I -- '' `` Yes , but how did papa get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 14]: Alice began to feel a little more curious about this possible buried treasure .
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 7]: `` Did he invent it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 12]: `` Partly , '' Mrs. Adams said , looking somewhat preoccupied .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 9]: `` He and another man invented it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 14]: `` Then maybe the other man -- '' `` He 's dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 21]: `` Then his family -- '' `` I do n't think he left any family , '' Mrs. Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 9]: `` Anyhow , it belongs to your father .
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 16]: At least it belongs to him as much as it does to any one else .
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 42]: He 's got an absolutely perfect right to do anything he wants to with it , and it would make us all comfortable if he 'd do what I want him to -- and he KNOWS it would , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 6]: Alice shook her head pityingly .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 5]: `` Poor mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 25]: `` Of course he knows it would n't do anything of the kind , or else he 'd have done it long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 8]: `` He would , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 4]: her mother cried .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 11]: `` That only shows how little you know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 5]: `` Poor mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 6]: Alice said again , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 23]: `` If papa were like what you say he is , he 'd be -- why , he 'd be crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 9]: Mrs. Adams agreed with a vehemence near passion .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 16]: `` You 're right about him for once : that 's just what he is !
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 41]: He sits up there in his stubbornness and lets us slave here in the kitchen when if he wanted to -- if he 'd so much as lift his little finger -- '' `` Oh , come , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 16]: `` You ca n't build even a glue factory with just one little finger . ''
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 31]: Mrs. Adams seemed about to reply that finding fault with a figure of speech was beside the point ; but a ringing of the front door bell forestalled the retort .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 11]: `` Now , who do you suppose that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 9]: she wondered aloud , then her face brightened .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 27]: `` Ah -- did Mr. Russell ask if he could -- '' `` No , he would n't be coming this evening , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 26]: `` Probably it 's the great J. A. Lamb : he usually stops for a minute on Thursdays to ask how papa 's getting along .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 5]: I 'll go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 18]: She tossed her apron off , and as she went through the house her expression was thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 22]: She was thinking vaguely about the glue factory and wondering if there might be `` something in it '' after all .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 66]: If her mother was right about the rich possibilities of Adams 's secret -- but that was as far as Alice 's speculations upon the matter went at this time : they were checked , partly by the thought that her father probably had n't enough money for such an enterprise , and partly by the fact that she had arrived at the front door .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 26]: CHAPTER XII The fine old gentleman revealed when she opened the door was probably the last great merchant in America to wear the chin beard .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 32]: White as white frost , it was trimmed short with exquisite precision , while his upper lip and the lower expanses of his cheeks were clean and rosy from fresh shaving .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 59]: With this trim white chin beard , the white waistcoat , the white tie , the suit of fine gray cloth , the broad and brilliantly polished black shoes , and the wide-brimmed gray felt hat , here was a man who had found his style in the seventies of the last century , and thenceforth kept it .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 33]: Files of old magazines of that period might show him , in woodcut , as , `` Type of Boston Merchant '' ; Nast might have drawn him as an honest statesman .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 31]: He was eighty , hale and sturdy , not aged ; and his quick blue eyes , still unflecked , and as brisk as a boy 's , saw everything .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 8]: `` Well , well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 5]: he said , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 37]: `` You have n't lost any of your good looks since last week , I see , Miss Alice , so I guess I 'm to take it you have n't been worrying over your daddy .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 13]: The young feller 's getting along all right , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 14]: `` He 's much better ; he 's sitting up , Mr. Lamb .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 7]: Wo n't you come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 12]: `` Well , I do n't know but I might . ''
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 50]: He turned to call toward twin disks of light at the curb , `` Be out in a minute , Billy '' ; and the silhouette of a chauffeur standing beside a car could be seen to salute in response , as the old gentleman stepped into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 16]: `` You do n't suppose your daddy 's receiving callers yet , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 31]: `` He 's a good deal stronger than he was when you were here last week , but I 'm afraid he 's not very presentable , though . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 5]: ` Presentable ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 7]: The old man echoed her jovially .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 3]: `` Pshaw !
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 8]: I 've seen lots of sick folks .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 26]: _ I _ know what they look like and how they love to kind of nest in among a pile of old blankets and wrappers .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 21]: Do n't you worry about THAT , Miss Alice , if you think he 'd like to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 40]: `` Of course he would -- if -- '' Alice hesitated ; then said quickly , `` Of course he 'd love to see you and he 's quite able to , if you care to come up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 23]: She ran up the stairs ahead of him , and had time to snatch the crocheted wrap from her father 's shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 35]: Swathed as usual , he was sitting beside a table , reading the evening paper ; but when his employer appeared in the doorway he half rose as if to come forward in greeting .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 5]: `` Sit still ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 5]: the old gentleman shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 6]: `` What do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 11]: Do n't you know you 're weak as a cat ?
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 20]: D'you think a man can be sick as long as you have and NOT be weak as a cat ?
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 12]: What you trying to do the polite with ME for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 10]: Adams gratefully protracted the handshake that accompanied these inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 16]: `` This is certainly mighty fine of you , Mr. Lamb , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 31]: `` I guess Alice has told you how much our whole family appreciate your coming here so regularly to see how this old bag o ' bones was getting along .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 7]: Have n't you , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 20]: `` Yes , papa , '' she said ; and turned to go out , but Lamb checked her .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 17]: `` Stay right here , Miss Alice ; I 'm not even going to sit down .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 20]: I know how it upsets sick folks when people outside the family come in for the first time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 11]: `` You do n't upset me , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 18]: `` I 'll feel a lot better for getting a glimpse of you , Mr. Lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 18]: The visitor 's laugh was husky , but hearty and re-assuring , like his voice in speaking .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 18]: `` That 's the way all my boys blarney me , Miss Alice , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 21]: `` They think I 'll make the work lighter on 'em if they can get me kind of flattered up .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 32]: You just tell your daddy it 's no use ; he does n't get on MY soft side , pretending he likes to see me even when he 's sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 15]: `` Oh , I 'm not so sick any more , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 18]: `` I expect to be back in my place ten days from now at the longest . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 17]: `` Well , now , do n't hurry it , Virgil ; do n't hurry it .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 10]: You take your time ; take your time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 20]: This brought to Adams 's lips a feeble smile not lacking in a kind of vanity , as feeble .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 16]: `` I suppose you think my department runs itself down there , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 9]: His employer 's response was another husky laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 8]: `` Well , well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 14]: he cried , and patted Adams 's shoulder with a strong pink hand .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 13]: `` Listen to this young feller , Miss Alice , will you !
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 12]: He thinks we ca n't get along without him a minute !
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 29]: Yes , sir , this daddy of yours believes the whole works 'll just take and run down if he is n't there to keep 'em wound up .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 19]: I always suspected he thought a good deal of himself , and now I know he does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 4]: Adams looked troubled .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 22]: `` Well , I do n't like to feel that my salary 's going on with me not earning it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 8]: `` Listen to him , Miss Alice !
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 19]: Would n't you think , now , he 'd let me be the one to worry about that ?
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 21]: Why , on my word , if your daddy had his way , _ I _ would n't be anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 22]: He 'd take all my worrying and everything else off my shoulders and shove me right out of Lamb and Company !
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 4]: He would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 26]: `` It seems to me I 've been soldiering on you a pretty long while , Mr. Lamb , '' the convalescent said , querulously .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 18]: `` I do n't feel right about it ; but I 'll be back in ten days .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 5]: You 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 9]: The old man took his hand in parting .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 10]: `` All right ; we 'll see , Virgil .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 34]: Of course we do need you , seriously speaking ; but we do n't need you so bad we 'll let you come down there before you 're fully fit and able . ''
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 6]: He went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 7]: `` You hear , Miss Alice ?
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 24]: That 's what I wanted to make the old feller understand , and what I want you to kind of enforce on him .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 27]: The old place is there waiting for him , and it 'd wait ten years if it took him that long to get good and well .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 11]: You see that he remembers it , Miss Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 26]: She went down the stairs with him , and he continued to impress this upon her until he had gone out of the front door .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 36]: And even after that , the husky voice called back from the darkness , as he went to his car , `` Do n't forget , Miss Alice ; let him take his own time .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 16]: We always want him , but we want him to get good and well first .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 8]: Good-night , good-night , young lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 30]: When she closed the door her mother came from the farther end of the `` living-room , '' where there was no light ; and Alice turned to her .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 16]: `` I ca n't help liking that old man , mama , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 15]: `` He always sounds so -- well , so solid and honest and friendly !
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 6]: I do like him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 10]: But Mrs. Adams failed in sympathy upon this point .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 17]: `` He did n't say anything about raising your father 's salary , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 5]: she asked , dryly .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 5]: I thought not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 30]: She would have said more , but Alice , indisposed to listen , began to whistle , ran up the stairs , and went to sit with her father .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 37]: She found him bright-eyed with the excitement a first caller brings into a slow convalescence : his cheeks showed actual hints of colour ; and he was smiling tremulously as he filled and lit his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 20]: She brought the crocheted scarf and put it about his shoulders again , then took a chair near him .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 17]: `` I believe seeing Mr. Lamb did do you good , papa , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 18]: `` I sort of thought it might , and that 's why I let him come up .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 12]: You really look a little like your old self again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 8]: Adams exhaled a breathy `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 15]: with the smoke from his pipe as he waved the match to extinguish it .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 9]: `` That 's fine , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 39]: `` The smoke I had before dinner did n't taste the way it used to , and I kind of wondered if I 'd lost my liking for tobacco , but this one seems to be all right .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 12]: You bet it did me good to see J. A. Lamb !
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 55]: He 's the biggest man that 's ever lived in this town or ever will live here ; and you can take all the Governors and Senators or anything they 've raised here , and put 'em in a pot with him , and they wo n't come out one-two-three alongside o ' him !
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 96]: And to think as big a man as that , with all his interests and everything he 's got on his mind -- to think he 'd never let anything prevent him from coming here once every week to ask how I was getting along , and then walk right upstairs and kind of CALL on me , as it were well , it makes me sort of feel as if I was n't so much of a nobody , so to speak , as your mother seems to like to make out sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 6]: `` How foolish , papa !
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 11]: Of COURSE you 're not ' a nobody . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 22]: Adams chuckled faintly upon his pipe-stem , what vanity he had seeming to be further stimulated by his daughter 's applause .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 30]: `` I guess there are n't a whole lot of people in this town that could claim J. A. showed that much interest in 'em , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 22]: `` Of course I do n't set up to believe it 's all because of merit , or anything like that .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 41]: He 'd do the same for anybody else that 'd been with the company as long as I have , but still it IS something to be with the company that long and have him show he appreciates it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 11]: `` Yes , indeed , it is , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , '' Adams said , reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 11]: `` Yes , sir , I guess that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 16]: And besides , it all goes to show the kind of a man he is .
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 12]: Simon pure , that 's what that man is , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 3]: Simon pure !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 27]: There 's never been anybody work for him that did n't respect him more than they did any other man in the world , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 14]: And when you work for him you know he respects you , too .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 36]: Right from the start you get the feeling that J. A. puts absolute confidence in you ; and that 's mighty stimulating : it makes you want to show him he has n't misplaced it .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 39]: There 's great big moral values to the way a man like him gets you to feeling about your relations with the business : it ai n't all just dollars and cents -- not by any means ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 44]: He was silent for a time , then returned with increasing enthusiasm to this theme , and Alice was glad to see so much renewal of life in him ; he had not spoken with a like cheerful vigour since before his illness .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 31]: The visit of his idolized great man had indeed been good for him , putting new spirit into him ; and liveliness of the body followed that of the spirit .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 32]: His improvement carried over the night : he slept well and awoke late , declaring that he was `` pretty near a well man and ready for business right now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 27]: Moreover , having slept again in the afternoon , he dressed and went down to dinner , leaning but lightly on Alice , who conducted him .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 3]: `` My !
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 16]: but you and your mother have been at it with your scrubbing and dusting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 12]: he said , as they came through the `` living-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 18]: `` I do n't know I ever did see the house so spick and span before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 16]: His glance fell upon a few carnations in a vase , and he chuckled admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 5]: `` Flowers , too !
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 21]: So THAT 'S what you coaxed that dollar and a half out o ` me for , this morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 21]: Other embellishments brought forth his comment when he had taken his old seat at the head of the small dinner-table .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 9]: `` Why , I declare , Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 63]: `` I been so busy looking at all the spick-and-spanishness after the house-cleaning , and the flowers out in the parlour -- ` living room ' I suppose you want me to call it , if I just GOT to be fashionable -- I been so busy studying over all this so-and-so , I declare I never noticed YOU till this minute !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 9]: My , but you ARE all dressed up !
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 6]: What 's goin ' on ?
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 20]: What 's it about : you so all dressed up , and flowers in the parlour and everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 8]: `` Do n't you see , papa ?
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 14]: It 's in honour of your coming downstairs again , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 12]: `` Oh , so that 's it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 15]: `` I never would ` a ' thought of that , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 17]: But Walter looked sidelong at his father , and gave forth his sly and knowing laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 6]: `` Neither would I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 6]: Adams lifted his eyebrows jocosely .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 10]: `` You 're jealous , are you , sonny ?
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 24]: You do n't want the old man to think our young lady 'd make so much fuss over him , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 16]: `` Go on thinkin ' it 's over you , '' Walter retorted , amused .
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 7]: `` Go on and think it .
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 7]: It 'll do you good . ''
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 12]: `` Of course I 'll think it , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 8]: `` It is n't anybody 's birthday .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 11]: Certainly the decorations are on account of me coming downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 9]: Did n't you hear Alice say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 10]: `` Sure , I heard her say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 14]: `` Well , then -- '' Walter interrupted him with a little music .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 21]: Looking shrewdly at Alice , he sang : `` I was walkin ' out on Monday with my sweet thing .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 21]: She 's my neat thing , My sweet thing : I 'll go round on Tuesday night to see her .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 12]: Oh , how we 'll spoon -- '' `` Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 4]: his mother cried .
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 10]: `` WHERE do you learn such vulgar songs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 16]: However , she seemed not greatly displeased with him , and laughed as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 9]: `` So that 's it , Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 3]: said Adams .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 12]: `` Playing the hypocrite with your old man , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 10]: It 's some new beau , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 13]: `` I only wish it were , '' she said , calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 16]: It 's just what I said : it 's all for you , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 14]: `` Do n't let her con you , '' Walter advised his father .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 6]: `` She 's got expectations .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 14]: You hang around downstairs a while after dinner and you 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 18]: But the prophecy failed , though Adams went to his own room without waiting to test it .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 4]: No one came .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 17]: Alice stayed in the `` living-room '' until half-past nine , when she went slowly upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 24]: Her mother , almost tearful , met her at the top , and whispered , `` You must n't mind , dearie . ''
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 7]: `` Must n't mind what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 16]: Alice asked , and then , as she went on her way , laughed scornfully .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 6]: `` What utter nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 20]: Next day she cut the stems of the rather scant show of carnations and refreshed them with new water .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 65]: At dinner , her father , still in high spirits , observed that she had again `` dressed up '' in honour of his second descent of the stairs ; and Walter repeated his fragment of objectionable song ; but these jocularities were rendered pointless by the eventless evening that followed ; and in the morning the carnations began to appear tarnished and flaccid .
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 31]: Alice gave them a long look , then threw them away ; and neither Walter nor her father was inspired to any rallying by her plain costume for that evening .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams was visibly depressed .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 24]: When Alice finished helping her mother with the dishes , she went outdoors and sat upon the steps of the little front veranda .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 22]: The night , gentle with warm air from the south , surrounded her pleasantly , and the perpetual smoke was thinner .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 50]: Now that the furnaces of dwelling-houses were no longer fired , life in that city had begun to be less like life in a railway tunnel ; people were aware of summer in the air , and in the thickened foliage of the shade-trees , and in the sky .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 26]: Stars were unveiled by the passing of the denser smoke fogs , and to-night they could be seen clearly ; they looked warm and near .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 23]: Other girls sat upon verandas and stoops in Alice 's street , cheerful as young fishermen along the banks of a stream .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 21]: Alice could hear them from time to time ; thin sopranos persistent in laughter that fell dismally upon her ears .
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 26]: She had set no lines or nets herself , and what she had of `` expectations , '' as Walter called them , were vanished .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 63]: For Alice was experienced ; and one of the conclusions she drew from her experience was that when a man says , `` I 'd take you for anything you wanted me to , '' he may mean it or , he may not ; but , if he does , he will not postpone the first opportunity to say something more .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 19]: Little affairs , once begun , must be warmed quickly ; for if they cool they are dead .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 9]: But Alice was not thinking of Arthur Russell .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 17]: When she tossed away the carnations she likewise tossed away her thoughts of that young man .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 29]: She had been like a boy who sees upon the street , some distance before him , a bit of something round and glittering , a possible dime .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 26]: He hopes it is a dime , and , until he comes near enough to make sure , he plays that it is a dime .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 15]: In his mind he has an adventure with it : he buys something delightful .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 23]: If he picks it up , discovering only some tin-foil which has happened upon a round shape , he feels a sinking .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 6]: A dulness falls upon him .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 38]: So Alice was dull with the loss of an adventure ; and when the laughter of other girls reached her , intermittently , she had not sprightliness enough left in her to be envious of their gaiety .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 34]: Besides , these neighbours were ineligible even for her envy , being of another caste ; they could never know a dance at the Palmers ' , except remotely , through a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 35]: Their laughter was for the encouragement of snappy young men of the stores and offices down-town , clerks , bookkeepers , what not -- some of them probably graduates of Frincke 's Business College .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 35]: Then , as she recalled that dark portal , with its dusty stairway mounting between close walls to disappear in the upper shadows , her mind drew back as from a doorway to Purgatory .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 49]: Nevertheless , it was a picture often in her reverie ; and sometimes it came suddenly , without sequence , into the midst of her other thoughts , as if it leaped up among them from a lower darkness ; and when it arrived it wanted to stay .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 31]: So a traveller , still roaming the world afar , sometimes broods without apparent reason upon his family burial lot : `` I wonder if I shall end there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 35]: The foreboding passed abruptly , with a jerk of her breath , as the street-lamp revealed a tall and easy figure approaching from the north , swinging a stick in time to its stride .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 10]: She had given Russell up -- and he came .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 7]: `` What luck for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 7]: `` To find you alone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 13]: Alice gave him her hand for an instant , not otherwise moving .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 12]: `` I 'm glad it happened so , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 10]: `` Let 's stay out here , shall we ?
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 20]: Do you think it 's too provincial to sit on a girl 's front steps with her ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 4]: ` Provincial ? '
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 21]: Why , it 's the very best of our institutions , '' he returned , taking his place beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 10]: `` At least , I think so to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 3]: `` Thanks !
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 10]: Is that practice for other nights somewhere else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 7]: `` No , '' he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 9]: `` The practicing all led up to this .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 7]: Did I come too soon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 9]: `` No , '' she replied , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 6]: `` Just in time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 30]: `` I 'm glad to be so accurate ; I 've spent two evenings wanting to come , Miss Adams , instead of doing what I was doing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 6]: `` What was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 3]: `` Dinners .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 5]: Large and long dinners .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 10]: Your fellow-citizens are immensely hospitable to a newcomer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 9]: `` We do n't do it for everybody .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 8]: Did n't you find yourself charmed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 12]: `` One was a men 's dinner , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 18]: `` Mr. Palmer seemed to think I ought to be shown to the principal business men . ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 8]: `` What was the other dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 8]: `` My cousin Mildred gave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 7]: `` Oh , DID she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 17]: Alice said , sharply , but she recovered herself in the same instant , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 16]: `` She wanted to show you to the principal business women , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 36]: At all events , I should n't give myself out to be so much feted by your ` fellow-citizens , ' after all , seeing these were both done by my relatives , the Palmers .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 12]: However , there are others to follow , I 'm afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 16]: I was wondering -- I hoped maybe you 'd be coming to some of them .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 5]: Are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 12]: `` I rather doubt it , '' Alice said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 20]: `` Mildred 's dance was almost the only evening I 've gone out since my father 's illness began .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 10]: He seemed better that day ; so I went .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 12]: He was better the other day when he wanted those cigars .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 9]: He 's very much up and down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 3]: She paused .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 12]: `` I 'd almost forgotten that Mildred is your cousin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 11]: `` Not a very near one , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 10]: `` Mr. Palmer 's father was my great-uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 10]: `` Still , of course you are related . ''
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 7]: `` Yes ; that distantly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 12]: Alice said placidly , `` It 's quite an advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 3]: He agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 4]: It is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 13]: `` No , '' she said , in the same placid tone .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 7]: `` I mean for Mildred . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 10]: `` I do n't see -- '' She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 4]: You would n't .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 39]: I mean it 's an advantage over the rest of us who might like to compete for some of your time ; and the worst of it is we ca n't accuse her of being unfair about it .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 15]: We ca n't prove she showed any trickiness in having you for a cousin .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 16]: Whatever else she might plan to do with you , she did n't plan that .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 11]: So the rest of us must just bear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 9]: `` The ` rest of you ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 13]: `` It 's going to mean a great deal of suffering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: Alice resumed her placid tone .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 14]: `` You 're staying at the Palmers ' , are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 6]: `` No , not now .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 6]: I 've taken an apartment .
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 11]: I 'm going to live here ; I 'm permanent .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 7]: Did n't I tell you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 15]: `` I think I 'd heard somewhere that you were , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 11]: `` Do you think you 'll like living here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 7]: `` How can one tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 20]: `` If I were in your place I think I should be able to tell , Mr. Russell . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 7]: `` Why , good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 17]: `` Have n't you got the most perfect creature in town for your -- your cousin ?
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 13]: SHE expects to make you like living here , does n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 20]: How could you keep from liking it , even if you tried not to , under the circumstances ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 33]: `` Well , you see , there 's such a lot of circumstances , '' he explained ; `` I 'm not sure I 'll like getting back into a business again .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 32]: I suppose most of the men of my age in the country have been going through the same experience : the War left us with a considerable restlessness of spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 8]: `` You were in the War ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 18]: she asked , quickly , and as quickly answered herself , `` Of course you were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 20]: `` I was a left-over ; they only let me out about four months ago , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 13]: `` It 's quite a shake-up trying to settle down again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 9]: `` You were in France , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 31]: `` Oh , yes ; but I did n't get up to the front much -- only two or three times , and then just for a day or so .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 8]: I was in the transportation service . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 10]: `` You were an officer , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 11]: `` They let me play I was a major . ''
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 10]: `` I guessed a major , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 12]: `` You 'd always be pretty grand , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 4]: Russell was amused .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 27]: `` Well , you see , '' he informed her , `` as it happened , we had at least several other majors in our army .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 12]: Why would I always be something ` pretty grand ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 8]: `` You 're related to the Palmers .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 12]: Do n't you notice they always affect the pretty grand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 17]: `` Then you think I 'm only one of their affectations , I take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 16]: `` Yes , you seem to be the most successful one they 've got ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 5]: Alice said , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 9]: `` You certainly do belong to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 11]: And she laughed as if at something hidden from him .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 14]: `` But you 've just excused me for that , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 14]: `` You said nobody could be blamed for my being their third cousin .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 8]: What a contradictory girl you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 5]: Alice shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 14]: `` Let 's keep away from the kind of girl I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 13]: `` That 's just what I came here to talk about . ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 6]: She shook her head again .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 13]: `` Let 's keep first to the kind of man you are .
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 10]: I 'm glad you were in the War . ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 33]: She was quiet a moment , for she was thinking that here she spoke the truth : his service put about him a little glamour that helped to please her with him .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 26]: She had been pleased with him during their walk ; pleased with him on his own account ; and now that pleasure was growing keener .
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 36]: She looked at him , and though the light in which she saw him was little more than starlight , she saw that he was looking steadily at her with a kindly and smiling seriousness .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 30]: All at once it seemed to her that the night air was sweeter to breathe , as if a distant fragrance of new blossoms had been blown to her .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 20]: She smiled back to him , and said , `` Well , what kind of man are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 15]: `` I do n't know ; I 've often wondered , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 9]: `` What kind of girl are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 6]: `` Do n't you remember ?
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 7]: I told you the other day .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 6]: I 'm just me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: `` But who is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 9]: `` You forget everything ; '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 12]: `` You told me what kind of a girl I am .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 18]: You seemed to think you 'd taken quite a fancy to me from the very first . ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 11]: `` So I did , '' he agreed , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 9]: `` But how quickly you forgot it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 15]: I only want YOU to say what kind of a girl you are . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 6]: She mocked him . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: I do n't know ; I 've often wondered ! '
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 12]: What kind of a girl does Mildred tell you I am ?
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 19]: What has she said about me since she told you I was ' a Miss Adams ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 13]: `` I do n't know ; I have n't asked her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 13]: `` Then DO N'T ask her , '' Alice said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 16]: `` Because she 's such a perfect creature and I 'm such an imperfect one .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 14]: Perfect creatures have the most perfect way of ruining the imperfect ones . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 9]: `` But then they would n't be perfect .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 20]: Not if they -- '' `` Oh , yes , they remain perfectly perfect , '' she assured him .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 10]: `` That 's because they never go into details .
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 22]: They 're not so vulgar as to come right out and TELL that you 've been in jail for stealing chickens .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 39]: They just look absent-minded and say in a low voice , ` Oh , very ; but I scarcely think you 'd like her particularly ' ; and then begin to talk of something else right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 5]: His smile had disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' he said , somewhat ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 7]: `` That does sound like Mildred .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 8]: You certainly do seem to know her !
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 10]: Do you know everybody as well as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 8]: `` Not myself , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 9]: `` I do n't know myself at all .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 23]: I got to wondering about that -- about who I was -- the other day after you walked home with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 25]: He uttered an exclamation , and added , explaining it , `` You do give a man a chance to be fatuous , though !
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 16]: As if it were walking home with me that made you wonder about yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: `` It was , '' Alice informed him , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 26]: `` I was wondering what I wanted to make you think of me , in case I should ever happen to see you again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 8]: This audacity appeared to take his breath .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 11]: `` You must n't be astonished , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 45]: `` What I decided then was that I would probably never dare to be just myself with you -- not if I cared to have you want to see me again -- and yet here I am , just being myself after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 20]: `` You ARE the cheeriest series of shocks , '' Russell exclaimed , whereupon Alice added to the series .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 17]: `` Tell me : Is it a good policy for me to follow with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 13]: she asked , and he found the mockery in her voice delightful .
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 18]: `` Would you advise me to offer you shocks as a sort of vacation from suavity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 22]: `` Suavity '' was yet another sketch of Mildred ; a recognizable one , or it would not have been humorous .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 32]: In Alice 's hands , so dexterous in this work , her statuesque friend was becoming as ridiculous as a fine figure of wax left to the mercies of a satirist .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 40]: But the lively young sculptress knew better than to overdo : what she did must appear to spring all from mirth ; so she laughed as if unwillingly , and said , `` I MUST N'T laugh at Mildred !
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 12]: In the first place , she 's your -- your cousin .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 29]: And in the second place , she 's not meant to be funny ; it is n't right to laugh at really splendid people who take themselves seriously .
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 15]: In the third place , you wo n't come again if I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 19]: `` Do n't be sure of that , '' Russell said , `` whatever you do . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 7]: ` Whatever I do ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 3]: she echoed .
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 12]: `` That sounds as if you thought I COULD be terrific !
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 17]: Be careful ; there 's one thing I could do that would keep you away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 13]: `` I could tell you not to come , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 9]: `` I wonder if I ought to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 13]: `` Why do you wonder if you ` ought to ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 7]: `` Do n't you guess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 15]: `` Then let 's both be mysteries to each other , '' she suggested .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 21]: `` I mystify you because I wonder , and you mystify me because you do n't guess why I wonder .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 12]: We 'll let it go at that , shall we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 22]: `` Very well ; so long as it 's certain that you DO N'T tell me not to come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: `` I 'll not tell you that -- yet , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 17]: `` In fact -- '' She paused , reflecting , with her head to one side .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 28]: `` In fact , I wo n't tell you not to come , probably , until I see that 's what you want me to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 16]: I 'll let you out easily -- and I 'll be sure to see it .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 8]: Even before you do , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 24]: `` That arrangement suits me , '' Russell returned , and his voice held no trace of jocularity : he had become serious .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 33]: `` It suits me better if you 're enough in earnest to mean that I can come -- oh , not whenever I want to ; I do n't expect so much !
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 14]: -- but if you mean that I can see you pretty often . ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 12]: `` Of course I 'm in earnest , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 53]: `` But before I say you can come ` pretty often , ' I 'd like to know how much of my time you 'd need if you did come ` whenever you want to ' ; and of course you would n't dare make any answer to that question except one .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 10]: Would n't you let me have Thursdays out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 6]: `` I want to know .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 9]: Will you let me come pretty often ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 11]: `` Lean toward me a little , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 8]: `` I want you to understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 32]: And as he obediently bent his head near hers , she inclined toward him as if to whisper ; then , in a half-shout , she cried , `` YES ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 5]: He clapped his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 5]: `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 8]: `` What a girl you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 17]: `` Well , for the first reason , because you have such gaieties as that one .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 24]: I should think your father would actually like being ill , just to be in the house with you all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 23]: `` You mean by that , '' Alice inquired , `` I keep my family cheerful with my amusing little ways ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 17]: `` There were only boys in your family , were n't there , Mr. Russell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 10]: `` I was an only child , unfortunately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 10]: `` I see you had n't any sisters . ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 22]: For a moment he puzzled over her meaning , then saw it , and was more delighted with her than ever .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 20]: `` I can answer a question of yours , now , that I could n't a while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 12]: `` Yes , I know , '' she returned , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 8]: `` But how could you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 22]: `` It 's the question I asked you about whether you were going to like living here , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 17]: `` You 're about to tell me that now you know you WILL like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 5]: `` More telepathy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 9]: `` Yes , that was it , precisely .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 35]: I suppose the same thing 's been said to you so many times that you -- '' `` No , it has n't , '' Alice said , a little confused for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 23]: I meant -- '' She paused , then asked in a gentle voice , `` Would you really like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 16]: `` Well , then , I was only afraid you did n't mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 8]: `` See here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 6]: `` I did mean it .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 17]: I told you it was being pretty difficult for me to settle down to things again .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 34]: Well , it 's more difficult than you know , but I think I can pull through in fair spirits if I can see a girl like you ` pretty often . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 13]: `` All right , '' she said , in a business-like tone .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 14]: `` I 've told you that you can if you want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 11]: `` I do want to , '' he assured her .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 7]: `` I do , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 13]: `` How often is ` pretty often , ' Mr. Russell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 8]: `` Would you walk with me sometimes ?
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 3]: To-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 3]: `` Sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 3]: Not to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 5]: The day after . ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 6]: `` That 's splendid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 30]: `` You 'll walk with me day after to-morrow , and the night after that I 'll see you at Miss Lamb 's dance , wo n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 8]: But this fell rather chillingly upon Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 6]: `` Miss Lamb 's dance ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 5]: Which Miss Lamb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 19]: `` I do n't know -- it 's the one that 's just coming out of mourning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 7]: `` Oh , Henrietta -- yes .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 6]: Is her dance so soon ?
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 5]: I 'd forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 11]: `` You 'll be there , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 8]: `` Please say you 're going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 23]: Alice did not respond at once , and he urged her again : `` Please do promise you 'll be there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 15]: `` No , I ca n't promise anything , '' she said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 16]: `` You see , for one thing , papa might not be well enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 7]: `` But if he is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 3]: said Russell .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 13]: `` If he is you 'll surely come , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 54]: Or , perhaps -- '' He hesitated , then went on quickly , `` I do n't know the rules in this place yet , and different places have different rules ; but do you have to have a chaperone , or do n't girls just go to dances with the men sometimes ?
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: If they do , would you -- would you let me take you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 4]: Alice was startled .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 22]: `` Do n't you think your relatives -- Are n't you expected to go with Mildred -- and Mrs. Palmer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 4]: `` Not necessarily .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 16]: It does n't matter what I might be expected to do , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 8]: `` Will you go with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 10]: `` I -- No ; I could n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 5]: `` I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 6]: I 'm not going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 5]: `` But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 14]: `` Papa 's not really any better , '' Alice said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 14]: `` I 'm too worried about him to go to a dance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 18]: Her voice sounded emotional , genuinely enough ; there was something almost like a sob in it .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 11]: `` Let 's talk of other things , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 28]: He acquiesced gently ; but Mrs. Adams , who had been listening to the conversation at the open window , just overhead , did not hear him .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 33]: She had correctly interpreted the sob in Alice 's voice , and , trembling with sudden anger , she rose from her knees , and went fiercely to her husband 's room .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 22]: CHAPTER XIII He had not undressed , and he sat beside the table , smoking his pipe and reading his newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 59]: Upon his forehead the lines in that old pattern , the historical map of his troubles , had grown a little vaguer lately ; relaxed by the complacency of a man who not only finds his health restored , but sees the days before him promising once more a familiar routine that he has always liked to follow .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 34]: As his wife came in , closing the door behind her , he looked up cheerfully , `` Well , mother , '' he said , `` what 's the news downstairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 17]: `` That 's what I came to tell you , '' she informed him , grimly .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 15]: Adams lowered his newspaper to his knee and peered over his spectacles at her .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 26]: She had remained by the door , standing , and the great greenish shadow of the small lamp-shade upon his table revealed her but dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 8]: `` Is n't everything all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 21]: `` Do n't worry : I 'm going to tell you , '' she said , her grimness not relaxed .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 9]: `` There 's matter enough , Virgil Adams .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 11]: Matter enough to make me sick of being alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 22]: With that , the markings on his brows began to emerge again in all their sharpness ; the old pattern reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 8]: `` Oh , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 3]: he lamented .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 19]: `` I thought maybe we were all going to settle down to a little peace for a while .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 7]: What 's it about now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 6]: `` It 's about Alice .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 13]: Did you think it was about ME or anything for MYSELF ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 20]: Like some ready old machine , always in order , his irritability responded immediately and automatically to her emotion .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 18]: `` How in thunder could I think what it 's about , or who it 's for ?
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 9]: SAY it , and get it over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 16]: `` Oh , I 'll ` say ' it , '' she promised , ominously .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 29]: `` What I 've come to ask you is , How much longer do you expect me to put up with that old man and his doings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 4]: `` Whose doings ?
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 5]: What old man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 8]: She came at him , fiercely accusing .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: `` You know well enough what old man , Virgil Adams !
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 11]: That old man who was here the other night . ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 5]: `` Mr. Lamb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 9]: `` Yes ; ` Mister Lamb ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 5]: She mocked his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 17]: `` What other old man would I be likely to mean except J. A. Lamb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 9]: `` What 's he been doing now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 6]: her husband inquired , satirically .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 21]: `` Where 'd you get something new against him since the last time you -- '' `` Just this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 38]: `` The other night when that man was here , if I 'd known how he was going to make my child suffer , I 'd never have let him set his foot in my house . ''
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 15]: Adams leaned back in his chair as though her absurdity had eased his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 10]: `` Oh , I see , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 8]: `` You 've just gone plain crazy .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 16]: That 's the only explanation of such talk , and it suits the case . ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 16]: `` Has n't that man made us all suffer every day of our lives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 25]: `` I 'd like to know why it is that my life and my children 's lives have to be sacrificed to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 11]: `` How are they ` sacrificed ' to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 9]: `` Because you keep on working for him !
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 22]: Because you keep on letting him hand out whatever miserable little pittance he chooses to give you ; that 's why !
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 31]: It 's as if he were some horrible old Juggernaut and I had to see my children 's own father throwing them under the wheels to keep him satisfied . ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 11]: `` I wo n't hear any more such stuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 9]: Lifting his paper , Adams affected to read .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 13]: `` You 'd better listen to me , '' she admonished him .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 22]: `` You might be sorry you did n't , in case he ever tried to set foot in my house again !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 14]: I might tell him to his face what I think of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 12]: At this , Adams slapped the newspaper down upon his knee .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 6]: `` Oh , the devil !
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 11]: What 's it matter what you think of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 9]: `` It had better matter to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 25]: `` Do you suppose I 'm going to submit forever to him and his family and what they 're doing to my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 15]: `` What are he and his family doing to ` your child ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams came out with it .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 19]: `` That snippy little Henrietta Lamb has always snubbed Alice every time she 's ever had the chance .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 57]: She 's followed the lead of the other girls ; they 've always all of 'em been jealous of Alice because she dared to try and be happy , and because she 's showier and better-looking than they are , even though you do give her only about thirty-five cents a year to do it on !
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 49]: They 've all done everything on earth they could to drive the young men away from her and belittle her to 'em ; and this mean little Henrietta Lamb 's been the worst of the whole crowd to Alice , every time she could see a chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 5]: Adams asked , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 13]: `` Why should she or anybody else pick on Alice ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 4]: ` Why ? '
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 6]: ` What for ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 8]: his wife repeated with a greater vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 11]: `` Do YOU ask me such a thing as that ?
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 8]: Do you really want to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 17]: `` Yes ; I 'd want to know -- I would if I believed it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 15]: `` Then I 'll tell you , '' she said in a cold fury .
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 18]: `` It 's on account of you , Virgil , and nothing else in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 5]: He hooted at her .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 14]: These girls do n't like ME , so they pick on Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 11]: `` Quit your palavering and evading , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 26]: `` A crowd of girls like that , when they get a pretty girl like Alice among them , they act just like wild beasts .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 32]: They 'll tear her to pieces , or else they 'll chase her and run her out , because they know if she had half a chance she 'd outshine 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 22]: They ca n't do that to a girl like Mildred Palmer because she 's got money and family to back her .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 20]: Now you listen to me , Virgil Adams : the way the world is now , money IS family .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 28]: Alice would have just as much ` family ' as any of 'em every single bit -- if you had n't fallen behind in the race . ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 13]: `` How did I -- '' `` Yes , you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 31]: `` Twenty-five years ago when we were starting and this town was smaller , you and I could have gone with any of 'em if we 'd tried hard enough .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 20]: Look at the people we knew then that do hold their heads up alongside of anybody in this town !
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 4]: WHY can they ?
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 19]: Because the men of those families made money and gave their children everything that makes life worth living !
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 9]: Why ca n't we hold our heads up ?
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 9]: Because those men passed you in the race .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 21]: They went up the ladder , and you -- you 're still a clerk down at that old hole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 12]: `` You leave that out , please , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 19]: `` I thought you were going to tell me something Henrietta Lamb had done to our Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 17]: `` You BET I 'm going to tell you , '' she assured him , vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 11]: `` But first I 'm telling WHY she does it .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 30]: It 's because you 've never given Alice any backing nor any background , and they all know they can do anything they like to her with perfect impunity .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 28]: If she had the hundredth part of what THEY have to fall back on she 'd have made 'em sing a mighty different song long ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 6]: `` How would she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 12]: `` Oh , my heavens , but you 're slow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams moaned .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 20]: You remember how practically all the nicest boys in this town used to come here a few years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 20]: Why , they were all crazy over her ; and the girls HAD to be nice to her then .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 6]: Look at the difference now !
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 51]: There 'll be a whole month go by and not a young man come to call on her , let alone send her candy or flowers , or ever think of TAKING her any place and yet she 's prettier and brighter than she was when they used to come .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 16]: It is n't the child 's fault she could n't hold 'em , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 8]: Poor thing , SHE tried hard enough !
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 13]: I suppose you 'd say it was her fault , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 8]: `` No ; I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 8]: `` Then whose fault is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 13]: `` Oh , mine , mine , '' he said , wearily .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 12]: `` I drove the young men away , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 11]: `` You might as well have driven 'em , Virgil .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 9]: It amounts to just the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 6]: `` How does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 23]: `` Because as they got older a good many of 'em began to think more about money ; that 's one thing .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 13]: Money 's at the bottom of it all , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 42]: Look at these country clubs and all such things : the other girls ' families belong and we do n't , and Alice do n't ; and she ca n't go unless somebody takes her , and nobody does any more .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 36]: Look at the other girls ' houses , and then look at our house , so shabby and old-fashioned she 'd be pretty near ashamed to ask anybody to come in and sit down nowadays !
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 37]: Look at her clothes -- oh , yes ; you think you shelled out a lot for that little coat of hers and the hat and skirt she got last March ; but it 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 15]: Some of these girls nowadays spend more than your whole salary on their clothes .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 7]: And what jewellery has she got ?
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 22]: A plated watch and two or three little pins and rings of the kind people 's maids would n't wear now .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 9]: Good Lord , Virgil Adams , wake up !
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 21]: Do n't sit there and tell me you do n't know things like this mean SUFFERING for the child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 32]: He had begun to rub his hands wretchedly back and forth over his bony knees , as if in that way he somewhat alleviated the tedium caused by her racking voice .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: `` Oh , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 8]: `` OH , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 18]: `` Yes , I should think you WOULD say ` Oh , my , my ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 7]: she took him up , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 8]: `` That does n't help things much !
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 23]: If you ever wanted to DO anything about it , the poor child might see some gleam of hope in her life .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 23]: You do n't CARE for her , that 's the trouble ; you do n't care a single thing about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 6]: `` I do n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 7]: `` No ; you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 18]: Why , even with your miserable little salary you could have given her more than you have .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 48]: You 're the closest man I ever knew : it 's like pulling teeth to get a dollar out of you for her , now and then , and yet you hide some away , every month or so , in some wretched little investment or other .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 15]: You -- '' `` Look here , now , '' he interrupted , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 5]: `` You look here !
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 28]: If I did n't put a little by whenever I could , in a bond or something , where would you be if anything happened to me ?
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 11]: The insurance doctors never passed me ; YOU know that .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 13]: Have n't we got to have SOMETHING to fall back on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 7]: `` Yes , we have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 20]: `` We ought to have something to go on with right now , too , when we need it .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 19]: Do you suppose these snippets would treat Alice the way they do if she could afford to ENTERTAIN ?
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 27]: They leave her out of their dinners and dances simply because they know she ca n't give any dinners and dances to leave them out of !
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 15]: They know she ca n't get EVEN , and that 's the whole story !
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 14]: That 's why Henrietta Lamb 's done this thing to her now . ''
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 11]: Adams had gone back to his rubbing of his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 8]: `` Oh , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 5]: `` WHAT thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 4]: She told him .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 24]: `` Your dear , grand , old Mister Lamb 's Henrietta has sent out invitations for a large party -- a LARGE one .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 15]: Everybody that is anybody in this town is asked , you can be sure .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 38]: There 's a very fine young man , a Mr. Russell , has just come to town , and he 's interested in Alice , and he 's asked her to go to this dance with him .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 7]: Well , Alice ca n't accept .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 19]: She ca n't go with him , though she 'd give anything in the world to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 4]: Do you understand ?
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 14]: The reason she ca n't is because Henrietta Lamb has n't invited her .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 12]: Do you want to know why Henrietta has n't invited her ?
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 37]: It 's because she knows Alice ca n't get even , and because she thinks Alice ought to be snubbed like this on account of only being the daughter of one of her grandfather 's clerks .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 6]: I HOPE you understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 8]: `` Oh , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 8]: `` OH , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 15]: `` That 's your sweet old employer , '' his wife cried , tauntingly .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 13]: `` That 's your dear , kind , grand old Mister Lamb !
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 36]: Alice has been left out of a good many smaller things , like big dinners and little dances , but this is just the same as serving her notice that she 's out of everything !
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 18]: And it 's all done by your dear , grand old -- '' `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 3]: Adams exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 12]: `` I do n't want to hear any more of that !
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 15]: You ca n't hold him responsible for everything his grandchildren do , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 10]: He probably does n't know a thing about it .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 20]: You do n't suppose he 's troubling HIS head over -- '' But she burst out at him passionately .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 9]: `` Suppose you trouble YOUR head about it !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 7]: You 'd better , Virgil Adams !
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 20]: You 'd better , unless you want to see your child just dry up into a miserable old maid !
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 38]: She 's still young and she has a chance for happiness , if she had a father that did n't bring a millstone to hang around her neck , instead of what he ought to give her !
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 22]: You just wait till you die and God asks you what you had in your breast instead of a heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 8]: `` Oh , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 12]: `` What 's my heart got to do with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 14]: You have n't got one or you 'd give her what she needed .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 9]: Am I asking anything you CA N'T do ?
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 11]: You know better ; you know I 'm not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 23]: At this he sat suddenly rigid , his troubled hands ceasing to rub his knees ; and he looked at her fixedly .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 12]: `` Now , tell me , '' he said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 8]: `` Just what ARE you asking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 5]: `` You know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 18]: `` You mean you 've broken your word never to speak of THAT to me again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 12]: `` What do _ I _ care for my word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 20]: she cried , and , sinking to the floor at his feet , rocked herself back and forth there .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 23]: `` Do you suppose I 'll let my ` word ' keep me from struggling for a little happiness for my children ?
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 12]: It wo n't , I tell you ; it wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 9]: I 'll struggle for that till I die !
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 11]: I will , till I die till I die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 29]: He rubbed his head now instead of his knees , and , shaking all over , he got up and began with uncertain steps to pace the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 8]: `` Hell , hell , hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 11]: `` I 've got to go through THAT again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 7]: `` Yes , you have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 6]: `` Till I die . ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 18]: `` Yes ; that 's what you been after all the time I was getting well . ''
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 16]: `` Yes , I have , and I 'll keep on till I die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 12]: `` A fine wife for a man , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 12]: `` Beggin ' a man to be a dirty dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 15]: To be a MAN -- and I 'll keep on till I die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 27]: Adams again fell back upon his last solace : he walked , half staggering , up and down the room , swearing in a rhythmic repetition .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 33]: His wife had repetitions of her own , and she kept at them in a voice that rose to a higher and higher pitch , like the sound of an old well-pump .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 5]: `` Till I die !
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 4]: Till I die !
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 5]: Till I DIE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 21]: She ended in a scream ; and Alice , coming up the stairs , thanked heaven that Russell had gone .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 11]: She ran to her father 's door and went in .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 16]: Adams looked at her , and gesticulated shakily at the convulsive figure on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 10]: `` Can you get her out of here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 20]: Alice helped Mrs. Adams to her feet ; and the stricken woman threw her arms passionately about her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 6]: `` Get her out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 12]: Adams said , harshly ; then cried , `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 21]: Alice , moving toward the door , halted , and looked at him blankly , over her mother 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 8]: `` What is it , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 10]: He stretched out his arm and pointed at her .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 15]: `` She says -- she says you have a mean life , Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 6]: `` No , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 9]: Mrs. Adams turned in her daughter 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 7]: `` Do you hear her lie ?
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 13]: Could n't you be as brave as she is , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 8]: `` Are you lying , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 9]: `` Do you have a mean time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 6]: `` No , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 5]: He came toward her .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 6]: `` Look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 15]: `` Things like this dance now -- is that so hard to bear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 18]: Alice tried to say , `` No , papa , '' again , but she could n't .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 11]: Suddenly and in spite of herself she began to cry .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: `` Do you hear her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 4]: his wife sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 12]: `` Now do you -- '' He waved at them fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 7]: `` Get out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 5]: `` Both of you !
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 6]: Get out of here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 24]: As they went , he dropped in his chair and bent far forward , so that his haggard face was concealed from them .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 25]: Then , as Alice closed the door , he began to rub his knees again , muttering , `` Oh , my , my !
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 7]: OH , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 49]: CHAPTER XIV There shone a jovial sun overhead on the appointed `` day after to-morrow '' ; a day not cool yet of a temperature friendly to walkers ; and the air , powdered with sunshine , had so much life in it that it seemed to sparkle .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 28]: To Arthur Russell this was a day like a gay companion who pleased him well ; but the gay companion at his side pleased him even better .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 20]: She looked her prettiest , chattered her wittiest , smiled her wistfulest , and delighted him with all together .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 23]: `` You look so happy it 's easy to see your father 's taken a good turn , '' he told her .
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 15]: `` Yes ; he has this afternoon , at least , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 13]: `` I might have other reasons for looking cheerful , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 5]: `` For instance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 4]: `` Exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 15]: she said , giving him a sweet look just enough mocked by her laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 5]: `` For instance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 10]: `` Well , go on , '' he begged .
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 7]: `` Is n't it expected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 8]: `` Of you , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 7]: `` No , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 8]: `` For you , I mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 62]: In this style , which uses a word for any meaning that quick look and colourful gesture care to endow it with , she was an expert ; and she carried it merrily on , leaving him at liberty -LRB- one of the great values of the style -RRB- to choose as he would how much or how little she meant .
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 42]: He was content to supply mere cues , for although he had little coquetry of his own , he had lately begun to find that the only interesting moments in his life were those during which Alice Adams coquetted with him .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 17]: Happily , these obliging moments extended themselves to cover all the time he spent with her .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 17]: However serious she might seem , whatever appeared to be her topic , all was thou-and-I .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 24]: He planned for more of it , seeing otherwise a dull evening ahead ; and reverted , afterwhile , to a forbidden subject .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 23]: `` About that dance at Miss Lamb 's -- since your father 's so much better -- '' She flushed a little .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 6]: `` Now , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 4]: she chided him .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 12]: `` We agreed not to say any more about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 15]: `` Yes , but since he IS better -- '' Alice shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 8]: `` He wo n't be better to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 21]: He always has a bad day after a good one especially after such a good one as this is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 30]: `` But if this time it should be different , '' Russell persisted ; `` would n't you be willing to come if he 's better by to-morrow evening ?
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 11]: Why not wait and decide at the last minute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 6]: She waved her hands airily .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 6]: `` What a pother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 18]: `` What does it matter whether poor little Alice Adams goes to a dance or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 24]: `` Well , I thought I 'd made it clear that it looks fairly bleak to me if you do n't go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 3]: she jeered .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 11]: `` It 's the simple truth , '' he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 34]: `` I do n't care a great deal about dances these days ; and if you are n't going to be there -- '' `` You could stay away , '' she suggested .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 6]: `` You would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 7]: `` Unfortunately , I ca n't .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 11]: I 'm afraid I 'm supposed to be the excuse .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 24]: Miss Lamb , in her capacity as a friend of my relatives -- '' `` Oh , she 's giving it for YOU !
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 3]: I see !
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 8]: On Mildred 's account you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 10]: At that his face showed an increase of colour .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 22]: `` I suppose just on account of my being a cousin of Mildred 's and of -- '' `` Of course !
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 9]: You 'll have a beautiful time , too .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 18]: Henrietta 'll see that you have somebody to dance with besides Miss Dowling , poor man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 15]: `` But what I want somebody to see is that I dance with you !
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 10]: And perhaps your father -- '' `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 41]: she said , frowning as if she debated whether or not to tell him something of import ; then , seeming to decide affirmatively , she asked : `` Would you really like to know the truth about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 9]: `` If it is n't too unflattering . ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 16]: `` It has n't anything to do with you at all , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 35]: `` Of course I 'd like to go with you and to dance with you -- though you do n't seem to realize that you would n't be permitted much time with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 13]: `` Oh , yes , I -- '' `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 7]: `` Of course you would n't .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 16]: But even if papa should be better to-morrow , I doubt if I 'd go .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 9]: In fact , I know I would n't .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 8]: There 's another reason besides papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 5]: `` Is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 13]: The truth is , I do n't get on with Henrietta Lamb .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 19]: As a matter of fact , I dislike her , and of course that means she dislikes me .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 25]: I should never think of asking her to anything I gave , and I really wonder she asks me to things SHE gives . ''
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 50]: This was a new inspiration ; and Alice , beginning to see her way out of a perplexity , wished that she had thought of it earlier : she should have told him from the first that she and Henrietta had a feud , and consequently exchanged no invitations .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 60]: Moreover , there was another thing to beset her with little anxieties : she might better not have told him from the first , as she had indeed told him by intimation , that she was the pampered daughter of an indulgent father , presumably able to indulge her ; for now she must elaborately keep to the part .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 42]: Veracity is usually simple ; and its opposite , to be successful , should be as simple ; but practitioners of the opposite are most often impulsive , like Alice ; and , like her , they become enmeshed in elaborations .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 30]: `` It would n't be very nice for me to go to her house , '' Alice went on , `` when I would n't want her in mine .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 6]: I 've never admired her .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 40]: I 've always thought she was lacking in some things most people are supposed to be equipped with -- for instance , a certain feeling about the death of a father who was always pretty decent to his daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 38]: Henrietta 's father died just , eleven months and twenty-seven days before your cousin 's dance , but she could n't stick out those few last days and make it a year ; she was there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 18]: Alice stopped , then laughed ruefully , exclaiming , `` But this is dreadful of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 15]: `` Blackguarding her to you when she 's giving a big party for you !
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 25]: Just the way Henrietta would blackguard me to you -- heaven knows what she WOULD N'T say if she talked about me to you !
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 20]: It would be fair , of course , but -- well , I 'd rather she did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 37]: And with that , Alice let her pretty hand , in its white glove , rest upon his arm for a moment ; and he looked down at it , not unmoved to see it there .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 27]: `` I want to be unfair about just this , '' she said , letting a troubled laughter tremble through her appealing voice as she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 16]: `` I wo n't take advantage of her with anybody , except just -- you !
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 32]: I 'd a little rather you did n't hear anybody blackguard me , and , if you do n't mind -- could you promise not to give Henrietta the chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 32]: It was charmingly done , with a humorous , faint pathos altogether genuine ; and Russell found himself suddenly wanting to shout at her , `` Oh , you DEAR ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 17]: Nothing else seemed adequate ; but he controlled the impulse in favour of something more conservative .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 14]: `` Imagine any one speaking unkindly of you -- not praising you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 9]: `` Who HAS praised me to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 5]: she asked , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 28]: `` I have n't talked about you with any one ; but if I did , I know they 'd -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 18]: she cried , and went on , again accompanying her words with little tremulous runs of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 9]: `` You do n't understand this town yet .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: You 'll be surprised when you do ; we 're different .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 7]: We talk about one another fearfully !
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 16]: Have n't I just proved it , the way I 've been going for Henrietta ?
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 32]: Of course I did n't say anything really very terrible about her , but that 's only because I do n't follow that practice the way most of the others do .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 25]: They do n't stop with the worst of the truth they can find : they make UP things -- yes , they really do !
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 20]: And , oh , I 'd RATHER they did n't make up things about me -- to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 11]: `` What difference would it make if they did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 5]: he inquired , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: `` I 'd know they were n't true . ''
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 18]: `` Even if you did know that , they 'd make a difference , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , they would !
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 53]: It 's too bad , but we do n't like anything quite so well that 's had specks on it , even if we 've wiped the specks off ; -- it 's just that much spoiled , and some things are all spoiled the instant they 're the least bit spoiled .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 11]: What a man thinks about a girl , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 16]: Do you want to have what you think about me spoiled , Mr. Russell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 17]: `` Oh , but that 's already far beyond reach , '' he said , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 8]: `` But it ca n't be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 7]: `` Because it never can be .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 32]: Men do n't change their minds about one another often : they make it quite an event when they do , and talk about it as if something important had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 26]: But a girl only has to go down-town with a shoe-string unfastened , and every man who sees her will change his mind about her .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 9]: Do n't you know that 's true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 9]: `` Not of myself , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 14]: `` That 's precisely what every man in the world would say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 9]: `` So you would n't trust me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 28]: `` Well -- I 'll be awfully worried if you give 'em a chance to tell you that I 'm too lazy to tie my shoe-strings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 4]: He laughed delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 9]: `` Is that what they do say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 4]: `` Just about !
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 8]: Whatever they hope will get results . ''
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 6]: She shook her head wisely .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes ; we do that here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 13]: `` But I do n't mind loose shoe-strings , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 8]: `` Not if they 're yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 11]: `` They 'll find out what you do mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 29]: `` But suppose , '' he said , looking at her whimsically ; `` suppose I would n't mind anything -- so long as it 's yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 3]: She courtesied .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 6]: `` Oh , pretty enough !
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 18]: But a girl who 's talked about has a weakness that 's often a fatal one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 15]: `` It 's this : when she 's talked about she is n't THERE .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 8]: That 's how they kill her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 11]: `` I 'm afraid I do n't follow you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 6]: `` Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 24]: If Henrietta -- or Mildred -- or any of 'em -- or some of their mothers -- oh , we ALL do it !
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 36]: Well , if any of 'em told you I did n't tie my shoe-strings , and if I were there , so that you could see me , you 'd know it was n't true .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 50]: Even if I were sitting so that you could n't see my feet , and could n't tell whether the strings were tied or not just then , still you could look at me , and see that I was n't the sort of girl to neglect my shoe-strings .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 34]: But that is n't the way it happens : they 'll get at you when I 'm nowhere around and ca n't remind you of the sort of girl I really am . ''
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 12]: `` But you do n't do that , '' he complained .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 21]: `` You do n't remind me you do n't even tell me -- the sort of girl you really are !
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 7]: I 'd like to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 17]: `` Let 's be serious then , '' she said , and looked serious enough herself .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 9]: `` Would you honestly like to know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 12]: `` Well , then , you must be careful . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 5]: ` Careful ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 5]: The word amused him .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 15]: `` I mean careful not to get me mixed up , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 25]: `` Careful not to mix up the girl you might hear somebody talking about with the me I honestly try to make you see .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 19]: If you do get those two mixed up -- well , the whole show 'll be spoiled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 8]: `` What makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 30]: `` Because it 's -- '' She checked herself , having begun to speak too impulsively ; and she was disturbed , realizing in what tricky stuff she dealt .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 18]: What had been on her lips to say was , `` Because it 's happened before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 25]: She changed to , `` Because it 's so easy to spoil anything -- easiest of all to spoil anything that 's pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 6]: `` That might depend . ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 7]: `` No ; it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 27]: And if you care at all about -- about knowing a girl who 'd like someone to know her -- '' `` Just ` someone ? '
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 5]: That 's disappointing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 9]: `` Well -- you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 16]: `` Tell me how ` careful ' you want me to be , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 38]: `` Well , do n't you think it would be nice if you did n't give anybody the chance to talk about me the way -- the way I 've just been talking about Henrietta Lamb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 28]: With that they laughed together , and he said , `` You may be cutting me off from a great deal of information , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' Alice admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 31]: `` Somebody might begin to praise me to you , too ; so it 's dangerous to ask you to change the subject if I ever happen to be mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 9]: But after all -- '' She paused . ''
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 16]: ` After all ' is n't the end of a thought , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 24]: `` Sometimes it is of a girl 's thought ; I suppose men are neater about their thoughts , and always finish 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 15]: It is n't the end of the thought I had then , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 9]: `` What is the end of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 6]: She looked at him impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 23]: `` Oh , it 's foolish , '' she said , and she laughed as laughs one who proposes something probably impossible .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 27]: `` But , WOULD N'T it be pleasant if two people could ever just keep themselves TO themselves , so far as they two were concerned ?
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 25]: I mean , if they could just manage to be friends without people talking about it , or talking to THEM about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 21]: `` I suppose that might be rather difficult , '' he said , more amused than impressed by her idea .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 17]: `` I do n't know : it might be done , '' she returned , hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 22]: `` Especially in a town of this size ; it 's grown so it 's quite a huge place these days .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 15]: People can keep themselves to themselves in a big place better , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 17]: For instance , nobody knows that you and I are taking a walk together today . ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 12]: `` How absurd , when here we are on exhibition ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 8]: `` No ; we are n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 6]: `` We are n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 8]: `` Not a bit of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 40]: `` We were the other day , when you walked home with me , but anybody could tell that had just happened by chance , on account of your overtaking me ; people can always see things like that .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 8]: But we 're not on exhibition now .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 8]: Look where I 've led you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 50]: Amused and a little bewildered , he looked up and down the street , which was one of gaunt-faced apartment-houses , old , sooty , frame boarding-houses , small groceries and drug-stores , laundries and one-room plumbers ' shops , with the sign of a clairvoyant here and there .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 5]: `` You see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 11]: `` I 've been leading you without your knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 26]: Of course that 's because you 're new to the town , and you give yourself up to the guidance of an old citizen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 10]: `` I 'm not so sure , Miss Adams .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 19]: It might mean that I do n't care where I follow so long as I follow you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 8]: `` Very well , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 33]: `` I 'd like you to keep on following me at least long enough for me to show you that there 's something nicer ahead of us than this dingy street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 6]: `` Is that figurative ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 5]: `` Might be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 5]: she returned , gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 37]: `` There 's a pretty little park at the end , but it 's very proletarian , and nobody you and I know will be more likely to see us there than on this street . ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 8]: `` What an imagination you have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 13]: `` You turn our proper little walk into a Parisian adventure . ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 14]: She looked at him in what seemed to be a momentary grave puzzlement .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 17]: `` Perhaps you feel that a Parisian adventure might n't please your -- your relatives ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 9]: `` Why , no , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 13]: `` You seem to think of them oftener than I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 17]: This appeared to amuse Alice , or at least to please her , for she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 14]: `` Then I can afford to quit thinking of them , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 18]: It 's only that I used to be quite a friend of Mildred 's -- but there !
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 8]: we need n't to go into that .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 31]: I 've never been a friend of Henrietta Lamb 's , though , and I almost wish she were n't taking such pains to be a friend of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 8]: `` Oh , but she 's not .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 23]: It 's all on account of -- '' `` On Mildred 's account , '' Alice finished this for him , coolly .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 7]: `` Yes , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 22]: `` It 's on account of the two families , '' he was at pains to explain , a little awkwardly .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 26]: `` It 's because I 'm a relative of the Palmers , and the Palmers and the Lambs seem to be old family friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 12]: `` Something the Adamses certainly are not , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 14]: `` Not with either of 'em ; particularly not with the Lambs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 19]: And here , scarce aware of what impelled her , she returned to her former elaborations and colourings .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 28]: `` You see , the differences between Henrietta and me are n't entirely personal : I could n't go to her house even if I liked her .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 26]: The Lambs and Adamses do n't get on with each other , and we 've just about come to the breaking-point as it happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 11]: `` I hope it 's nothing to bother you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 8]: A lot of things bother me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 18]: `` I 'm sorry they do , '' he said , and seemed simply to mean it .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 4]: She nodded gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 10]: `` That 's nice of you , Mr. Russell .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 3]: It helps .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 14]: The break between the Adamses and the Lambs is a pretty bothersome thing .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 10]: It 's been coming on a long time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 38]: She sighed deeply , and the sigh was half genuine ; this half being for her father , but the other half probably belonged to her instinctive rendering of Juliet Capulet , daughter to a warring house .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 8]: `` I hate it all so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 3]: she added .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 7]: `` Of course you must . ''
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 17]: `` I suppose most quarrels between families are on account of business , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 9]: `` That 's why they 're so sordid .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 18]: Certainly the Lambs seem a sordid lot to me , though of course I 'm biased . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 23]: And with that she began to sketch a history of the commercial antagonism that had risen between the Adamses and the Lambs .
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: The sketching was spontaneous and dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 25]: Mathematics had no part in it ; nor was there accurate definition of Mr. Adams 's relation to the institution of Lamb and Company .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 31]: The point was clouded , in fact ; though that might easily be set down to the general haziness of young ladies confronted with the mysteries of trade or commerce .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 62]: Mr. Adams either had been a vague sort of junior member of the firm , it appeared , or else he should have been made some such thing ; at all events , he was an old mainstay of the business ; and he , as much as any Lamb , had helped to build up the prosperity of the company .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 38]: But at last , tired of providing so much intelligence and energy for which other people took profit greater than his own , he had decided to leave the company and found a business entirely for himself .
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 14]: The Lambs were going to be enraged when they learned what was afoot .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 16]: Such was the impression , a little misted , wrought by Alice 's quick narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 12]: But there was dolorous fact behind it : Adams had succumbed .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 30]: His wife , grave and nervous , rather than triumphant , in success , had told their daughter that the great J. A. would be furious and possibly vindictive .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 9]: Adams was afraid of him , she said .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 8]: `` But what for , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 14]: Alice asked , since this seemed a turn of affairs out of reason .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 22]: `` What in the world has Mr. Lamb to do with papa 's leaving the company to set up for himself ?
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 10]: What right has he to be angry about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 31]: If he 's such a friend as he claims to be , I should think he 'd be glad -- that is , if the glue factory turns out well .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 8]: What will he be angry for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 36]: Mrs. Adams gave Alice an uneasy glance , hesitated , and then explained that a resignation from Lamb 's had always been looked upon , especially by `` that old man , '' as treachery .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 25]: You were supposed to die in the service , she said bitterly , and her daughter , a little mystified , accepted this explanation .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 26]: Adams had not spoken to her of his surrender ; he seemed not inclined to speak to her at all , or to any one .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 23]: Alice was not serious too long , and she began to laugh as she came to the end of her decorative sketch .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 15]: `` After all , the whole thing is perfectly ridiculous , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 8]: `` In fact , it 's FUNNY !
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 17]: That 's on account of what papa 's going to throw over the Lamb business FOR !
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 16]: To save your life you could n't imagine what he 's going to do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 12]: `` I wo n't try , then , '' Russell assented .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 14]: `` It takes all the romance out of ME , '' she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 25]: `` You 'll never go for a Parisian walk with me again , after I tell you what I 'll be heiress to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 31]: They had come to the entrance of the little park ; and , as Alice had said , it was a pretty place , especially on a day so radiant .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 51]: Trees of the oldest forest stood there , hale and serene over the trim , bright grass ; and the proletarians had not come from their factories at this hour ; only a few mothers and their babies were to be seen , here and there , in the shade .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 33]: `` I think I 'll postpone telling you about it till we get nearly home again , '' Alice said , as they began to saunter down one of the gravelled paths .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 37]: `` There 's a bench beside a spring farther on ; we can sit there and talk about a lot of things -- things not so sticky as my dowry 's going to be . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 5]: ` Sticky ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 3]: he echoed .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 11]: `` What in the world -- '' She laughed despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 6]: `` A glue factory ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 35]: Then he laughed , too , as much from friendliness as from amusement ; and she remembered to tell him that the project of a glue factory was still `` an Adams secret . ''
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 29]: It would be known soon , however , she added ; and the whole Lamb connection would probably begin saying all sorts of things , heaven knew what !
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 39]: Thus Alice built her walls of flimsy , working always gaily , or with at least the air of gaiety ; and even as she rattled on , there was somewhere in her mind a constant little wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 15]: Everything she said seemed to be necessary to support something else she had said .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 5]: How had it happened ?
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 76]: She found herself telling him that since her father had decided on making so great a change in his ways , she and her mother hoped at last to persuade him to give up that `` foolish little house '' he had been so obstinate about ; and she checked herself abruptly on this declivity just as she was about to slide into a remark concerning her own preference for a `` country place . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 28]: Discretion caught her in time ; and something else , in company with discretion , caught her , for she stopped short in her talk and blushed .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 58]: They had taken possession of the bench beside the spring , by this time ; and Russell , his elbow on the back of the bench and his chin on his hand , the better to look at her , had no guess at the cause of the blush , but was content to find it lovely .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 40]: At his first sight of Alice she had seemed pretty in the particular way of being pretty that he happened to like best ; and , with every moment he spent with her , this prettiness appeared to increase .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 37]: He felt that he could not look at her enough : his gaze followed the fluttering of the graceful hands in almost continual gesture as she talked ; then lifted happily to the vivacious face again .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 4]: She charmed him .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 21]: After her abrupt pause , she sighed , then looked at him with her eyebrows lifted in a comedy appeal .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 32]: `` You have n't said you would n't give Henrietta the chance , '' she said , in the softest voice that can still have a little laugh running in it .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 4]: He was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 7]: `` Give Henrietta the chance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 4]: `` YOU know !
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 13]: You 'll let me keep on being unfair , wo n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 12]: Not give the other girls a chance to get even ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 5]: He promised , heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 49]: CHAPTER XV Alice had said that no one who knew either Russell or herself would be likely to see them in the park or upon the dingy street ; but although they returned by that same ungenteel thoroughfare they were seen by a person who knew them both .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 25]: Also , with some surprise on the part of Russell , and something more poignant than surprise for Alice , they saw this person .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 19]: All of the dingy street was ugly , but the greater part of it appeared to be honest .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 37]: The two pedestrians came upon a block or two , however , where it offered suggestions of a less upright character , like a steady enough workingman with a naughty book sticking out of his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 46]: Three or four dim shops , a single story in height , exhibited foul signboards , yet fair enough so far as the wording went ; one proclaiming a tobacconist , one a junk-dealer , one a dispenser of `` soft drinks and cigars . ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 68]: The most credulous would have doubted these signboards ; for the craft of the modern tradesman is exerted to lure indoors the passing glance , since if the glance is pleased the feet may follow ; but this alleged tobacconist and his neighbours had long been fond of dust on their windows , evidently , and shades were pulled far down on the glass of their doors .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 25]: Thus the public eye , small of pupil in the light of the open street , was intentionally not invited to the dusky interiors .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 67]: Something different from mere lack of enterprise was apparent ; and the signboards might have been omitted ; they were pains thrown away , since it was plain to the world that the business parts of these shops were the brighter back rooms implied by the dark front rooms ; and that the commerce there was in perilous new liquors and in dice and rough girls .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 49]: Nothing could have been more innocent than the serenity with which these wicked little places revealed themselves for what they were ; and , bound by this final tie of guilelessness , they stood together in a row which ended with a companionable barbershop , much like them .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 30]: Beyond was a series of soot-harried frame two-story houses , once part of a cheerful neighbourhood when the town was middle-aged and settled , and not old and growing .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 8]: These houses , all carrying the label .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 54]: `` Rooms , '' had the worried look of vacancy that houses have when they are too full of everybody without being anybody 's home ; and there was , too , a surreptitious air about them , as if , like the false little shops , they advertised something by concealing it .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 81]: One of them -- the one next to the barber-shop -- had across its front an ample , jig-sawed veranda , where aforetime , no doubt , the father of a family had fanned himself with a palm-leaf fan on Sunday afternoons , watching the surreys go by , and where his daughter listened to mandolins and badinage on starlit evenings ; but , although youth still held the veranda , both the youth and the veranda were in decay .
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 20]: The four or five young men who lounged there this afternoon were of a type known to shady pool-parlours .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 39]: Hats found no favour with them ; all of them wore caps ; and their tight clothes , apparently from a common source , showed a vivacious fancy for oblique pockets , false belts , and Easter-egg colourings .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 32]: Another thing common to the group was the expression of eye and mouth ; and Alice , in the midst of her other thoughts , had a distasteful thought about this .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 51]: The veranda was within a dozen feet of the sidewalk , and as she and her escort came nearer , she took note of the young men , her face hardening a little , even before she suspected there might be a resemblance between them and any one she knew .
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 47]: Then she observed that each of these loungers wore not for the occasion , but as of habit , a look of furtively amused contempt ; the mouth smiled to one side as if not to dislodge a cigarette , while the eyes kept languidly superior .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 42]: All at once Alice was reminded of Walter ; and the slight frown caused by this idea had just begun to darken her forehead when Walter himself stepped out of the open door of the house and appeared upon the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 38]: Upon his head was a new straw hat , and in his hand was a Malacca stick with an ivory top , for Alice had finally decided against it for herself and had given it to him .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 22]: His mood was lively : he twirled the stick through his fingers like a drum-major 's baton , and whistled loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 7]: Moreover , he was indeed accompanied .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 61]: With him was a thin girl who had made a violent black-and-white poster of herself : black dress , black flimsy boa , black stockings , white slippers , great black hat down upon the black eyes ; and beneath the hat a curve of cheek and chin made white as whitewash , and in strong bilateral motion with gum .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 46]: The loungers on the veranda were familiars of the pair ; hailed them with cacklings ; and one began to sing , in a voice all tin : `` Then my skirt , Sal , and me did go Right straight to the moving-pitcher show .
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 7]: OH , you bashful vamp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 5]: The girl laughed airily .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 10]: `` God , but you guys are wise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 7]: `` Come on , Wallie . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 23]: Walter stared at his sister ; then grinned faintly , and nodded at Russell as the latter lifted his hat in salutation .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 45]: Alice uttered an incoherent syllable of exclamation , and , as she began to walk faster , she bit her lip hard , not in order to look wistful , this time , but to help her keep tears of anger from her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 4]: Russell laughed cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 20]: `` Your brother certainly seems to have found the place for ` colour ' today , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 12]: `` That girl 's talk must be full of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 23]: But Alice had forgotten the colour she herself had used in accounting for Walter 's peculiarities , and she did not understand .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 5]: she said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 10]: `` Do n't you remember telling me about him ?
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 24]: How he was going to write , probably , and would go anywhere to pick up types and get them to talk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 22]: She kept her eyes ahead , and said sharply , `` I think his literary tastes scarcely cover this case ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 7]: `` Do n't be too sure .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 8]: He did n't look at all disconcerted .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 11]: He did n't seem to mind your seeing him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 12]: `` That 's all the worse , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 12]: `` Why , no , '' her friend said , genially .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 18]: `` It means he did n't consider that he was engaged in anything out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 25]: You ca n't expect to understand everything boys do at his age ; they do all sorts of queer things , and outgrow them .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 34]: Your brother evidently has a taste for queer people , and very likely he 's been at least half sincere when he 's made you believe he had a literary motive behind it .
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 16]: We all go through -- '' `` Thanks , Mr. Russell , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 10]: `` Let 's do n't say any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 47]: He looked at her flushed face and enlarged eyes ; and he liked her all the better for her indignation : this was how good sisters ought to feel , he thought , failing to understand that most of what she felt was not about Walter .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 7]: He ventured only a word more .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 18]: `` Try not to mind it so much ; it really does n't amount to anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 27]: She shook her head , and they went on in silence ; she did not look at him again until they stopped before her own house .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 15]: Then she gave him only one glimpse of her eyes before she looked down .
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 10]: `` It 's spoiled , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 8]: she said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 8]: `` What 's ` spoiled ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 8]: `` Our walk -- well , everything .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 8]: Somehow it always -- is . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 7]: ` Always is ' what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 7]: `` Spoiled , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 48]: He laughed at that ; but without looking at him she suddenly offered him her hand , and , as he took it , he felt a hurried , violent pressure upon his fingers , as if she meant to thank him almost passionately for being kind .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 11]: She was gone before he could speak to her again .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 38]: In her room , with the door locked , she did not go to her mirror , but to her bed , flinging herself face down , not caring how far the pillows put her hat awry .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 31]: Sheer grief had followed her anger ; grief for the calamitous end of her bright afternoon , grief for the `` end of everything , '' as she thought then .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 23]: Nevertheless , she gradually grew more composed , and , when her mother tapped on the door presently , let her in .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 9]: Mrs. Adams looked at her with quick apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 6]: `` Oh , poor child !
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 9]: Was n't he -- '' Alice told her .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 23]: `` You see how it -- how it made me look , mama , '' she quavered , having concluded her narrative .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 37]: `` I 'd tried to cover up Walter 's awfulness at the dance with that story about his being ` literary , ' but no story was big enough to cover this up -- and oh !
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 13]: it must make him think I tell stories about other things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 8]: `` No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams protested .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 6]: `` Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 31]: At the worst , all HE could think is that Walter told stories to you about why he likes to be with such dreadful people , and you believed them .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 13]: That 's all HE 'D think ; do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 11]: Alice 's wet eyes began to show a little hopefulness .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 13]: `` You honestly think it might be that way , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 19]: `` Why , from what you 've told me he said , I KNOW it 's that way .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 11]: Did n't he say he wanted to come again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 9]: `` N-no , '' Alice said , uncertainly .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 7]: `` But I think he will .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 9]: At least I begin to think so now .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 6]: He -- '' She stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 24]: `` From all you tell me , he seems to be a very desirable young man , '' Mrs. Adams said , primly .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 17]: Her daughter was silent for several moments ; then new tears gathered upon her downcast lashes .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 8]: `` He 's just -- dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 3]: she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 15]: `` He 's told you he is n't engaged , has n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 7]: But I know he is n't .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 19]: Maybe when he first came here he was near it , but I know he 's not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 15]: `` I guess Mildred Palmer would LIKE him to be , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 27]: Mrs. Adams was frank enough to say , rather triumphantly ; and Alice , with a lowered head , murmured : `` Anybody -- would . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 7]: The words were all but inaudible .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 18]: `` Do n't you worry , '' her mother said , and patted her on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 15]: `` Everything will come out all right ; do n't you fear , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 18]: Ca n't you see that beside any other girl in town you 're just a perfect QUEEN ?
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 33]: Do you think any young man that was n't prejudiced , or something , would need more than just one look to -- '' But Alice moved away from the caressing hand .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 6]: `` Never mind , mama .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 9]: I wonder he looks at me at all .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 22]: And if he does again , after seeing my brother with those horrible people -- '' `` Now , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams interrupted , expostulating mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 16]: `` I 'm sure Walter 's a GOOD boy -- '' `` You are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 8]: Alice cried , with a sudden vigour .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 5]: `` You ARE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 22]: `` I 'm sure he 's GOOD , yes -- and if he is n't , it 's not his fault .
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 5]: It 's mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 5]: `` What nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 12]: `` No , it 's true , '' Mrs. Adams lamented .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 28]: `` I tried to bring him up to be good , God knows ; and when he was little he was the best boy I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 40]: When he came from Sunday-school he 'd always run to me and we 'd go over the lesson together ; and he let me come in his room at night to hear his prayers almost until he was sixteen .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 15]: Most boys wo n't do that with their mothers -- not nearly that long .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 22]: I tried so hard to bring him up right -- but if anything 's gone wrong it 's my fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 6]: `` How could it be ?
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 23]: You 've just said -- '' `` It 's because I did n't make your father this -- this new step earlier .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 20]: Then Walter might have had all the advantages that other -- '' `` Oh , mama , PLEASE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 4]: Alice begged her .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 11]: `` Let 's do n't go over all that again .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 15]: Is n't it more important to think what 's to be done about him ?
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 16]: Is he going to be allowed to go on disgracing us as he does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams sighed profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 15]: `` I do n't know what to do , '' she confessed , unhappily .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 33]: `` Your father 's so upset about -- about this new step he 's taking -- I do n't feel as if we ought to -- '' `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 3]: Alice cried .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 15]: `` Papa must n't be distressed with this , on top of everything else .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: But SOMETHING 'S got to be done about Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 6]: `` What can be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 6]: her mother asked , helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 6]: `` What can be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 8]: Alice admitted that she did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 79]: At dinner , an hour later , Walter 's habitually veiled glance lifted , now and then , to touch her furtively ; -- he was waiting , as he would have said , for her to `` spring it '' ; and he had prepared a brief and sincere defense to the effect that he made his own living , and would like to inquire whose business it was to offer intrusive comment upon his private conduct .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 16]: But she said nothing , while his father and mother were as silent as she .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 39]: Walter concluded that there was to be no attack , but changed his mind when his father , who ate only a little , and broodingly at that , rose to leave the table and spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 22]: `` Walter , '' he said , `` when you 've finished I wish you 'd come up to my room .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 11]: I got something I want to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 16]: Walter shot a hard look at his apathetic sister , then turned to his father .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 9]: `` Make it to-morrow , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 14]: `` This is Satad ' y night and I got a date . ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 9]: `` No , '' Adams said , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 9]: `` You come up before you go out .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 5]: It 's important . ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 17]: `` All right ; I 've had all I want to eat , '' Walter returned .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 7]: `` I got a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 5]: Make it quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 29]: He followed his father upstairs , and when they were in the room together Adams shut the door , sat down , and began to rub his knees .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 4]: `` Rheumatism ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 6]: the boy inquired , slyly .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 12]: `` That what you want to talk to me about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 23]: But Adams did not go on ; he seemed to be in difficulties for words , and Walter decided to help him .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 11]: `` Hop ahead and spring it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 18]: `` Get it off your mind : I 'll tell the world _ I _ should worry !
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 15]: You are n't goin ' to bother ME any , so why bother yourself ?
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 26]: Alice hopped home and told you she saw me playin ' around with some pretty gay-lookin ' berries and you -- '' `` Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 7]: his father said , obviously surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 8]: `` It 's nothing about Alice . ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 19]: `` Did n't she tell you -- '' `` I have n't talked with her all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 10]: `` Oh , I see , '' Walter said .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 10]: `` She told mother and mother told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 11]: `` No , neither of 'em have told me anything .
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 7]: What was there to tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 3]: Walter laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 12]: `` Oh , it 's nothin ' , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 46]: `` I was just startin ' out to buy a girl friend o ' mine a rhinestone buckle I lost to her on a bet , this afternoon , and Alice came along with that big Russell fish ; and I thought she looked sore .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 17]: She expects me to like the kind she likes , and I do n't like 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 16]: I thought she 'd prob ` ly got you all stirred up about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 12]: `` No , no , '' his father said , peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 20]: `` I do n't know anything about it , and I do n't care to know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 11]: I want to talk to you about something important . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 23]: Then , as he was again silent , Walter said , `` Well , TALK about it ; I 'm listening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 11]: `` It 's this , '' Adams began , heavily .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 11]: `` It 's about me going into this glue business .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 11]: Your mother 's told you , has n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 19]: `` She said you were goin ' to leave the old place down-town and start a glue factory .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 19]: That 's all I know about it ; I got my own affairs to ` tend to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 15]: `` Well , this is your affair , '' his father said , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 11]: `` You ca n't stay with Lamb and Company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 6]: Walter looked a little startled .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 9]: `` What you mean , I ca n't ?
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 30]: `` You 've got to help me , '' Adams explained slowly ; and he frowned more deeply , as if the interview were growing increasingly laborious for him .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 18]: `` It 's going to be a big pull to get this business on its feet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 7]: Walter exclaimed with a sharp skepticism .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 8]: `` I should say it was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 7]: He stared at his father incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 22]: `` Look here ; are n't you just a little bit sudden , the way you 're goin ' about things ?
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 15]: You 've let mother shove you a little too fast , have n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 18]: Do you know anything about what it means to set up a new business these days ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 13]: `` Yes , I know all about it , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 9]: `` About this business , I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 6]: `` How do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 10]: `` Because I made a long study of it .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 35]: I 'm not afraid of going about it the wrong way ; but it 's a hard job and you 'll have to put in all whatever sense and strength you 've got . ''
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 18]: Walter began to breathe quickly , and his lips were agitated ; then he set them obstinately .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 10]: `` Oh ; I will , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 20]: `` Yes , you will , '' Adams returned , not noticing that his son 's inflection was satiric .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 45]: `` It 's going to take every bit of energy in your body , and all the energy I got left in mine , and every cent of the little I 've saved , besides something I 'll have to raise on this house .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 29]: I 'm going right at it , now I 've got to ; and you 'll have to quit Lamb 's by the end of next week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 7]: `` Oh , I will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 14]: Walter 's voice grew louder , and there was a shrillness in it .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 17]: `` I got to quit Lamb 's the end of next week , have I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 6]: He stepped forward , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 4]: `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 14]: `` I 'm not walkin ' out o ' Lamb 's , see ?
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 16]: I 'm not quittin ' down there : I stay with 'em , see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 8]: Adams looked up at him , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 12]: `` You 'll leave there next Saturday , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 9]: `` I 've got to have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 17]: `` You do n't anything o ' the kind , '' Walter told him , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 10]: `` Do you expect to pay me anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 14]: `` I 'd pay you about what you been getting down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 16]: `` Then pay somebody else ; _ I _ do n't know anything about glue .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 6]: You get somebody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 15]: You 've got to -- '' Walter cut him off with the utmost vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 11]: `` Do n't tell me what I got to do !
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 14]: I know what I got to do better 'n you , I guess !
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 9]: I stay at Lamb 's , see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 4]: Adams rose angrily .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 9]: `` You 'll do what I tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 8]: You ca n't stay down there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 7]: `` Why ca n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 9]: `` Because I wo n't let you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 16]: Keep on not lettin ' me : I 'll be there just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 10]: At that his father broke into a sour laughter .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 9]: `` THEY wo n't let you , Walter !
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 16]: They wo n't have you down there after they find out I 'm going . ''
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 6]: `` Why wo n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 23]: You do n't think they 're goin ' to be all shot to pieces over losin ' YOU , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 18]: `` I tell you they wo n't let you stay , '' his father insisted , loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 14]: `` Why , what do they care whether you go or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 13]: `` They 'll care enough to fire YOU , my boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 11]: `` Look here , then ; show me why . ''
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 7]: `` They 'll do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 32]: `` Yes , '' Walter jeered ; `` you keep sayin ' they will , but when I ask you to show me why , you keep sayin ' they will !
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 13]: That makes little headway with ME , I can tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 15]: Adams groaned , and , rubbing his head , began to pace the floor .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 44]: Walter 's refusal was something he had not anticipated ; and he felt the weakness of his own attempt to meet it : he seemed powerless to do anything but utter angry words , which , as Walter said , made little headway .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 8]: `` Oh , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 11]: he muttered , `` OH , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 22]: Walter , usually sallow , had grown pale : he watched his father narrowly , and now took a sudden resolution .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 8]: `` Look here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 31]: `` When you say Lamb 's is likely to fire me because you 're goin ' to quit , you talk like the people that have to be locked up .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 23]: I do n't know where you get such things in your head ; Lamb and Company wo n't know you 're gone .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 12]: Listen : I can stay there long as I want to .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 30]: But I 'll tell you what I 'll do : make it worth my while and I 'll hook up with your old glue factory , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 12]: Adams stopped his pacing abruptly , and stared at him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 8]: ` Make it worth your while ? '
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 5]: What you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 17]: `` I got a good use for three hundred dollars right now , '' Walter said .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 16]: `` Let me have it and I 'll quit Lamb 's to work for you .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 14]: Do n't let me have it and I SWEAR I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 6]: `` Are you crazy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 11]: `` Is everybody crazy that needs three hundred dollars ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 32]: `` They are if they ask ME for it , when I got to stretch every cent I can lay my hands on to make it look like a dollar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 8]: `` You wo n't do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 6]: Adams burst out at him .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 5]: `` You little fool !
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 44]: If I had three hundred dollars to throw away , besides the pay I expected to give you , have n't you got sense enough to see I could hire a man worth three hundred dollars more to me than you 'd be ?
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 17]: It 's a FINE time to ask me for three hundred dollars , is n't it !
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 3]: What FOR ?
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 12]: Rhinestone buckles to throw around on your ` girl friends ? '
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 4]: Shame on you !
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 14]: Ask me to BRIBE you to help yourself and your own family ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 13]: `` I 'll give you a last chance , '' Walter said .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 17]: `` Either you do what I want , or I wo n't do what you want .
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 17]: Do n't ask me again after this , because -- '' Adams interrupted him fiercely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 6]: ` Ask you again ! '
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 9]: Do n't worry about that , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 14]: All I ask you is to get out o ' my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 19]: `` Look here , '' Walter said , quietly ; and his lopsided smile distorted his livid cheek .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 23]: `` Look here : I expect YOU would n't give me three hundred dollars to save my life , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 14]: `` You make me sick , '' Adams said , in his bitterness .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 7]: `` Get out of here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 19]: Walter went out , whistling ; and Adams drooped into his old chair again as the door closed .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 8]: `` OH , my , my ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 3]: he groaned .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 7]: `` Oh , Lordy , Lordy !
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 45]: The way of the transgressor -- '' CHAPTER XVI He meant his own transgression and his own way ; for Walter 's stubborn refusal appeared to Adams just then as one of the inexplicable but righteous besettings he must encounter in following that way .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 8]: `` Oh , Lordy , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 16]: he groaned , and then , as resentment moved him -- `` That dang boy !
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 23]: Dang idiot '' Yet he knew himself for a greater idiot because he had not been able to tell Walter the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 39]: He could not bring himself to do it , nor even to state his case in its best terms ; and that was because he felt that even in its best terms the case was a bad one .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 30]: Of all his regrets the greatest was that in a moment of vanity and tenderness , twenty-five years ago , he had told his young wife a business secret .
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 32]: He had wanted to show how important her husband was becoming , and how much the head of the universe , J. A. Lamb , trusted to his integrity and ability .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 31]: The great man had an idea : he thought of `` branching out a little , '' he told Adams confidentially , and there were possibilities of profit in glue .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 17]: What he wanted was a liquid glue to be put into little bottles and sold cheaply .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 40]: `` The kind of thing that sells itself , '' he said ; `` the kind of thing that pays its own small way as it goes along , until it has profits enough to begin advertising it right .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 20]: Everybody has to use glue , and if I make mine convenient and cheap , everybody 'll buy mine .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 48]: But it 's got to be glue that 'll STICK ; it 's got to be the best ; and if we find how to make it we 've got to keep it a big secret , of course , or anybody can steal it from us .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 53]: There was a man here last month ; he knew a formula he wanted to sell me , ` sight unseen ' ; but he was in such a hurry I got suspicious , and I found he 'd managed to steal it , working for the big packers in their glue-works .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 13]: We 've got to find a better glue than that , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 11]: I 'm going to set you and Campbell at it .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 29]: You 're a practical , wide-awake young feller , and Campbell 's a mighty good chemist ; I guess you two boys ought to make something happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 6]: His guess was shrewd enough .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 37]: Working in a shed a little way outside the town , where their cheery employer visited them sometimes to study their malodorous stews , the two young men found what Lamb had set them to find .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 8]: But Campbell was thoughtful over the discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 8]: `` Look here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 11]: `` Why ai n't this just about yours and mine ?
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 27]: After all , it may be Lamb 's money that 's paid for the stuff we 've used , but it has n't cost much . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 17]: `` But he pays US , '' Adams remonstrated , horrified by his companion 's idea .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 8]: `` He paid us to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 7]: It belongs absolutely to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 16]: `` Oh , I know he THINKS it does , '' Campbell admitted , plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 12]: `` I suppose we 've got to let him take it .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 47]: It 's not patentable , and he 'll have to do pretty well by us when he starts his factory , because he 's got to depend on us to run the making of the stuff so that the workmen ca n't get onto the process .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 19]: You better ask him the same salary I do , and mine 's going to be high . ''
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 13]: But the high salary , thus pleasantly imagined , was never paid .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 62]: Campbell died of typhoid fever , that summer , leaving Adams and his employer the only possessors of the formula , an unwritten one ; and Adams , pleased to think himself more important to the great man than ever , told his wife that there could be little doubt of his being put in sole charge of the prospective glue-works .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 7]: Unfortunately , the enterprise remained prospective .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 17]: Its projector had already become `` inveigled into another side-line , '' as he told Adams .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 54]: One of his sons had persuaded him to take up a `` cough-lozenge , '' to be called the `` Jalamb Balm Trochee '' ; and the lozenge did well enough to amuse Mr. Lamb and occupy his spare time , which was really about all he had asked of the glue project .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 44]: He had `` all the MONEY anybody ought to want , '' he said , when Adams urged him ; and he could `` start up this little glue side-line '' at any time ; the formula was safe in their two heads .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 39]: At intervals Adams would seek opportunity to speak of `` the little glue side-line '' to his patron , and to suggest that the years were passing ; but Lamb , petting other hobbies , had lost interest .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 13]: `` Oh , I 'll start it up some day , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 28]: If I do n't , I may turn it over to my heirs : it 's always an asset , worth something or other , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 52]: We 'll probably take it up some day , though , you and I. '' The sun persistently declined to rise on that day , and , as time went on , Adams saw that his rather timid urgings bored his employer , and he ceased to bring up the subject .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 20]: Lamb apparently forgot all about glue , but Adams discovered that unfortunately there was someone else who remembered it .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 33]: `` It 's really YOURS , '' she argued , that painful day when for the first time she suggested his using his knowledge for the benefit of himself and his family .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 30]: `` Mr. Campbell might have had a right to part of it , but he died and did n't leave any kin , so it belongs to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 16]: `` Suppose J. A. Lamb hired me to saw some wood , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 9]: `` Would the sticks belong to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 19]: `` He has n't got any right to take your invention and bury it , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 16]: `` What good is it doing him if he does n't DO anything with it ?
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 7]: What good is it doing ANYBODY ?
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 5]: None in the world !
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 21]: And what harm would it do him if you went ahead and did this for yourself and for your children ?
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 5]: None in the world !
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 22]: And what could he do to you if he WAS old pig enough to get angry with you for doing it ?
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 18]: He could n't do a single thing , and you 've admitted he could n't , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 23]: So what 's your reason for depriving your children and your wife of the benefits you know you could give 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 18]: `` Nothing but decency , '' he answered ; and she had her reply ready for that .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 42]: It seemed to him that , strive as he would , he could not reach her mind with even the plainest language ; while everything that she said to him , with such vehemence , sounded like so much obstinate gibberish .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 25]: Over and over he pressed her with the same illustration , on the point of ownership , though he thought he was varying it .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 18]: `` Suppose he hired me to build him a house : would that be MY house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 12]: `` He did n't hire you to build him a house .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 41]: You and Campbell invented -- '' `` Look here : suppose you give a cook a soup-bone and some vegetables , and pay her to make you a soup : has she got a right to take and sell it ?
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 5]: You know better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 27]: `` I know ONE thing : if that old man tried to keep your own invention from you he 's no better than a robber ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 39]: They never found any point of contact in all their passionate discussions of this ethical question ; and the question was no more settled between them , now that Adams had succumbed , than it had ever been .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 30]: But at least the wrangling about it was over : they were grave together , almost silent , and an uneasiness prevailed with her as much as with him .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 54]: He had already been out of the house , to walk about the small green yard ; and on Monday afternoon he sent for a taxicab and went down-town , but kept a long way from the `` wholesale section , '' where stood the formidable old oblong pile of Lamb and Company .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 59]: He arranged for the sale of the bonds he had laid away , and for placing a mortgage upon his house ; and on his way home , after five o'clock , he went to see an old friend , a man whose term of service with Lamb and Company was even a little longer than his own .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 41]: This veteran , returned from the day 's work , was sitting in front of the apartment house where he lived , but when the cab stopped at the curb he rose and came forward , offering a jocular greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 8]: `` Well , well , Virgil Adams !
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 11]: I always thought you had a sporty streak in you .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 12]: Travel in your own hired private automobile nowadays , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 16]: Pamperin ' yourself because you 're still layin ' off sick , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 24]: `` Oh , I 'm well enough again , Charley Lohr , '' Adams said , as he got out and shook hands .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 26]: Then , telling the driver to wait , he took his friend 's arm , walked to the bench with him , and sat down .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 13]: `` I been practically well for some time , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 12]: `` I 'm fixin ' to get into harness again . ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 19]: `` Bein ' sick has certainly produced a change of heart in you , '' his friend laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 22]: `` You 're the last man I ever expected to see blowin ' yourself -- or anybody else to a taxicab !
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 31]: For that matter , I never heard of you bein ' in ANY kind of a cab , ` less 'n it might be when you been pall-bearer for somebody .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 7]: What 's come over you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 22]: `` Well , I got to turn over a new leaf , and that 's a fact , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 40]: `` I got a lot to do , and the only way to accomplish it , it 's got to be done soon , or I wo n't have anything to live on while I 'm doing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 7]: `` What you talkin ' about ?
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 19]: What you got to do except to get strong enough to come back to the old place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 32]: `` Well -- '' Adams paused , then coughed , and said slowly , `` Fact is , Charley Lohr , I been thinking likely I would n't come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 7]: What you talkin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Adams .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 17]: `` I been thinking I might likely kind of branch out on my own account . ''
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 9]: `` Well , I 'll be doggoned ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 33]: Old Charley Lohr was amazed ; he ruffled up his gray moustache with thumb and forefinger , leaving his mouth open beneath , like a dark cave under a tangled wintry thicket .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 13]: `` Why , that 's the doggonedest thing I ever heard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 28]: `` I already am the oldest inhabitant down there , but if you go , there wo n't be anybody else of the old generation at all .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 12]: What on earth you thinkin ' of goin ' into ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 47]: `` Well , '' said Adams , `` I rather you did n't mention it till I get started of course anybody 'll know what it is by then -- but I HAVE been kind of planning to put a liquid glue on the market . ''
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 17]: His friend , still ruffling the gray moustache upward , stared at him in frowning perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 4]: `` Glue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 4]: `` GLUE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 16]: I been sort of milling over the idea of taking up something like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 12]: `` Handlin ' it for some firm , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 3]: Making it .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 7]: Sort of a glue-works likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 5]: Lohr continued to frown .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 9]: `` Let me think , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 15]: `` Did n't the ole man have some such idea once , himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 16]: Adams leaned forward , rubbing his knees ; and he coughed again before he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 5]: `` Well , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 6]: Fact is , he did .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 14]: That is to say , a mighty long while ago he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 8]: `` I remember , '' said Lohr .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 49]: `` He never said anything about it that I know of ; but seems to me I recollect we had sort of a rumour around the place how you and that man -- le 's see , was n't his name Campbell , that died of typhoid fever ?
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 8]: Yes , that was it , Campbell .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 22]: Did n't the ole man have you and Campbell workin ' sort of private on some glue proposition or other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 7]: `` Yes , he did . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 3]: Adams nodded .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 14]: `` I found out a good deal about glue then , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 12]: `` Been workin ' on it since , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 14]: Kept it in my mind and studied out new things about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 4]: Lohr looked serious .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 11]: `` Well , but see here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 24]: `` I hope it ai n't anything the ole man 'll think might infringe on whatever he had you doin ' for HIM .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 83]: You know how he is : broad-minded , liberal , free-handed man as walks this earth , and if he thought he owed you a cent he 'd sell his right hand for a pork-chop to pay it , if that was the only way ; but if he got the idea anybody was tryin ' to get the better of him , he 'd sell BOTH his hands , if he had to , to keep 'em from doin ' it .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 8]: Yes , at eighty , he would !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 20]: Not that I mean I think you might be tryin ' to get the better of him , Virg .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 17]: You 're a mighty close ole codger , but such a thing ai n't in you .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 31]: What I mean : I hope there ai n't any chance for the ole man to THINK you might be -- '' `` Oh , no , '' Adams interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 67]: `` As a matter of fact , I do n't believe he 'll ever think about it at all , and if he did he would n't have any real right to feel offended at me : the process I 'm going to use is one I expect to change and improve a lot different from the one Campbell and I worked on for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 11]: `` Well , that 's good , '' said Lohr .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 20]: `` Of course you know what you 're up to : you 're old enough , God knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 4]: He laughed ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 17]: `` My , but it will seem funny to me -- down there with you gone !
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 43]: I expect you and I both been gettin ' to be pretty much dead-wood in the place , the way the young fellows look at it , and the only one that 'd miss either of us would be the other one !
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 9]: Have you told the ole man yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 8]: `` Well -- '' Adams spoke laboriously .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 6]: No , I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 16]: I thought -- well , that 's what I wanted to see you about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 7]: `` What can I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 21]: `` I thought I 'd write him a letter and get you to hand it to him for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 5]: `` My soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 4]: his friend exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 16]: `` Why on earth do n't you just go down there and tell him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 5]: Adams became pitiably embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 29]: He stammered , coughed , stammered again , wrinkling his face so deeply he seemed about to weep ; but finally he contrived to utter an apologetic laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 31]: `` I ought to do that , of course ; but in some way or other I just do n't seem to be able to -- to manage it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 8]: `` Why in the world not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 5]: the mystified Lohr inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 54]: `` I could hardly tell you -- ` less 'n it is to say that when you been with one boss all your life it 's so -- so kind of embarrassing -- to quit him , I just ca n't make up my mind to go and speak to him about it .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 33]: No ; I got it in my head a letter 's the only satisfactory way to do it , and I thought I 'd ask you to hand it to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 21]: `` Well , of course I do n't mind doin ' that for you , '' Lohr said , mildly .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 16]: `` But why in the world do n't you just mail it to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 12]: `` Well , I 'll tell you , '' Adams returned .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 29]: `` You know , like that , it 'd have to go through a clerk and that secretary of his , and I do n't know who all .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 71]: There 's a couple of kind of delicate points I want to put in it : for instance , I want to explain to him how much improvement and so on I 'm going to introduce on the old process I helped to work out with Campbell when we were working for him , so ' t he 'll understand it 's a different article and no infringement at all .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 34]: Then there 's another thing : you see all during while I was sick he had my salary paid to me it amounts to considerable , I was on my back so long .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 52]: Under the circumstances , because I 'm quitting , I do n't feel as if I ought to accept it , and so I 'll have a check for him in the letter to cover it , and I want to be sure he knows it , and gets it personally .
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 31]: If it had to go through a lot of other people , the way it would if I put it in the mail , why , you ca n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 52]: So what I thought : if you 'd hand it to him for me , and maybe if he happened to read it right then , or anything , it might be you 'd notice whatever he 'd happen to say about it -- and you could tell me afterward . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 8]: `` All right , '' Lohr said .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 36]: `` Certainly if you 'd rather do it that way , I 'll hand it to him and tell you what he says ; that is , if he says anything and I hear him .
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 5]: Got it written ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 16]: `` No ; I 'll send it around to you last of the week . ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 6]: Adams moved toward his taxicab .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 18]: `` Do n't say anything to anybody about it , Charley , especially till after that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 5]: `` All right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 26]: `` And , Charley , I 'll be mighty obliged to you , '' Adams said , and came back to shake hands in farewell .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 21]: `` There 's one thing more you might do -- if you 'd ever happen to feel like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 27]: He kept his eyes rather vaguely fixed on a point above his friend 's head as he spoke , and his voice was not well controlled .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 43]: `` I been -- I been down there a good many years and I may not ` a ' been so much use lately as I was at first , but I always tried to do my best for the old firm .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 40]: If anything turned out so 's they DID kind of take offense with me , down there , why , just say a good word for me -- if you 'd happen to feel like it , maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 52]: Old Charley Lohr assured him that he would speak a good word if opportunity became available ; then , after the cab had driven away , he went up to his small apartment on the third floor and muttered ruminatively until his wife inquired what he was talking to himself about .
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 10]: `` Ole Virg Adams , '' he told her .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 27]: `` He 's out again after his long spell of sickness , and the way it looks to me he 'd better stayed in bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 13]: `` You mean he still looks too bad to be out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 19]: `` Oh , I expect he 's gettin ' his HEALTH back , '' Lohr said , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 9]: `` Then what 's the matter with him ?
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 9]: You mean he 's lost his mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 12]: `` My goodness , but women do jump at conclusions ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 21]: `` Well , '' said Mrs. Lohr , `` what other conclusion did you leave me to jump at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 23]: Her husband explained with a little heat : `` People can have a sickness that AFFECTS their mind , ca n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 16]: Their mind can get some affected without bein ' LOST , ca n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 14]: `` Then you mean the poor man 's mind does seem affected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 27]: `` Why , no ; I 'd scarcely go as far as that , '' Lohr said , inconsistently , and declined to be more definite .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 35]: Adams devoted the latter part of that evening to the composition of his letter -- a disquieting task not completed when , at eleven o'clock , he heard his daughter coming up the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 39]: She was singing to herself in a low , sweet voice , and Adams paused to listen incredulously , with his pen lifted and his mouth open , as if he heard the strangest sound in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 27]: Then he set down the pen upon a blotter , went to his door , and opened it , looking out at her as she came .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 17]: `` Well , dearie , you seem to be feeling pretty good , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 7]: `` What you been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 12]: `` Just sitting out on the front steps , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 8]: `` All alone , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 5]: Mr. Russell called . ''
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 7]: `` Oh , he did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 6]: Adams pretended to be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 20]: `` What all could you and he find to talk about till this hour o ' the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 4]: She laughed gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 10]: `` You do n't know me , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 15]: `` You 've never found out that I always do all the talking . ''
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 14]: `` Did n't you let him get a word in all evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes ; every now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 8]: Adams took her hand and petted it .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 9]: `` Well , what did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 10]: Alice gave him a radiant look and kissed him .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 7]: `` Not what you think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 32]: she laughed ; then slapped his cheek with saucy affection , pirouetted across the narrow hall and into her own room , and curtsied to him as she closed her door .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 45]: Adams went back to his writing with a lighter heart ; for since Alice was born she had been to him the apple of his eye , his own phrase in thinking of her ; and what he was doing now was for her .
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 24]: He smiled as he picked up his pen to begin a new draft of the painful letter ; but presently he looked puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 15]: After all , she could be happy just as things were , it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 22]: Then why had he taken what his wife called `` this new step , '' which he had so long resisted ?
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 7]: He could only sigh and wonder .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 30]: `` Life works out pretty peculiarly , '' he thought ; for he could n't go back now , though the reason he could n't was not clearly apparent .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 6]: He had to go ahead .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 23]: CHAPTER XVII He was out in his taxicab again the next morning , and by noon he had secured what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 10]: It was curiously significant that he worked so quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 77]: All the years during which his wife had pressed him toward his present shift he had sworn to himself , as well as to her , that he would never yield ; and yet when he did yield he had no plans to make , because he found them already prepared and worked out in detail in his mind ; as if he had long contemplated the `` step '' he believed himself incapable of taking .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 60]: Sometimes he had thought of improving his income by exchanging his little collection of bonds for a `` small rental property , '' if he could find `` a good buy '' ; and he had spent many of his spare hours rambling over the enormously spreading city and its purlieus , looking for the ideal `` buy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 17]: It remained unattainable , so far as he was concerned ; but he found other things .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 28]: Not twice a crow 's mile from his own house there was a dismal and slummish quarter , a decayed `` industrial district '' of earlier days .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 28]: Most of the industries were small ; some of them died , perishing of bankruptcy or fire ; and a few had moved , leaving their shells .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 56]: Of the relics , the best was a brick building which had been the largest and most important factory in the quarter : it had been injured by a long vacancy almost as serious as a fire , in effect , and Adams had often guessed at the sum needed to put it in repair .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 21]: When he passed it , he would look at it with an interest which he supposed detached and idly speculative .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 12]: `` That 'd be just the thing , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 50]: `` If a fellow had money enough , and took a notion to set up some new business on a big scale , this would be a pretty good place -- to make glue , for instance , if that was n't out of the question , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 35]: It would take a lot of money , though ; a great deal too much for me to expect to handle -- even if I 'd ever dream of doing such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 46]: Opposite the dismantled factory was a muddy , open lot of two acres or so , and near the middle of the lot , a long brick shed stood in a desolate abandonment , not happily decorated by old coatings of theatrical and medicinal advertisements .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 66]: But the brick shed had two wooden ells , and , though both shed and ells were of a single story , here was empty space enough for a modest enterprise -- `` space enough for almost anything , to start with , '' Adams thought , as he walked through the low buildings , one day , when he was prospecting in that section .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 14]: `` Yes , I suppose I COULD swing this , '' he thought .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 52]: `` If the process belonged to me , say , instead of being out of the question because it is n't my property -- or if I was the kind of man to do such a thing anyhow , here would be something I could probably get hold of pretty cheap .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 35]: They 'd want a lot of money for a lease on that big building over the way -- but this , why , I should think it 'd be practically nothing at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 65]: Then , by chance , meeting an agent he knew , he made inquiries -- merely to satisfy a casual curiosity , he thought -- and he found matters much as he had supposed , except that the owners of the big building did not wish to let , but to sell it , and this at a price so exorbitant that Adams laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 36]: But the long brick shed in the great muddy lot was for sale or to let , or `` pretty near to be given away , '' he learned , if anybody would take it .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 44]: Adams took it now , though without seeing that he had been destined to take it , and that some dreary wizard in the back of his head had foreseen all along that he would take it , and planned to be ready .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 31]: He drove in his taxicab to look the place over again , then down-town to arrange for a lease ; and came home to lunch with his wife and daughter .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 10]: Things were `` moving , '' he told them .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 32]: He boasted a little of having acted so decisively , and said that since the dang thing had to be done , it was `` going to be done RIGHT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 46]: He was almost cheerful , in a feverish way , and when the cab came for him again , soon after lunch , he explained that he intended not only to get things done right , but also to `` get 'em done quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 21]: Alice , following him to the front door , looked at him anxiously and asked if she could n't help .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: He laughed at her grimly .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 16]: `` Then let me go along with you in the cab , '' she begged .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 26]: `` You do n't look able to start in so hard , papa , just when you 're barely beginning to get your strength back .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 30]: Do let me go with you and see if I ca n't help -- or at least take care of you if you should get to feeling badly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 36]: He declined , but upon pressure let her put a tiny bottle of spirits of ammonia in his pocket , and promised to make use of it if he `` felt faint or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 28]: Then he was off again ; and the next morning had men at work in his sheds , though the wages he had to pay frightened him .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 37]: He directed the workmen in every detail , hurrying them by example and exhortations , and receiving , in consequence , several declarations of independence , as well as one resignation , which took effect immediately .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 35]: `` Yous capitalusts seem to think a man 's got nothin ' to do but break his back p ` doosin ' wealth fer yous to squander , '' the resigning person loudly complained .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 24]: `` You look out : the toiler 's day is a-comin ' , and it ai n't so fur off , neither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 21]: But the capitalist was already out of hearing , gone to find a man to take this orator 's place .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 33]: By the end of the week , Adams felt that he had moved satisfactorily forward in his preparations for the simple equipment he needed ; but he hated the pause of Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 25]: He did n't WANT any rest , he told Alice impatiently , when she suggested that the idle day might be good for him .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 36]: Late that afternoon he walked over to the apartment house where old Charley Lohr lived , and gave his friend the letter he wanted the head of Lamb and Company to receive `` personally . ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 28]: `` I 'll take it as a mighty great favour in you to hand it to him personally , Charley , '' he said , in parting .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 73]: `` And you wo n't forget , in case he says anything about it -- and remember if you ever do get a chance to put in a good word for me later , you know -- '' Old Charley promised to remember , and , when Mrs. Lohr came out of the `` kitchenette , '' after the door closed , he said thoughtfully , `` Just skin and bones . ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 8]: `` You mean Mr. Adams is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 4]: Mrs. Lohr inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 9]: `` Who 'd you think I meant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 11]: `` One o ' these partridges in the wall-paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 8]: `` Did he look so badly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 13]: `` Looked kind of distracted to me , '' her husband replied .
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 13]: `` These little thin fellers can stand a heap sometimes , though .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 9]: He 'll be over here again Monday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 8]: `` Did he say he would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Lohr .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 5]: `` But he will .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 4]: You 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 19]: He 'll be over to find out what the big boss says when I give him this letter .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 16]: Expect I 'd be kind of anxious , myself , if I was him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 5]: `` Why would you ?
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 12]: What 's Mr. Adams doing to be so anxious about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 31]: Lohr 's expression became one of reserve , the look of a man who has found that when he speaks his inner thoughts his wife jumps too far to conclusions .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 9]: `` Oh , nothing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 19]: `` Of course any man starting up a new business is bound to be pretty nervous a while .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 16]: He 'll be over here to-morrow evening , all right ; you 'll see . ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 32]: The prediction was fulfilled : Adams arrived just after Mrs. Lohr had removed the dinner dishes to her `` kitchenette '' ; but Lohr had little information to give his caller .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 14]: `` He did n't say a word , Virgil ; nary a word .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 24]: I took it into his office and handed it to him , and he just sat and read it ; that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 47]: I kind of stood around as long as I could , but he was sittin ' at his desk with his side to me , and he never turned around full toward me , as it were , so I could n't hardly even tell anything .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 10]: All I know : he just read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 13]: `` Well , but see here , '' Adams began , nervously .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 11]: `` Well -- '' `` Well what , Virg ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 14]: `` Well , but what did he say when he DID speak ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 6]: `` He did n't speak .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 10]: Not so long I was in there , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 8]: He just sat there and read it .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 5]: Read kind of slow .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 21]: Then , when he came to the end , he turned back and started to read it all over again .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 30]: By that time there was three or four other men standin ' around in the office waitin ' to speak to him , and I had to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 11]: Adams sighed , and stared at the floor , irresolute .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 17]: `` Well , I 'll be getting along back home then , I guess , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 20]: So you 're sure you could n't tell anything what he might have thought about it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 8]: `` Not a thing in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 11]: I 've told you all I know , Virg . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 15]: `` I guess so , I guess so , '' Adams said , mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 14]: `` I feel mighty obliged to you , Charley Lohr ; mighty obliged .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 5]: Good-night to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 8]: And he departed , sighing in perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 68]: On his way home , preoccupied with many thoughts , he walked so slowly that once or twice he stopped and stood motionless for a few moments , without being aware of it ; and when he reached the juncture of the sidewalk with the short brick path that led to his own front door , he stopped again , and stood for more than a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 14]: `` Ah , I wish I knew , '' he whispered , plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 13]: `` I do wish I knew what he thought about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 16]: He was roused by a laugh that came lightly from the little veranda near by .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 4]: `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 4]: Alice called gaily .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 12]: `` What are you standing there muttering to yourself about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 10]: `` Oh , are you there , dearie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 9]: he said , and came up the path .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 11]: A tall figure rose from a chair on the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 9]: `` Papa , this is Mr. Russell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 40]: The two men shook hands , Adams saying , `` Pleased to make your acquaintance , '' as they looked at each other in the faint light diffused through the opaque glass in the upper part of the door .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 46]: Adams 's impression was of a strong and tall young man , fashionable but gentle ; and Russell 's was of a dried , little old business man with a grizzled moustache , worried bright eyes , shapeless dark clothes , and a homely manner .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 14]: `` Nice evening , '' Adams said further , as their hands parted .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 28]: `` Nice time o ' year it is , but we do n't always have as good weather as this ; that 's the trouble of it .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 9]: Well -- '' He went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 19]: `` Well -- I bid you good evening , '' he said , and retired within the house .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 22]: `` He 's the old-fashionedest man in town , I suppose and frightfully impressed with you , I could see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 5]: `` What nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 3]: said Russell .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 10]: `` How could anybody be impressed with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 4]: `` Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 5]: Because you 're quiet ?
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 3]: Good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 12]: Do n't you know that you 're the most impressive sort ?
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 13]: We chatterers spend all our time playing to you quiet people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 11]: `` Yes ; we 're only the audience . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 5]: ` Only ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 3]: she echoed .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 17]: `` Why , we live for you , and we ca n't live without you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 11]: `` I wish you could n't , '' said Russell .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 17]: `` That would be a new experience for both of us , would n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 17]: `` It might be a rather bleak one for me , '' she answered , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 17]: `` I 'm afraid I 'll miss these summer evenings with you when they 're over .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 9]: I 'll miss them enough , thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 11]: `` Do they have to be over some time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 14]: `` Oh , everything 's over some time , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 5]: Russell laughed at her .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 16]: `` Do n't let 's look so far ahead as that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 17]: `` We do n't need to be already thinking of the cemetery , do we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 13]: `` I did n't , '' she said , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 14]: `` Our summer evenings will be over before then , Mr. Russell . ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 5]: `` Good heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 14]: `` THERE 'S laconic eloquence : almost a proposal in a single word !
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 11]: Never mind , I sha n't hold you to it .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 26]: But to answer you : well , I 'm always looking ahead , and somehow I usually see about how things are coming out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 31]: `` I suppose most of us do ; at least it seems as if we did , because we so seldom feel surprised by the way they do come out .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 30]: But maybe that 's only because life is n't like a play in a theatre , and most things come about so gradually we get used to them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 21]: `` No , I 'm sure I can see quite a long way ahead , '' she insisted , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 18]: `` And it does n't seem to me as if our summer evenings could last very long .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 23]: Something 'll interfere -- somebody will , I mean -- they 'll SAY something -- '' `` What if they do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 10]: She moved her shoulders in a little apprehensive shiver .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 10]: `` It 'll change you , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 14]: `` I 'm just sure something spiteful 's going to happen to me .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 9]: You 'll feel differently about -- things . ''
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 10]: `` Now , is n't that an idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 8]: `` It will , '' she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 11]: `` I know something spiteful 's going to happen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 18]: `` You seem possessed by a notion not a bit flattering to me , '' he remarked .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 8]: `` Oh , but is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 7]: That 's just what it is !
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 6]: Why is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 21]: `` Because it implies that I 'm made of such soft material the slightest breeze will mess me all up .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 50]: I 'm not so like that as I evidently appear ; and if it 's true that we 're afraid other people will do the things we 'd be most likely to do ourselves , it seems to me that I ought to be the one to be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 26]: I ought to be afraid that somebody may say something about me to you that will make you believe I 'm a professional forger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 11]: We both know they wo n't , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 20]: `` We both know you 're the sort of person everybody in the world says nice things about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 13]: She lifted her hand to silence him as he laughed at this .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 8]: `` Oh , of course you are !
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 27]: I think perhaps you 're a little flirtatious -- most quiet men have that one sly way with 'em -- oh , yes , they do !
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 14]: But you happen to be the kind of man everybody loves to praise .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 17]: And if you were n't , _ I _ should n't hear anything terrible about you .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 17]: I told you I was unpopular : I do n't see anybody at all any more .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 33]: The only man except you who 's been to see me in a month is that fearful little fat Frank Dowling , and I sent word to HIM I was n't home .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 12]: Nobody 'd tell me of your wickedness , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 14]: `` Then let me break some news to you , '' Russell said .
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 10]: `` Nobody would tell me of yours , either .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 9]: Nobody 's even mentioned you to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 7]: She burlesqued a cry of anguish .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 5]: `` That IS obscurity !
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 20]: I suppose I 'm too apt to forget that they say the population 's about half a million nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 14]: There ARE other people to talk about , you feel , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 11]: `` None that I want to , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 23]: `` But I should think the size of the place might relieve your mind of what seems to insist on burdening it .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 16]: Besides , I 'd rather you thought me a better man than you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 13]: `` What kind of a man do I think you are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 19]: `` The kind affected by what 's said about people instead of by what they do themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 6]: `` Are n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 11]: `` No , I 'm not , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 20]: `` If you want our summer evenings to be over you 'll have to drive me away yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 6]: `` Nobody else could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 21]: She was silent , leaning forward , with her elbows on her knees and her clasped hands against her lips .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 17]: Then , not moving , she said softly : `` Well -- I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 22]: She was silent again , and he said nothing , but looked at her , seeming to be content with looking .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 36]: Her attitude was one only a graceful person should assume , but she was graceful ; and , in the wan light , which made a prettily shaped mist of her , she had beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 53]: Perhaps it was beauty of the hour , and of the love scene almost made into form by what they had both just said , but she had it ; and though beauty of the hour passes , he who sees it will long remember it and the hour when it came .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 8]: `` What are you thinking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 13]: She leaned back in her chair and did not answer at once .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 19]: Then she said : `` I do n't know ; I doubt if I was thinking of anything .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 8]: It seems to me I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 14]: I think I was just being sort of sadly happy just then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 4]: `` Were you ?
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 9]: Was it ` sadly , ' too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 15]: `` It seems to me that only little children can be just happily happy .
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 44]: I think when we get older our happiest moments are like the one I had just then : it 's as if we heard strains of minor music running through them -- oh , so sweet , but oh , so sad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 10]: `` But what makes it sad for YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 15]: `` I do n't know , '' she said , in a lighter tone .
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 16]: `` Perhaps it 's a kind of useless foreboding I seem to have pretty often .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 13]: It may be that -- or it may be poor papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 12]: `` You ARE a funny , delightful girl , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 3]: Russell laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 18]: `` When your father 's so well again that he goes out walking in the evenings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 11]: `` He does too much walking , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 11]: `` Too much altogether , over at his new plant .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 9]: But there is n't any stopping him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 7]: She laughed and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 23]: `` When a man gets an ambition to be a multi-millionaire his family do n't appear to have much weight with him .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 14]: He 'll walk all he wants to , in spite of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 16]: `` I suppose so , '' Russell said , absently ; then he leaned forward .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 16]: `` I wish I could understand better why you were ` sadly ' happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 33]: Meanwhile , as Alice shed what further light she could on this point , the man ambitious to be a `` multi-millionaire '' was indeed walking too much for his own good .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 44]: He had gone to bed , hoping to sleep well and rise early for a long day 's work , but he could not rest , and now , in his nightgown and slippers , he was pacing the floor of his room .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 15]: `` I wish I DID know , '' he thought , over and over .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 13]: `` I DO wish I knew how he feels about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 40]: CHAPTER XVIII That was a thought almost continuously in his mind , even when he was hardest at work ; and , as the days went on and he could not free himself , he became querulous about it .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 23]: `` I guess I 'm the biggest dang fool alive , '' he told his wife as they sat together one evening .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 19]: `` I got plenty else to bother me , without worrying my head off about what HE thinks .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 15]: I ca n't help what he thinks ; it 's too late for that .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 11]: So why should I keep pestering myself about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 15]: `` It 'll wear off , Virgil , '' Mrs. Adams said , reassuringly .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 35]: She was gentle and sympathetic with him , and for the first time in many years he would come to sit with her and talk , when he had finished his day 's work .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 18]: He had told her , evading her eye , `` Oh , I do n't blame you .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 21]: You did n't get after me to do this on your own account ; you could n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 14]: `` Yes ; but it do n't wear off , '' he complained .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 47]: `` This afternoon I was showing the men how I wanted my vats to go , and I caught my fool self standing there saying to my fool self , ` It 's funny I do n't hear how he feels about it from SOMEbody . '
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 19]: I was saying it aloud , almost -- and it IS funny I do n't hear anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 15]: `` Well , you see what it means , do n't you , Virgil ?
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 13]: It only means he has n't said anything to anybody about it .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 14]: Do n't you think you 're getting kind of morbid over it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 9]: `` Maybe , maybe , '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 11]: `` Why , yes , '' she said , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 18]: `` You do n't realize what a little bit of a thing all this is to him .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 29]: It 's been a long , long while since the last time you even mentioned glue to him , and he 's probably forgotten everything about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 22]: `` You 're off your base ; it is n't like him to forget things , '' Adams returned , peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 14]: `` He may seem to forget 'em , but he do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 20]: `` But he 's not thinking about this , or you 'd have heard from him before now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 6]: Her husband shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: `` Ah , that 's just it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 10]: `` Why HAVE N'T I heard from him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 9]: `` It 's all your morbidness , Virgil .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 21]: Look at Walter : if Mr. Lamb held this up against you , would he still let Walter stay there ?
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 14]: Would n't he have discharged Walter if he felt angry with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 6]: `` That dang boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 3]: Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 27]: `` If he WANTED to come with me now , I would n't hardly let him , What do you suppose makes him so bull-headed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 13]: `` But has n't he a right to choose for himself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 17]: `` I suppose he feels he ought to stick to what he thinks is sure pay .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 25]: As soon as he sees that you 're going to succeed with the glue-works he 'll want to be with you quick enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 19]: `` Well , he better get a little sense in his head , '' Adams returned , crossly .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 34]: `` He wanted me to pay him a three-hundred-dollar bonus in advance , when anybody with a grain of common sense knows I need every penny I can lay my hands on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 14]: `` He 'll come around later and be glad of the chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 10]: `` He 'll have to beg for it then !
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 10]: _ I _ wo n't ask him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 15]: `` Oh , Walter will come out all right ; you need n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 24]: And do n't you see that Mr. Lamb 's not discharging him means there 's no hard feeling against you , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 16]: `` I ca n't make it out at all , '' he said , frowning .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 41]: `` The only thing I can THINK it means is that J. A. Lamb is so fair-minded -- and of course he IS one of the fair-mindedest men alive I suppose that 's the reason he has n't fired Walter .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 43]: He may know , '' Adams concluded , morosely -- `` he may know that 's just another thing to make me feel all the meaner : keeping my boy there on a salary after I 've done him an injury . ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 6]: `` Now , now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 8]: she said , trying to comfort him .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 19]: `` You could n't do anybody an injury to save your life , and everybody knows it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 34]: `` Well , anybody ought to know I would n't WANT to do an injury , but this world is n't built so ' t we can do just what we want . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 5]: He paused , reflecting .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 26]: `` Of course there may be one explanation of why Walter 's still there : J. A. maybe has n't noticed that he IS there .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 14]: There 's so many I expect he hardly knows him by sight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 15]: `` Well , just do quit thinking about it , '' she urged him .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 10]: `` It only bothers you without doing any good .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 7]: Do n't you know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 8]: `` Do n't I , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 5]: he laughed , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 8]: `` I know it better 'n anybody !
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 33]: How funny that is : when you know thinking about a thing only pesters you without helping anything at all , and yet you keep right on pestering yourself with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 5]: `` But WHY ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 17]: `` What 's the use when you know you have n't done anything wrong , Virgil ?
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 32]: You said yourself you were going to improve the process so much it would be different from the old one , and you 'd REALLY have a right to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 49]: Adams had persuaded himself of this when he yielded ; he had found it necessary to persuade himself of it -- though there was a part of him , of course , that remained unpersuaded ; and this discomfiting part of him was what made his present trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 10]: `` Yes , I know , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 58]: `` That 's true , but I ca n't quite seem to get away from the fact that the principle of the process is a good deal the same -- well , it 's more 'n that ; it 's just about the same as the one he hired Campbell and me to work out for him .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 27]: Truth is , nobody could tell the difference , and I do n't know as there IS any difference except in these improvements I 'm making .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 61]: Of course , the improvements do give me pretty near a perfect right to it , as a person might say ; and that 's one of the things I thought of putting in my letter to him ; but I was afraid he 'd just think I was trying to make up excuses , so I left it out .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 38]: I kind of worried all the time I was writing that letter , because if he thought I WAS just making up excuses , why , it might set him just so much more against me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 64]: Ever since Mrs. Adams had found that she was to have her way , the depths of her eyes had been troubled by a continuous uneasiness ; and , although she knew it was there , and sometimes veiled it by keeping the revealing eyes averted from her husband and children , she could not always cover it under that assumption of absent-mindedness .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 53]: The uneasy look became vivid , and her voice was slightly tremulous now , as she said , `` But what if he SHOULD be against you -- although I do n't believe he is , of course -- you told me he could n't DO anything to you , Virgil . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 9]: `` No , '' he said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 11]: `` I ca n't see how he could do anything .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 16]: It was just a secret , not a patent ; the thing ai n't patentable .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 34]: I 've tried to think what he could do -- supposing he was to want to -- but I ca n't figure out anything at all that would be any harm to me .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 17]: There is n't any way in the world it could be made a question of law .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 21]: Only thing he could do 'd be to TELL people his side of it , and set 'em against me .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 14]: I been kind of waiting for that to happen , all along . ''
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 5]: She looked somewhat relieved .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 11]: `` So did I expect it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 26]: `` I was dreading it most on Alice 's account : it might have -- well , young men are so easily influenced and all .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 16]: But so far as the business is concerned , what if Mr. Lamb did talk ?
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 7]: That would n't amount to much .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 11]: It would n't affect the business ; not to hurt .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 12]: And , besides , he is n't even doing that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 11]: `` No ; anyhow not yet , it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 7]: And Adams sighed again , wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 15]: `` But I WOULD give a good deal to know what he thinks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 35]: Before his surrender he had always supposed that if he did such an unthinkable thing as to seize upon the glue process for himself , what he would feel must be an overpowering shame .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 24]: But shame is the rarest thing in the world : what he felt was this unremittent curiosity about his old employer 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 42]: It was an obsession , yet he did not want to hear what Lamb `` thought '' from Lamb himself , for Adams had a second obsession , and this was his dread of meeting the old man face to face .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 42]: Such an encounter could happen only by chance and unexpectedly ; since Adams would have avoided any deliberate meeting , so long as his legs had strength to carry him , even if Lamb came to the house to see him .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 23]: But people do meet unexpectedly ; and when Adams had to be down-town he kept away from the `` wholesale district . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 43]: One day he did see Lamb , as the latter went by in his car , impassive , going home to lunch ; and Adams , in the crowd at a corner , knew that the old man had not seen him .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 30]: Nevertheless , in a street car , on the way back to his sheds , an hour later , he was still subject to little shivering seizures of horror .
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 41]: He worked unceasingly , seeming to keep at it even in his sleep , for he always woke in the midst of a planning and estimating that must have been going on in his mind before consciousness of himself returned .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 28]: Moreover , the work , thus urged , went rapidly , in spite of the high wages he had to pay his labourers for their short hours .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 76]: `` It eats money , '' he complained , and , in fact , by the time his vats and boilers were in place it had eaten almost all he could supply ; but in addition to his equipment he now owned a stock of `` raw material , '' raw indeed ; and when operations should be a little further along he was confident his banker would be willing to `` carry '' him .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 15]: Six weeks from the day he had obtained his lease he began his glue-making .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 21]: The terrible smells came out of the sheds and went writhing like snakes all through that quarter of the town .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 24]: A smiling man , strolling and breathing the air with satisfaction , would turn a corner and smile no more , but hurry .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 29]: However , coloured people had almost all the dwellings of this old section to themselves ; and although even they were troubled , there was recompense for them .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 32]: Being philosophic about what appeared to them as in the order of nature , they sought neither escape nor redress , and soon learned to bear what the wind brought them .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 45]: They even made use of it to enrich those figures of speech with which the native impulses of coloured people decorate their communications : they flavoured metaphor , simile , and invective with it ; and thus may be said to have enjoyed it .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 28]: But the man who produced it took a hot bath as soon as he reached his home the evening of that first day when his manufacturing began .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 27]: Then he put on fresh clothes ; but after dinner he seemed to be haunted , and asked his wife if she `` noticed anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 8]: She laughed and inquired what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 20]: `` Seems to me as if that glue-works smell had n't quit hanging to me , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 8]: `` Do n't you notice it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 5]: What an idea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 26]: He laughed , too , but uneasily ; and told her he was sure `` the dang glue smell '' was somehow sticking to him .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 36]: Later , he went outdoors and walked up and down the small yard in the dusk ; but now and then he stood still , with his head lifted , and sniffed the air suspiciously .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 7]: `` Can YOU smell it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 19]: he called to Alice , who sat upon the veranda , prettily dressed and waiting in a reverie .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 7]: `` Smell what , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 6]: `` That dang glue-works . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 18]: She did the same thing her mother had done : laughed , and said , `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 3]: How foolish !
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 13]: Why , papa , it 's over two miles from here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 10]: `` You do n't get it at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 3]: he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 4]: `` The idea !
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: The air is lovely to-night , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 19]: The air did not seem lovely to him , for he was positive that he detected the taint .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 41]: He wondered how far it carried , and if J. A. Lamb would smell it , too , out on his own lawn a mile to the north ; and if he did , would he guess what it was ?
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 19]: Then Adams laughed at himself for such nonsense ; but could not rid his nostrils of their disgust .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 12]: To him the whole town seemed to smell of his glue-works .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 13]: Nevertheless , the glue was making , and his sheds were busy .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 23]: `` Guess we 're stirrin ' up this ole neighbourhood with more than the smell , '' his foreman remarked one morning .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 6]: `` How 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: Adams inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 22]: `` That great big , enormous ole dead butterine factory across the street from our lot , '' the man said .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 15]: `` Nothin ' like settin ' an example to bring real estate to life .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 20]: That place is full o ' carpenters startin ' in to make a regular buildin ' of it again .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 28]: Guess you ought to have the credit of it , because you was the first man in ten years to see any possibilities in this neighbourhood . ''
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 35]: Adams was pleased , and , going out to see for himself , heard a great hammering and sawing from within the building ; while carpenters were just emerging gingerly upon the dangerous roof .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 36]: He walked out over the dried mud of his deep lot , crossed the street , and spoke genially to a workman who was removing the broken glass of a window on the ground floor .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 9]: What 's all this howdy-do over here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 17]: `` Goin ' to fix her all up , I guess , '' the workman said .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 9]: `` Big job it is , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 9]: `` Sh ' think it would be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 15]: `` Yes , sir ; a pretty big job -- a pretty big job .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 13]: Got men at it on all four floors and on the roof .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 8]: They 're doin ' it RIGHT . ''
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 7]: `` Who 's doing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 3]: `` Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 4]: I d' know .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 13]: Some o ' these here big manufacturing corporations , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 9]: `` What 's it going to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 25]: `` They tell ME , '' the workman answered -- `` they tell ME she 's goin ' to be a butterine factory again .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 30]: Anyways , I hope she wo n't be anything to smell like that glue-works you got over there not while I 'm workin ' around her , anyways ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 11]: `` That smell 's all right , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 9]: `` You soon get used to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 5]: `` You do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 5]: The man appeared incredulous .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 26]: I was over in France : it 's a good thing them Dutchmen never thought of it ; we 'd of had to quit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 10]: Adams laughed , and went back to his sheds .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 22]: `` I guess my foreman was right , '' he told his wife , that evening , with a little satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 25]: `` As soon as one man shows enterprise enough to found an industry in a broken-down neighbourhood , somebody else is sure to follow .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 44]: I kind of like the look of it : it 'll help make our place seem sort of more busy and prosperous when it comes to getting a loan from the bank -- and I got to get one mighty soon , too .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 79]: I did think some that if things go as well as there 's every reason to think they OUGHT to , I might want to spread out and maybe get hold of that old factory myself ; but I hardly expected to be able to handle a proposition of that size before two or three years from now , and anyhow there 's room enough on the lot I got , if we need more buildings some day .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 31]: Things are going about as fine as I could ask : I hired some girls to-day to do the bottling -- coloured girls along about sixteen to twenty years old .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 43]: Afterwhile , I expect to get a machine to put the stuff in the little bottles , when we begin to get good returns ; but half a dozen of these coloured girls can do it all right now , by hand .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 24]: We 're getting to have really quite a little plant over there : yes , sir , quite a regular little plant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 33]: He chuckled , and at this cheerful sound , of a kind his wife had almost forgotten he was capable of producing , she ventured to put her hand upon his arm .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 49]: They had gone outdoors , after dinner , taking two chairs with them , and were sitting through the late twilight together , keeping well away from the `` front porch , '' which was not yet occupied , however Alice was in her room changing her dress .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 40]: `` Well , honey , '' Mrs. Adams said , taking confidence not only to put her hand upon his arm , but to revive this disused endearment ; -- `` it 's grand to have you so optimistic .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 13]: Maybe some time you 'll admit I was right , after all .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 22]: Everything 's going so well , it seems a pity you did n't take this -- this step -- long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 10]: Do n't you think maybe so , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 21]: `` Well -- if I was ever going to , I do n't know but I might as well of .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 33]: I got to admit the proposition begins to look pretty good : I know the stuff 'll sell , and I ca n't see a thing in the world to stop it .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: It does look good , and if -- if -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 5]: `` If what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 6]: she said , suddenly anxious .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 10]: He laughed plaintively , as if confessing a superstition .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 15]: `` It 's funny -- well , it 's mighty funny about that smell .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 21]: I 've got so used to it at the plant I never seem to notice it at all over there .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 8]: It 's only when I get away .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 9]: Honestly , ca n't you notice -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 4]: `` Virgil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 10]: She lifted her hand to strike his arm chidingly .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 9]: `` Do quit harping on that nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 16]: `` Oh , of course it do n't amount to anything , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 12]: `` A person can stand a good deal of just smell .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 8]: It do n't WORRY me any . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 13]: `` I should think not especially as there is n't any . ''
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 28]: `` Well , '' he said , `` I feel pretty fair over the whole thing -- a lot better 'n I ever expected to , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 17]: I do n't know as there 's any reason I should n't tell you so . ''
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 24]: She was deeply pleased with this acknowledgment , and her voice had tenderness in it as she responded : `` There , honey !
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 15]: Did n't I always say you 'd be glad if you did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 14]: Embarrassed , he coughed loudly , then filled his pipe and lit it .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 15]: `` Well , '' he said , slowly , `` it 's a puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 10]: Yes , sir , it 's a puzzle . ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 9]: `` Pretty much everything , I guess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 17]: As he spoke , a song came to them from a lighted window over their heads .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 24]: Then the window darkened abruptly , but the song continued as Alice went down through the house to wait on the little veranda .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 21]: `` Mi chiamo Mimi , '' she sang , and in her voice throbbed something almost startling in its sweetness .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 28]: Her father and mother listened , not speaking until the song stopped with the click of the wire screen at the front door as Alice came out .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 4]: `` My ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 4]: said her father .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 7]: `` How sweet she does sing !
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 19]: I do n't know as I ever heard her voice sound nicer than it did just then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 17]: `` There 's something that makes it sound that way , '' his wife told him .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 11]: `` I suppose so , '' he said , sighing .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: `` I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 15]: You think -- '' `` She 's just terribly in love with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 34]: `` I expect that 's the way it ought to be , '' he said , then drew upon his pipe for reflection , and became murmurous with the symptoms of melancholy laughter .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 17]: `` It do n't make things less of a puzzle , though , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 8]: `` In what way , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 37]: `` Why , here , '' he said -- `` here we go through all this muck and moil to help fix things nicer for her at home , and what 's it all amount to ?
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 31]: Seems like she 's just gone ahead the way she 'd ` a ' gone anyhow ; and now , I suppose , getting ready to up and leave us !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 8]: Ai n't that a puzzle to you ?
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 6]: It is to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 13]: `` Oh , but things have n't gone that far yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 16]: `` Why , you just said -- '' She gave a little cry of protest .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 9]: `` Oh , they are n't ENGAGED yet .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 33]: Of course they WILL be ; he 's just as much interested in her as she is in him , but -- '' `` Well , what 's the trouble then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 9]: `` You ARE a simple old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 11]: his wife exclaimed , and then rose from her chair .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 9]: `` That reminds me , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 5]: `` What of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 11]: `` What 's my being simple remind you of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 4]: `` Nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 9]: `` It was n't you that reminded me .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 11]: It was just something that 's been on my mind .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 14]: I do n't believe he 's actually ever been inside our house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 6]: `` Has n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 14]: `` I actually do n't believe he ever has , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 12]: `` Of course we must -- '' She paused , debating .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 6]: `` We must what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 17]: `` I guess I better talk to Alice about it right now , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 21]: `` He do n't usually come for about half an hour yet ; I guess I 've got time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 13]: And with that she walked away , leaving him to his puzzles .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 23]: CHAPTER XIX Alice was softly crooning to herself as her mother turned the corner of the house and approached through the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 10]: `` Is n't it the most BEAUTIFUL evening ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 4]: the daughter said .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 9]: `` WHY ca n't summer last all year ?
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 13]: Did you ever know a lovelier twilight than this , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 19]: Mrs. Adams laughed , and answered , `` Not since I was your age , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 6]: Alice was wistful at once .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 11]: `` Do n't they stay beautiful after my age ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 11]: `` Well , it 's not the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 5]: `` Is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 4]: Not ever ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 19]: `` You may have a different kind from mine , '' the mother said , a little sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 8]: `` I think you will , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 11]: You deserve -- '' `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 11]: I do n't deserve anything , and I know it .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 20]: But I 'm getting a great deal these days -- more than I ever dreamed COULD come to me .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 11]: I 'm -- I 'm pretty happy , mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 4]: `` Dearie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 12]: Her mother would have kissed her , but Alice drew away .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 13]: `` Oh , I do n't mean -- '' She laughed nervously .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 14]: `` I was n't meaning to tell you I 'm ENGAGED , mama .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 4]: We 're not .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 5]: I mean -- oh !
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 16]: things seem pretty beautiful in spite of all I 've done to spoil 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 4]: `` You ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams cried , incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 10]: `` What have you done to spoil anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 8]: `` Little things , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 13]: `` A thousand little silly -- oh , what 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 23]: He 's so honestly what he is -- just simple and good and intelligent -- I feel a tricky mess beside him !
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 23]: I do n't see why he likes me ; and sometimes I 'm afraid he would n't if he knew me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 13]: `` He 'd just worship you , '' said the fond mother .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: `` And the more he knew you , the more he 'd worship you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 5]: Alice shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 8]: `` He 's not the worshiping kind .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 6]: Not like that at all .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 36]: He 's more -- '' But Mrs. Adams was not interested in this analysis , and she interrupted briskly , `` Of course it 's time your father and I showed some interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 18]: I was just saying I actually do n't believe he 's ever been inside the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 21]: `` No , '' Alice said , musingly ; `` that 's true : I do n't believe he has .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 24]: Except when we 've walked in the evening we 've always sat out here , even those two times when it was drizzly .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 7]: It 's so much nicer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 18]: `` We 'll have to do SOMETHING or other , of course , '' her mother said .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 5]: `` What like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 10]: `` I was thinking -- '' Mrs. Adams paused .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 22]: `` Well , of course we could hardly put off asking him to dinner , or something , much longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 22]: Alice was not enthusiastic ; so far from it , indeed , that there was a melancholy alarm in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 8]: `` Oh , mama , must we ?
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 6]: Do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 6]: `` Yes , I do .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 5]: I really do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 13]: `` Could n't we -- well , could n't we wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 10]: `` It looks queer , '' Mrs. Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 32]: `` It is n't the thing at all for a young man to come as much as he does , and never more than just barely meet your father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 7]: We ought to do something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 6]: `` But a dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 3]: Alice objected .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 15]: `` In the first place , there is n't anybody I want to ask .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 9]: There is n't anybody I WOULD ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: `` I did n't mean trying to give a big dinner , '' her mother explained .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 9]: `` I just mean having him to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 20]: That mulatto woman , Malena Burns , goes out by the day , and she could bring a waitress .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 16]: We can get some flowers for the table and some to put in the living-room .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 40]: We might just as well go ahead and do it to-morrow as any other time ; because your father 's in a fine mood , and I saw Malena this afternoon and told her I might want her soon .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 19]: She said she did n't have any engagements this week , and I can let her know to-night .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 12]: Suppose when he comes you ask him for to-morrow , Alice .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 10]: Everything 'll be very nice , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 7]: Do n't worry about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 10]: `` Well -- but -- '' Alice was uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 18]: `` But do n't you see , it looks so queer , not to do SOMETHING ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 4]: her mother urged .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 8]: `` It looks so kind of poverty-stricken .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 10]: We really ought n't to wait any longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 10]: Alice assented , though not with a good heart .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 18]: `` Very well , I 'll ask him , if you think we 've got to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 12]: `` That matter 's settled then , '' Mrs. Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 18]: `` I 'll go telephone Malena , and then I 'll tell your father about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 28]: But when she went back to her husband , she found him in an excited state of mind , and Walter standing before him in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 11]: Adams was almost shouting , so great was his vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 6]: `` Hush , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 10]: his wife implored , as she came near them .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 12]: `` They 'll hear you out on the front porch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 21]: `` I do n't care who hears me , '' Adams said , harshly , though he tempered his loudness .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 14]: `` Do you want to know what this boy 's asking me for ?
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 32]: I thought he 'd maybe come to tell me he 'd got a little sense in his head at last , and a little decency about what 's due his family !
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 15]: I thought he was going to ask me to take him into my plant .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 12]: No , ma'am ; THAT 'S not what he wants ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 11]: `` No , it is n't , '' Walter said .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 33]: In the darkness his face could not be seen ; he stood motionless , in what seemed an apathetic attitude ; and he spoke quietly , `` No , '' he repeated .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 9]: `` That is n't what I want . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 52]: `` You stay down at that place , '' Adams went on , hotly , `` instead of trying to be a little use to your family ; and the only reason you 're ALLOWED to stay there is because Mr. Lamb 's never happened to notice you ARE still there !
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 20]: You just wait -- '' `` You 're off , '' Walter said , in the same quiet way .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 7]: `` He knows I 'm there .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 19]: He spoke to me yesterday : he asked me how I was getting along with my work . ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 5]: `` He did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: Adams said , seeming not to believe him .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: He did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 10]: `` What else did he say , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 4]: `` Nothin ' .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 5]: Just walked on . ''
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 15]: `` I do n't believe he knew who you were , '' Adams declared .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 4]: `` Think not ?
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 9]: He called me ` Walter Adams . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 28]: At this Adams was silent ; and Walter , after waiting a moment , said : `` Well , are you going to do anything about me ?
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 11]: About what I told you I got to have ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 8]: `` What is it , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 10]: his mother asked , since Adams did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 36]: Walter cleared his throat , and replied in a tone as quiet as that he had used before , though with a slight huskiness , `` I got to have three hundred and fifty dollars .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 14]: You better get him to give it to me if you can . ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 5]: Adams found his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' he said , bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 7]: `` That 's all he asks !
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 23]: He wo n't do anything I ask HIM to , and in return he asks me for three hundred and fifty dollars !
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 5]: That 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 7]: `` What in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 7]: `` What FOR , Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 11]: `` I got to have it , '' Walter said .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 6]: `` But what FOR ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 7]: His quiet huskiness did not alter .
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: `` I got to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 17]: `` But ca n't you tell us -- '' `` I got to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 15]: `` That 's all you can get out of him , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 17]: `` He seems to think it 'll bring him in three hundred and fifty dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 10]: A faint tremulousness became evident in the husky voice .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 8]: `` Have n't you got it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 10]: `` NO , I have n't got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 4]: his father answered .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 18]: `` And I 've got to go to a bank for more than my pay-roll next week .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 9]: Do you think I 'm a mint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 20]: `` I do n't understand what you mean , Walter , '' Mrs. Adams interposed , perplexed and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 47]: `` If your father had the money , of course he 'd need every cent of it , especially just now , and , anyhow , you could scarcely expect him to give it to you , unless you told us what you want with it .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 8]: But he has n't got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 43]: `` All right , '' Walter said ; and after standing a moment more , in silence , he added , impersonally , `` I do n't see as you ever did anything much for me , anyhow either of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 32]: Then , as if this were his valedictory , he turned his back upon them , walked away quickly , and was at once lost to their sight in the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 15]: `` There 's a fine boy to 've had the trouble of raising ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 3]: Adams grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 9]: `` Just crazy , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 16]: `` What in the world do you suppose he wants all that money for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 6]: his wife said , wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 12]: `` I ca n't imagine what he could DO with it .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 7]: I wonder -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 13]: `` I wonder if he -- '' `` If he what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 5]: Adams prompted her irritably .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 10]: `` If he COULD have bad -- associates . ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 5]: `` God knows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 4]: said Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 6]: _ I _ do n't !
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 16]: It just looks to me like he had something in him I do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 25]: You ca n't keep your eye on a boy all the time in a city this size , not a boy Walter 's age .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 18]: You got a girl pretty much in the house , but a boy 'll follow his nature .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 13]: _ I _ do n't know what to do with him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 6]: Mrs. Adams brightened a little .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 12]: `` He 'll come out all right , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 7]: `` I 'm sure he will .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 28]: I 'm sure he 'd never be anything really bad : and he 'll come around all right about the glue-works , too ; you 'll see .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 26]: Of course every young man wants money -- it does n't prove he 's doing anything wrong just because he asks you for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 36]: All it proves to me is that he has n't got good sense asking me for three hundred and fifty dollars , when he knows as well as you do the position I 'm in !
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 23]: If I wanted to , I could n't hardly let him have three hundred and fifty cents , let alone dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 37]: `` I 'm afraid you 'll have to let ME have that much -- and maybe a little more , '' she ventured , timidly ; and she told him of her plans for the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 4]: He objected vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 18]: `` Oh , but Alice has probably asked him by this time , '' Mrs. Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 26]: `` It really must be done , Virgil : you do n't want him to think she 's ashamed of us , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 17]: `` Well , go ahead , but just let me stay away , '' he begged .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 40]: `` Of course I expect to undergo a kind of talk with him , when he gets ready to say something to us about Alice , but I do hate to have to sit through a fashionable dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 25]: `` Why , it is n't going to bother you , '' she said ; `` just one young man as a guest . ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 51]: `` Yes , I know ; but you want to have all this fancy cookin ' ; and I see well enough you 're going to get that old dress suit out of the cedar chest in the attic , and try to make me put it on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 10]: `` I do think you better , Virgil . ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 14]: `` I hope the moths have got in it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 18]: `` Last time I wore it was to the banquet , and it was pretty old then .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 26]: Of course I did n't mind wearing it to the banquet so much , because that was what you might call quite an occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 65]: He spoke with some reminiscent complacency ; `` the banquet , '' an affair now five years past , having provided the one time in his life when he had been so distinguished among his fellow-citizens as to receive an invitation to be present , with some seven hundred others , at the annual eating and speech-making of the city 's Chamber of Commerce .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 34]: `` Anyhow , as you say , I think it would look foolish of me to wear a dress suit for just one young man , '' he went on protesting , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 13]: `` What 's the use of all so much howdy-do , anyway ?
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 19]: You do n't expect him to believe we put on all that style every night , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 8]: Is that what you 're after ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 16]: `` Well , we want him to think we live nicely , '' she admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 7]: `` So that 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 5]: he said , querulously .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 15]: `` You want him to think that 's our regular gait , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 55]: Well , he 'll know better about me , no matter how you fix me up , because he saw me in my regular suit the evening she introduced me to him , and he could tell anyway I 'm not one of these moving-picture sporting-men that 's always got a dress suit on .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 18]: Besides , you and Alice certainly have some idea he 'll come AGAIN , have n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 24]: If they get things settled between 'em he 'll be around the house and to meals most any time , wo n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 16]: You do n't hardly expect to put on style all the time , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 22]: Well , he 'll see then that this kind of thing was all show-off , and bluff , wo n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 5]: What about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 20]: `` Oh , well , by THAT time -- '' She left the sentence unfinished , as if absently .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 19]: `` You could let us have a little money for to-morrow , could n't you , honey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 13]: `` Oh , I reckon , I reckon , '' he mumbled .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 37]: `` A girl like Alice is some comfort : she do n't come around acting as if she 'd commit suicide if she did n't get three hundred and fifty dollars in the next five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 18]: I expect I can spare five or six dollars for your show-off if I got to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 29]: However , she finally obtained fifteen before his bedtime ; and the next morning `` went to market '' after breakfast , leaving Alice to make the beds .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 7]: Walter had not yet come downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 23]: `` You had better call him , '' Mrs. Adams said , as she departed with a big basket on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 35]: `` I expect he 's pretty sleepy ; he was out so late last night I did n't hear him come in , though I kept awake till after midnight , listening for him .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 32]: Tell him he 'll be late to work if he does n't hurry ; and see that he drinks his coffee , even if he has n't time for anything else .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 19]: And when Malena comes , get her started in the kitchen : show her where everything is . ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 17]: She waved her hand , as she set out for a corner where the cars stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 6]: `` Everything 'll be lovely .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 7]: Do n't forget about Walter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 11]: Nevertheless , Alice forgot about Walter for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 25]: She closed the door , went into the `` living-room '' absently , and stared vaguely at one of the old brown-plush rocking-chairs there .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 23]: Upon her forehead were the little shadows of an apprehensive reverie , and her thoughts overlapped one another in a fretful jumble .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 6]: `` What will he think ?
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 8]: These old chairs -- they 're hideous .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 18]: I 'll scrub those soot-streaks on the columns : it wo n't do any good , though .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 12]: That long crack in the column -- nothing can help it .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 7]: What will he think of papa ?
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 9]: I hope mama wo n't talk too much .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 36]: When he thinks of Mildred 's house , or of Henrietta 's , or any of 'em , beside this -- She said she 'd buy plenty of roses ; that ought to help some .
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 26]: Nothing could be done about these horrible chairs : ca n't take 'em up in the attic -- a room 's got to have chairs !
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 5]: Might have rented some .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 15]: No ; if he ever comes again he 'd see they were n't here .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 17]: ` If he ever comes again ' -- oh , it wo n't be THAT bad !
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 9]: But it wo n't be what he expects .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 23]: I 'm responsible for what he expects : he expects just what the airs I 've put on have made him expect .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 22]: What did I want to pose so to him for -- as if papa were a wealthy man and all that ?
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 5]: What WILL he think ?
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 13]: The photograph of the Colosseum 's a rather good thing , though .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 14]: It helps some -- as if we 'd bought it in Rome perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 17]: I hope he 'll think so ; he believes I 've been abroad , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 18]: The other night he said , ` You remember the feeling you get in the Sainte-Chapelle ' .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 21]: -- There 's another lie of mine , not saying I did n't remember because I 'd never been there .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 6]: What makes me do it ?
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 7]: Papa MUST wear his evening clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 21]: But Walter -- '' With that she recalled her mother 's admonition , and went upstairs to Walter 's door .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 8]: She tapped upon it with her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 8]: `` Time to get up , Walter .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 19]: The rest of us had breakfast over half an hour ago , and it 's nearly eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 5]: You 'll be late .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 15]: Hurry down and I 'll have some coffee and toast ready for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 14]: There came no sound from within the room , so she rapped louder .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 7]: `` Wake up , Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 28]: She called and rapped again , without getting any response , and then , finding that the door yielded to her , opened it and went in .
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 5]: Walter was not there .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 41]: He had been there , however ; had slept upon the bed , though not inside the covers ; and Alice supposed he must have come home so late that he had been too sleepy to take off his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 34]: Near the foot of the bed was a shallow closet where he kept his `` other suit '' and his evening clothes ; and the door stood open , showing a bare wall .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 18]: Nothing whatever was in the closet , and Alice was rather surprised at this for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 61]: `` That 's queer , '' she murmured ; and then she decided that when he woke he found the clothes he had slept in `` so mussy '' he had put on his `` other suit , '' and had gone out before breakfast with the mussed clothes to have them pressed , taking his evening things with them .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 53]: Satisfied with this explanation , and failing to observe that it did not account for the absence of shoes from the closet floor , she nodded absently , `` Yes , that must be it '' ; and , when her mother returned , told her that Walter had probably breakfasted down-town .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 21]: They did not delay over this ; the coloured woman had arrived , and the basket 's disclosures were important .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 22]: `` I stopped at Worlig 's on the way back , '' said Mrs. Adams , flushed with hurry and excitement .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 9]: `` I bought a can of caviar there .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 61]: I thought we 'd have little sandwiches brought into the ` living-room ' before dinner , the way you said they did when you went to that dinner at the -- '' `` But I think that was to go with cocktails , mama , and of course we have n't -- '' `` No , '' Mrs. Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 10]: `` Still , I think it would be nice .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 20]: We can make them look very dainty , on a tray , and the waitress can bring them in .
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 33]: I thought we 'd have the soup already on the table ; and we can walk right out as soon as we have the sandwiches , so it wo n't get cold .
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 27]: Then , after the soup , Malena says she can make sweetbread pates with mushrooms : and for the meat course we 'll have larded fillet .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 22]: Malena 's really a fancy cook , you know , and she says she can do anything like that to perfection .
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 15]: We 'll have peas with the fillet , and potato balls and Brussels sprouts .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 12]: Brussels sprouts are fashionable now , they told me at market .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 50]: Then will come the chicken salad , and after that the ice-cream -- she 's going to make an angel-food cake to go with it -- and then coffee and crackers and a new kind of cheese I got at Worlig 's , he says is very fine . ''
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 4]: Alice was alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 14]: `` Do n't you think perhaps it 's too much , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 19]: `` It 's better to have too much than too little , '' her mother said , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 15]: `` We do n't want him to think we 're the kind that skimp .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 14]: Lord knows we have to enough , though , most of the time !
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 8]: Get the flowers in water , child .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 21]: I bought 'em at market because they 're so much cheaper there , but they 'll keep fresh and nice .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 8]: You fix 'em any way you want .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 2]: Hurry !
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 10]: It 's got to be a busy day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 8]: She had bought three dozen little roses .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 27]: Alice took them and began to arrange them in vases , keeping the stems separated as far as possible so that the clumps would look larger .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 38]: She put half a dozen in each of three vases in the `` living-room , '' placing one vase on the table in the center of the room , and one at each end of the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 30]: Then she took the rest of the roses to the dining-room ; but she postponed the arrangement of them until the table should be set , just before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 43]: She was thoughtful ; planning to dry the stems and lay them on the tablecloth like a vine of roses running in a delicate design , if she found that the dozen and a half she had left were enough for that .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 12]: If they were n't she would arrange them in a vase .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 42]: She looked a long time at the little roses in the basin of water , where she had put them ; then she sighed , and went away to heavier tasks , while her mother worked in the kitchen with Malena .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 39]: Alice dusted the `` living-room '' and the dining-room vigorously , though all the time with a look that grew more and more pensive ; and having dusted everything , she wiped the furniture ; rubbed it hard .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 11]: After that , she washed the floors and the woodwork .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 32]: Emerging from the kitchen at noon , Mrs. Adams found her daughter on hands and knees , scrubbing the bases of the columns between the hall and the `` living-room . ''
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 26]: `` Now , dearie , '' she said , `` you must n't tire yourself out , and you 'd better come and eat something .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 42]: Your father said he 'd get a bite down-town to-day -- he was going down to the bank -- and Walter eats down-town all the time lately , so I thought we would n't bother to set the table for lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 12]: Come on and we 'll have something in the kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 17]: `` No , '' Alice said , dully , as she went on with the work .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 8]: `` I do n't want anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 7]: Her mother came closer to her .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 9]: `` Why , what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 5]: she asked , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 23]: `` You seem kind of pale , to me ; and you do n't look -- you do n't look HAPPY . ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 14]: `` Well -- '' Alice began , uncertainly , but said no more .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: `` See here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 8]: `` This is all just for you !
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 7]: You ought to be ENJOYING it .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 21]: Why , it 's the first time we 've -- we 've entertained in I do n't know how long !
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 16]: I guess it 's almost since we had that little party when you were eighteen .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 8]: What 's the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 6]: I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 15]: `` But , dearie , are n't you looking FORWARD to this evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 12]: The girl looked up , showing a pallid and solemn face .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 17]: `` Oh , yes , of course , '' she said , and tried to smile .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 17]: `` Of course we had to do it -- I do think it 'll be nice .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 10]: Of course I 'm looking forward to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 57]: CHAPTER XX She was indeed `` looking forward '' to that evening , but in a cloud of apprehension ; and , although she could never have guessed it , this was the simultaneous condition of another person -- none other than the guest for whose pleasure so much cooking and scrubbing seemed to be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 22]: Moreover , Mr. Arthur Russell 's premonitions were no product of mere coincidence ; neither had any magical sympathy produced them .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 26]: His state of mind was rather the result of rougher undercurrents which had all the time been running beneath the surface of a romantic friendship .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 62]: Never shrewder than when she analyzed the gentlemen , Alice did not libel him when she said he was one of those quiet men who are a bit flirtatious , by which she meant that he was a bit `` susceptible , '' the same thing -- and he had proved himself susceptible to Alice upon his first sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 5]: he said to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 6]: `` Who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 26]: And in the crowd of girls at his cousin 's dance , all strangers to him , she was the one he wanted to know .
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 40]: Since then , his summer evenings with her had been as secluded as if , for three hours after the falling of dusk , they two had drawn apart from the world to some dear bower of their own .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 42]: The little veranda was that glamorous nook , with a faint golden light falling through the glass of the closed door upon Alice , and darkness elsewhere , except for the one round globe of the street lamp at the corner .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 33]: The people who passed along the sidewalk , now and then , were only shadows with voices , moving vaguely under the maple trees that loomed in obscure contours against the stars .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 44]: So , as the two sat together , the back of the world was the wall and closed door behind them ; and Russell , when he was away from Alice , always thought of her as sitting there before the closed door .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 38]: A glamour was about her thus , and a spell upon him ; but he had a formless anxiety never put into words : all the pictures of her in his mind stopped at the closed door .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 19]: He had another anxiety ; and , for the greater part , this was of her own creating .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 27]: She had too often asked him -LRB- no matter how gaily -RRB- what he heard about her , too often begged him not to hear anything .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 61]: Then , hoping to forestall whatever he might hear , she had been at too great pains to account for it , to discredit and mock it ; and , though he laughed at her for this , telling her truthfully he did not even hear her mentioned , the everlasting irony that deals with all such human forefendings prevailed .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 15]: Lately , he had half confessed to her what a nervousness she had produced .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 16]: `` You make me dread the day when I 'll hear somebody speaking of you .
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 30]: You 're getting me so upset about it that if I ever hear anybody so much as say the name ` Alice Adams , ' I 'll run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 26]: The confession was but half of one because he laughed ; and she took it for an assurance of loyalty in the form of burlesque .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 12]: She misunderstood : he laughed , but his nervousness was genuine .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 39]: After any stroke of events , whether a happy one or a catastrophe , we see that the materials for it were a long time gathering , and the only marvel is that the stroke was not prophesied .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 70]: What bore the air of fatal coincidence may remain fatal indeed , to this later view ; but , with the haphazard aspect dispelled , there is left for scrutiny the same ancient hint from the Infinite to the effect that since events have never yet failed to be law-abiding , perhaps it were well for us to deduce that they will continue to be so until further notice .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 26]: ... On the day that was to open the closed door in the background of his pictures of Alice , Russell lunched with his relatives .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 23]: There were but the four people , Russell and Mildred and her mother and father , in the great , cool dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 39]: Arched French windows , shaded by awnings , admitted a mellow light and looked out upon a green lawn ending in a long conservatory , which revealed through its glass panes a carnival of plants in luxuriant blossom .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 24]: From his seat at the table , Russell glanced out at this pretty display , and informed his cousins that he was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 31]: `` You have such a glorious spread of flowers all over the house , '' he said , `` I did n't suppose you 'd have any left out yonder .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 18]: In fact , I did n't know there were so many splendid flowers in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 37]: Mrs. Palmer , large , calm , fair , like her daughter , responded with a mild reproach : `` That 's because you have n't been cousinly enough to get used to them , Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 13]: You 've almost taught us to forget what you look like . ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 10]: In defense Russell waved a hand toward her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 23]: `` You see , he 's begun to keep me so hard at work -- '' But Mr. Palmer declined the responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 16]: `` Up to four or five in the afternoon , perhaps , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 21]: `` After that , the young gentleman is as much a stranger to me as he is to my family .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 10]: I 've been wondering who she could be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 14]: `` When a man 's preoccupied there must be a lady then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 3]: Russell inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 16]: `` That seems to be the view of your sex , '' Mrs. Palmer suggested .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 18]: `` It was my husband who said it , not Mildred or I. '' Mildred smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 27]: `` Papa may be singular in his ideas ; they may come entirely from his own experience , and have nothing to do with Arthur . ''
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 16]: `` Thank you , Mildred , '' her cousin said , bowing to her gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 17]: `` You seem to understand my character -- and your father 's quite as well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 42]: However , Mildred remained grave in the face of this customary pleasantry , not because the old jest , worn round , like what preceded it , rolled in an old groove , but because of some preoccupation of her own .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 44]: Her faint smile had disappeared , and , as her cousin 's glance met hers , she looked down ; yet not before he had seen in her eyes the flicker of something like a question -- a question both poignant and dismayed .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 20]: He may have understood it ; for his own smile vanished at once in favour of a reciprocal solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 19]: `` You see , Arthur , '' Mrs. Palmer said , `` Mildred is always a good cousin .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 21]: She and I stand by you , even if you do stay away from us for weeks and weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 44]: Then , observing that he appeared to be so occupied with a bunch of iced grapes upon his plate that he had not heard her , she began to talk to her husband , asking him what was `` going on down-town . ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 20]: Arthur continued to eat his grapes , but he ventured to look again at Mildred after a few moments .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 26]: She , also , appeared to be occupied with a bunch of grapes though she ate none , and only pulled them from their stems .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 60]: She sat straight , her features as composed and pure as those of a new marble saint in a cathedral niche ; yet her downcast eyes seemed to conceal many thoughts ; and her cousin , against his will , was more aware of what these thoughts might be than of the leisurely conversation between her father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 38]: All at once , however , he heard something that startled him , and he listened -- and here was the effect of all Alice 's forefendings ; he listened from the first with a sinking heart .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 25]: Mr. Palmer , mildly amused by what he was telling his wife , had just spoken the words , `` this Virgil Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 18]: What he had said was , `` this Virgil Adams -- that 's the man 's name .
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 4]: Queer case . ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 6]: `` Who told you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 8]: Mrs. Palmer inquired , not much interested .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 9]: `` Alfred Lamb , '' her husband answered .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 12]: `` He was laughing about his father , at the club .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 37]: You see the old gentleman takes a great pride in his judgment of men , and always boasted to his sons that he 'd never in his life made a mistake in trusting the wrong man .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 33]: Now Alfred and James Albert , Junior , think they have a great joke on him ; and they 've twitted him so much about it he 'll scarcely speak to them .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 24]: From the first , Alfred says , the old chap 's only repartee was , ` You wait and you 'll see ! '
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 26]: And they 've asked him so often to show them what they 're going to see that he wo n't say anything at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 13]: `` He 's a funny old fellow , '' Mrs. Palmer observed .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 19]: `` But he 's so shrewd I ca n't imagine his being deceived for such a long time .
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 7]: Twenty years , you said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 10]: `` Yes , longer than that , I understand .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 41]: It appears when this man -- this Adams -- was a young clerk , the old gentleman trusted him with one of his business secrets , a glue process that Mr. Lamb had spent some money to get hold of .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 27]: The old chap thought this Adams was going to have quite a future with the Lamb concern , and of course never dreamed he was dishonest .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 59]: Alfred says this Adams has n't been of any real use for years , and they should have let him go as dead wood , but the old gentleman would n't hear of it , and insisted on his being kept on the payroll ; so they just decided to look on it as a sort of pension .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 53]: Well , one morning last March the man had an attack of some sort down there , and Mr. Lamb got his own car out and went home with him , himself , and worried about him and went to see him no end , all the time he was ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 11]: `` He would , '' Mrs. Palmer said , approvingly .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 12]: `` He 's a kind-hearted creature , that old man . ''
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 4]: Her husband laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: `` Alfred says he thinks his kind-heartedness is about cured !
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 23]: It seems that as soon as the man got well again he deliberately walked off with the old gentleman 's glue secret .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 5]: Just calmly stole it !
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 29]: Alfred says he believes that if he had a stroke in the office now , himself , his father would n't lift a finger to help him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 10]: Mrs. Palmer repeated the name to herself thoughtfully . ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 9]: ` Adams ' -- ` Virgil Adams . '
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 9]: You said his name was Virgil Adams ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 6]: She looked at her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 17]: `` Why , you know who that is , Mildred , '' she said , casually .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 13]: `` It 's that Alice Adams 's father , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 8]: Was n't his name Virgil Adams ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 10]: `` I think it is , '' Mildred said .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 7]: Mrs. Palmer turned toward her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 9]: `` You 've seen this Alice Adams here .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 11]: Mr. Lamb 's pet swindler must be her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 23]: Mr. Palmer passed a smooth hand over his neat gray hair , which was not disturbed by this effort to stimulate recollection .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 6]: `` Of course -- certainly .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 11]: Quite a good-looking girl -- one of Mildred 's friends .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 4]: How queer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 16]: Mildred looked up , as if in a little alarm , but did not speak .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 6]: Her mother set matters straight .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 38]: `` Fathers ARE amusing , '' she said smilingly to Russell , who was looking at her , though how fixedly she did not notice ; for she turned from him at once to enlighten her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 35]: `` Every girl who meets Mildred , and tries to push the acquaintance by coming here until the poor child has to hide , is n't a FRIEND of hers , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 16]: Mildred 's eyes were downcast again , and a faint colour rose in her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 24]: `` Oh , I should n't put it quite that way about Alice Adams , '' she said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 10]: `` I saw something of her for a time .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 9]: She 's not unattractive in a way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 10]: Mrs. Palmer settled the whole case of Alice carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 11]: `` A pushing sort of girl , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 8]: `` A very pushing little person . ''
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 21]: `` I -- '' Mildred began ; and , after hesitating , concluded , `` I rather dropped her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 14]: `` Fortunate you 've done so , '' her father remarked , cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 13]: `` Especially since various members of the Lamb connection are here frequently .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 17]: They might n't think you 'd show great tact in having her about the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 9]: He laughed , and turned to his cousin .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 11]: `` All this is n't very interesting to poor Arthur .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 22]: How terrible people are with a newcomer in a town ; they talk as if he knew all about everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 19]: `` But we do n't know anything about these queer people , ourselves , '' said Mrs. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 23]: `` We know something about the girl , of course -- she used to be a bit too conspicuous , in fact !
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 17]: However , as you say , we might find a subject more interesting for Arthur . ''
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 8]: She smiled whimsically upon the young man .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 9]: `` Tell the truth , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 15]: `` Do n't you fairly detest going into business with that tyrant yonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 8]: Yes -- I beg your pardon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 3]: he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 13]: `` You were right , '' Mrs. Palmer said to her husband .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 22]: `` You 've bored him so , talking about thievish clerks , he ca n't even answer an honest question . ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 10]: But Russell was beginning to recover his outward composure .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 9]: `` Try me again , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid I was thinking of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 9]: This was the best he found to say .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 29]: There was a part of him that wanted to protest and deny , but he had not heat enough , in the chill that had come upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 81]: Here was the first `` mention '' of Alice , and with it the reason why it was the first : Mr. Palmer had difficulty in recalling her , and she happened to be spoken of , only because her father 's betrayal of a benefactor 's trust had been so peculiarly atrocious that , in the view of the benefactor 's family , it contained enough of the element of humour to warrant a mild laugh at a club .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 17]: There was the deadliness of the story : its lack of malice , even of resentment .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 38]: Deadlier still were Mrs. Palmer 's phrases : `` a pushing sort of girl , '' `` a very pushing little person , '' and `` used to be a bit TOO conspicuous , in fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 29]: But she spoke placidly and by chance ; being as obviously without unkindly motive as Mr. Palmer was when he related the cause of Alfred Lamb 's amusement .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 26]: Her opinion of the obscure young lady momentarily her topic had been expressed , moreover , to her husband , and at her own table .
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 53]: She sat there , large , kind , serene -- a protest might astonish but could not change her ; and Russell , crumpling in his strained fingers the lace-edged little web of a napkin on his knee , found heart enough to grow red , but not enough to challenge her .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 26]: She noticed his colour , and attributed it to the embarrassment of a scrupulously gallant gentleman caught in a lapse of attention to a lady .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 12]: `` Do n't be disturbed , '' she said , benevolently .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 14]: `` People are n't expected to listen all the time to their relatives .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 20]: A high colour 's very becoming to you , Arthur ; but it really is n't necessary between cousins .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 17]: You can always be informal enough with us to listen only when you care to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 25]: His complexion continued to be ruddier than usual , however , throughout the meal , and was still somewhat tinted when Mrs. Palmer rose .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 19]: `` The man 's bringing you cigarettes here , '' she said , nodding to the two gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 20]: `` We 'll give you a chance to do the sordid kind of talking we know you really like .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 21]: Afterwhile , Mildred will show you what 's in bloom in the hothouse , if you wish , Arthur . ''
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 47]: Mildred followed her , and , when they were alone in another of the spacious rooms , went to a window and looked out , while her mother seated herself near the center of the room in a gilt armchair , mellowed with old Aubusson tapestry .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 24]: Mrs. Palmer looked thoughtfully at her daughter 's back , but did not speak to her until coffee had been brought for them .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 23]: `` Thanks , '' Mildred said , not turning , `` I do n't care for any coffee , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 6]: Mrs. Palmer said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 17]: `` I 'm afraid our good-looking cousin wo n't think you 're very talkative , Mildred .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 8]: You spoke only about twice at lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 26]: I should n't care for him to get the idea you 're piqued because he 's come here so little lately , should you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 30]: `` No , I should n't , '' Mildred answered in a low voice , and with that she turned quickly , and came to sit near her mother .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 10]: `` But it 's what I am afraid of !
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 11]: Mama , did you notice how red he got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 15]: `` You mean when he was caught not listening to a question of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 10]: Yes ; it 's very becoming to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: `` Mama , I do n't think that was the reason .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 16]: I do n't think it was because he was n't listening , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 37]: `` I think his colour and his not listening came from the same reason , '' Mildred said , and although she had come to sit near her mother , she did not look at her .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 14]: `` I think it happened because you and papa -- '' She stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 10]: Mrs. Palmer said , good-naturedly , to prompt her .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 10]: `` Your father and I did something embarrassing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 17]: `` Mama , it was because of those things that came out about Alice Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 7]: `` How could that bother Arthur ?
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 6]: Does he know her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 7]: `` Do n't you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 4]: the daughter asked .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 25]: `` The day after my dance I mentioned how odd I thought it was in him -- I was a little disappointed in him .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 34]: I 'd been seeing that he met everybody , of course , but she was the only girl HE asked to meet ; and he did it as soon as he noticed her .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 66]: I had n't meant to have him meet her -- in fact , I was rather sorry I 'd felt I had to ask her , because she oh , well , she 's the sort that ` tries for the new man , ' if she has half a chance ; and sometimes they seem quite fascinated -- for a time , that is .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 23]: I thought Arthur was above all that ; or at the very least I gave him credit for being too sophisticated . ''
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 11]: `` I see , '' Mrs. Palmer said , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 10]: `` I remember now that you spoke of it .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 33]: You said it seemed a little peculiar , but of course it really was n't : a ` new man ' has nothing to go by , except his own first impressions .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 16]: You ca n't blame poor Arthur -- she 's quite a piquant looking little person .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 12]: You think he 's seen something of her since then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 4]: Mildred nodded slowly .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 27]: `` I never dreamed such a thing till yesterday , and even then I rather doubted it -- till he got so red , just now !
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 40]: I was surprised when he asked to meet her , but he just danced with her once and did n't mention her afterward ; I forgot all about it -- in fact , I virtually forgot all about HER .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 18]: I 'd seen quite a little of her -- '' `` Yes , '' said Mrs. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 8]: `` She did keep coming here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 19]: `` But I 'd just about decided that it really would n't do , '' Mildred went on .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 14]: `` She is n't -- well , I did n't admire her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 22]: `` No , '' her mother assented , and evidently followed a direct connection of thought in a speech apparently irrelevant .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 11]: `` I understand the young Malone wants to marry Henrietta .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 16]: I hope she wo n't ; he seems rather a gross type of person . ''
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 12]: `` Oh , he 's just one , '' Mildred said .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 20]: `` I do n't know that he and Alice Adams were ever engaged -- she never told me so .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 53]: She may not have been engaged to any of them ; she was just enough among the other girls to get talked about -- and one of the reasons I felt a little inclined to be nice to her was that they seemed to be rather edging her out of the circle .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 13]: It was n't long before I saw they were right , though .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 45]: I happened to mention I was going to give a dance and she pretended to take it as a matter of course that I meant to invite her brother -- at least , I thought she pretended ; she may have really believed it .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 31]: At any rate , I had to send him a card ; but I did n't intend to be let in for that sort of thing again , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 20]: She 's what you said , ` pushing ' ; though I 'm awfully sorry you said it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 13]: `` Why should n't I have said it , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 13]: `` Of course I did n't say ` should n't . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 5]: Mildred explained , gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 12]: `` I meant only that I 'm sorry it happened . ''
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 7]: `` Yes ; but why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 38]: `` Mama '' -- Mildred turned to her , leaning forward and speaking in a lowered voice -- `` Mama , at first the change was so little it seemed as if Arthur hardly knew it himself .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 58]: He 'd been lovely to me always , and he was still lovely to me but -- oh , well , you 've understood -- after my dance it was more as if it was just his nature and his training to be lovely to me , as he would be to everyone a kind of politeness .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 19]: He 'd never said he CARED for me , but after that I could see he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 7]: It was clear -- after that .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 18]: I did n't know what had happened ; I could n't think of anything I 'd done .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 8]: Mama -- it was Alice Adams . ''
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 39]: Mrs. Palmer set her little coffee-cup upon the table beside her , calmly following her own motion with her eyes , and not seeming to realize with what serious entreaty her daughter 's gaze was fixed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 16]: Mildred repeated the last sentence of her revelation , and introduced a stress of insistence .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 9]: `` Mama , it WAS Alice Adams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 29]: But Mrs. Palmer declined to be greatly impressed , so far as her appearance went , at least ; and to emphasize her refusal , she smiled indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 8]: `` What makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 7]: `` Henrietta told me yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 11]: At this Mrs. Palmer permitted herself to laugh softly aloud .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 4]: `` Good heavens !
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 5]: Is Henrietta a soothsayer ?
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 9]: Or is she Arthur 's particular confidante ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 6]: Ella Dowling told her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 6]: Mrs. Palmer 's laughter continued .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 7]: `` Now we have it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 34]: `` It 's a game of gossip : Arthur tells Ella , Ella tells Henrietta , and Henrietta tells -- '' `` Do n't laugh , please , mama , '' Mildred begged .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 9]: `` Of course Arthur did n't tell anybody .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 10]: It 's roundabout enough , but it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 4]: I know it !
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 19]: I had n't quite believed it , but I knew it was true when he got so red .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 15]: He looked -- oh , for a second or so he looked -- stricken !
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 8]: He thought I did n't notice it .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 13]: Mama , he 's been to see her almost every evening lately .
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 6]: They take long walks together .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 10]: That 's why he has n't been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 21]: Of Mrs. Palmer 's laughter there was left only her indulgent smile , which she had not allowed to vanish .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 4]: `` Mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Mrs. Palmer .
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 6]: `` What of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 8]: `` But do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 22]: Mildred 's well-tutored voice , though modulated and repressed even in her present emotion , nevertheless had a tendency to quaver .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 5]: `` It 's true .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 26]: Frank Dowling was going to see her one evening and he saw Arthur sitting on the stoop with her , and did n't go in .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 18]: And Ella used to go to school with a girl who lives across the street from here .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 16]: She told Ella -- '' `` Oh , I understand , '' Mrs. Palmer interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 7]: `` Suppose he does go there .
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 13]: My dear , I said , ` What of it ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 11]: `` I do n't see what you mean , mama .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 44]: I 'm so afraid he might think we knew about it , and that you and papa said those things about her and her father on that account -- as if we abused them because he goes there instead of coming here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 30]: Mrs. Palmer rose , went to a window , and , turning there , stood with her back to it , facing her daughter and looking at her cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 6]: `` Nonsense , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 17]: It was perfectly clear that she was mentioned by accident , and so was her father .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 5]: What an extraordinary man !
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 23]: If Arthur makes friends with people like that , he certainly knows better than to expect to hear favourable opinions of them .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 13]: Besides , it 's only a little passing thing with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 3]: `` Mama !
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 18]: When he goes there almost every -- '' `` Yes , '' Mrs. Palmer said , dryly .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 21]: `` It seems to me I 've heard somewhere that other young men have gone there ` almost every ! '
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 7]: She does n't last , apparently .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 23]: Arthur 's gallant , and he 's impressionable -- but he 's fastidious , and fastidiousness is always the check on impressionableness .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 19]: A girl belongs to her family , too -- and this one does especially , it strikes me !
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 14]: Arthur 's very sensible ; he sees more than you 'd think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 6]: Mildred looked at her hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 23]: `` Then you do n't believe he 's likely to imagine we said those things of her in any meaning way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 8]: At this , Mrs. Palmer laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 15]: `` There 's one thing you seem not to have noticed , Mildred . ''
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 16]: `` It seems to have escaped your attention that he never said a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 8]: `` Might n't that mean -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 7]: Mildred began , but she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 15]: `` No , it might n't , '' her mother replied , comprehending easily .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 27]: `` On the contrary , it might mean that instead of his feeling it too deeply to speak , he was getting a little illumination . ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 7]: Mildred rose and came to her .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 13]: `` WHY do you suppose he never told us he went there ?
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 21]: Do you think he 's -- do you think he 's pleased with her , and yet ashamed of it ?
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 12]: WHY do you suppose he 's never spoken of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 20]: `` Ah , that , '' Mrs. Palmer said , -- `` that might possibly be her own doing .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 36]: If it is , she 's well paid by what your father and I said , because we would n't have said it if we 'd known that Arthur -- '' She checked herself quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 30]: Looking over her daughter 's shoulder , she saw the two gentlemen coming from the corridor toward the wide doorway of the room ; and she greeted them cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 40]: `` If you 've finished with each other for a while , '' she added , `` Arthur may find it a relief to put his thoughts on something prettier than a trust company -- and more fragrant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 5]: Arthur came to Mildred .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 32]: `` Your mother said at lunch that perhaps you 'd -- '' `` I did n't say ` perhaps , ' Arthur , '' Mrs. Palmer interrupted , to correct him .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 6]: `` I said she would .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 20]: If you care to see and smell those lovely things out yonder , she 'll show them to you .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 6]: Run along , children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 23]: Half an hour later , glancing from a window , she saw them come from the hothouses and slowly cross the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 13]: Arthur had a fine rose in his buttonhole and looked profoundly thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 57]: CHAPTER XXI That morning and noon had been warm , though the stirrings of a feeble breeze made weather not flagrantly intemperate ; but at about three o'clock in the afternoon there came out of the southwest a heat like an affliction sent upon an accursed people , and the air was soon dead of it .
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 53]: Dripping negro ditch-diggers whooped with satires praising hell and hot weather , as the tossing shovels flickered up to the street level , where sluggish male pedestrians carried coats upon hot arms , and fanned themselves with straw hats , or , remaining covered , wore soaked handkerchiefs between scalp and straw .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 93]: Clerks drooped in silent , big department stores , stenographers in offices kept as close to electric fans as the intervening bulk of their employers would let them ; guests in hotels left the lobbies and went to lie unclad upon their beds ; while in hospitals the patients murmured querulously against the heat , and perhaps against some noisy motorist who strove to feel the air by splitting it , not troubled by any foreboding that he , too , that hour next week , might need quiet near a hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 48]: The `` hot spell '' was a true spell , one upon men 's spirits ; for it was so hot that , in suburban outskirts , golfers crept slowly back over the low undulations of their club lands , abandoning their matches and returning to shelter .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 17]: Even on such a day , sizzling work had to be done , as in winter .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 78]: There were glowing furnaces to be stoked , liquid metals to be poured ; but such tasks found seasoned men standing to them ; and in all the city probably no brave soul challenged the heat more gamely than Mrs. Adams did , when , in a corner of her small and fiery kitchen , where all day long her hired African immune cooked fiercely , she pressed her husband 's evening clothes with a hot iron .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 22]: No doubt she risked her life , but she risked it cheerfully in so good and necessary a service for him .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 22]: She would have given her life for him at any time , and both his and her own for her children .
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 20]: Unconscious of her own heroism , she was surprised to find herself rather faint when she finished her ironing .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 44]: However , she took heart to believe that the clothes looked better , in spite of one or two scorched places ; and she carried them upstairs to her husband 's room before increasing blindness forced her to grope for the nearest chair .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 53]: Then , trying to rise and walk , without having sufficiently recovered , she had to sit down again ; but after a little while she was able to get upon her feet ; and , keeping her hand against the wall , moved successfully to the door of her own room .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 48]: Here she wavered ; might have gone down , had she not been stimulated by the thought of how much depended upon her ; -- she made a final great effort , and floundered across the room to her bureau , where she kept some simple restoratives .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 19]: They served her need , or her faith in them did ; and she returned to her work .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 37]: She went down the stairs , keeping a still tremulous hand upon the rail ; but she smiled brightly when Alice looked up from below , where the woodwork was again being tormented with superfluous attentions .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 7]: `` Alice , DO N'T ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 6]: her mother said , commiseratingly .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 12]: `` You did all that this morning and it looks lovely .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 11]: What 's the use of wearing yourself out on it ?
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 16]: You ought to be lying down , so 's to look fresh for to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 10]: `` Had n't you better lie down yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 4]: the daughter returned .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 8]: `` Are you ill , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 10]: What in the world makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 14]: `` You look pretty pale , '' Alice said , and sighed heavily .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 16]: `` It makes me ashamed , having you work so hard -- for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 4]: `` How foolish !
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 17]: I think it 's fun , getting ready to entertain a little again , like this .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 28]: I only wish it had n't turned so hot : I 'm afraid your poor father 'll suffer -- his things are pretty heavy , I noticed .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 20]: Well , it 'll do him good to bear something for style 's sake this once , anyhow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 14]: She laughed , and coming to Alice , bent down and kissed her .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 30]: `` Dearie , '' she said , tenderly , `` would n't you please slip upstairs now and take just a little teeny nap to please your mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 15]: But Alice responded only by moving her head slowly , in token of refusal .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 4]: `` Do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams urged .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 14]: `` You do n't want to look worn out , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 13]: `` I 'll LOOK all right , '' Alice said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 13]: `` Do you like the way I 've arranged the furniture now ?
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 12]: I 've tried all the different ways it 'll go . ''
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 12]: `` It 's lovely , '' her mother said , admiringly .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 14]: `` I thought the last way you had it was pretty , too .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 14]: But you know best ; I never knew anybody with so much taste .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 43]: If you 'd only just quit now , and take a little rest -- '' `` There 'd hardly be time , even if I wanted to ; it 's after five but I could n't ; really , I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 23]: How do you think we can manage about Walter -- to see that he wears his evening things , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams pondered .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 20]: `` I 'm afraid he 'll make a lot of objections , on account of the weather and everything .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 16]: I wish we 'd had a chance to tell him last night or this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 38]: I 'd have telephoned to him this afternoon except -- well , I scarcely like to call him up at that place , since your father -- '' `` No , of course not , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 34]: `` If Walter gets home late , '' Mrs. Adams went on , `` I 'll just slip out and speak to him , in case Mr. Russell 's here before he comes .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 17]: I 'll just tell him he 's got to hurry and get his things on . ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 17]: `` Maybe he wo n't come home to dinner , '' Alice suggested , rather hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 7]: `` Sometimes he does n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 10]: `` No ; I think he 'll be here .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 26]: When he does n't come he usually telephones by this time to say not to wait for him ; he 's very thoughtful about that .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 22]: Well , it really is getting late : I must go and tell her she ought to be preparing her fillet .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 8]: Dearie , DO rest a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 33]: `` You 'd much better do that yourself , '' Alice called after her , but Mrs. Adams shook her head cheerily , not pausing on her way to the fiery kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 83]: Alice continued her useless labours for a time ; then carried her bucket to the head of the cellar stairway , where she left it upon the top step ; and , closing the door , returned to the `` living-room ; '' Again she changed the positions of the old plush rocking-chairs , moving them into the corners where she thought they might be least noticeable ; and while thus engaged she was startled by a loud ringing of the door-bell .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 39]: For a moment her face was panic-stricken , and she stood staring , then she realized that Russell would not arrive for another hour , at the earliest , and recovering her equipoise , went to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 28]: Waiting there , in a languid attitude , was a young coloured woman , with a small bundle under her arm and something malleable in her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 7]: `` Listen , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 10]: `` You folks expectin ' a coloured lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 9]: `` Especially not at the front door . ''
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 10]: `` Listen , '' the coloured woman said again .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 3]: `` Listen .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 4]: Say , listen .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 12]: Ai n't they another coloured lady awready here by the day ?
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 2]: Listen .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 13]: Ai n't Miz Malena Burns here by the day this evenin ' ?
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 4]: Say , listen .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 9]: This the number house she give ME . ''
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 7]: `` Are you the waitress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 5]: Alice asked , dismally .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm , if Malena here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 31]: `` Malena is here , '' Alice said , and hesitated ; but she decided not to send the waitress to the back door ; it might be a risk .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 5]: She let her in .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 7]: `` What 's your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 3]: `` Me ?
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 6]: I 'm name ' Gertrude .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 5]: Miss Gertrude Collamus . ''
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 10]: `` Did you bring a cap and apron ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 10]: Gertrude took the little bundle from under her arm .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 7]: I 'm all fix ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 12]: `` I 've already set the table , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 11]: `` I 'll show you what we want done . ''
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 43]: She led the way to the dining-room , and , after offering some instruction there , received by Gertrude with languor and a slowly moving jaw , she took her into the kitchen , where the cap and apron were put on .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 47]: The effect was not fortunate ; Gertrude 's eyes were noticeably bloodshot , an affliction made more apparent by the white cap ; and Alice drew her mother apart , whispering anxiously , `` Do you suppose it 's too late to get someone else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid it is , '' Mrs. Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 11]: `` Malena says it was hard enough to get HER !
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 18]: You have to pay them so much that they only work when they feel like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 13]: `` Mama , could you ask her to wear her cap straighter ?
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 37]: Every time she moves her head she gets it on one side , and her skirt 's too long behind and too short in front -- and oh , I 've NEVER seen such FEET ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 4]: Alice laughed desolately .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 10]: `` And she MUST quit that terrible chewing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 12]: `` Never mind ; I 'll get to work with her .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 16]: I 'll straighten her out all I can , dearie ; do n't worry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 9]: Mrs. Adams patted her daughter 's shoulder encouragingly .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 24]: `` Now YOU ca n't do another thing , and if you do n't run and begin dressing you wo n't be ready .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 22]: It 'll only take me a minute to dress , myself , and I 'll be down long before you will .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 4]: Run , darling !
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 7]: I 'll look after everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 43]: Alice nodded vaguely , went up to her room , and , after only a moment with her mirror , brought from her closet the dress of white organdie she had worn the night when she met Russell for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 18]: She laid it carefully upon her bed , and began to make ready to put it on .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 16]: Her mother came in , half an hour later , to `` fasten '' her .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 13]: `` I 'M all dressed , '' Mrs. Adams said , briskly .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 8]: `` Of course it does n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 17]: He wo n't know what the rest of us even look like : How could he ?
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 17]: I know I 'm an old SIGHT , but all I want is to look respectable .
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 4]: Do I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 16]: `` You look like the best woman in the world ; that 's all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 8]: Alice said , with a little gulp .
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 10]: Her mother laughed and gave her a final scrutiny .
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 25]: `` You might use just a tiny bit more colour , dearie -- I 'm afraid the excitement 's made you a little pale .
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 6]: And you MUST brighten up !
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 23]: There 's sort of a look in your eyes as if you 'd got in a trance and could n't get out .
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 7]: You 've had it all day .
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 15]: I must run : your father wants me to help him with his studs .
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 40]: Walter has n't come yet , but I 'll look after him ; do n't worry , And you better HURRY , dearie , if you 're going to take any time fixing the flowers on the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 24]: She departed , while Alice sat at the mirror again , to follow her advice concerning a `` tiny bit more colour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 21]: Before she had finished , her father knocked at the door , and , when she responded , came in .
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 36]: He was dressed in the clothes his wife had pressed ; but he had lost substantially in weight since they were made for him ; no one would have thought that they had been pressed .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 16]: They hung from him voluminously , seeming to be the clothes of a larger man .
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 17]: `` Your mother 's gone downstairs , '' he said , in a voice of distress .
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 21]: `` One of the buttonholes in my shirt is too large and I ca n't keep the dang thing fastened .
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 12]: _ I _ do n't know what to do about it !
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 24]: I only got one other white shirt , and it 's kind of ruined : I tried it before I did this one .
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 11]: Do you s ` pose you could do anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 9]: `` I 'll see , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 20]: `` My collar 's got a frayed edge , '' he complained , as she examined his troublesome shirt .
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 28]: `` It 's a good deal like wearing a saw ; but I expect it 'll wilt down flat pretty soon , and not bother me long .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 33]: I 'm liable to wilt down flat , myself , I expect ; I do n't know as I remember any such hot night in the last ten or twelve years . ''
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 18]: He lifted his head and sniffed the flaccid air , which was laden with a heavy odour .
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 11]: `` My , but that smell is pretty strong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 13]: `` Stand still , please , papa , '' Alice begged him .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 14]: `` I ca n't see what 's the matter if you move around .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 12]: How absurd you are about your old glue smell , papa !
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 12]: There is n't a vestige of it , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 12]: `` I did n't mean glue , '' he informed her .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 5]: `` I mean cabbage .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 16]: Is that fashionable now , to have cabbage when there 's company for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 8]: `` That is n't cabbage , papa .
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 6]: It 's Brussels sprouts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 6]: `` Oh , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 22]: I do n't mind it much , because it keeps that glue smell off me , but it 's fairly strong .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 31]: I expect you do n't notice it so much because you been in the house with it all along , and got used to it while it was growing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 10]: `` It is pretty dreadful , '' Alice said .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 9]: `` Are all the windows open downstairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 20]: `` I 'll go down and see , if you 'll just fix that hole up for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid I ca n't , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 14]: `` Not unless you take your shirt off and bring it to me .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 10]: I 'll have to sew the hole smaller . ''
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 21]: `` Oh , well , I 'll go ask your mother to -- '' `` No , '' said Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 9]: `` She 's got everything on her hands .
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 6]: Run and take it off .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 19]: Hurry , papa ; I 've got to arrange the flowers on the table before he comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 16]: He went away , and came back presently , half undressed , bringing the shirt .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 16]: `` There 's ONE comfort , '' he remarked , pensively , as she worked .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 14]: `` I 've got that collar off -- for a while , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 19]: I wish I could go to table like this ; I could stand it a good deal better .
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 14]: Do you seem to be making any headway with the dang thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 22]: `` I think probably I can -- '' Downstairs the door-bell rang , and Alice 's arms jerked with the shock .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 4]: `` Golly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 4]: her father said .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 12]: `` Did you stick your finger with that fool needle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 7]: She gave him a blank stare .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 6]: `` He 's come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 21]: She was not mistaken , for , upon the little veranda , Russell stood facing the closed door at last .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 13]: However , it remained closed for a considerable time after he rang .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 32]: Inside the house the warning summons of the bell was immediately followed by another sound , audible to Alice and her father as a crash preceding a series of muffled falls .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 10]: Then came a distant voice , bitter in complaint .
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 6]: `` Oh , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 3]: said Adams .
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 19]: Alice went to the top of the front stairs , and her mother appeared in the hall below .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 4]: `` Mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams looked up .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 15]: `` It 's all right , '' she said , in a loud whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 8]: `` Gertrude fell down the cellar stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 24]: Somebody left a bucket there , and -- '' She was interrupted by a gasp from Alice , and hastened to reassure her .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 7]: `` Do n't worry , dearie .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 15]: She may limp a little , but -- '' Adams leaned over the banisters .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 7]: `` Did she break anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 4]: his wife whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 34]: She seems upset and angry about it , more than anything else ; but she 's rubbing herself , and she 'll be all right in time to bring in the little sandwiches .
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 2]: Alice !
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 4]: Those flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 6]: `` I know , mama .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 7]: But -- '' `` Hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 5]: Mrs. Adams warned her .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 6]: `` Both of you hurry !
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 7]: I MUST let him in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 15]: She turned to the door , smiling cordially , even before she opened it .
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 25]: `` Do come right in , Mr. Russell , '' she said , loudly , lifting her voice for additional warning to those above .
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 19]: `` I 'm SO glad to receive you informally , this way , in our own little home .
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 25]: There 's a hat-rack here under the stairway , '' she continued , as Russell , murmuring some response , came into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 36]: `` I 'm afraid you 'll think it 's almost TOO informal , my coming to the door , but unfortunately our housemaid 's just had a little accident -- oh , nothing to mention !
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 12]: I just thought we better not keep you waiting any longer .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 10]: Will you step into our living-room , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 45]: She led the way between the two small columns , and seated herself in one of the plush rocking-chairs , selecting it because Alice had once pointed out that the chairs , themselves , were less noticeable when they had people sitting in them .
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 25]: `` Do sit down , Mr. Russell ; it 's so very warm it 's really quite a trial just to stand up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 14]: `` Thank you , '' he said , as he took a seat .
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 6]: It is quite warm . ''
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 14]: And this seemed to be the extent of his responsiveness for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 50]: He was grave , rather pale ; and Mrs. Adams 's impression of him , as she formed it then , was of `` a distinguished-looking young man , really elegant in the best sense of the word , but timid and formal when he first meets you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 27]: She beamed upon him , and used with everything she said a continuous accompaniment of laughter , meaningless except that it was meant to convey cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 18]: `` Of course we DO have a great deal of warm weather , '' she informed him .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 18]: `` I 'm glad it 's so much cooler in the house than it is outdoors . ''
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 7]: `` It is pleasanter indoors . ''
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 27]: And , stopping with this single untruth , he permitted himself the briefest glance about the room ; then his eyes returned to his smiling hostess .
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 15]: `` Most people make a great fuss about hot weather , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 20]: `` The only person I know who does n't mind the heat the way other people do is Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 20]: She always seems as cool as if we had a breeze blowing , no matter how hot it is .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 11]: But then she 's so amiable she never minds anything .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 6]: It 's just her character .
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 23]: She 's always been that way since she was a little child ; always the same to everybody , high and low .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 23]: I think character 's the most important thing in the world , after all , do n't you , Mr. Russell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 19]: `` Yes , '' he said , solemnly ; and touched his bedewed white forehead with a handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 20]: `` Indeed it is , '' she agreed with herself , never failing to continue her murmur of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 30]: `` That 's what I 've always told Alice ; but she never sees anything good in herself , and she just laughs at me when I praise her .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 30]: She sees good in everybody ELSE in the world , no matter how unworthy they are , or how they behave toward HER ; but she always underestimates herself .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 14]: From the time she was a little child she was always that way .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 23]: When some other little girl would behave selfishly or meanly toward her , do you think she 'd come and tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 6]: Never a word to anybody !
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 7]: The little thing was too proud !
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 8]: She was the same way about school .
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 34]: The teachers had to tell me when she took a prize ; she 'd bring it home and keep it in her room without a word about it to her father and mother .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 9]: Now , Walter was just the other way .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 20]: Walter would -- '' But here Mrs. Adams checked herself , though she increased the volume of her laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 7]: `` How silly of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 14]: `` I expect you know how mothers ARE , though , Mr. Russell .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 13]: Give us a chance and we 'll talk about our children forever !
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 19]: Alice would feel terribly if she knew how I 've been going on about her to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 32]: In this Mrs. Adams was right , though she did not herself suspect it , and upon an almost inaudible word or two from him she went on with her topic .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 15]: `` Of course my excuse is that few mothers have a daughter like Alice .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 28]: I suppose we all think the same way about our children , but SOME of us must be right when we feel we 've got the best .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 7]: Do n't you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 5]: Yes , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 10]: `` I 'm sure _ I _ am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 11]: `` I 'll let the others speak for themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 4]: She paused reflectively .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 18]: `` No ; I think a mother knows when she 's got a treasure in her family .
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 24]: If she HAS N'T got one , she 'll pretend she has , maybe ; but if she has , she knows it .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 8]: I certainly know _ I _ have .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 38]: She 's always been what people call ` the joy of the household ' -- always cheerful , no matter what went wrong , and always ready to smooth things over with some bright , witty saying .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 32]: You must be sure not to TELL we 've had this little chat about her -- she 'd just be furious with me -- but she IS such a dear child !
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 10]: You wo n't tell her , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 19]: `` No , '' he said , and again applied the handkerchief to his forehead for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 23]: `` No , I 'll -- '' He paused , and finished lamely : `` I 'll -- not tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 47]: Thus reassured , Mrs. Adams set before him some details of her daughter 's popularity at sixteen , dwelling upon Alice 's impartiality among her young suitors : `` She never could BEAR to hurt their feelings , and always treated all of them just alike .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 13]: About half a dozen of them were just BOUND to marry her !
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 21]: Naturally , her father and I considered any such idea ridiculous ; she was too young , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 38]: Thus the mother went on with her biographical sketches , while the pale young man sat facing her under the hard overhead light of a white globe , set to the ceiling ; and listened without interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 55]: She was glad to have the chance to tell him a few things about Alice he might not have guessed for himself , and , indeed , she had planned to find such an opportunity , if she could ; but this was getting to be altogether too much of one , she felt .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 43]: As time passed , she was like an actor who must improvise to keep the audience from perceiving that his fellow-players have missed their cues ; but her anxiety was not betrayed to the still listener ; she had a valiant soul .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 47]: Alice , meanwhile , had arranged her little roses on the table in as many ways , probably , as there were blossoms ; and she was still at it when her father arrived in the dining-room by way of the back stairs and the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 11]: `` It 's pulled out again , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 29]: `` But I guess there 's no help for it now ; it 's too late , and anyway it lets some air into me when it bulges .
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 15]: I can sit so 's it wo n't be noticed much , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 14]: Is n't it time you quit bothering about the looks of the table ?
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 27]: Your mother 's been talking to him about half an hour now , and I had the idea he came on your account , not hers .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 14]: Had n't you better go and -- '' `` Just a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 5]: Alice said , piteously .
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 10]: `` Do YOU think it looks all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 4]: `` The flowers ?
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 2]: Fine !
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 14]: Had n't you better leave 'em the way they are , though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 10]: `` Just a minute , '' she begged again .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 8]: `` Just ONE minute , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 21]: And she exchanged a rose in front of Russell 's plate for one that seemed to her a little larger .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 15]: `` You better come on , '' Adams said , moving to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 9]: `` Just ONE more second , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 7]: She shook her head , lamenting .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 12]: `` Oh , I wish we 'd rented some silver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 15]: `` Because so much of the plating has rubbed off a lot of it .
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 7]: JUST a second , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 39]: And as she spoke she hastily went round the table , gathering the knives and forks and spoons that she thought had their plating best preserved , and exchanging them for more damaged pieces at Russell 's place .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 5]: she sighed , finally .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 7]: `` Now I 'll come . ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 15]: But at the door she paused to look back dubiously , over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 4]: `` The roses .
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 26]: I believe after all I should n't have tried that vine effect ; I ought to have kept them in water , in the vase .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 22]: It 's so hot , they already begin to look a little wilted , out on the dry tablecloth like that .
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 15]: I believe I 'll -- '' `` Why , look here , Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 11]: he remonstrated , as she seemed disposed to turn back .
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 37]: `` Everything 'll burn up on the stove if you keep on -- '' `` Oh , well , '' she said , `` the vase was terribly ugly ; I ca n't do any better .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 6]: We 'll go in . ''
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 10]: But with her hand on the door-knob she paused .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 5]: `` No , papa .
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 9]: We must n't go in by this door .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 13]: It might look as if -- '' `` As if what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 9]: `` Let 's go the other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 33]: `` I do n't see what difference it makes , '' he grumbled , but nevertheless followed her through the kitchen , and up the back stairs then through the upper hallway .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 34]: At the top of the front stairs she paused for a moment , drawing a deep breath ; and then , before her father 's puzzled eyes , a transformation came upon her .
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 66]: Her shoulders , like her eyelids , had been drooping , but now she threw her head back : the shoulders straightened , and the lashes lifted over sparkling eyes ; vivacity came to her whole body in a flash ; and she tripped down the steps , with her pretty hands rising in time to the lilting little tune she had begun to hum .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 40]: At the foot of the stairs , one of those pretty hands extended itself at full arm 's length toward Russell , and continued to be extended until it reached his own hand as he came to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 7]: `` How terrible of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 8]: `` To be so late coming down !
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 13]: And papa , too -- I think you know each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 60]: Her father was advancing toward the young man , expecting to shake hands with him , but Alice stood between them , and Russell , a little flushed , bowed to him gravely over her shoulder , without looking at him ; whereupon Adams , slightly disconcerted , put his hands in his pockets and turned to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 13]: `` I guess dinner 's more 'n ready , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 8]: `` We better go sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 13]: But she shook her head at him fiercely , `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 4]: `` What for ?
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 4]: For Walter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 26]: `` No ; he ca n't be coming , '' she returned , hurriedly , and again warned him by a shake of her head .
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 5]: `` Be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 9]: `` Oh , well -- '' he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 5]: `` Sit down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 36]: He was thoroughly mystified , but obeyed her gesture and went to the rocking-chair in the opposite corner , where he sat down , and , with an expression of meek inquiry , awaited events .
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 19]: Meanwhile , Alice prattled on : `` It 's really not a fault of mine , being tardy .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 11]: The shameful truth is I was trying to hurry papa .
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 22]: He 's incorrigible : he stays so late at his terrible old factory -- terrible new factory , I should say .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 18]: I hope you do n't HATE us for making you dine with us in such fearful weather !
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 21]: I 'm nearly dying of the heat , myself , so you have a fellow-sufferer , if that pleases you .
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 21]: Why is it we always bear things better if we think other people have to stand them , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 20]: And she added , with an excited laugh : `` SILLY of us , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 14]: Gertrude had just made her entrance from the dining-room , bearing a tray .
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 38]: She came slowly , with an air of resentment ; and her skirt still needed adjusting , while her lower jaw moved at intervals , though not now upon any substance , but reminiscently , of habit .
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 8]: She halted before Adams , facing him .
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 4]: He looked plaintive .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 9]: `` What you want o ' me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 23]: For response , she extended the tray toward him with a gesture of indifference ; but he still appeared to be puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 8]: `` What in the world -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 27]: he began , then caught his wife 's eye , and had presence of mind enough to take a damp and plastic sandwich from the tray .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 43]: `` Well , I 'll TRY one , '' he said , but a moment later , as he fulfilled this promise , an expression of intense dislike came upon his features , and he would have returned the sandwich to Gertrude .
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 27]: However , as she had crossed the room to Mrs. Adams he checked the gesture , and sat helplessly , with the sandwich in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 40]: He made another effort to get rid of it as the waitress passed him , on her way back to the dining-room , but she appeared not to observe him , and he continued to be troubled by it .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 6]: Alice was a loyal daughter .
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 27]: `` These are delicious , mama , '' she said ; and turning to Russell , `` You missed it ; you should have taken one .
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 45]: Too bad we could n't have offered you what ought to go with it , of course , but -- '' She was interrupted by the second entrance of Gertrude , who announced , `` Dinner serve ' , '' and retired from view .
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 11]: Adams said , rising from his chair , with relief .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 5]: `` That 's good !
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 11]: Let 's go see if we can eat it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 26]: And as the little group moved toward the open door of the dining-room he disposed of his sandwich by dropping it in the empty fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 24]: Alice , glancing back over her shoulder , was the only one who saw him , and she shuddered in spite of herself .
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 39]: Then , seeing that he looked at her entreatingly , as if he wanted to explain that he was doing the best he could , she smiled upon him sunnily , and began to chatter to Russell again .
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 33]: CHAPTER XXII Alice kept her sprightly chatter going when they sat down , though the temperature of the room and the sight of hot soup might have discouraged a less determined gayety .
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 94]: Moreover , there were details as unpropitious as the heat : the expiring roses expressed not beauty but pathos , and what faint odour they exhaled was no rival to the lusty emanations of the Brussels sprouts ; at the head of the table , Adams , sitting low in his chair , appeared to be unable to flatten the uprising wave of his starched bosom ; and Gertrude 's manner and expression were of a recognizable hostility during the long period of vain waiting for the cups of soup to be emptied .
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 31]: Only Mrs. Adams made any progress in this direction ; the others merely feinting , now and then lifting their spoons as if they intended to do something with them .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 34]: Alice 's talk was little more than cheerful sound , but , to fill a desolate interval , served its purpose ; and her mother supported her with ever-faithful cooings of applausive laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 9]: `` What a funny thing weather is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 5]: the girl ran on .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 72]: `` Yesterday it was cool -- angels had charge of it -- and to-day they had an engagement somewhere else , so the devil saw his chance and started to move the equator to the North Pole ; but by the time he got half-way , he thought of something else he wanted to do , and went off ; and left the equator here , right on top of US !
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 11]: I wish he 'd come back and get it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 7]: `` Why , Alice dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 6]: her mother cried , fondly .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 5]: `` What an imagination !
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 17]: Not a very pious one , I 'm afraid Mr. Russell might think , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 29]: Here she gave Gertrude a hidden signal to remove the soup ; but , as there was no response , she had to make the signal more conspicuous .
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 23]: Gertrude was leaning against the wall , her chin moving like a slow pendulum , her streaked eyes fixed mutinously upon Russell .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 26]: Mrs. Adams nodded several times , increasing the emphasis of her gesture , while Alice talked briskly ; but the brooding waitress continued to brood .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 36]: A faint snap of the fingers failed to disturb her ; nor was a covert hissing whisper of avail , and Mrs. Adams was beginning to show signs of strain when her daughter relieved her .
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 18]: `` Imagine our trying to eat anything so hot as soup on a night like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 3]: Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 20]: `` What COULD have been in the cook 's mind not to give us something iced and jellied instead ?
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 26]: Of course it 's because she 's equatorial , herself , originally , and only feels at home when Mr. Satan moves it north . ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 11]: She looked round at Gertrude , who stood behind her .
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 9]: `` Do take this dreadful soup away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 29]: Thus directly addressed , Gertrude yielded her attention , though unwillingly , and as if she decided only by a hair 's weight not to revolt , instead .
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 32]: However , she finally set herself in slow motion ; but overlooked the supposed head of the table , seeming to be unaware of the sweltering little man who sat there .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 31]: As she disappeared toward the kitchen with but three of the cups upon her tray he turned to look plaintively after her , and ventured an attempt to recall her .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 8]: he said , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 6]: `` Here , you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 8]: `` What is it , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 4]: his wife asked .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 7]: `` What 's her name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 43]: Mrs. Adams gave him a glance of sudden panic , and , seeing that the guest of the evening was not looking at her , but down at the white cloth before him , she frowned hard , and shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 22]: Unfortunately Alice was not observing her mother , and asked , innocently : `` What 's whose name , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 12]: `` Why , this young darky woman , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 6]: `` She left mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' Alice laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 9]: `` There 's hope for you , papa .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 7]: She has n't gone forever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 19]: `` I do n't know about that , '' he said , not content with this impulsive assurance .
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 8]: `` She LOOKED like she is . ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 29]: And his remark , considered as a prediction , had begun to seem warranted before Gertrude 's return with china preliminary to the next stage of the banquet .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 47]: Alice proved herself equal to the long gap , and rattled on through it with a spirit richly justifying her mother 's praise of her as `` always ready to smooth things over '' ; for here was more than long delay to be smoothed over .
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 34]: She smoothed over her father and mother for Russell ; and she smoothed over him for them , though he did not know it , and remained unaware of what he owed her .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 43]: With all this , throughout her prattlings , the girl 's bright eyes kept seeking his with an eager gayety , which but little veiled both interrogation and entreaty -- as if she asked : `` Is it too much for you ?
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 6]: Ca n't you bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 7]: Wo n't you PLEASE bear it ?
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 5]: I would for you .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 14]: Wo n't you give me a sign that it 's all right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 29]: He looked at her but fleetingly , and seemed to suffer from the heat , in spite of every manly effort not to wipe his brow too often .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 44]: His colour , after rising when he greeted Alice and her father , had departed , leaving him again moistly pallid ; a condition arising from discomfort , no doubt , but , considered as a decoration , almost poetically becoming to him .
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 46]: Not less becoming was the faint , kindly smile , which showed his wish to express amusement and approval ; and yet it was a smile rather strained and plaintive , as if he , like Adams , could only do the best he could .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 25]: He pleased Adams , who thought him a fine young man , and decidedly the quietest that Alice had ever shown to her family .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 41]: In her father 's opinion this was no small merit ; and it was to Russell 's credit , too , that he showed embarrassment upon this first intimate presentation ; here was an applicant with both reserve and modesty .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 47]: `` So far , he seems to be first rate a mighty fine young man , '' Adams thought ; and , prompted by no wish to part from Alice but by reminiscences of apparent candidates less pleasing , he added , `` At last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 6]: Alice 's liveliness never flagged .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 16]: Her smoothing over of things was an almost continuous performance , and had to be .
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 37]: Yet , while she chattered through the hot and heavy courses , the questions she asked herself were as continuous as the performance , and as poignant as what her eyes seemed to be asking Russell .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 16]: Why had she not prevailed over her mother 's fear of being `` skimpy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 19]: Had she been , indeed , as her mother said she looked , `` in a trance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 11]: But above all : What was the matter with HIM ?
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 4]: What had happened ?
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 23]: For she told herself with painful humour that something even worse than this dinner must be `` the matter with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 39]: The small room , suffocated with the odour of boiled sprouts , grew hotter and hotter as more and more food appeared , slowly borne in , between deathly long waits , by the resentful , loud-breathing Gertrude .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 60]: And while Alice still sought Russell 's glance , and read the look upon his face a dozen different ways , fearing all of them ; and while the straggling little flowers died upon the stained cloth , she felt her heart grow as heavy as the food , and wondered that it did not die like the roses .
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 22]: With the arrival of coffee , the host bestirred himself to make known a hospitable regret , `` By George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 9]: `` I meant to buy some cigars . ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 8]: He addressed himself apologetically to the guest .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 20]: `` I do n't know what I was thinking about , to forget to bring some home with me .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 17]: I do n't use 'em myself -- unless somebody hands me one , you might say .
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 25]: I 've always been a pipe-smoker , pure and simple , but I ought to remembered for kind of an occasion like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 9]: `` Not at all , '' Russell said .
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 25]: `` I 'm not smoking at all lately ; but when I do , I 'm like you , and smoke a pipe . ''
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 40]: Alice started , remembering what she had told him when he overtook her on her way from the tobacconist 's ; but , after a moment , looking at him , she decided that he must have forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 17]: If he had remembered , she thought , he could not have helped glancing at her .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 48]: On the contrary , he seemed more at ease , just then , than he had since they sat down , for he was favouring her father with a thoughtful attention as Adams responded to the introduction of a man 's topic into the conversation at last .
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 15]: `` Well , Mr. Russell , I guess you 're right , at that .
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 72]: I do n't say but what cigars may be all right for a man that can afford 'em , if he likes 'em better than a pipe , but you take a good old pipe now -- '' He continued , and was getting well into the eulogium customarily provoked by this theme , when there came an interruption : the door-bell rang , and he paused inquiringly , rather surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 20]: Mrs. Adams spoke to Gertrude in an undertone : `` Just say , ` Not at home . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 15]: `` If it 's callers , just say we 're not at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 24]: Gertrude spoke out freely : `` You mean you astin ' me to ` tend you ' front do ' fer you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 16]: She seemed both incredulous and affronted , but Mrs. Adams persisted , though somewhat apprehensively .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 6]: Hurry -- uh -- please .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 12]: Just say we 're not at home if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 19]: Again Gertrude obviously hesitated between compliance and revolt , and again the meeker course fortunately prevailed with her .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 13]: She gave Mrs. Adams a stare , grimly derisive , then departed .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 14]: When she came back she said : `` He say he wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 19]: `` But I told you to tell anybody we were not at home , '' Mrs Adams returned .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 6]: `` Who is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 8]: `` Say he name Mr. Law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 10]: `` We do n't know any Mr. Law . ''
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 8]: `` Yes 'm ; he know you .
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 8]: Say he anxious to speak Mr. Adams .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 5]: Say he wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 9]: `` Tell him Mr. Adams is engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 10]: `` Hold on a minute , '' Adams intervened .
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 3]: `` Law ?
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 8]: I do n't know any Mr. Law .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 9]: You sure you got the name right ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 19]: `` Say he name Law , '' Gertrude replied , looking at the ceiling to express her fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 3]: `` Law .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 12]: 'S all he tell me ; 's all I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 3]: Adams frowned .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 7]: `` Law , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 10]: `` Was n't it maybe ` Lohr ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 8]: `` Law , '' Gertrude repeated . ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 12]: 'S all he tell me ; 's all I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 8]: `` What 's he look like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 11]: `` He ai n't much , '' she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 15]: ` Bout you ' age ; got brustly white moustache , nice eye-glasses . ''
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 7]: `` It 's Charley Lohr ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 3]: Adams exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 10]: `` I 'll go see what he wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 22]: `` But , Virgil , '' his wife remonstrated , `` do finish your coffee ; he might stay all evening .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 8]: Maybe he 's come to call . ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 3]: Adams laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 12]: `` He is n't much of a caller , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 14]: Do n't worry : I 'll take him up to my room . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 26]: And turning toward Russell , `` Ah -- if you 'll just excuse me , '' he said ; and went out to his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 26]: When he had gone , Mrs. Adams finished her coffee , and , having glanced intelligently from her guest to her daughter , she rose .
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 57]: `` I think perhaps I ought to go and shake hands with Mr. Lohr , myself , '' she said , adding in explanation to Russell , as she reached the door , `` He 's an old friend of my husband 's and it 's a very long time since he 's been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 52]: Alice nodded and smiled to her brightly , but upon the closing of the door , the smile vanished ; all her liveliness disappeared ; and with this change of expression her complexion itself appeared to change , so that her rouge became obvious , for she was pale beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 42]: However , Russell did not see the alteration , for he did not look at her ; and it was but a momentary lapse the vacation of a tired girl , who for ten seconds lets herself look as she feels .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 14]: Then she shot her vivacity back into place as by some powerful spring .
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 7]: `` Penny for your thoughts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 17]: she cried , and tossed one of the wilted roses at him , across the table .
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 31]: `` I 'll bid more than a penny ; I 'll bid tuppence -- no , a poor little dead rose a rose for your thoughts , Mr. Arthur Russell !
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 5]: What are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 5]: He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 10]: `` I 'm afraid I have n't any . ''
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 11]: `` No , of course not , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 10]: `` Who could have thoughts in weather like this ?
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 7]: Will you EVER forgive us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 35]: `` Making you eat such a heavy dinner -- I mean LOOK at such a heavy dinner , because you certainly did n't do more than look at it -- on such a night !
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 17]: But the crime draws to a close , and you can begin to cheer up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 13]: She laughed gaily , and , rising , moved to the door .
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 28]: `` Let 's go in the other room ; your fearful duty is almost done , and you can run home as soon as you want to .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 10]: That 's what you 're dying to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 18]: `` Not at all , '' he said in a voice so feeble that she laughed aloud .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 11]: `` I had n't realized it was THAT bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 36]: For this , though he contrived to laugh , he seemed to have no verbal retort whatever ; but followed her into the `` living-room , '' where she stopped and turned , facing him .
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 9]: `` Has it really been so frightful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 7]: `` Why , of course not .
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 5]: Not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 11]: `` Of course yes , though , you mean ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 14]: It 's been most kind of your mother and father and you . ''
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 29]: `` Do you know , '' she said , `` you 've never once looked at me for more than a second at a time the whole evening ?
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 14]: And it seemed to me I looked rather nice to-night , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 9]: `` You always do , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 39]: `` I do n't see how you know , '' she returned ; and then stepping closer to him , spoke with gentle solicitude : `` Tell me : you 're really feeling wretchedly , are n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 12]: I know you 've got a fearful headache , or something .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 4]: Tell me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 6]: `` Not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 12]: `` You are ill -- I 'm sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 6]: `` Not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 6]: `` On your word ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 9]: `` I 'm really quite all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 42]: `` But if you are -- '' she began ; and then , looking at him with a desperate sweetness , as if this were her last resource to rouse him , `` What 's the matter , little boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 6]: she said with lisping tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 5]: `` Tell auntie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 20]: It was a mistake , for he seemed to flinch , and to lean backward , however , slightly .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 15]: She turned away instantly , with a flippant lift and drop of both hands .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 7]: `` Oh , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 8]: `` I wo n't eat you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 35]: And as the discomfited young man watched her , seeming able to lift his eyes , now that her back was turned , she went to the front door and pushed open the screen .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 13]: `` Let 's go out on the porch , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 6]: `` Where we belong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 21]: Then , when he had followed her out , and they were seated , `` Is n't this better ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 12]: `` Do n't you feel more like yourself out here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 30]: He began a murmur : `` Not at -- '' But she cut him off sharply : `` Please do n't say ` Not at all ' again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 6]: `` I 'm sorry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 12]: `` You do seem sorry about something , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 14]: Is n't it time you were telling me what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 6]: Indeed nothing 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 12]: Of course one IS rather affected by such weather as this .
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 14]: It may make one a little quieter than usual , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 13]: She sighed , and let the tired muscles of her face rest .
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 33]: Under the hard lights , indoors , they had served her until they ached , and it was a luxury to feel that in the darkness no grimacings need call upon them .
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 15]: `` Of course , if you wo n't tell me -- '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 13]: `` I can only assure you there 's nothing to tell . ''
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 15]: `` I know what an ugly little house it is , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 15]: `` Maybe it was the furniture -- or mama 's vases that upset you .
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 10]: Or was it mama herself -- or papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 8]: `` Nothing ` upset ' me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 10]: At that she uttered a monosyllable of doubting laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 9]: `` I wonder why you say that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 7]: `` Because it 's so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 25]: It 's because you 're too kind , or too conscientious , or too embarrassed -- anyhow too something -- to tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 23]: She leaned forward , elbows on knees and chin in hands , in the reflective attitude she knew how to make graceful .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 20]: `` I have a feeling that you 're not going to tell me , '' she said , slowly .
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 13]: `` Yes -- even that you 're never going to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 10]: I wonder -- I wonder -- '' `` Yes ?
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 6]: What do you wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 19]: `` I was just thinking -- I wonder if they have n't done it , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 34]: `` I wonder , '' she went on , still slowly , and in a voice of reflection , `` I wonder who HAS been talking about me to you , after all ?
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 6]: Is n't that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 18]: `` Not at -- '' he began , but checked himself and substituted another form of denial .
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 8]: `` Nothing is ` it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 6]: `` Why , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 5]: `` How curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 12]: `` Because all evening you 've been so utterly different . ''
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 10]: `` But in this weather -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 14]: That would n't make you afraid to look at me all evening ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 8]: `` But I did look at you .
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 3]: Often . ''
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 6]: Not really a LOOK . ''
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 10]: `` But I 'm looking at you now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 8]: `` Yes -- in the dark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 23]: `` No -- the weather might make you even quieter than usual , but it would n't strike you so nearly dumb .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 25]: No -- and it would n't make you seem to be under such a strain -- as if you thought only of escape ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 18]: `` But I have n't -- '' `` You should n't , '' she interrupted , gently .
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 13]: `` There 's nothing you have to escape from , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 11]: You are n't committed to -- to this friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 18]: `` I 'm sorry you think -- '' he began , but did not complete the fragment .
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 5]: She took it up .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 20]: `` You 're sorry I think you 're so different , you mean to say , do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 27]: Never mind : that 's what you did mean to say , but you could n't finish it because you 're not good at deceiving . ''
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 11]: `` Oh , no , '' he protested , feebly .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 6]: `` I 'm not deceiving .
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 13]: I 'm -- '' `` Never mind , '' she said again .
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 21]: `` You 're sorry I think you 're so different -- and all in one day -- since last night .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 9]: Yes , your voice SOUNDS sorry , too .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 32]: It sounds sorrier than it would just because of my thinking something you could change my mind about in a minute so it means you 're sorry you ARE different . ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 20]: `` No -- I -- '' But disregarding the faint denial , `` Never mind , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 24]: `` Do you remember one night when you told me that nothing anybody else could do would ever keep you from coming here ?
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 19]: That if you -- if you left me it would be because I drove you away myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' he said , huskily .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 6]: `` It was true . ''
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 17]: `` Indeed I am , '' he answered in a low voice , but with conviction .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 7]: `` Then -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 12]: `` Well -- but I have n't driven you away . ''
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 13]: `` And yet you 've gone , '' she said , quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 11]: `` Do I seem so stupid as all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 8]: `` You know what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 22]: She leaned back in her chair again , and her hands , inactive for once , lay motionless in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 21]: When she spoke it was in a rueful whisper : `` I wonder if I HAVE driven you away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 14]: `` You 've done nothing -- nothing at all , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 14]: `` I wonder -- '' she said once more , but she stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 106]: In her mind she was going back over their time together since the first meeting -- fragments of talk , moments of silence , little things of no importance , little things that might be important ; moonshine , sunshine , starlight ; and her thoughts zigzagged among the jumbling memories ; but , as if she made for herself a picture of all these fragments , throwing them upon the canvas haphazard , she saw them all just touched with the one tainting quality that gave them coherence , the faint , false haze she had put over this friendship by her own pretendings .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 54]: And , if this terrible dinner , or anything , or everything , had shown that saffron tint in its true colour to the man at her side , last night almost a lover , then she had indeed of herself driven him away , and might well feel that she was lost .
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 6]: `` Do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 12]: she said , suddenly , in a clear , loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 7]: `` I have the strangest feeling .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 25]: I feel as if I were going to be with you only about five minutes more in all the rest of my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 9]: `` Why , no , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 12]: `` Of course I 'm coming to see you -- often .
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 10]: I -- '' `` No , '' she interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 11]: `` I 've never had a feeling like this before .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 12]: It 's -- it 's just SO ; that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 14]: You 're GOING -- why , you 're never coming here again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 12]: She stood up , abruptly , beginning to tremble all over .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 12]: `` Why , it 's FINISHED , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 13]: she said , and her trembling was manifest now in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 12]: `` Why , it 's all OVER , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 5]: Why , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 7]: He had risen as she did .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 15]: `` I 'm afraid you 're awfully tired and nervous , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 9]: `` I really ought to be going . ''
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 14]: `` Yes , of COURSE you ought , '' she cried , despairingly .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 10]: `` There 's nothing else for you to do .
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 16]: When anything 's spoiled , people CA N'T do anything but run away from it .
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 4]: So good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 20]: `` At least , '' he returned , huskily , `` we 'll only -- only say good-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 19]: Then , as moving to go , he stumbled upon the veranda steps , `` Your HAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 20]: `` I 'd like to keep it for a souvenir , but I 'm afraid you need it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 19]: She ran into the hall and brought his straw hat from the chair where he had left it .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 6]: `` You poor thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 7]: she said , with quavering laughter .
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 14]: `` Do n't you know you ca n't go without your hat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 33]: Then , as they faced each other for the short moment which both of them knew would be the last of all their veranda moments , Alice 's broken laughter grew louder .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 8]: `` What a thing to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 11]: `` What a romantic parting -- talking about HATS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 41]: Her laughter continued as he turned away , but other sounds came from within the house , clearly audible with the opening of a door upstairs -- a long and wailing cry of lamentation in the voice of Mrs. Adams .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 17]: Russell paused at the steps , uncertain , but Alice waved to him to go on .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 11]: `` Oh , do n't bother , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 13]: `` We have lots of that in this funny little old house !
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 3]: Good-bye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 22]: And as he went down the steps , she ran back into the house and closed the door heavily behind her .
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 28]: CHAPTER XXIII Her mother 's wailing could still be heard from overhead , though more faintly ; and old Charley Lohr was coming down the stairs alone .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 6]: He looked at Alice compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 21]: `` I was just comin ' to suggest maybe you 'd excuse yourself from your company , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 38]: `` Your mother was bound not to disturb you , and tried her best to keep you from hearin ' how she 's takin ' on , but I thought probably you better see to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 7]: `` Yes , I 'll come .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 25]: `` Well , '' he said , '' _ I _ only stepped over to offer my sympathy and services , as it were .
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 13]: _ I _ thought of course you folks knew all about it .
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 26]: Fact is , it was in the evening paper -- just a little bit of an item on the back page , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 3]: He coughed .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 14]: `` Well , it ai n't anything so terrible , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 29]: `` Fact is , your brother Walter 's got in a little trouble -- well , I suppose you might call it quite a good deal of trouble .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 18]: Fact is , he 's quite considerable short in his accounts down at Lamb and Company . ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 23]: Alice ran up the stairs and into her father 's room , where Mrs. Adams threw herself into her daughter 's arms .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 6]: `` Is he gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 3]: she sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 10]: `` He did n't hear me , did he ?
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 15]: I tried so hard -- '' Alice patted the heaving shoulders her arms enclosed .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 20]: `` He did n't hear you -- it would n't have mattered -- he does n't matter anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 7]: `` Oh , POOR Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 4]: The mother cried .
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 7]: `` Oh , the POOR boy !
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 5]: Poor , poor Walter !
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 17]: Poor , poor , poor , POOR -- '' `` Hush , dear , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 32]: Alice tried to soothe her , but the lament could not be abated , and from the other side of the room a repetition in a different spirit was as continuous .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 16]: Adams paced furiously there , pounding his fist into his left palm as he strode .
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 6]: `` The dang boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 5]: `` Dang little fool !
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 3]: Dang idiot !
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 3]: Dang fool !
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 12]: Why n't he TELL me , the dang little fool ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 5]: `` He DID ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 16]: `` He DID tell you , and you would n't GIVE it to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 8]: `` He DID , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 5]: Adams shouted at her .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 13]: `` What he begged me for was money to run away with !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 10]: He never dreamed of putting back what he took .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 11]: What the dangnation you talking about -- accusing me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 9]: `` He NEEDED it , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 9]: `` He needed it to run away with !
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 21]: How could he expect to LIVE , after he got away , if he did n't have a little money ?
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 9]: Oh , poor , poor , POOR Walter !
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 38]: Poor , poor , poor -- '' She went back to this repetition ; and Adams went back to his own , then paused , seeing his old friend standing in the hallway outside the open door .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 19]: `` Ah -- I 'll just be goin ' , I guess , Virgil , '' Lohr said .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 18]: `` I do n't see as there 's any use my tryin ' to say any more .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 13]: I 'll do anything you want me to , you understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 22]: `` Wait a minute , '' Adams said , and , groaning , came and went down the stairs with him .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 14]: `` You say you did n't see the old man at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 28]: `` No , I do n't know a thing about what he 's going to do , '' Lohr said , as they reached the lower floor .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 5]: `` Not a thing .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 37]: But look here , Virgil , I do n't see as this calls for you and your wife to take on so hard about -- anyhow not as hard as the way you 've started . ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 7]: `` No , '' Adams gulped .
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 17]: `` It always seems that way to the other party that 's only looking on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 19]: `` Oh , well , I know that , of course , '' old Charley returned , soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 51]: `` But look here , Virgil : they may not catch the boy ; they did n't even seem to be sure what train he made , and if they do get him , why , the ole man might decide not to prosecute if -- '' `` HIM ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 5]: Adams cried , interrupting .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 5]: `` Him not prosecute ?
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 14]: Why , that 's what he 's been waiting for , all along !
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 10]: He thinks my boy and me both cheated him !
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 12]: Why , he was just letting Walter walk into a trap !
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 14]: Did n't you say they 'd been suspecting him for some time back ?
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 19]: Did n't you say they 'd been watching him and were just about fixing to arrest him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 29]: `` Yes , I know , '' said Lohr ; `` but you ca n't tell , especially if you raise the money and pay it back . ''
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 5]: `` Every cent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 3]: Adams vociferated .
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 5]: `` Every last penny !
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 11]: I can raise it -- I GOT to raise it !
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 12]: I 'm going to put a loan on my factory to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 13]: Oh , I 'll get it for him , you tell him !
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 5]: Every last penny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 17]: `` Well , ole feller , you just try and get quieted down some now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 8]: Charley held out his hand in parting .
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 10]: `` You and your wife just quiet down some .
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 25]: You AI N'T the healthiest man in the world , you know , and you already been under quite some strain before this happened .
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 23]: You want to take care of yourself for the sake of your wife and that sweet little girl upstairs , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 14]: Now , good-night , '' he finished , stepping out upon the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 14]: `` You send for me if there 's anything I can do . ''
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 4]: `` Do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 3]: Adams echoed .
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 10]: `` There ai n't anything ANYBODY can do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 32]: And then , as his old friend went down the path to the sidewalk , he called after him , `` You tell him I 'll pay him every last cent !
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 9]: Every last , dang , dirty PENNY ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 16]: He slammed the door and went rapidly up the stairs , talking loudly to himself .
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 9]: `` Every dang , last , dirty penny !
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 14]: Thinks EVERYBODY in this family wants to steal from him , does he ?
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 9]: Thinks we 're ALL yellow , does he ?
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 6]: I 'll show him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 19]: And he came into his own room vociferating , `` Every last , dang , dirty penny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 29]: Mrs. Adams had collapsed , and Alice had put her upon his bed , where she lay tossing convulsively and sobbing , `` Oh , POOR Walter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 14]: over and over , but after a time she varied the sorry tune .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 7]: `` Oh , poor Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 10]: she moaned , clinging to her daughter 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 44]: `` Oh , poor , POOR Alice to have THIS come on the night of your dinner -- just when everything seemed to be going so well -- at last -- oh , poor , poor , POOR -- '' `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 5]: Alice said , sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 9]: `` Do n't say ` poor Alice ! '
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 6]: I 'm all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 6]: `` You MUST be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 7]: her mother cried , clutching her .
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 8]: `` You 've just GOT to be !
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 37]: ONE of us has got to be all right -- surely God would n't mind just ONE of us being all right -- that would n't hurt Him -- '' `` Hush , hush , mother !
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 3]: Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 10]: But Mrs. Adams only clutched her the more tightly .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 11]: `` He seemed SUCH a nice young man , dearie !
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 78]: He may not see this in the paper -- Mr. Lohr said it was just a little bit of an item -- he MAY not see it , dearie -- '' Then her anguish went back to Walter again ; and to his needs as a fugitive -- she had meant to repair his underwear , but had postponed doing so , and her neglect now appeared to be a detail as lamentable as the calamity itself .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 25]: She could neither be stilled upon it , nor herself exhaust its urgings to self-reproach , though she finally took up another theme temporarily .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 50]: Upon an unusually violent outbreak of her husband 's , in denunciation of the runaway , she cried out faintly that he was cruel ; and further wearied her broken voice with details of Walter 's beauty as a baby , and of his bedtime pieties throughout his infancy .
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 7]: So the hot night wore on .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 34]: Three had struck before Mrs. Adams was got to bed ; and Alice , returning to her own room , could hear her father 's bare feet thudding back and forth after that .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 5]: `` Poor papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 9]: she whispered in helpless imitation of her mother .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 4]: `` Poor papa !
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 3]: Poor mama !
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 3]: Poor Walter !
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 6]: Poor all of us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 37]: She fell asleep , after a time , while from across the hall the bare feet still thudded over their changeless route ; and she woke at seven , hearing Adams pass her door , shod .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 16]: In her wrapper she ran out into the hallway and found him descending the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 4]: `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 16]: `` Hush , '' he said , and looked up at her with reddened eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 8]: `` Do n't wake your mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 9]: `` I wo n't , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 5]: `` How about you ?
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 9]: You have n't slept any at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 6]: `` Yes , I did .
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 5]: I got some sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 9]: I 'm going over to the works now .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 12]: I got to throw some figures together to show the bank .
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 11]: Do n't worry : I 'll get things fixed up .
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 6]: You go back to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 4]: `` Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 5]: she bade him sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 10]: `` You 've got to have some breakfast . ''
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 8]: `` Do n't want ` ny . ''
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 5]: `` You wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 13]: she said , imperiously , and disappeared to return almost at once .
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 27]: `` I can cook in my bedroom slippers , '' she explained , `` but I do n't believe I could in my bare feet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 20]: Descending softly , she made him wait in the dining-room until she brought him toast and eggs and coffee .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 4]: `` Eat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 25]: `` And I 'm going to telephone for a taxicab to take you , if you think you 've really got to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 15]: `` No , I 'm going to walk -- I WANT to walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 6]: She shook her head anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 7]: `` You do n't look able .
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 7]: You 've walked all night . ''
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 11]: `` No , I did n't , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 9]: `` I tell you I got some sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 8]: I got all I wanted anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 10]: `` But , papa -- '' `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 16]: he interrupted , looking up at her suddenly and setting down his cup of coffee .
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 6]: What about this Mr. Russell ?
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 6]: I forgot all about him .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 5]: What about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 14]: Her lip trembled a little , but she controlled it before she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 10]: `` Well , what about him , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 6]: she asked , calmly enough .
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 14]: `` Well , we could hardly -- '' Adams paused , frowning heavily .
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 15]: `` We could hardly expect he would n't hear something about all this . ''
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 13]: `` Yes ; of course he 'll hear it , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 5]: she asked , gently .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 24]: `` You do n't think he 'd be the -- the cheap kind it 'd make a difference with , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 10]: `` Oh , no ; he is n't cheap .
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 10]: It wo n't make any difference with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 9]: Adams suffered a profound sigh to escape him .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 12]: `` Well -- I 'm glad of that , anyway . ''
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 20]: `` The difference , '' she explained -- `` the difference was made without his hearing anything about Walter .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 9]: He does n't know about THAT yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 10]: `` Well , what does he know about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 12]: `` Only , '' she said , `` about me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 10]: `` What you mean by that , Alice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 5]: he asked , helplessly .
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 8]: `` Never mind , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 19]: `` It 's nothing beside the real trouble we 're in -- I 'll tell you some time .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 17]: You eat your eggs and toast ; you ca n't keep going on just coffee . ''
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 16]: `` I ca n't eat any eggs and toast , '' he objected , rising .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 6]: `` I ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 12]: `` Then wait till I can bring you something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 9]: `` No , '' he said , irritably .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 7]: `` I wo n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 8]: I do n't want any dang food !
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 30]: And look here '' -- he spoke sharply to stop her , as she went toward the telephone -- `` I do n't want any dang taxi , either !
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 10]: You look after your mother when she wakes up .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 8]: I got to be at WORK ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 20]: And though she followed him to the front door , entreating , he could not be stayed or hindered .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 32]: He went through the quiet morning streets at a rickety , rapid gait , swinging his old straw hat in his hands , and whispering angrily to himself as he went .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 58]: His grizzled hair , not trimmed for a month , blew back from his damp forehead in the warm breeze ; his reddened eyes stared hard at nothing from under blinking lids ; and one side of his face twitched startlingly from time to time ; -- children might have run from him , or mocked him .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 46]: When he had come into that fallen quarter his industry had partly revived and wholly made odorous , a negro woman , leaning upon her whitewashed gate , gazed after him and chuckled for the benefit of a gossiping friend in the next tiny yard .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 6]: `` Oh , good Satan !
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 10]: Wha ` ssa matter that ole glue man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 3]: Him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 4]: the neighbour inquired .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 7]: `` What he do now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 11]: `` Talkin ' to his ole se ` f ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 6]: the first explained , joyously .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 11]: `` Look like gone distracted -- ole glue man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 42]: Adams 's legs had grown more uncertain with his hard walk , and he stumbled heavily as he crossed the baked mud of his broad lot , but cared little for that , was almost unaware of it , in fact .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 37]: Thus his eyes saw as little as his body felt , and so he failed to observe something that would have given him additional light upon an old phrase that already meant quite enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 41]: There are in the wide world people who have never learned its meaning ; but most are either young or beautifully unobservant who remain wholly unaware of the inner poignancies the words convey : `` a rain of misfortunes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 47]: It is a boiling rain , seemingly whimsical in its choice of spots whereon to fall ; and , so far as mortal eye can tell , neither the just nor the unjust may hope to avoid it , or need worry themselves by expecting it .
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 13]: It had selected the Adams family for its scaldings ; no question .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 27]: The glue-works foreman , standing in the doorway of the brick shed , observed his employer 's eccentric approach , and doubtfully stroked a whiskered chin .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 25]: `` Well , they ai n't no putticular use gettin ' so upset over it , '' he said , as Adams came up .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 20]: `` When a thing happens , why , it happens , and that 's all there is to it .
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 12]: When a thing 's so , why , it 's so .
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 30]: All you can do about it is think if there 's anything you CAN do ; and that 's what you better be doin ' with this case . ''
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 10]: Adams halted , and seemed to gape at him .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 6]: `` What -- case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 6]: he said , with difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 11]: `` Was it in the morning papers , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 11]: `` No , it ai n't in no morning papers .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 3]: My land !
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 18]: It do n't need to be in no papers ; look at the SIZE of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 7]: `` The size of what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 7]: `` Why , great God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 4]: the foreman exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 8]: `` He ai n't even seen it .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 4]: Look yonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 32]: Adams stared vaguely at the man 's outstretched hand and pointing forefinger , then turned and saw a great sign upon the facade of the big factory building across the street .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 12]: The letters were large enough to be read two blocks away .
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 21]: `` AFTER THE FIFTEENTH OF NEXT MONTH THIS BUILDING WILL BE OCCUPIED BY THE J. A. LAMB LIQUID GLUE CO. .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 27]: INC. '' A gray touring-car had just come to rest before the principal entrance of the building , and J. A. Lamb himself descended from it .
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 32]: He glanced over toward the humble rival of his projected great industry , saw his old clerk , and immediately walked across the street and the lot to speak to him .
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 23]: `` Well , Adams , '' he said , in his husky , cheerful voice , `` how 's your glue-works ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 38]: Adams uttered an inarticulate sound , and lifted the hand that held his hat as if to make a protective gesture , but failed to carry it out ; and his arm sank limp at his side .
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 15]: The foreman , however , seemed to feel that something ought to be said .
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 7]: `` Our glue-works , hell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 3]: he remarked .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 30]: `` I guess we wo n't HAVE no glue-works over here not very long , if we got to compete with the sized thing you got over there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 3]: Lamb chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 13]: `` I kind of had some such notion , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 29]: `` You see , Virgil , I could n't exactly let you walk off with it like swallering a pat o ' butter , now , could I ?
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 21]: It did n't look exactly reasonable to expect me to let go like that , now , did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 10]: Adams found a half-choked voice somewhere in his throat .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 17]: `` Do you -- would you step into my office a minute , Mr. Lamb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 56]: `` Why , certainly I 'm willing to have a little talk with you , '' the old gentleman said , as he followed his former employee indoors , and he added , `` I feel a lot more like it than I did before I got THAT up , over yonder , Virgil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 41]: Adams threw open the door of the rough room he called his office , having as justification for this title little more than the fact that he had a telephone there and a deal table that served as a desk .
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 13]: `` Just step into the office , please , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 48]: Lamb glanced at the desk , at the kitchen chair before it , at the telephone , and at the partition walls built of old boards , some covered with ancient paint and some merely weatherbeaten , the salvage of a house-wrecker ; and he smiled broadly .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 11]: `` So these are your offices , are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 20]: `` You expect to do quite a business here , I guess , do n't you , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 10]: Adams turned upon him a stricken and tortured face .
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 14]: `` Have you seen Charley Lohr since last night , Mr. Lamb ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 10]: `` No ; I have n't seen Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 44]: `` Well , I told him to tell you , '' Adams began ; -- `` I told him I 'd pay you -- '' `` Pay me what you expect to make out o ' glue , you mean , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 9]: `` No , '' Adams said , swallowing .
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 9]: `` I mean what my boy owes you .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 10]: That 's what I told Charley to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 20]: I told him to tell you I 'd pay you every last -- '' `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 7]: the old gentleman interrupted , testily .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 10]: `` I do n't know anything about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 18]: `` I 'm expecting to pay you , '' Adams went on , swallowing again , painfully .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 21]: `` I was expecting to do it out of a loan I thought I could get on my glue-works . ''
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 8]: The old gentleman lifted his frosted eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 9]: `` Oh , out o ' the GLUE-works ?
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 13]: You expected to raise money on the glue-works , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 9]: At that , Adams 's agitation increased prodigiously .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 12]: `` How 'd you THINK I expected to pay you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 16]: `` Did you think I expected to get money on my own old bones ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 10]: He slapped himself harshly upon the chest and legs .
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 20]: `` Do you think a bank 'll lend money on a man 's ribs and his broken-down old knee-bones ?
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 6]: They wo n't do it !
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 39]: You got to have some BUSINESS prospects to show 'em , if you have n't got any property nor securities ; and what business prospects have I got now , with that sign of yours up over yonder ?
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 25]: Why , you do n't need to make an OUNCE o ' glue ; your sign 's fixed ME without your doing another lick !
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 14]: THAT 'S all you had to do ; just put your sign up !
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 25]: You need n't to -- '' `` Just let me tell you something , Virgil Adams , '' the old man interrupted , harshly .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 71]: `` I got just one right important thing to tell you before we talk any further business ; and that 's this : there 's some few men in this town made their money in off-colour ways , but there are n't many ; and those there are have had to be a darn sight slicker than you know how to be , or ever WILL know how to be !
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 39]: Yes , sir , and they none of them had the little gumption to try to make it out of a man that had the spirit not to let 'em , and the STRENGTH not to let 'em !
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 6]: I know what you thought .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 52]: ` Here , ' you said to yourself , ` here 's this ole fool J. A. Lamb ; he 's kind of worn out and in his second childhood like ; I can put it over on him , without his ever -- ' '' `` I did not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 3]: Adams shouted .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 17]: `` A great deal YOU know about my feelings and all what I said to myself !
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 30]: There 's one thing I want to tell YOU , and that 's what I 'm saying to myself NOW , and what my feelings are this MINUTE ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 21]: He struck the table a great blow with his thin fist , and shook the damaged knuckles in the air .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 28]: `` I just want to tell you , whatever I did feel , I do n't feel MEAN any more ; not to-day , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 18]: There 's a meaner man in this world than _ I _ am , Mr. Lamb ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 17]: `` Oh , so you feel better about yourself to-day , do you , Virgil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 6]: `` You bet I do !
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 29]: You worked till you got me where you want me ; and I would n't do that to another man , no matter what he did to me !
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 12]: I would n't -- '' `` What you talkin ' about !
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 13]: How 've I ` got you where I want you ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 8]: `` Ai n't it plain enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 3]: Adams cried .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 21]: `` You even got me where I ca n't raise the money to pay back what my boy owes you !
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 30]: Do you suppose anybody 's fool enough to let me have a cent on this business after one look at what you got over there across the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 8]: `` No , I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 13]: `` No , you do n't , '' Adams echoed , hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 27]: `` What 's more , you knew my house was mortgaged , and my -- '' `` I did not , '' Lamb interrupted , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 12]: `` What do _ I _ care about your house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 11]: `` What 's the use your talking like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 3]: Adams cried .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 41]: `` You got me where I ca n't even raise the money to pay what my boy owes the company , so ' t I ca n't show any reason to stop the prosecution and keep him out the penitentiary .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 11]: That 's where you worked till you got ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 3]: Lamb shouted .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 13]: `` You accuse me of -- '' '' ` Accuse you ? '
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 6]: What am I telling you ?
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 9]: Do you think I got no EYES ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 7]: And Adams hammered the table again .
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 17]: `` Why , you knew the boy was weak -- '' `` I did not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 19]: `` Listen : you kept him there after you got mad at my leaving the way I did .
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 31]: You kept him there after you suspected him ; and you had him watched ; you let him go on ; just waited to catch him and ruin him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 6]: `` You 're crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 5]: the old man bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 15]: `` I did n't know there was anything against the boy till last night .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 8]: You 're CRAZY , I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 4]: Adams looked it .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 56]: With his hair disordered over his haggard forehead and bloodshot eyes ; with his bruised hands pounding the table and flying in a hundred wild and absurd gestures , while his feet shuffled constantly to preserve his balance upon staggering legs , he was the picture of a man with a mind gone to rags .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 7]: `` Maybe I AM crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 9]: he cried , his voice breaking and quavering .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 30]: `` Maybe I am , but I would n't stand there and taunt a man with it if I 'd done to him what you 've done to me !
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 67]: Just look at me : I worked all my life for you , and what I did when I quit never harmed you -- it did n't make two cents ' worth o ' difference in your life and it looked like it 'd mean all the difference in the world to my family -- and now look what you 've DONE to me for it !
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 42]: I tell you , Mr. Lamb , there never was a man looked up to another man the way I looked up to you the whole o ' my life , but I do n't look up to you any more !
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 36]: You think you got a fine day of it now , riding up in your automobile to look at that sign -- and then over here at my poor little works that you 've ruined .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 11]: But listen to me just this one last time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 14]: The cracking voice broke into falsetto , and the gesticulating hands fluttered uncontrollably .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 6]: `` Just you listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 3]: he panted .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 86]: `` You think I did you a bad turn , and now you got me ruined for it , and you got my works ruined , and my family ruined ; and if anybody 'd ` a ' told me this time last year I 'd ever say such a thing to you I 'd called him a dang liar , but I DO say it : I say you 've acted toward me like -- like a -- a doggone mean -- man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 40]: His voice , exhausted , like his body , was just able to do him this final service ; then he sank , crumpled , into the chair by the table , his chin down hard upon his chest .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 10]: `` I tell you , you 're crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 4]: Lamb said again .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 21]: `` I never in the world -- '' But he checked himself , staring in sudden perplexity at his accuser .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 8]: `` What 's the matter of you ?
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 9]: Have you got another of those -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 16]: He put his hand upon Adams 's shoulder , which jerked feebly under the touch .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 13]: The old man went to the door and called to the foreman .
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 13]: `` Run and tell my chauffeur to bring my car over here .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 14]: Tell him to drive right up over the sidewalk and across the lot .
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 6]: Tell him to hurry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 24]: So , it happened , the great J. A. Lamb a second time brought his former clerk home , stricken and almost inanimate .
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 50]: CHAPTER XXIV About five o'clock that afternoon , the old gentleman came back to Adams 's house ; and when Alice opened the door , he nodded , walked into the `` living-room '' without speaking ; then stood frowning as if he hesitated to decide some perplexing question .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 9]: `` Well , how is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 5]: he asked , finally .
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 19]: `` The doctor was here again a little while ago ; he thinks papa 's coming through it .
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 8]: He 's pretty sure he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 11]: `` Something like the way it was last spring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 10]: `` Not a bit of sense to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 5]: Lamb said , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 31]: `` When he was getting well the other time the doctor told me it was n't a regular stroke , so to speak -- this ` cerebral effusion ' thing .
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 29]: Said there was n't any particular reason for your father to expect he 'd ever have another attack , if he 'd take a little care of himself .
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 16]: Said he could consider himself well as anybody else long as he did that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 8]: But he did n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 14]: Lamb nodded , sighed aloud , and crossed the room to a chair .
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 14]: `` I guess not , '' he said , as he sat down .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 14]: `` Bustin ' his health up over his glue-works , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 10]: `` I guess so ; I guess so . ''
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 15]: Then he looked up at her with a glimmer of anxiety in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 8]: `` Has he came to yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 6]: He 's talked a little .
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 17]: His mind 's clear ; he spoke to mama and me and to Miss Perry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 4]: Alice laughed sadly .
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 21]: `` We were lucky enough to get her back , but papa did n't seem to think it was lucky .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 23]: When he recognized her he said , ` Oh , my goodness , 't is n't YOU , is it ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 17]: `` Well , that 's a good sign , if he 's getting a little cross .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 17]: Did he -- did he happen to say anything -- for instance , about me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 24]: This question , awkwardly delivered , had the effect of removing the girl 's pallor ; rosy tints came quickly upon her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 12]: `` He -- yes , he did , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 14]: `` Naturally , he 's troubled about -- about -- '' She stopped .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 8]: `` About your brother , maybe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 25]: `` Yes , about making up the -- '' `` Here , now , '' Lamb said , uncomfortably , as she stopped again .
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 16]: `` Listen , young lady ; let 's do n't talk about that just yet .
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 22]: I want to ask you : you understand all about this glue business , I expect , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 6]: `` I 'm not sure .
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 17]: I only know -- '' `` Let me tell you , '' he interrupted , impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 12]: `` I 'll tell you all about it in two words .
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 27]: The process belonged to me , and your father up and walked off with it ; there 's no getting around THAT much , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 6]: `` Is n't there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 5]: Alice stared at him .
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 10]: `` I think you 're mistaken , Mr. Lamb .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 14]: Did n't papa improve it so that it virtually belonged to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 12]: There was a spark in the old blue eyes at this .
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 10]: `` Is that the way he got around it ?
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 37]: Why , in all my life I never heard of such a -- '' But he left the sentence unfinished ; the testiness went out of his husky voice and the anger out of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 17]: `` Well , I expect maybe that was the way of it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 33]: `` Anyhow , it 's right for you to stand up for your father ; and if you think he had a right to it -- '' `` But he did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 13]: `` I expect so , '' the old man returned , pacifically .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 7]: `` I expect so , probably .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 16]: Anyhow , it 's a question that 's neither here nor there , right now .
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 26]: What I was thinking of saying -- well , did your father happen to let out that he and I had words this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 7]: `` Well , we did . ''
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 7]: He sighed and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 18]: `` Your father -- well , he used some pretty hard expressions toward me , young lady .
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 28]: They were n't SO , I 'm glad to say , but he used 'em to me , and the worst of it was he believed 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 32]: Well , I been thinking it over , and I thought I 'd just have a kind of little talk with you to set matters straight , so to speak . ''
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 14]: `` For instance , '' he said , `` it 's like this .
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 50]: Now , I hope you wo n't think I mean any indelicacy , but you take your brother 's case , since we got to mention it , why , your father had the whole thing worked out in his mind about as wrong as anybody ever got anything .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 27]: If I 'd acted the way your father thought I did about that , why , somebody just ought to take me out and shoot me !
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 9]: Do YOU know what that man thought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 7]: `` I 'm not sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 19]: He frowned at her , and asked , `` Well , what do you think about it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 15]: `` I do n't believe I think anything at all about anything to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 18]: `` Well , well , '' he returned ; `` I expect not ; I expect not .
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 20]: You kind of look to me as if you ought to be in bed yourself , young lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 6]: `` Oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 64]: `` I guess you mean ` Oh , yes ' ; and I wo n't keep you long , but there 's something we got to get fixed up , and I 'd rather talk to you than I would to your mother , because you 're a smart girl and always friendly ; and I want to be sure I 'm understood .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 5]: Now , listen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 11]: `` I will , '' Alice promised , smiling faintly .
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 20]: `` I never even hardly noticed your brother was still working for me , '' he explained , earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 8]: `` I never thought anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 64]: My sons sort of tried to tease me about the way your father -- about his taking up this glue business , so to speak -- and one day Albert , Junior , asked me if I felt all right about your brother 's staying there after that , and I told him -- well , I just asked him to shut up .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 47]: If the boy wanted to stay there , I did n't consider it my business to send him away on account of any feeling I had toward his father ; not as long as he did his work right -- and the report showed he did .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 35]: Well , as it happens , it looks now as if he stayed because he HAD to ; he could n't quit because he 'd ` a ' been found out if he did .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 29]: Well , he 'd been covering up his shortage for a considerable time -- and do you know what your father practically charged me with about that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 7]: `` No , Mr. Lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 18]: In his resentment , the old gentleman 's ruddy face became ruddier and his husky voice huskier .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 12]: `` Thinks I kept the boy there because I suspected him !
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 10]: Thinks I did it to get even with HIM !
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 16]: Do I look to YOU like a man that 'd do such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 9]: `` No , '' she said , gently .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 9]: `` I do n't think you would . ''
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 19]: `` Nor HE would n't think so if he was himself ; he 's known me too long .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 32]: But he must been sort of brooding over this whole business -- I mean before Walter 's trouble he must been taking it to heart pretty hard for some time back .
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 47]: He thought I did n't think much of him any more -- and I expect he maybe wondered some what I was going to DO -- and there 's nothing worse 'n that state of mind to make a man suspicious of all kinds of meanness .
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 37]: Well , he practically stood up there and accused me to my face of fixing things so ' t he could n't ever raise the money to settle for Walter and ask us not to prosecute .
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 26]: That 's the state of mind your father 's brooding got him into , young lady -- charging me with a trick like that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 9]: `` I 'm sorry , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 18]: `` I know you 'd never -- '' The old man slapped his sturdy knee , angrily .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 12]: `` Why , that dang fool of a Virgil Adams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 26]: `` He would n't even give me a chance to talk ; and he got me so mad I could n't hardly talk , anyway !
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 61]: He might ` a ' known from the first I was n't going to let him walk in and beat me out of my own -- that is , he might ` a ' known I would n't let him get ahead of me in a business matter -- not with my boys twitting me about it every few minutes !
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 25]: But to talk to me the way he did this morning -- well , he was out of his head ; that 's all !
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 18]: Now , wait just a minute , '' he interposed , as she seemed about to speak .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 18]: `` In the first place , we are n't going to push this case against your brother .
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 52]: I believe in the law , all right , and business men got to protect themselves ; but in a case like this , where restitution 's made by the family , why , I expect it 's just as well sometimes to use a little influence and let matters drop .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 19]: Of course your brother 'll have to keep out o ' this state ; that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 10]: `` But -- you said -- '' she faltered .
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 6]: What 'd I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 14]: `` You said , ` where restitution 's made by the family . '
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 26]: That 's what seemed to trouble papa so terribly , because -- because restitution could n't -- '' `` Why , yes , it could .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 13]: That 's what I 'm here to talk to you about . ''
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 20]: `` I do n't see -- '' `` I 'm going to TELL you , ai n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 5]: he said , gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 11]: `` Just hold your horses a minute , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 20]: He coughed , rose from his chair , walked up and down the room , then halted before her .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 10]: `` It 's like this , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 39]: `` After I brought your father home , this morning , there was one of the things he told me , when he was going for me , over yonder -- it kind of stuck in my craw .
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 27]: It was something about all this glue controversy not meaning anything to me in particular , and meaning a whole heap to him and his family .
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 10]: Well , he was wrong about that two ways .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 25]: The first one was , it did mean a good deal to me to have him go back on me after so many years .
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 31]: I do n't need to say any more about it , except just to tell you it meant quite a little more to me than you 'd think , maybe .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 37]: The other way he was wrong is , that how much a thing means to one man and how little it means to another ai n't the right way to look at a business matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 11]: `` I suppose it is n't , Mr. Lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 5]: `` It is n't .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 11]: It 's not the right way to look at anything .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 70]: Yes , and your father knows it as well as I do , when he 's in his right mind ; and I expect that 's one of the reasons he got so mad at me -- but anyhow , I could n't help thinking about how much all this thing HAD maybe meant to him ; -- as I say , it kind of stuck in my craw .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 31]: I want you to tell him something from me , and I want you to go and tell him right off , if he 's able and willing to listen .
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 49]: You tell him I got kind of a notion he was pushed into this thing by circumstances , and tell him I 've lived long enough to know that circumstances can beat the best of us -- you tell him I said ` the BEST of us . '
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 34]: Tell him I have n't got a bit of feeling against him -- not any more -- and tell him I came here to ask him not to have any against me . ''
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 7]: `` Yes , Mr. Lamb . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 100]: `` Tell him I said -- '' The old man paused abruptly and Alice was surprised , in a dull and tired way , when she saw that his lips had begun to twitch and his eyelids to blink ; but he recovered himself almost at once , and continued : `` I want him to remember , ` Forgive us our transgressions , as we forgive those that transgress against us ' ; and if he and I been transgressing against each other , why , tell him I think it 's time we QUIT such foolishness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 36]: He coughed again , smiled heartily upon her , and walked toward the door ; then turned back to her with an exclamation : `` Well , if I ai n't an old fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 12]: `` Why , I forgot what we were just talking about !
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 10]: Your father wants to settle for Walter 's deficit .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 33]: Tell him we 'll be glad to accept it ; but of course we do n't expect him to clean the matter up until he 's able to talk business again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 16]: Alice stared at him blankly enough for him to perceive that further explanations were necessary .
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 10]: `` It 's like this , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 49]: `` You see , if your father decided to keep his works going over yonder , I do n't say but he might give us some little competition for a time , ` specially as he 's got the start on us and about ready for the market .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 53]: Then I was figuring we could use his plant -- it 's small , but it 'd be to our benefit to have the use of it -- and he 's got a lease on that big lot ; it may come in handy for us if we want to expand some .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 75]: Well , I 'd prefer to make a deal with him as quietly as possible -- no good in every Tom , Dick and Harry hearing about things like this -- but I figured he could sell out to me for a little something more 'n enough to cover the mortgage he put on this house , and Walter 's deficit , too -- THAT do n't amount to much in dollars and cents .
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 56]: The way I figure it , I could offer him about ninety-three hundred dollars as a total -- or say ninety-three hundred and fifty -- and if he feels like accepting , why , I 'll send a confidential man up here with the papers soon 's your father 's able to look 'em over .
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 21]: You tell him , will you , and ask him if he sees his way to accepting that figure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 39]: `` Yes , '' Alice said ; and now her own lips twitched , while her eyes filled so that she saw but a blurred image of the old man , who held out his hand in parting .
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 6]: `` I 'll tell him .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 4]: Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 6]: He shook her hand hastily .
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 20]: `` Well , let 's just keep it kind of quiet , '' he said , at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 18]: `` No good in every Tom , Dick and Harry knowing all what goes on in town !
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 26]: You telephone me when your papa 's ready to go over the papers -- and call me up at my house to-night , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 9]: Let me hear how he 's feeling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 20]: `` I will , '' she said , and through her grateful tears gave him a smile almost radiant .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 9]: `` He 'll be better , Mr. Lamb .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 5]: We all will . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 45]: CHAPTER XXV One morning , that autumn , Mrs. Adams came into Alice 's room , and found her completing a sober toilet for the street ; moreover , the expression revealed in her mirror was harmonious with the business-like severity of her attire .
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 11]: `` What makes you look so cross , dearie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 4]: the mother asked .
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 17]: `` Could n't you find anything nicer to wear than that plain old dark dress ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 16]: `` I do n't believe I 'm cross , '' the girl said , absently .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 8]: `` I believe I 'm just thinking .
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 7]: Is n't it about time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 6]: `` Time for what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 12]: `` Time for thinking -- for me , I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 10]: Disregarding this , Mrs. Adams looked her over thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 17]: `` I ca n't see why you do n't wear more colour , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 12]: `` At your age it 's becoming and proper , too .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 26]: Anyhow , when you 're going on the street , I think you ought to look just as gay and lively as you can manage .
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 12]: You want to show 'em you 've got some spunk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 9]: `` How do you mean , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 18]: `` I mean about Walter 's running away and the mess your father made of his business .
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 17]: It would help to show 'em you 're holding up your head just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 5]: `` Show whom ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 13]: `` All these other girls that -- '' `` Not I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 8]: Alice laughed shortly , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 23]: `` I 've quit dressing at them , and if they saw me they would n't think what you want 'em to .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 20]: It 's funny ; but we do n't often make people think what we want 'em to , mama .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 35]: You do thus and so ; and you tell yourself , ` Now , seeing me do thus and so , people will naturally think this and that ' ; but they do n't .
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 15]: They think something else -- usually just what you DO N'T want 'em to .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 23]: I suppose about the only good in pretending is the fun we get out of fooling ourselves that we fool somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 10]: `` Well , but it would n't be pretending .
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 17]: You ought to let people see you 're still holding your head up because you ARE .
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 38]: You would n't want that Mildred Palmer to think you 're cast down about -- well , you know you would n't want HER not to think you 're holding your head up , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 14]: `` She would n't know whether I am or not , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 35]: Alice bit her lip , then smiled faintly as she said : `` Anyhow , I 'm not thinking about my head in that way -- not this morning , I 'm not . ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 7]: Mrs. Adams dropped the subject casually .
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 7]: `` Are you going down-town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 9]: `` Just something I want to see about .
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 9]: I 'll tell you when I come back .
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 8]: Anything you want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 8]: `` No ; I guess not to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 20]: I thought you might look for a rug , but I 'd rather go with you to select it .
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 18]: We 'll have to get a new rug for your father 's room , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 10]: `` I 'm glad you think so , mama .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 23]: I do n't suppose he 's ever even noticed it , but that old rug of his -- well , really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 15]: `` I did n't mean for him , '' her mother explained , thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 24]: `` No ; he do n't mind it , and he 'd likely make a fuss if we changed it on his account .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 18]: No ; what I meant -- we 'll have to put your father in Walter 's room .
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 14]: He wo n't mind , I do n't expect -- not much . ''
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 14]: `` No , I suppose not , '' Alice agreed , rather sadly .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 8]: `` I heard the bell awhile ago .
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 7]: Was it somebody about that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 9]: `` Yes ; just before I came upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 19]: Mrs. Lohr gave him a note to me , and he was really a very pleasant-looking young man .
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 21]: A VERY pleasant-looking young man , '' Mrs. Adams repeated with increased animation and a thoughtful glance at her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 33]: `` He 's a Mr. Will Dickson ; he has a first-rate position with the gas works , Mrs. Lohr says , and he 's fully able to afford a nice room .
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 37]: So if you and I double up in here , then with that young married couple in my room , and this Mr. Dickson in your father 's , we 'll just about have things settled .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 29]: I thought maybe I could make one more place at table , too , so that with the other people from outside we 'd be serving eleven altogether .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 34]: You see if I have to pay this cook twelve dollars a week -- it ca n't be helped , I guess -- well , one more would certainly help toward a profit .
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 16]: Of course it 's a terribly worrying thing to see how we WILL come out .
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 12]: Do n't you suppose we could squeeze in one more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 11]: `` I suppose it COULD be managed ; yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 4]: Mrs. Adams brightened .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 23]: `` I 'm sure it 'll be pleasant having that young married couple in the house and especially this Mr. Will Dickson .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 17]: He seemed very much of a gentleman , and anxious to get settled in good surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 42]: I was very favourably impressed with him in every way ; and he explained to me about his name ; it seems it is n't William , it 's just ` Will ' ; his parents had him christened that way .
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 5]: It 's curious . ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 31]: She paused , and then , with an effort to seem casual , which veiled nothing from her daughter : `` It 's QUITE curious , '' she said again .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 15]: `` But it 's rather attractive and different , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 5]: `` Poor mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 4]: Alice laughed compassionately .
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 5]: `` Poor mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 11]: `` He is , though , '' Mrs. Adams maintained .
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 31]: `` He 's very much of a gentleman , unless I 'm no judge of appearances ; and it 'll really be nice to have him in the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 16]: `` No doubt , '' Alice said , as she opened her door to depart .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 20]: `` I do n't suppose we 'll mind having any of 'em as much as we thought we would .
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 3]: Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 12]: But her mother detained her , catching her by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 13]: `` Alice , you do hate it , do n't you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 10]: `` No , '' the girl said , quickly .
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 10]: `` There was n't anything else to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 17]: Mrs. Adams became emotional at once : her face cried tragedy , and her voice misfortune .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 10]: `` There MIGHT have been something else to do !
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 28]: Oh , Alice , you gave your father bad advice when you upheld him in taking a miserable little ninety-three hundred and fifty from that old wretch !
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 23]: If your father 'd just had the gumption to hold out , they 'd have had to pay him anything he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 18]: If he 'd just had the gumption and a little manly COURAGE -- '' `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 11]: Alice whispered , for her mother 's voice grew louder .
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 8]: He 'll hear you , mama . ''
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 9]: `` Could he hear me too often ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 5]: the embittered lady asked .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 38]: `` If he 'd listened to me at the right time , would we have to be taking in boarders and sinking DOWN in the scale at the end of our lives , instead of going UP ?
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 33]: You were both wrong ; we did n't need to be so panicky -- that was just what that old man wanted : to scare us and buy us out for nothing !
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 36]: If your father 'd just listened to me then , or if for once in his life he 'd just been half a MAN -- '' Alice put her hand over her mother 's mouth .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 5]: `` You must n't !
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 6]: He WILL hear you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 15]: But from the other side of Adams 's closed door his voice came querulously .
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 11]: `` Oh , I HEAR her , all right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 7]: `` You see , mama ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 26]: Alice said , and , as Mrs. Adams turned away , weeping , the daughter sighed ; then went in to speak to her father .
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 48]: He was in his old chair by the table , with a pillow behind his head , but the crocheted scarf and Mrs. Adams 's wrapper swathed him no more ; he wore a dressing-gown his wife had bought for him , and was smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 9]: `` The old story , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 8]: he said , as Alice came in .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 8]: `` The same , same old story !
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 5]: Has she gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 6]: `` Yes , papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 10]: `` Got your hat on , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 6]: `` Where you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 12]: `` I 'm going down-town on an errand of my own .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 9]: Is there anything you want , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 7]: `` Yes , there is . ''
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 5]: He smiled at her .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 31]: `` I wish you 'd sit down a while and talk to me unless your errand -- '' `` No , '' she said , taking a chair near him .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 17]: `` I was just going down to see about some arrangements I was making for myself .
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 6]: There 's no hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 9]: `` What arrangements for yourself , dearie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 17]: `` I 'll tell you afterwards -- after I find out something about 'em myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 10]: `` All right , '' he said , indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 10]: `` Keep your secrets ; keep your secrets . ''
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 14]: He paused , drew musingly upon his pipe , and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 11]: `` Funny -- the way your mother looks at things !
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 23]: For the matter o ' that , everything 's pretty funny , I expect , if you stop to think about it .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 63]: For instance , let her say all she likes , but we were pushed right spang to the wall , if J. A. Lamb had n't taken it into his head to make that offer for the works ; and there 's one of the things I been thinking about lately , Alice : thinking about how funny they work out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 11]: `` What did you think about it , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 27]: `` Well , I 've seen it happen in other people 's lives , time and time again ; and now it 's happened in ours .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 75]: You think you 're going to be pushed right up against the wall ; you ca n't see any way out , or any hope at all ; you think you 're GONE -- and then something you never counted on turns up ; and , while maybe you never do get back to where you used to be , yet somehow you kind of squirm out of being right SPANG against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 19]: You keep on going -- maybe you ca n't go much , but you do go a little .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 6]: See what I mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 6]: I understand , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 13]: `` Yes , I 'm afraid you do , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 4]: `` Too bad !
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 10]: You ought n't to understand it at your age .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 49]: It seems to me a good deal as if the Lord really meant for the young people to have the good times , and for the old to have the troubles ; and when anybody as young as you has trouble there 's a big mistake somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 3]: she protested .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 23]: But he persisted whimsically in this view of divine error : `` Yes , it does look a good deal that way .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 21]: But of course we ca n't tell ; we 're never certain about anything -- not about anything at all .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 10]: Sometimes I look at it another way , though .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 60]: Sometimes it looks to me as if a body 's troubles came on him mainly because he had n't had sense enough to know how not to have any -- as if his troubles were kind of like a boy 's getting kept in after school by the teacher , to give him discipline , or something or other .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 6]: But , my , my !
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 7]: We do n't learn easy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 4]: He chuckled mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 24]: `` Not to learn how to live till we 're about ready to die , it certainly seems to me dang tough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 18]: `` Then I would n't brood on such a notion , papa , '' she said . ''
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 4]: ` Brood ? '
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 3]: No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 11]: `` I just kind o ' mull it over . ''
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 50]: He chuckled again , sighed , and then , not looking at her , he said , `` That Mr. Russell -- your mother tells me he has n't been here again -- not since -- '' `` No , '' she said , quietly , as Adams paused .
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 7]: `` He never came again . ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 14]: `` Well , but maybe -- '' `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 9]: `` There is n't any ` maybe . '
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 9]: I told him good-bye that night , papa .
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 13]: It was before he knew about Walter -- I told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 9]: `` Well , well , '' Adams said .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 18]: `` Young people are entitled to their own privacy ; I do n't want to pry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 26]: He emptied his pipe into a chipped saucer on the table beside him , laid the pipe aside , and reverted to a former topic .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 15]: `` Speaking of dying -- '' `` Well , but we were n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 3]: Alice protested .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 21]: `` Yes , about not knowing how to live till you 're through living -- and THEN maybe not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 10]: he said , chuckling at his own determined pessimism .
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 55]: `` I see I 'm pretty old because I talk this way -- I remember my grandmother saying things a good deal like all what I 'm saying now ; I used to hear her at it when I was a young fellow -- she was a right gloomy old lady , I remember .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 35]: Well , anyhow , it reminds me : I want to get on my feet again as soon as I can ; I got to look around and find something to go into . ''
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 6]: Alice shook her head gently .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 22]: `` But , papa , he told you -- '' `` Never mind throwing that dang doctor up at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 5]: Adams interrupted , peevishly .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 23]: `` He said I 'd be good for SOME kind of light job -- if I could find just the right thing .
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 17]: ` Where there would n't be either any physical or mental strain , ' he said .
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 10]: Well , I got to find something like that .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 17]: Anyway , I 'll feel better if I can just get out LOOKING for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 21]: `` But , papa , I 'm afraid you wo n't find it , and you 'll be disappointed . ''
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 14]: `` Well , I want to hunt around and SEE , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 5]: Alice patted his hand .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 9]: `` You must just be contented , papa .
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 19]: Everything 's going to be all right , and you must n't get to worrying about doing anything .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 29]: We own this house it 's all clear -- and you 've taken care of mama and me all our lives ; now it 's our turn . ''
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 6]: `` No , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 5]: he said , querulously .
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 23]: `` I do n't like the idea of being the landlady 's husband around a boarding-house ; it goes against my gizzard .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 43]: _ I _ know : makes out the bills for his wife Sunday mornings -- works with a screw-driver on somebody 's bureau drawer sometimes -- ` tends the furnace maybe -- one the boarders gives him a cigar now and then .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 10]: That 's a FINE life to look forward to !
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 17]: No , sir ; I do n't want to finish as a landlady 's husband ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 18]: Alice looked grave ; for she knew the sketch was but too accurately prophetic in every probability .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 34]: `` But , papa , '' she said , to console him , `` do n't you think maybe there is n't such a thing as a ` finish , ' after all !
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 47]: You say perhaps we do n't learn to live till we die but maybe that 's how it is AFTER we die , too -- just learning some more , the way we do here , and maybe through trouble again , even after that . ''
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 11]: `` Oh , it might be , '' he sighed .
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 6]: `` I expect so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 22]: `` Well , then , '' she said , `` what 's the use of talking about a ` finish ? '
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 27]: We do keep looking ahead to things as if they 'd finish something , but when we get TO them , they do n't finish anything .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 8]: They 're just part of going on .
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 35]: I 'll tell you -- I looked ahead all summer to something I was afraid of , and I said to myself , ` Well , if that happens , I 'm finished ! '
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 8]: But it was n't so , papa .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 25]: It did happen , and nothing 's finished ; I 'm going on , just the same only -- '' She stopped and blushed .
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 5]: `` Only what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 26]: `` Well -- '' She blushed more deeply , then jumped up , and , standing before him , caught both his hands in hers .
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 32]: `` Well , do n't you think , since we do have to go on , we ought at least to have learned some sense about how to do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 7]: He looked up at her adoringly .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 29]: `` What _ I _ think , '' he said , and his voice trembled ; -- `` I think you 're the smartest girl in the world !
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 13]: I would n't trade you for the whole kit-and-boodle of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 24]: But as this folly of his threatened to make her tearful , she kissed him hastily , and went forth upon her errand .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 44]: Since the night of the tragic-comic dinner she had not seen Russell , nor caught even the remotest chance glimpse of him ; and it was curious that she should encounter him as she went upon such an errand as now engaged her .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 33]: At a corner , not far from that tobacconist 's shop she had just left when he overtook her and walked with her for the first time , she met him to-day .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 33]: He turned the corner , coming toward her , and they were face to face ; whereupon that engaging face of Russell 's was instantly reddened , but Alice 's remained serene .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 22]: She stopped short , though ; and so did he ; then she smiled brightly as she put out her hand .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 7]: `` Why , Mr. Russell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 20]: `` I 'm so -- I 'm so glad to have this -- this chance , '' he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 37]: `` I 've wanted to tell you -- it 's just that going into a new undertaking -- this business life -- one does n't get to do a great many things he 'd like to .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 16]: I hope you 'll let me call again some time , if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 6]: `` Yes , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 17]: she said , cordially , and then , with a quick nod , went briskly on .
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 32]: She breathed more rapidly , but knew that he could not have detected it , and she took some pride in herself for the way she had met this little crisis .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 26]: But to have met it with such easy courage meant to her something more reassuring than a momentary pride in the serenity she had shown .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 26]: For she found that what she had resolved in her inmost heart was now really true : she was `` through with all that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 35]: She walked on , but more slowly , for the tobacconist 's shop was not far from her now -- and , beyond it , that portal of doom , Frincke 's Business College .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 39]: Already Alice could read the begrimed gilt letters of the sign ; and although they had spelled destiny never with a more painful imminence than just then , an old habit of dramatizing herself still prevailed with her .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 36]: There came into her mind a whimsical comparison of her fate with that of the heroine in a French romance she had read long ago and remembered well , for she had cried over it .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 31]: The story ended with the heroine 's taking the veil after a death blow to love ; and the final scene again became vivid to Alice , for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 42]: Again , as when she had read and wept , she seemed herself to stand among the great shadows in the cathedral nave ; smelled the smoky incense on the enclosed air , and heard the solemn pulses of the organ .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 65]: She remembered how the novice 's father knelt , trembling , beside a pillar of gray stone ; how the faithless lover watched and shivered behind the statue of a saint ; how stifled sobs and outcries were heard when the novice came to the altar ; and how a shaft of light struck through the rose-window , enveloping her in an amber glow .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 76]: It was the vision of a moment only , and for no longer than a moment did Alice tell herself that the romance provided a prettier way of taking the veil than she had chosen , and that a faithless lover , shaking with remorse behind a saint 's statue , was a greater solace than one left on a street corner protesting that he 'd like to call some time -- if he could !
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 31]: Her pity for herself vanished more reluctantly ; but she shook it off and tried to smile at it , and at her romantic recollections -- at all of them .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 8]: She had something important to think of .
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 44]: She passed the tobacconist 's , and before her was that dark entrance to the wooden stairway leading up to Frincke 's Business College -- the very doorway she had always looked upon as the end of youth and the end of hope .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 45]: How often she had gone by here , hating the dreary obscurity of that stairway ; how often she had thought of this obscurity as something lying in wait to obliterate the footsteps of any girl who should ascend into the smoky darkness above !
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 38]: Never had she passed without those ominous imaginings of hers : pretty girls turning into old maids `` taking dictation '' -- old maids of a dozen different types , yet all looking a little like herself .
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 8]: Well , she was here at last !
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 37]: She looked up and down the street quickly , and then , with a little heave of the shoulders , she went bravely in , under the sign , and began to climb the wooden steps .
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 17]: Half-way up the shadows were heaviest , but after that the place began to seem brighter .
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 22]: There was an open window overhead somewhere , she found ; and the steps at the top were gay with sunshine .
