Parsing [sent. 1 len. 74]: Bleak House by Charles Dickens Preface A Chancery judge once had the kindness to inform me , as one of a company of some hundred and fifty men and women not labouring under any suspicions of lunacy , that the Court of Chancery , though the shining subject of much popular prejudice -LRB- at which point I thought the judge 's eye had a cast in my direction -RRB- , was almost immaculate .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 81]: There had been , he admitted , a trivial blemish or so in its rate of progress , but this was exaggerated and had been entirely owing to the `` parsimony of the public , '' which guilty public , it appeared , had been until lately bent in the most determined manner on by no means enlarging the number of Chancery judges appointed -- I believe by Richard the Second , but any other king will do as well .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 44]: This seemed to me too profound a joke to be inserted in the body of this book or I should have restored it to Conversation Kenge or to Mr. Vholes , with one or other of whom I think it must have originated .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 48]: In such mouths I might have coupled it with an apt quotation from one of Shakespeare 's sonnets : `` My nature is subdued To what it works in , like the dyer 's hand : Pity me , then , and wish I were renewed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 49]: But as it is wholesome that the parsimonious public should know what has been doing , and still is doing , in this connexion , I mention here that everything set forth in these pages concerning the Court of Chancery is substantially true , and within the truth .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 37]: The case of Gridley is in no essential altered from one of actual occurrence , made public by a disinterested person who was professionally acquainted with the whole of the monstrous wrong from beginning to end .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 80]: At the present moment -LRB- August , 1853 -RRB- there is a suit before the court which was commenced nearly twenty years ago , in which from thirty to forty counsel have been known to appear at one time , in which costs have been incurred to the amount of seventy thousand pounds , which is A FRIENDLY SUIT , and which is -LRB- I am assured -RRB- no nearer to its termination now than when it was begun .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 41]: There is another well-known suit in Chancery , not yet decided , which was commenced before the close of the last century and in which more than double the amount of seventy thousand pounds has been swallowed up in costs .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 27]: If I wanted other authorities for Jarndyce and Jarndyce , I could rain them on these pages , to the shame of -- a parsimonious public .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 15]: There is only one other point on which I offer a word of remark .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 69]: The possibility of what is called spontaneous combustion has been denied since the death of Mr. Krook ; and my good friend Mr. Lewes -LRB- quite mistaken , as he soon found , in supposing the thing to have been abandoned by all authorities -RRB- published some ingenious letters to me at the time when that event was chronicled , arguing that spontaneous combustion could not possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 31]: I have no need to observe that I do not wilfully or negligently mislead my readers and that before I wrote that description I took pains to investigate the subject .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 60]: There are about thirty cases on record , of which the most famous , that of the Countess Cornelia de Baudi Cesenate , was minutely investigated and described by Giuseppe Bianchini , a prebendary of Verona , otherwise distinguished in letters , who published an account of it at Verona in 1731 , which he afterwards republished at Rome .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 22]: The appearances , beyond all rational doubt , observed in that case are the appearances observed in Mr. Krook 's case .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 32]: The next most famous instance happened at Rheims six years earlier , and the historian in that case is Le Cat , one of the most renowned surgeons produced by France .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 51]: The subject was a woman , whose husband was ignorantly convicted of having murdered her ; but on solemn appeal to a higher court , he was acquitted because it was shown upon the evidence that she had died the death of which this name of spontaneous combustion is given .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 30]: I do not think it necessary to add to these notable facts , and that general reference to the authorities which will be found at page 30 , vol .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 55]: ii. ,1 the recorded opinions and experiences of distinguished medical professors , French , English , and Scotch , in more modern days , contenting myself with observing that I shall not abandon the facts until there shall have been a considerable spontaneous combustion of the testimony on which human occurrences are usually received .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 15]: In Bleak House I have purposely dwelt upon the romantic side of familiar things .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 29]: 1853 1 Another case , very clearly described by a dentist , occurred at the town of Columbus , in the United States of America , quite recently .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 15]: The subject was a German who kept a liquor-shop and was an inveterate drunkard .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 7]: Chapter I -- In Chancery London .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 16]: Michaelmas term lately over , and the Lord Chancellor sitting in Lincoln 's Inn Hall .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 4]: Implacable November weather .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 47]: As much mud in the streets as if the waters had but newly retired from the face of the earth , and it would not be wonderful to meet a Megalosaurus , forty feet long or so , waddling like an elephantine lizard up Holborn Hill .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 39]: Smoke lowering down from chimney-pots , making a soft black drizzle , with flakes of soot in it as big as full-grown snowflakes -- gone into mourning , one might imagine , for the death of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 6]: Dogs , undistinguishable in mire .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 11]: Horses , scarcely better ; splashed to their very blinkers .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 74]: Foot passengers , jostling one another 's umbrellas in a general infection of ill temper , and losing their foot-hold at street-corners , where tens of thousands of other foot passengers have been slipping and sliding since the day broke -LRB- if this day ever broke -RRB- , adding new deposits to the crust upon crust of mud , sticking at those points tenaciously to the pavement , and accumulating at compound interest .
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 3]: Fog everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 41]: Fog up the river , where it flows among green aits and meadows ; fog down the river , where it rolls deified among the tiers of shipping and the waterside pollutions of a great -LRB- and dirty -RRB- city .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 12]: Fog on the Essex marshes , fog on the Kentish heights .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 34]: Fog creeping into the cabooses of collier-brigs ; fog lying out on the yards and hovering in the rigging of great ships ; fog drooping on the gunwales of barges and small boats .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 57]: Fog in the eyes and throats of ancient Greenwich pensioners , wheezing by the firesides of their wards ; fog in the stem and bowl of the afternoon pipe of the wrathful skipper , down in his close cabin ; fog cruelly pinching the toes and fingers of his shivering little ` prentice boy on deck .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 37]: Chance people on the bridges peeping over the parapets into a nether sky of fog , with fog all round them , as if they were up in a balloon and hanging in the misty clouds .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 32]: Gas looming through the fog in divers places in the streets , much as the sun may , from the spongey fields , be seen to loom by husbandman and ploughboy .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 27]: Most of the shops lighted two hours before their time -- as the gas seems to know , for it has a haggard and unwilling look .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 39]: The raw afternoon is rawest , and the dense fog is densest , and the muddy streets are muddiest near that leaden-headed old obstruction , appropriate ornament for the threshold of a leaden-headed old corporation , Temple Bar .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 32]: And hard by Temple Bar , in Lincoln 's Inn Hall , at the very heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 50]: Never can there come fog too thick , never can there come mud and mire too deep , to assort with the groping and floundering condition which this High Court of Chancery , most pestilent of hoary sinners , holds this day in the sight of heaven and earth .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 78]: On such an afternoon , if ever , the Lord High Chancellor ought to be sitting her -- as here he is -- with a foggy glory round his head , softly fenced in with crimson cloth and curtains , addressed by a large advocate with great whiskers , a little voice , and an interminable brief , and outwardly directing his contemplation to the lantern in the roof , where he can see nothing but fog .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 76]: On such an afternoon some score of members of the High Court of Chancery bar ought to be -- as here they are -- mistily engaged in one of the ten thousand stages of an endless cause , tripping one another up on slippery precedents , groping knee-deep in technicalities , running their goat-hair and horsehair warded heads against walls of words and making a pretence of equity with serious faces , as players might .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 40]: On such an afternoon the various solicitors in the cause , some two or three of whom have inherited it from their fathers , who made a fortune by it , ought to be -- as are they not ?
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 69]: -- ranged in a line , in a long matted well -LRB- but you might look in vain for truth at the bottom of it -RRB- between the registrar 's red table and the silk gowns , with bills , cross-bills , answers , rejoinders , injunctions , affidavits , issues , references to masters , masters ' reports , mountains of costly nonsense , piled before them .
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 117]: Well may the court be dim , with wasting candles here and there ; well may the fog hang heavy in it , as if it would never get out ; well may the stained-glass windows lose their colour and admit no light of day into the place ; well may the uninitiated from the streets , who peep in through the glass panes in the door , be deterred from entrance by its owlish aspect and by the drawl , languidly echoing to the roof from the padded dais where the Lord High Chancellor looks into the lantern that has no light in it and where the attendant wigs are all stuck in a fog-bank !
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 132]: This is the Court of Chancery , which has its decaying houses and its blighted lands in every shire , which has its worn-out lunatic in every madhouse and its dead in every churchyard , which has its ruined suitor with his slipshod heels and threadbare dress borrowing and begging through the round of every man 's acquaintance , which gives to monied might the means abundantly of wearying out the right , which so exhausts finances , patience , courage , hope , so overthrows the brain and breaks the heart , that there is not an honourable man among its practitioners who would not give -- who does not often give -- the warning , `` Suffer any wrong that can be done you rather than come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 43]: Who happen to be in the Lord Chancellor 's court this murky afternoon besides the Lord Chancellor , the counsel in the cause , two or three counsel who are never in any cause , and the well of solicitors before mentioned ?
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 39]: There is the registrar below the judge , in wig and gown ; and there are two or three maces , or petty-bags , or privy purses , or whatever they may be , in legal court suits .
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 32]: These are all yawning , for no crumb of amusement ever falls from Jarndyce and Jarndyce -LRB- the cause in hand -RRB- , which was squeezed dry years upon years ago .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 31]: The short-hand writers , the reporters of the court , and the reporters of the newspapers invariably decamp with the rest of the regulars when Jarndyce and Jarndyce comes on .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 6]: Their places are a blank .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 56]: Standing on a seat at the side of the hall , the better to peer into the curtained sanctuary , is a little mad old woman in a squeezed bonnet who is always in court , from its sitting to its rising , and always expecting some incomprehensible judgment to be given in her favour .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 26]: Some say she really is , or was , a party to a suit , but no one knows for certain because no one cares .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 23]: She carries some small litter in a reticule which she calls her documents , principally consisting of paper matches and dry lavender .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 68]: A sallow prisoner has come up , in custody , for the half-dozenth time to make a personal application `` to purge himself of his contempt , '' which , being a solitary surviving executor who has fallen into a state of conglomeration about accounts of which it is not pretended that he had ever any knowledge , he is not at all likely ever to do .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 10]: In the meantime his prospects in life are ended .
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 79]: Another ruined suitor , who periodically appears from Shropshire and breaks out into efforts to address the Chancellor at the close of the day 's business and who can by no means be made to understand that the Chancellor is legally ignorant of his existence after making it desolate for a quarter of a century , plants himself in a good place and keeps an eye on the judge , ready to call out `` My Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 13]: in a voice of sonorous complaint on the instant of his rising .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 30]: A few lawyers ' clerks and others who know this suitor by sight linger on the chance of his furnishing some fun and enlivening the dismal weather a little .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 6]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce drones on .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 24]: This scarecrow of a suit has , in course of time , become so complicated that no man alive knows what it means .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 37]: The parties to it understand it least , but it has been observed that no two Chancery lawyers can talk about it for five minutes without coming to a total disagreement as to all the premises .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 26]: Innumerable children have been born into the cause ; innumerable young people have married into it ; innumerable old people have died out of it .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 29]: Scores of persons have deliriously found themselves made parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce without knowing how or why ; whole families have inherited legendary hatreds with the suit .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 37]: The little plaintiff or defendant who was promised a new rocking-horse when Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be settled has grown up , possessed himself of a real horse , and trotted away into the other world .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 82]: Fair wards of court have faded into mothers and grandmothers ; a long procession of Chancellors has come in and gone out ; the legion of bills in the suit have been transformed into mere bills of mortality ; there are not three Jarndyces left upon the earth perhaps since old Tom Jarndyce in despair blew his brains out at a coffee-house in Chancery Lane ; but Jarndyce and Jarndyce still drags its dreary length before the court , perennially hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 9]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce has passed into a joke .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 12]: That is the only good that has ever come of it .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 16]: It has been death to many , but it is a joke in the profession .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 12]: Every master in Chancery has had a reference out of it .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 21]: Every Chancellor was `` in it , '' for somebody or other , when he was counsel at the bar .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 22]: Good things have been said about it by blue-nosed , bulbous-shoed old benchers in select port-wine committee after dinner in hall .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 15]: Articled clerks have been in the habit of fleshing their legal wit upon it .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 62]: The last Lord Chancellor handled it neatly , when , correcting Mr. Blowers , the eminent silk gown who said that such a thing might happen when the sky rained potatoes , he observed , `` or when we get through Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mr. Blowers '' -- a pleasantry that particularly tickled the maces , bags , and purses .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 27]: How many people out of the suit Jarndyce and Jarndyce has stretched forth its unwholesome hand to spoil and corrupt would be a very wide question .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 58]: From the master upon whose impaling files reams of dusty warrants in Jarndyce and Jarndyce have grimly writhed into many shapes , down to the copying-clerk in the Six Clerks ' Office who has copied his tens of thousands of Chancery folio-pages under that eternal heading , no man 's nature has been made better by it .
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 28]: In trickery , evasion , procrastination , spoliation , botheration , under false pretences of all sorts , there are influences that can never come to good .
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 54]: The very solicitors ' boys who have kept the wretched suitors at bay , by protesting time out of mind that Mr. Chizzle , Mizzle , or otherwise was particularly engaged and had appointments until dinner , may have got an extra moral twist and shuffle into themselves out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 32]: The receiver in the cause has acquired a goodly sum of money by it but has acquired too a distrust of his own mother and a contempt for his own kind .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 51]: Chizzle , Mizzle , and otherwise have lapsed into a habit of vaguely promising themselves that they will look into that outstanding little matter and see what can be done for Drizzle -- who was not well used -- when Jarndyce and Jarndyce shall be got out of the office .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 74]: Shirking and sharking in all their many varieties have been sown broadcast by the ill-fated cause ; and even those who have contemplated its history from the outermost circle of such evil have been insensibly tempted into a loose way of letting bad things alone to take their own bad course , and a loose belief that if the world go wrong it was in some off-hand manner never meant to go right .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 28]: Thus , in the midst of the mud and at the heart of the fog , sits the Lord High Chancellor in his High Court of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 22]: `` Mr. Tangle , '' says the Lord High Chancellor , latterly something restless under the eloquence of that learned gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 8]: `` Mlud , '' says Mr. Tangle .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 11]: Mr. Tangle knows more of Jarndyce and Jarndyce than anybody .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 18]: He is famous for it -- supposed never to have read anything else since he left school .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 9]: `` Have you nearly concluded your argument ? ''
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 28]: `` Mlud , no -- variety of points -- feel it my duty tsubmit -- ludship , '' is the reply that slides out of Mr. Tangle .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 16]: `` Several members of the bar are still to be heard , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 8]: says the Chancellor with a slight smile .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 41]: Eighteen of Mr. Tangle 's learned friends , each armed with a little summary of eighteen hundred sheets , bob up like eighteen hammers in a pianoforte , make eighteen bows , and drop into their eighteen places of obscurity .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 16]: `` We will proceed with the hearing on Wednesday fortnight , '' says the Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 36]: For the question at issue is only a question of costs , a mere bud on the forest tree of the parent suit , and really will come to a settlement one of these days .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 28]: The Chancellor rises ; the bar rises ; the prisoner is brought forward in a hurry ; the man from Shropshire cries , `` My lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 17]: Maces , bags , and purses indignantly proclaim silence and frown at the man from Shropshire .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 35]: `` In reference , '' proceeds the Chancellor , still on Jarndyce and Jarndyce , `` to the young girl -- '' `` Begludship 's pardon -- boy , '' says Mr. Tangle prematurely .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 71]: `` In reference , '' proceeds the Chancellor with extra distinctness , `` to the young girl and boy , the two young people '' -- Mr. Tangle crushed -- `` whom I directed to be in attendance to-day and who are now in my private room , I will see them and satisfy myself as to the expediency of making the order for their residing with their uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 7]: Mr. Tangle on his legs again .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 8]: `` Begludship 's pardon -- dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 22]: `` With their '' -- Chancellor looking through his double eyeglass at the papers on his desk -- `` grandfather . ''
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 13]: `` Begludship 's pardon -- victim of rash action -- brains . ''
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 33]: Suddenly a very little counsel with a terrific bass voice arises , fully inflated , in the back settlements of the fog , and says , `` Will your lordship allow me ?
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 5]: I appear for him .
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 9]: He is a cousin , several times removed .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 26]: I am not at the moment prepared to inform the court in what exact remove he is a cousin , but he IS a cousin .
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 32]: Leaving this address -LRB- delivered like a sepulchral message -RRB- ringing in the rafters of the roof , the very little counsel drops , and the fog knows him no more .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 5]: Everybody looks for him .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 5]: Nobody can see him .
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 30]: `` I will speak with both the young people , '' says the Chancellor anew , `` and satisfy myself on the subject of their residing with their cousin .
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 14]: I will mention the matter to-morrow morning when I take my seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 15]: The Chancellor is about to bow to the bar when the prisoner is presented .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 22]: Nothing can possibly come of the prisoner 's conglomeration but his being sent back to prison , which is soon done .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 12]: The man from Shropshire ventures another remonstrative `` My lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 13]: but the Chancellor , being aware of him , has dexterously vanished .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 6]: Everybody else quickly vanishes too .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 36]: A battery of blue bags is loaded with heavy charges of papers and carried off by clerks ; the little mad old woman marches off with her documents ; the empty court is locked up .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 49]: If all the injustice it has committed and all the misery it has caused could only be locked up with it , and the whole burnt away in a great funeral pyre -- why so much the better for other parties than the parties in Jarndyce and Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 24]: Chapter II -- In Fashion It is but a glimpse of the world of fashion that we want on this same miry afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 27]: It is not so unlike the Court of Chancery but that we may pass from the one scene to the other , as the crow flies .
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 58]: Both the world of fashion and the Court of Chancery are things of precedent and usage : oversleeping Rip Van Winkles who have played at strange games through a deal of thundery weather ; sleeping beauties whom the knight will wake one day , when all the stopped spits in the kitchen shall begin to turn prodigiously !
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 7]: It is not a large world .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 46]: Relatively even to this world of ours , which has its limits too -LRB- as your Highness shall find when you have made the tour of it and are come to the brink of the void beyond -RRB- , it is a very little speck .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 23]: There is much good in it ; there are many good and true people in it ; it has its appointed place .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 46]: But the evil of it is that it is a world wrapped up in too much jeweller 's cotton and fine wool , and can not hear the rushing of the larger worlds , and can not see them as they circle round the sun .
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 17]: It is a deadened world , and its growth is sometimes unhealthy for want of air .
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 37]: My Lady Dedlock has returned to her house in town for a few days previous to her departure for Paris , where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 19]: The fashionable intelligence says so for the comfort of the Parisians , and it knows all fashionable things .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 9]: To know things otherwise were to be unfashionable .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 22]: My Lady Dedlock has been down at what she calls , in familiar conversation , her `` place '' in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 7]: The waters are out in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 15]: An arch of the bridge in the park has been sapped and sopped away .
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 36]: The adjacent low-lying ground for half a mile in breadth is a stagnant river with melancholy trees for islands in it and a surface punctured all over , all day long , with falling rain .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 10]: My Lady Dedlock 's place has been extremely dreary .
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 40]: The weather for many a day and night has been so wet that the trees seem wet through , and the soft loppings and prunings of the woodman 's axe can make no crash or crackle as they fall .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 12]: The deer , looking soaked , leave quagmires where they pass .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 38]: The shot of a rifle loses its sharpness in the moist air , and its smoke moves in a tardy little cloud towards the green rise , coppice-topped , that makes a background for the falling rain .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 21]: The view from my Lady Dedlock 's own windows is alternately a lead-coloured view and a view in Indian ink .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 45]: The vases on the stone terrace in the foreground catch the rain all day ; and the heavy drops fall -- drip , drip , drip -- upon the broad flagged pavement , called from old time the Ghost 's Walk , all night .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 38]: On Sundays the little church in the park is mouldy ; the oaken pulpit breaks out into a cold sweat ; and there is a general smell and taste as of the ancient Dedlocks in their graves .
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 78]: My Lady Dedlock -LRB- who is childless -RRB- , looking out in the early twilight from her boudoir at a keeper 's lodge and seeing the light of a fire upon the latticed panes , and smoke rising from the chimney , and a child , chased by a woman , running out into the rain to meet the shining figure of a wrapped-up man coming through the gate , has been put quite out of temper .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 13]: My Lady Dedlock says she has been `` bored to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 38]: Therefore my Lady Dedlock has come away from the place in Lincolnshire and has left it to the rain , and the crows , and the rabbits , and the deer , and the partridges and pheasants .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 36]: The pictures of the Dedlocks past and gone have seemed to vanish into the damp walls in mere lowness of spirits , as the housekeeper has passed along the old rooms shutting up the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 39]: And when they will next come forth again , the fashionable intelligence -- which , like the fiend , is omniscient of the past and present , but not the future -- can not yet undertake to say .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 17]: Sir Leicester Dedlock is only a baronet , but there is no mightier baronet than he .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 14]: His family is as old as the hills , and infinitely more respectable .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 21]: He has a general opinion that the world might get on without hills but would be done up without Dedlocks .
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 40]: He would on the whole admit nature to be a good idea -LRB- a little low , perhaps , when not enclosed with a park-fence -RRB- , but an idea dependent for its execution on your great county families .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 41]: He is a gentleman of strict conscience , disdainful of all littleness and meanness and ready on the shortest notice to die any death you may please to mention rather than give occasion for the least impeachment of his integrity .
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 18]: He is an honourable , obstinate , truthful , high-spirited , intensely prejudiced , perfectly unreasonable man .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 14]: Sir Leicester is twenty years , full measure , older than my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 15]: He will never see sixty-five again , nor perhaps sixty-six , nor yet sixty-seven .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 16]: He has a twist of the gout now and then and walks a little stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 32]: He is of a worthy presence , with his light-grey hair and whiskers , his fine shirt-frill , his pure-white waistcoat , and his blue coat with bright buttons always buttoned .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 25]: He is ceremonious , stately , most polite on every occasion to my Lady , and holds her personal attractions in the highest estimation .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 26]: His gallantry to my Lady , which has never changed since he courted her , is the one little touch of romantic fancy in him .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 8]: Indeed , he married her for love .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 32]: A whisper still goes about that she had not even family ; howbeit , Sir Leicester had so much family that perhaps he had enough and could dispense with any more .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 24]: But she had beauty , pride , ambition , insolent resolve , and sense enough to portion out a legion of fine ladies .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 38]: Wealth and station , added to these , soon floated her upward , and for years now my Lady Dedlock has been at the centre of the fashionable intelligence and at the top of the fashionable tree .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 33]: How Alexander wept when he had no more worlds to conquer , everybody knows -- or has some reason to know by this time , the matter having been rather frequently mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 23]: My Lady Dedlock , having conquered HER world , fell not into the melting , but rather into the freezing , mood .
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 28]: An exhausted composure , a worn-out placidity , an equanimity of fatigue not to be ruffled by interest or satisfaction , are the trophies of her victory .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 5]: She is perfectly well-bred .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 19]: If she could be translated to heaven to-morrow , she might be expected to ascend without any rapture .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 22]: She has beauty still , and if it be not in its heyday , it is not yet in its autumn .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 33]: She has a fine face -- originally of a character that would be rather called very pretty than handsome , but improved into classicality by the acquired expression of her fashionable state .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 12]: Her figure is elegant and has the effect of being tall .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 33]: Not that she is so , but that `` the most is made , '' as the Honourable Bob Stables has frequently asserted upon oath , `` of all her points . ''
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 29]: The same authority observes that she is perfectly got up and remarks in commendation of her hair especially that she is the best-groomed woman in the whole stud .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 60]: With all her perfections on her head , my Lady Dedlock has come up from her place in Lincolnshire -LRB- hotly pursued by the fashionable intelligence -RRB- to pass a few days at her house in town previous to her departure for Paris , where her ladyship intends to stay some weeks , after which her movements are uncertain .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 80]: And at her house in town , upon this muddy , murky afternoon , presents himself an old-fashioned old gentleman , attorney-at-law and eke solicitor of the High Court of Chancery , who has the honour of acting as legal adviser of the Dedlocks and has as many cast-iron boxes in his office with that name outside as if the present baronet were the coin of the conjuror 's trick and were constantly being juggled through the whole set .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 60]: Across the hall , and up the stairs , and along the passages , and through the rooms , which are very brilliant in the season and very dismal out of it -- fairy-land to visit , but a desert to live in -- the old gentleman is conducted by a Mercury in powder to my Lady 's presence .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 32]: The old gentleman is rusty to look at , but is reputed to have made good thrift out of aristocratic marriage settlements and aristocratic wills , and to be very rich .
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 22]: He is surrounded by a mysterious halo of family confidences , of which he is known to be the silent depository .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 41]: There are noble mausoleums rooted for centuries in retired glades of parks among the growing timber and the fern , which perhaps hold fewer noble secrets than walk abroad among men , shut up in the breast of Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 36]: He is of what is called the old school -- a phrase generally meaning any school that seems never to have been young -- and wears knee-breeches tied with ribbons , and gaiters or stockings .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 24]: One peculiarity of his black clothes and of his black stockings , be they silk or worsted , is that they never shine .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 16]: Mute , close , irresponsive to any glancing light , his dress is like himself .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 8]: He never converses when not professionaly consulted .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 55]: He is found sometimes , speechless but quite at home , at corners of dinner-tables in great country houses and near doors of drawing-rooms , concerning which the fashionable intelligence is eloquent , where everybody knows him and where half the Peerage stops to say `` How do you do , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 17]: He receives these salutations with gravity and buries them along with the rest of his knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 15]: Sir Leicester Dedlock is with my Lady and is happy to see Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 25]: There is an air of prescription about him which is always agreeable to Sir Leicester ; he receives it as a kind of tribute .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 17]: He likes Mr. Tulkinghorn 's dress ; there is a kind of tribute in that too .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 15]: It is eminently respectable , and likewise , in a general way , retainer-like .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 25]: It expresses , as it were , the steward of the legal mysteries , the butler of the legal cellar , of the Dedlocks .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 9]: Has Mr. Tulkinghorn any idea of this himself ?
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 44]: It may be so , or it may not , but there is this remarkable circumstance to be noted in everything associated with my Lady Dedlock as one of a class -- as one of the leaders and representatives of her little world .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 32]: She supposes herself to be an inscrutable Being , quite out of the reach and ken of ordinary mortals -- seeing herself in her glass , where indeed she looks so .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 57]: Yet every dim little star revolving about her , from her maid to the manager of the Italian Opera , knows her weaknesses , prejudices , follies , haughtinesses , and caprices and lives upon as accurate a calculation and as nice a measure of her moral nature as her dressmaker takes of her physical proportions .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 42]: Is a new dress , a new custom , a new singer , a new dancer , a new form of jewellery , a new dwarf or giant , a new chapel , a new anything , to be set up ?
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 89]: There are deferential people in a dozen callings whom my Lady Dedlock suspects of nothing but prostration before her , who can tell you how to manage her as if she were a baby , who do nothing but nurse her all their lives , who , humbly affecting to follow with profound subservience , lead her and her whole troop after them ; who , in hooking one , hook all and bear them off as Lemuel Gulliver bore away the stately fleet of the majestic Lilliput .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 64]: `` If you want to address our people , sir , '' say Blaze and Sparkle , the jewellers -- meaning by our people Lady Dedlock and the rest -- `` you must remember that you are not dealing with the general public ; you must hit our people in their weakest place , and their weakest place is such a place . ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 50]: `` To make this article go down , gentlemen , '' say Sheen and Gloss , the mercers , to their friends the manufacturers , `` you must come to us , because we know where to have the fashionable people , and we can make it fashionable . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 127]: `` If you want to get this print upon the tables of my high connexion , sir , '' says Mr. Sladdery , the librarian , `` or if you want to get this dwarf or giant into the houses of my high connexion , sir , or if you want to secure to this entertainment the patronage of my high connexion , sir , you must leave it , if you please , to me , for I have been accustomed to study the leaders of my high connexion , sir , and I may tell you without vanity that I can turn them round my finger '' -- in which Mr. Sladdery , who is an honest man , does not exaggerate at all .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 26]: Therefore , while Mr. Tulkinghorn may not know what is passing in the Dedlock mind at present , it is very possible that he may .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 19]: `` My Lady 's cause has been again before the Chancellor , has it , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 9]: says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 38]: It has been on again to-day , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , making one of his quiet bows to my Lady , who is on a sofa near the fire , shading her face with a hand-screen .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 32]: `` It would be useless to ask , '' says my Lady with the dreariness of the place in Lincolnshire still upon her , `` whether anything has been done . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 17]: `` Nothing that YOU would call anything has been done to-day , '' replies Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 11]: `` Nor ever will be , '' says my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 11]: Sir Leicester has no objection to an interminable Chancery suit .
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 14]: It is a slow , expensive , British , constitutional kind of thing .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 66]: To be sure , he has not a vital interest in the suit in question , her part in which was the only property my Lady brought him ; and he has a shadowy impression that for his name -- the name of Dedlock -- to be in a cause , and not in the title of that cause , is a most ridiculous accident .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 54]: But he regards the Court of Chancery , even if it should involve an occasional delay of justice and a trifling amount of confusion , as a something devised in conjunction with a variety of other somethings by the perfection of human wisdom for the eternal settlement -LRB- humanly speaking -RRB- of everything .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 42]: And he is upon the whole of a fixed opinion that to give the sanction of his countenance to any complaints respecting it would be to encourage some person in the lower classes to rise up somewhere -- like Wat Tyler .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 83]: `` As a few fresh affidavits have been put upon the file , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` and as they are short , and as I proceed upon the troublesome principle of begging leave to possess my clients with any new proceedings in a cause '' -- cautious man Mr. Tulkinghorn , taking no more responsibility than necessary -- `` and further , as I see you are going to Paris , I have brought them in my pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 26]: -LRB- Sir Leicester was going to Paris too , by the by , but the delight of the fashionable intelligence was in his Lady . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 43]: Mr. Tulkinghorn takes out his papers , asks permission to place them on a golden talisman of a table at my Lady 's elbow , puts on his spectacles , and begins to read by the light of a shaded lamp . ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 4]: ` In Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 24]: Between John Jarndyce -- ' '' My Lady interrupts , requesting him to miss as many of the formal horrors as he can .
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 12]: Mr. Tulkinghorn glances over his spectacles and begins again lower down .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 9]: My Lady carelessly and scornfully abstracts her attention .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 30]: Sir Leicester in a great chair looks at the file and appears to have a stately liking for the legal repetitions and prolixities as ranging among the national bulwarks .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 26]: It happens that the fire is hot where my Lady sits and that the hand-screen is more beautiful than useful , being priceless but small .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 34]: My Lady , changing her position , sees the papers on the table -- looks at them nearer -- looks at them nearer still -- asks impulsively , `` Who copied that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 16]: Mr. Tulkinghorn stops short , surprised by my Lady 's animation and her unusual tone .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 10]: `` Is it what you people call law-hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 18]: she asks , looking full at him in her careless way again and toying with her screen .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 4]: `` Not quite .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 27]: Probably '' -- Mr. Tulkinghorn examines it as he speaks -- `` the legal character which it has was acquired after the original hand was formed .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 6]: Why do you ask ? ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 8]: `` Anything to vary this detestable monotony .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 8]: Oh , go on , do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 5]: Mr. Tulkinghorn reads again .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 11]: The heat is greater ; my Lady screens her face .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 14]: Sir Leicester dozes , starts up suddenly , and cries , `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 6]: What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 25]: `` I say I am afraid , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who had risen hastily , `` that Lady Dedlock is ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 24]: `` Faint , '' my Lady murmurs with white lips , `` only that ; but it is like the faintness of death .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 6]: Do n't speak to me .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 10]: Ring , and take me to my room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 18]: Mr. Tulkinghorn retires into another chamber ; bells ring , feet shuffle and patter , silence ensues .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 9]: Mercury at last begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to return .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 21]: `` Better now , '' quoth Sir Leicester , motioning the lawyer to sit down and read to him alone .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 7]: `` I have been quite alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 8]: I never knew my Lady swoon before .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 23]: But the weather is extremely trying , and she really has been bored to death down at our place in Lincolnshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 30]: Chapter III -- A Progress I have a great deal of difficulty in beginning to write my portion of these pages , for I know I am not clever .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 5]: I always knew that .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 54]: I can remember , when I was a very little girl indeed , I used to say to my doll when we were alone together , `` Now , Dolly , I am not clever , you know very well , and you must be patient with me , like a dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 53]: And so she used to sit propped up in a great arm-chair , with her beautiful complexion and rosy lips , staring at me -- or not so much at me , I think , as at nothing -- while I busily stitched away and told her every one of my secrets .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 5]: My dear old doll !
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 28]: I was such a shy little thing that I seldom dared to open my lips , and never dared to open my heart , to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 51]: It almost makes me cry to think what a relief it used to be to me when I came home from school of a day to run upstairs to my room and say , `` Oh , you dear faithful Dolly , I knew you would be expecting me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 29]: and then to sit down on the floor , leaning on the elbow of her great chair , and tell her all I had noticed since we parted .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 17]: I had always rather a noticing way -- not a quick way , oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 20]: -- a silent way of noticing what passed before me and thinking I should like to understand it better .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 10]: I have not by any means a quick understanding .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 14]: When I love a person very tenderly indeed , it seems to brighten .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 8]: But even that may be my vanity .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 30]: I was brought up , from my earliest remembrance -- like some of the princesses in the fairy stories , only I was not charming -- by my godmother .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 10]: At least , I only knew her as such .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 8]: She was a good , good woman !
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 30]: She went to church three times every Sunday , and to morning prayers on Wednesdays and Fridays , and to lectures whenever there were lectures ; and never missed .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 29]: She was handsome ; and if she had ever smiled , would have been -LRB- I used to think -RRB- like an angel -- but she never smiled .
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 7]: She was always grave and strict .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 23]: She was so very good herself , I thought , that the badness of other people made her frown all her life .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 53]: I felt so different from her , even making every allowance for the differences between a child and a woman ; I felt so poor , so trifling , and so far off that I never could be unrestrained with her -- no , could never even love her as I wished .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 76]: It made me very sorry to consider how good she was and how unworthy of her I was , and I used ardently to hope that I might have a better heart ; and I talked it over very often with the dear old doll , but I never loved my godmother as I ought to have loved her and as I felt I must have loved her if I had been a better girl .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 32]: This made me , I dare say , more timid and retiring than I naturally was and cast me upon Dolly as the only friend with whom I felt at ease .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 17]: But something happened when I was still quite a little thing that helped it very much .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 9]: I had never heard my mama spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 18]: I had never heard of my papa either , but I felt more interested about my mama .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 13]: I had never worn a black frock , that I could recollect .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 10]: I had never been shown my mama 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 9]: I had never been told where it was .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 15]: Yet I had never been taught to pray for any relation but my godmother .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 54]: I had more than once approached this subject of my thoughts with Mrs. Rachael , our only servant , who took my light away when I was in bed -LRB- another very good woman , but austere to me -RRB- , and she had only said , `` Esther , good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 7]: and gone away and left me .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 33]: Although there were seven girls at the neighbouring school where I was a day boarder , and although they called me little Esther Summerson , I knew none of them at home .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 54]: All of them were older than I , to be sure -LRB- I was the youngest there by a good deal -RRB- , but there seemed to be some other separation between us besides that , and besides their being far more clever than I was and knowing much more than I did .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 33]: One of them in the first week of my going to the school -LRB- I remember it very well -RRB- invited me home to a little party , to my great joy .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 16]: But my godmother wrote a stiff letter declining for me , and I never went .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 7]: I never went out at all .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 5]: It was my birthday .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 13]: There were holidays at school on other birthdays -- none on mine .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 29]: There were rejoicings at home on other birthdays , as I knew from what I heard the girls relate to one another -- there were none on mine .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 14]: My birthday was the most melancholy day at home in the whole year .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 43]: I have mentioned that unless my vanity should deceive me -LRB- as I know it may , for I may be very vain without suspecting it , though indeed I do n't -RRB- , my comprehension is quickened when my affection is .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 32]: My disposition is very affectionate , and perhaps I might still feel such a wound if such a wound could be received more than once with the quickness of that birthday .
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 18]: Dinner was over , and my godmother and I were sitting at the table before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 29]: The clock ticked , the fire clicked ; not another sound had been heard in the room or in the house for I do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 55]: I happened to look timidly up from my stitching , across the table at my godmother , and I saw in her face , looking gloomily at me , `` It would have been far better , little Esther , that you had had no birthday , that you had never been born ! ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 33]: I broke out crying and sobbing , and I said , `` Oh , dear godmother , tell me , pray do tell me , did Mama die on my birthday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 7]: `` No , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 9]: `` Ask me no more , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 11]: `` Oh , do pray tell me something of her .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 13]: Do now , at last , dear godmother , if you please !
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 7]: What did I do to her ?
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 6]: How did I lose her ?
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 19]: Why am I so different from other children , and why is it my fault , dear godmother ?
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 11]: No , no , no , do n't go away .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 7]: Oh , speak to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 24]: I was in a kind of fright beyond my grief , and I caught hold of her dress and was kneeling to her .
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 14]: She had been saying all the while , `` Let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 6]: But now she stood still .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 19]: Her darkened face had such power over me that it stopped me in the midst of my vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 38]: I put up my trembling little hand to clasp hers or to beg her pardon with what earnestness I might , but withdrew it as she looked at me , and laid it on my fluttering heart .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 48]: She raised me , sat in her chair , and standing me before her , said slowly in a cold , low voice -- I see her knitted brow and pointed finger -- `` Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 29]: The time will come -- and soon enough -- when you will understand this better and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 51]: I have forgiven her '' -- but her face did not relent -- `` the wrong she did to me , and I say no more of it , though it was greater than you will ever know -- than any one will ever know but I , the sufferer .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 37]: For yourself , unfortunate girl , orphaned and degraded from the first of these evil anniversaries , pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head , according to what is written .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 21]: Forget your mother and leave all other people to forget her who will do her unhappy child that greatest kindness .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 5]: Now , go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 21]: She checked me , however , as I was about to depart from her -- so frozen as I was !
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 27]: -- and added this , `` Submission , self-denial , diligent work , are the preparations for a life begun with such a shadow on it .
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 24]: You are different from other children , Esther , because you were not born , like them , in common sinfulness and wrath .
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 6]: You are set apart . ''
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 38]: I went up to my room , and crept to bed , and laid my doll 's cheek against mine wet with tears , and holding that solitary friend upon my bosom , cried myself to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 39]: Imperfect as my understanding of my sorrow was , I knew that I had brought no joy at any time to anybody 's heart and that I was to no one upon earth what Dolly was to me .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 96]: Dear , dear , to think how much time we passed alone together afterwards , and how often I repeated to the doll the story of my birthday and confided to her that I would try as hard as ever I could to repair the fault I had been born with -LRB- of which I confessedly felt guilty and yet innocent -RRB- and would strive as I grew up to be industrious , contented , and kind-hearted and to do some good to some one , and win some love to myself if I could .
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 16]: I hope it is not self-indulgent to shed these tears as I think of it .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 22]: I am very thankful , I am very cheerful , but I can not quite help their coming to my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 13]: I have wiped them away now and can go on again properly .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 57]: I felt the distance between my godmother and myself so much more after the birthday , and felt so sensible of filling a place in her house which ought to have been empty , that I found her more difficult of approach , though I was fervently grateful to her in my heart , than ever .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 48]: I felt in the same way towards my school companions ; I felt in the same way towards Mrs. Rachael , who was a widow ; and oh , towards her daughter , of whom she was proud , who came to see her once a fortnight !
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 14]: I was very retired and quiet , and tried to be very diligent .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 48]: One sunny afternoon when I had come home from school with my books and portfolio , watching my long shadow at my side , and as I was gliding upstairs to my room as usual , my godmother looked out of the parlour-door and called me back .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 16]: Sitting with her , I found -- which was very unusual indeed -- a stranger .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 36]: A portly , important-looking gentleman , dressed all in black , with a white cravat , large gold watch seals , a pair of gold eye-glasses , and a large seal-ring upon his little finger .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 17]: `` This , '' said my godmother in an undertone , `` is the child . ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 19]: Then she said in her naturally stern way of speaking , `` This is Esther , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 21]: The gentleman put up his eye-glasses to look at me and said , `` Come here , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 21]: He shook hands with me and asked me to take off my bonnet , looking at me all the while .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 12]: When I had complied , he said , `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 6]: and afterwards `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 38]: And then , taking off his eye-glasses and folding them in a red case , and leaning back in his arm-chair , turning the case about in his two hands , he gave my godmother a nod .
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 16]: Upon that , my godmother said , `` You may go upstairs , Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 10]: And I made him my curtsy and left him .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 27]: It must have been two years afterwards , and I was almost fourteen , when one dreadful night my godmother and I sat at the fireside .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 10]: I was reading aloud , and she was listening .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 48]: I had come down at nine o'clock as I always did to read the Bible to her , and was reading from St. John how our Saviour stooped down , writing with his finger in the dust , when they brought the sinful woman to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 36]: ` So when they continued asking him , he lifted up himself and said unto them , He that is without sin among you , let him first cast a stone at her ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 46]: I was stopped by my godmother 's rising , putting her hand to her head , and crying out in an awful voice from quite another part of the book , '' ` Watch ye , therefore , lest coming suddenly he find you sleeping .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 16]: And what I say unto you , I say unto all , Watch ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 20]: In an instant , while she stood before me repeating these words , she fell down on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 22]: I had no need to cry out ; her voice had sounded through the house and been heard in the street .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 7]: She was laid upon her bed .
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 29]: For more than a week she lay there , little altered outwardly , with her old handsome resolute frown that I so well knew carved upon her face .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 65]: Many and many a time , in the day and in the night , with my head upon the pillow by her that my whispers might be plainer to her , I kissed her , thanked her , prayed for her , asked her for her blessing and forgiveness , entreated her to give me the least sign that she knew or heard me .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 6]: No , no , no .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 5]: Her face was immovable .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 14]: To the very last , and even afterwards , her frown remained unsoftened .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 21]: On the day after my poor good godmother was buried , the gentleman in black with the white neckcloth reappeared .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 24]: I was sent for by Mrs. Rachael , and found him in the same place , as if he had never gone away .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 28]: `` My name is Kenge , '' he said ; `` you may remember it , my child ; Kenge and Carboy , Lincoln 's Inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 12]: I replied that I remembered to have seen him once before .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 9]: `` Pray be seated -- here near me .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 11]: Do n't distress yourself ; it 's of no use .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 45]: Mrs. Rachael , I need n't inform you who were acquainted with the late Miss Barbary 's affairs , that her means die with her and that this young lady , now her aunt is dead -- '' `` My aunt , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 37]: `` It is really of no use carrying on a deception when no object is to be gained by it , '' said Mr. Kenge smoothly , `` Aunt in fact , though not in law .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 5]: Do n't distress yourself !
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 4]: Do n't weep !
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 4]: Do n't tremble !
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 21]: Mrs. Rachael , our young friend has no doubt heard of -- the -- a -- Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 8]: `` Never , '' said Mrs. Rachael .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 29]: `` Is it possible , '' pursued Mr. Kenge , putting up his eye-glasses , `` that our young friend -- I BEG you wo n't distress yourself !
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 9]: -- never heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 11]: I shook my head , wondering even what it was .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 8]: `` Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 25]: said Mr. Kenge , looking over his glasses at me and softly turning the case about and about as if he were petting something .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 11]: `` Not of one of the greatest Chancery suits known ?
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 18]: Not of Jarndyce and Jarndyce -- the -- a -- in itself a monument of Chancery practice .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 33]: In which -LRB- I would say -RRB- every difficulty , every contingency , every masterly fiction , every form of procedure known in that court , is represented over and over again ?
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 16]: It is a cause that could not exist out of this free and great country .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 45]: I should say that the aggregate of costs in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Mrs. Rachael '' -- I was afraid he addressed himself to her because I appeared inattentive '' -- amounts at the present hour to from SIX-ty to SEVEN-ty THOUSAND POUNDS ! ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 10]: said Mr. Kenge , leaning back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 11]: I felt very ignorant , but what could I do ?
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 17]: I was so entirely unacquainted with the subject that I understood nothing about it even then .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 11]: `` And she really never heard of the cause ! ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 4]: said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 4]: `` Surprising ! ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 36]: `` Miss Barbary , sir , '' returned Mrs. Rachael , `` who is now among the Seraphim -- '' `` I hope so , I am sure , '' said Mr. Kenge politely . ''
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 13]: -- Wished Esther only to know what would be serviceable to her .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 16]: And she knows , from any teaching she has had here , nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 4]: said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 8]: `` Upon the whole , very proper .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 9]: Now to the point , '' addressing me .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 48]: `` Miss Barbary , your sole relation -LRB- in fact that is , for I am bound to observe that in law you had none -RRB- being deceased and it naturally not being to be expected that Mrs. Rachael -- '' `` Oh , dear no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 5]: said Mrs. Rachael quickly .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 78]: `` Quite so , '' assented Mr. Kenge ; '' -- that Mrs. Rachael should charge herself with your maintenance and support -LRB- I beg you wo n't distress yourself -RRB- , you are in a position to receive the renewal of an offer which I was instructed to make to Miss Barbary some two years ago and which , though rejected then , was understood to be renewable under the lamentable circumstances that have since occurred .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 42]: Now , if I avow that I represent , in Jarndyce and Jarndyce and otherwise , a highly humane , but at the same time singular , man , shall I compromise myself by any stretch of my professional caution ? ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 17]: said Mr. Kenge , leaning back in his chair again and looking calmly at us both .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 13]: He appeared to enjoy beyond everything the sound of his own voice .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 23]: I could n't wonder at that , for it was mellow and full and gave great importance to every word he uttered .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 27]: He listened to himself with obvious satisfaction and sometimes gently beat time to his own music with his head or rounded a sentence with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 38]: I was very much impressed by him -- even then , before I knew that he formed himself on the model of a great lord who was his client and that he was generally called Conversation Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 82]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , '' he pursued , `` being aware of the -- I would say , desolate -- position of our young friend , offers to place her at a first-rate establishment where her education shall be completed , where her comfort shall be secured , where her reasonable wants shall be anticipated , where she shall be eminently qualified to discharge her duty in that station of life unto which it has pleased -- shall I say Providence ?
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 6]: -- to call her . ''
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 33]: My heart was filled so full , both by what he said and by his affecting manner of saying it , that I was not able to speak , though I tried .
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 39]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , '' he went on , `` makes no condition beyond expressing his expectation that our young friend will not at any time remove herself from the establishment in question without his knowledge and concurrence .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 24]: That she will faithfully apply herself to the acquisition of those accomplishments , upon the exercise of which she will be ultimately dependent .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 22]: That she will tread in the paths of virtue and honour , and -- the -- a -- so forth . ''
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 10]: I was still less able to speak than before .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 11]: `` Now , what does our young friend say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 5]: proceeded Mr , Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 7]: `` Take time , take time !
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 6]: I pause for her reply .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 5]: But take time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 17]: What the destitute subject of such an offer tried to say , I need not repeat .
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 18]: What she did say , I could more easily tell , if it were worth the telling .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 17]: What she felt , and will feel to her dying hour , I could never relate .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 22]: This interview took place at Windsor , where I had passed -LRB- as far as I knew -RRB- my whole life .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 22]: On that day week , amply provided with all necessaries , I left it , inside the stagecoach , for Reading .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 23]: Mrs. Rachael was too good to feel any emotion at parting , but I was not so good , and wept bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 32]: I thought that I ought to have known her better after so many years and ought to have made myself enough of a favourite with her to make her sorry then .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 57]: When she gave me one cold parting kiss upon my forehead , like a thaw-drop from the stone porch -- it was a very frosty day -- I felt so miserable and self-reproachful that I clung to her and told her it was my fault , I knew , that she could say good-bye so easily !
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 6]: `` No , Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 7]: `` It is your misfortune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 30]: The coach was at the little lawn-gate -- we had not come out until we heard the wheels -- and thus I left her , with a sorrowful heart .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 16]: She went in before my boxes were lifted to the coach-roof and shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 21]: As long as I could see the house , I looked back at it from the window through my tears .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 55]: My godmother had left Mrs. Rachael all the little property she possessed ; and there was to be a sale ; and an old hearth-rug with roses on it , which always seemed to me the first thing in the world I had ever seen , was hanging outside in the frost and snow .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 42]: A day or two before , I had wrapped the dear old doll in her own shawl and quietly laid her -- I am half ashamed to tell it -- in the garden-earth under the tree that shaded my old window .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 19]: I had no companion left but my bird , and him I carried with me in his cage .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 90]: When the house was out of sight , I sat , with my bird-cage in the straw at my feet , forward on the low seat to look out of the high window , watching the frosty trees , that were like beautiful pieces of spar , and the fields all smooth and white with last night 's snow , and the sun , so red but yielding so little heat , and the ice , dark like metal where the skaters and sliders had brushed the snow away .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 39]: There was a gentleman in the coach who sat on the opposite seat and looked very large in a quantity of wrappings , but he sat gazing out of the other window and took no notice of me .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 71]: I thought of my dead godmother , of the night when I read to her , of her frowning so fixedly and sternly in her bed , of the strange place I was going to , of the people I should find there , and what they would be like , and what they would say to me , when a voice in the coach gave me a terrible start .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 13]: It said , `` What the de-vil are you crying for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 23]: I was so frightened that I lost my voice and could only answer in a whisper , `` Me , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 27]: For of course I knew it must have been the gentleman in the quantity of wrappings , though he was still looking out of his window .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 12]: `` Yes , you , '' he said , turning round .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 15]: `` I did n't know I was crying , sir , '' I faltered .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 6]: `` But you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 39]: He came quite opposite to me from the other corner of the coach , brushed one of his large furry cuffs across my eyes -LRB- but without hurting me -RRB- , and showed me that it was wet .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 10]: Now you know you are , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 9]: `` And what are you crying for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 14]: said the genfleman , `` Do n't you want to go there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 6]: `` Where , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 3]: `` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 12]: Why , wherever you are going , '' said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 15]: `` I am very glad to go there , sir , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 5]: `` Well , then !
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 4]: Look glad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 67]: I thought he was very strange , or at least that what I could see of him was very strange , for he was wrapped up to the chin , and his face was almost hidden in a fur cap with broad fur straps at the side of his head fastened under his chin ; but I was composed again , and not afraid of him .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 32]: So I told him that I thought I must have been crying because of my godmother 's death and because of Mrs. Rachael 's not being sorry to part with me .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 6]: `` Confound Mrs. Rachael ! ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 4]: said the gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 14]: `` Let her fly away in a high wind on a broomstick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 18]: I began to be really afraid of him now and looked at him with the greatest astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 26]: But I thought that he had pleasant eyes , although he kept on muttering to himself in an angry manner and calling Mrs. Rachael names .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 36]: After a little while he opened his outer wrapper , which appeared to me large enough to wrap up the whole coach , and put his arm down into a deep pocket in the side .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: `` Now , look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 40]: `` In this paper , '' which was nicely folded , `` is a piece of the best plum-cake that can be got for money -- sugar on the outside an inch thick , like fat on mutton chops .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 22]: Here 's a little pie -LRB- a gem this is , both for size and quality -RRB- , made in France .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 10]: And what do you suppose it 's made of ?
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 5]: Livers of fat geese .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 5]: There 's a pie !
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 9]: Now let 's see you eat 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 34]: `` Thank you , sir , '' I replied ; `` thank you very much indeed , but I hope you wo n't be offended -- they are too rich for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 5]: `` Floored again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 20]: said the gentleman , which I did n't at all understand , and threw them both out of window .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 42]: He did not speak to me any more until he got out of the coach a little way short of Reading , when he advised me to be a good girl and to be studious , and shook hands with me .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 10]: I must say I was relieved by his departure .
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 7]: We left him at a milestone .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 24]: I often walked past it afterwards , and never for a long time without thinking of him and half expecting to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 20]: But I never did ; and so , as time went on , he passed out of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 22]: When the coach stopped , a very neat lady looked up at the window and said , `` Miss Donny . ''
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 9]: `` No , ma'am , Esther Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 16]: `` That is quite right , '' said the lady , `` Miss Donny . ''
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 30]: I now understood that she introduced herself by that name , and begged Miss Donny 's pardon for my mistake , and pointed out my boxes at her request .
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 36]: Under the direction of a very neat maid , they were put outside a very small green carriage ; and then Miss Donny , the maid , and I got inside and were driven away .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 38]: `` Everything is ready for you , Esther , '' said Miss Donny , `` and the scheme of your pursuits has been arranged in exact accordance with the wishes of your guardian , Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 10]: `` Of -- did you say , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 13]: `` Of your guardian , Mr. Jarndyce , '' said Miss Donny .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 22]: I was so bewildered that Miss Donny thought the cold had been too severe for me and lent me her smelling-bottle .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 14]: `` Do you know my -- guardian , Mr. Jarndyce , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 9]: I asked after a good deal of hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 25]: `` Not personally , Esther , '' said Miss Donny ; `` merely through his solicitors , Messrs. Kenge and Carboy , of London .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 8]: A very superior gentleman , Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 4]: Truly eloquent indeed .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 8]: Some of his periods quite majestic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 16]: I felt this to be very true but was too confused to attend to it .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 43]: Our speedy arrival at our destination , before I had time to recover myself , increased my confusion , and I never shall forget the uncertain and the unreal air of everything at Greenleaf -LRB- Miss Donny 's house -RRB- that afternoon !
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 8]: But I soon became used to it .
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 38]: I was so adapted to the routine of Greenleaf before long that I seemed to have been there a great while and almost to have dreamed rather than really lived my old life at my godmother 's .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 13]: Nothing could be more precise , exact , and orderly than Greenleaf .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 23]: There was a time for everything all round the dial of the clock , and everything was done at its appointed moment .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 14]: We were twelve boarders , and there were two Miss Donnys , twins .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 46]: It was understood that I would have to depend , by and by , on my qualifications as a governess , and I was not only instructed in everything that was taught at Greenleaf , but was very soon engaged in helping to instruct others .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 27]: Although I was treated in every other respect like the rest of the school , this single difference was made in my case from the first .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 40]: As I began to know more , I taught more , and so in course of time I had plenty to do , which I was very fond of doing because it made the dear girls fond of me .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 43]: At last , whenever a new pupil came who was a little downcast and unhappy , she was so sure -- indeed I do n't know why -- to make a friend of me that all new-comers were confided to my care .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 14]: They said I was so gentle , but I am sure THEY were !
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 58]: I often thought of the resolution I had made on my birthday to try to be industrious , contented , and true-hearted and to do some good to some one and win some love if I could ; and indeed , indeed , I felt almost ashamed to have done so little and have won so much .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 10]: I passed at Greenleaf six happy , quiet years .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 28]: I never saw in any face there , thank heaven , on my birthday , that it would have been better if I had never been born .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 30]: When the day came round , it brought me so many tokens of affectionate remembrance that my room was beautiful with them from New Year 's Day to Christmas .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 19]: In those six years I had never been away except on visits at holiday time in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 44]: After the first six months or so I had taken Miss Donny 's advice in reference to the propriety of writing to Mr. Kenge to say that I was happy and grateful , and with her approval I had written such a letter .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 29]: I had received a formal answer acknowledging its receipt and saying , `` We note the contents thereof , which shall be duly communicated to our client . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 31]: After that I sometimes heard Miss Donny and her sister mention how regular my accounts were paid , and about twice a year I ventured to write a similar letter .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 37]: I always received by return of post exactly the same answer in the same round hand , with the signature of Kenge and Carboy in another writing , which I supposed to be Mr. Kenge 's .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 16]: It seems so curious to me to be obliged to write all this about myself !
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 11]: As if this narrative were the narrative of MY life !
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 12]: But my little body will soon fall into the background now .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 56]: Six quiet years -LRB- I find I am saying it for the second time -RRB- I had passed at Greenleaf , seeing in those around me , as it might be in a looking-glass , every stage of my own growth and change there , when , one November morning , I received this letter .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 5]: I omit the date .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 69]: Old Square , Lincoln 's Inn Madam , Jarndyce and Jarndyce Our clt Mr. Jarndyce being abt to rece into his house , under an Order of the Ct of Chy , a Ward of the Ct in this cause , for whom he wishes to secure an elgble compn , directs us to inform you that he will be glad of your serces in the afsd capacity .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 50]: We have arrngd for your being forded , carriage free , pr eight o'clock coach from Reading , on Monday morning next , to White Horse Cellar , Piccadilly , London , where one of our clks will be in waiting to convey you to our offe as above .
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 34]: We are , Madam , Your obedt Servts , Kenge and Carboy Miss Esther Summerson Oh , never , never , never shall I forget the emotion this letter caused in the house !
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 53]: It was so tender in them to care so much for me , it was so gracious in that father who had not forgotten me to have made my orphan way so smooth and easy and to have inclined so many youthful natures towards me , that I could hardly bear it .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 57]: Not that I would have had them less sorry -- I am afraid not ; but the pleasure of it , and the pain of it , and the pride and joy of it , and the humble regret of it were so blended that my heart seemed almost breaking while it was full of rapture .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 13]: The letter gave me only five days ' notice of my removal .
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 75]: When every minute added to the proofs of love and kindness that were given me in those five days , and when at last the morning came and when they took me through all the rooms that I might see them for the last time , and when some cried , `` Esther , dear , say good-bye to me here at my bedside , where you first spoke so kindly to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 50]: and when others asked me only to write their names , `` With Esther 's love , '' and when they all surrounded me with their parting presents and clung to me weeping and cried , `` What shall we do when dear , dear Esther 's gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 34]: and when I tried to tell them how forbearing and how good they had all been to me and how I blessed and thanked them every one , what a heart I had !
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 36]: And when the two Miss Donnys grieved as much to part with me as the least among them , and when the maids said , `` Bless you , miss , wherever you go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 52]: and when the ugly lame old gardener , who I thought had hardly noticed me in all those years , came panting after the coach to give me a little nosegay of geraniums and told me I had been the light of his eyes -- indeed the old man said so !
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 8]: -- what a heart I had then !
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 83]: And could I help it if with all this , and the coming to the little school , and the unexpected sight of the poor children outside waving their hats and bonnets to me , and of a grey-haired gentleman and lady whose daughter I had helped to teach and at whose house I had visited -LRB- who were said to be the proudest people in all that country -RRB- , caring for nothing but calling out , `` Good-bye , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 7]: May you be very happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 32]: -- could I help it if I was quite bowed down in the coach by myself and said `` Oh , I am so thankful , I am so thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 4]: many times over !
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 25]: But of course I soon considered that I must not take tears where I was going after all that had been done for me .
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 29]: Therefore , of course , I made myself sob less and persuaded myself to be quiet by saying very often , `` Esther , now you really must !
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 6]: This WILL NOT do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 44]: I cheered myself up pretty well at last , though I am afraid I was longer about it than I ought to have been ; and when I had cooled my eyes with lavender water , it was time to watch for London .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 29]: I was quite persuaded that we were there when we were ten miles off , and when we really were there , that we should never get there .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 51]: However , when we began to jolt upon a stone pavement , and particularly when every other conveyance seemed to be running into us , and we seemed to be running into every other conveyance , I began to believe that we really were approaching the end of our journey .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 6]: Very soon afterwards we stopped .
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 34]: A young gentleman who had inked himself by accident addressed me from the pavement and said , `` I am from Kenge and Carboy 's , miss , of Lincoln 's Inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 11]: `` If you please , sir , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 32]: He was very obliging , and as he handed me into a fly after superintending the removal of my boxes , I asked him whether there was a great fire anywhere ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 18]: For the streets were so full of dense brown smoke that scarcely anything was to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 12]: `` Oh , dear no , miss , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 8]: `` This is a London particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 9]: I had never heard of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 12]: `` A fog , miss , '' said the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 6]: `` Oh , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 87]: We drove slowly through the dirtiest and darkest streets that ever were seen in the world -LRB- I thought -RRB- and in such a distracting state of confusion that I wondered how the people kept their senses , until we passed into sudden quietude under an old gateway and drove on through a silent square until we came to an odd nook in a corner , where there was an entrance up a steep , broad flight of stairs , like an entrance to a church .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 21]: And there really was a churchyard outside under some cloisters , for I saw the gravestones from the staircase window .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 7]: This was Kenge and Carboy 's .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 33]: The young gentleman showed me through an outer office into Mr. Kenge 's room -- there was no one in it -- and politely put an arm-chair for me by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 20]: He then called my attention to a little looking-glass hanging from a nail on one side of the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 25]: `` In case you should wish to look at yourself , miss , after the journey , as you 're going before the Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 17]: Not that it 's requisite , I am sure , '' said the young gentleman civilly .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 7]: `` Going before the Chancellor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 8]: I said , startled for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 15]: `` Only a matter of form , miss , '' returned the young gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 8]: `` Mr. Kenge is in court now .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 45]: He left his compliments , and would you partake of some refreshment '' -- there were biscuits and a decanter of wine on a small table -- `` and look over the paper , '' which the young gentleman gave me as he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 9]: He then stirred the fire and left me .
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 51]: Everything was so strange -- the stranger from its being night in the day-time , the candles burning with a white flame , and looking raw and cold -- that I read the words in the newspaper without knowing what they meant and found myself reading the same words repeatedly .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 80]: As it was of no use going on in that way , I put the paper down , took a peep at my bonnet in the glass to see if it was neat , and looked at the room , which was not half lighted , and at the shabby , dusty tables , and at the piles of writings , and at a bookcase full of the most inexpressive-looking books that ever had anything to say for themselves .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 55]: Then I went on , thinking , thinking , thinking ; and the fire went on , burning , burning , burning ; and the candles went on flickering and guttering , and there were no snuffers -- until the young gentleman by and by brought a very dirty pair -- for two hours .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 6]: At last Mr. Kenge came .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 20]: HE was not altered , but he was surprised to see how altered I was and appeared quite pleased .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 43]: `` As you are going to be the companion of the young lady who is now in the Chancellor 's private room , Miss Summerson , '' he said , `` we thought it well that you should be in attendance also .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 15]: You will not be discomposed by the Lord Chancellor , I dare say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 28]: `` No , sir , '' I said , `` I do n't think I shall , '' really not seeing on consideration why I should be .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 25]: So Mr. Kenge gave me his arm and we went round the corner , under a colonnade , and in at a side door .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 32]: And so we came , along a passage , into a comfortable sort of room where a young lady and a young gentleman were standing near a great , loud-roaring fire .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 19]: A screen was interposed between them and it , and they were leaning on the screen , talking .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 29]: They both looked up when I came in , and I saw in the young lady , with the fire shining upon her , such a beautiful girl !
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 21]: With such rich golden hair , such soft blue eyes , and such a bright , innocent , trusting face !
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 16]: `` Miss Ada , '' said Mr. Kenge , `` this is Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 28]: She came to meet me with a smile of welcome and her hand extended , but seemed to change her mind in a moment and kissed me .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 44]: In short , she had such a natural , captivating , winning manner that in a few minutes we were sitting in the window-seat , with the light of the fire upon us , talking together as free and happy as could be .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 7]: What a load off my mind !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 16]: It was so delightful to know that she could confide in me and like me !
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 13]: It was so good of her , and so encouraging to me !
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 18]: The young gentleman was her distant cousin , she told me , and his name Richard Carstone .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 47]: He was a handsome youth with an ingenuous face and a most engaging laugh ; and after she had called him up to where we sat , he stood by us , in the light of the fire , talking gaily , like a light-hearted boy .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 25]: He was very young , not more than nineteen then , if quite so much , but nearly two years older than she was .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 22]: They were both orphans and -LRB- what was very unexpected and curious to me -RRB- had never met before that day .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 55]: Our all three coming together for the first time in such an unusual place was a thing to talk about , and we talked about it ; and the fire , which had left off roaring , winked its red eyes at us -- as Richard said -- like a drowsy old Chancery lion .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 52]: We conversed in a low tone because a full-dressed gentleman in a bag wig frequenfly came in and out , and when he did so , we could hear a drawling sound in the distance , which he said was one of the counsel in our case addressing the Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 44]: He told Mr. Kenge that the Chancellor would be up in five minutes ; and presently we heard a bustle and a tread of feet , and Mr. Kenge said that the Court had risen and his lordship was in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 19]: The gentleman in the bag wig opened the door almost directly and requested Mr. Kenge to come in .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 72]: Upon that , we all went into the next room , Mr. Kenge first , with my darling -- it is so natural to me now that I ca n't help writing it ; and there , plainly dressed in black and sitting in an arm-chair at a table near the fire , was his lordship , whose robe , trimmed with beautiful gold lace , was thrown upon another chair .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 19]: He gave us a searching look as we entered , but his manner was both courtly and kind .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 28]: The gentleman in the bag wig laid bundles of papers on his lordship 's table , and his lordship silently selected one and turned over the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 10]: `` Miss Clare , '' said the Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 6]: `` Miss Ada Clare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 16]: Mr. Kenge presented her , and his lordship begged her to sit down near him .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 17]: That he admired her and was interested by her even I could see in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 22]: It touched me that the home of such a beautiful young creature should be represented by that dry , official place .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 22]: The Lord High Chancellor , at his best , appeared so poor a substitute for the love and pride of parents .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 25]: `` The Jarndyce in question , '' said the Lord Chancellor , still turning over leaves , `` is Jarndyce of Bleak House . ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 14]: `` Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 11]: `` A dreary name , '' said the Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 17]: `` But not a dreary place at present , my lord , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 22]: `` And Bleak House , '' said his lordship , `` is in -- '' `` Hertfordshire , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 11]: `` Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House is not married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 4]: said his lordship .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 13]: `` He is not , my lord , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 9]: `` Young Mr. Richard Carstone is present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 9]: said the Lord Chancellor , glancing towards him .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 6]: Richard bowed and stepped forward .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 4]: `` Hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 10]: said the Lord Chancellor , turning over more leaves .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 43]: `` Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House , my lord , '' Mr. Kenge observed in a low voice , `` if I may venture to remind your lordship , provides a suitable companion for -- '' `` For Mr. Richard Carstone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 25]: I thought -LRB- but I am not quite sure -RRB- I heard his lordship say in an equally low voice and with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 6]: `` For Miss Ada Clare .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 6]: This is the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 4]: Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 14]: His lordship gave me an indulgent look and acknowledged my curtsy very graciously .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 17]: `` Miss Summerson is not related to any party in the cause , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 7]: `` No , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 12]: Mr. Kenge leant over before it was quite said and whispered .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 35]: His lordship , with his eyes upon his papers , listened , nodded twice or thrice , turned over more leaves , and did not look towards me again until we were going away .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 38]: Mr. Kenge now retired , and Richard with him , to where I was , near the door , leaving my pet -LRB- it is so natural to me that again I ca n't help it ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 58]: sitting near the Lord Chancellor , with whom his lordship spoke a little part , asking her , as she told me afterwards , whether she had well reflected on the proposed arrangement , and if she thought she would be happy under the roof of Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House , and why she thought so ?
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 59]: Presently he rose courteously and released her , and then he spoke for a minute or two with Richard Carstone , not seated , but standing , and altogether with more ease and less ceremony , as if he still knew , though he WAS Lord Chancellor , how to go straight to the candour of a boy .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 5]: `` Very well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 5]: said his lordship aloud .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 7]: `` I shall make the order .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 49]: Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House has chosen , so far as I may judge , '' and this was when he looked at me , `` a very good companion for the young lady , and the arrangement altogether seems the best of which the circumstances admit . ''
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 40]: He dismissed us pleasantly , and we all went out , very much obliged to him for being so affable and polite , by which he had certainly lost no dignity but seemed to us to have gained some .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 44]: When we got under the colonnade , Mr. Kenge remembered that he must go back for a moment to ask a question and left us in the fog , with the Lord Chancellor 's carriage and servants waiting for him to come out .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 4]: said Richard Carstone .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 5]: `` THAT 'S over !
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 11]: And where do we go next , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 7]: `` Do n't you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 10]: `` Not in the least , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 11]: `` And do n't YOU know , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 4]: I asked Ada .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 6]: `` Not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 46]: We looked at one another , half laughing at our being like the children in the wood , when a curious little old woman in a squeezed bonnet and carrying a reticule came curtsying and smiling up to us with an air of great ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 6]: `` The wards in Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 12]: Ve-ry happy , I am sure , to have the honour !
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 33]: It is a good omen for youth , and hope , and beauty when they find themselves in this place , and do n't know what 's to come of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 4]: `` Mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 10]: whispered Richard , not thinking she could hear him .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 3]: `` Right !
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 16]: Mad , young gentleman , '' she returned so quickly that he was quite abashed .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 7]: `` I was a ward myself .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 18]: I was not mad at that time , '' curtsying low and smiling between every little sentence .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 7]: `` I had youth and hope .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 5]: I believe , beauty .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 6]: It matters very little now .
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 9]: Neither of the three served or saved me .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 9]: I have the honour to attend court regularly .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 4]: With my documents .
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 5]: I expect a judgment .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 2]: Shortly .
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 6]: On the Day of Judgment .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 16]: I have discovered that the sixth seal mentioned in the Revelations is the Great Seal .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 8]: It has been open a long time !
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 6]: Pray accept my blessing . ''
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 25]: As Ada was a little frightened , I said , to humour the poor old lady , that we were much obliged to her .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 4]: `` Ye-es ! ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 4]: she said mincingly .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 5]: `` I imagine so .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 6]: And here is Conversation Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 4]: With HIS documents !
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 8]: How does your honourable worship do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 7]: `` Quite well , quite well !
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 13]: Now do n't be troublesome , that 's a good soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 9]: said Mr. Kenge , leading the way back .
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 19]: `` By no means , '' said the poor old lady , keeping up with Ada and me .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 5]: `` Anything but troublesome .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 16]: I shall confer estates on both -- which is not being troublesome , I trust ?
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 5]: I expect a judgment .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 2]: Shortly .
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 6]: On the Day of Judgment .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 8]: This is a good omen for you .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 5]: Accept my blessing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 46]: She stopped at the bottom of the steep , broad flight of stairs ; but we looked back as we went up , and she was still there , saying , still with a curtsy and a smile between every little sentence , `` Youth .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 3]: And hope .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 3]: And beauty .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 3]: And Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 4]: And Conversation Kenge !
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 6]: Pray accept my blessing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 48]: Chapter IV -- Telescopic Philanthropy We were to pass the night , Mr. Kenge told us when we arrived in his room , at Mrs. Jellyby 's ; and then he turned to me and said he took it for granted I knew who Mrs. Jellyby was .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 12]: `` I really do n't , sir , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 21]: `` Perhaps Mr. Carstone -- or Miss Clare -- '' But no , they knew nothing whatever about Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 3]: `` In-deed !
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 50]: Mrs. Jellyby , '' said Mr. Kenge , standing with his back to the fire and casting his eyes over the dusty hearth-rug as if it were Mrs. Jellyby 's biography , `` is a lady of very remarkable strength of character who devotes herself entirely to the public .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 67]: She has devoted herself to an extensive variety of public subjects at various times and is at present -LRB- until something else attracts her -RRB- devoted to the subject of Africa , with a view to the general cultivation of the coffee berry -- AND the natives -- and the happy settlement , on the banks of the African rivers , of our superabundant home population .
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 42]: Mr. Jarndyce , who is desirous to aid any work that is considered likely to be a good work and who is much sought after by philanthropists , has , I believe , a very high opinion of Mrs. Jellyby . ''
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 12]: Mr. Kenge , adjusting his cravat , then looked at us .
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 8]: `` And Mr. Jellyby , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 3]: suggested Richard .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 38]: Mr. Jellyby , '' said Mr. Kenge , `` is -- a -- I do n't know that I can describe him to you better than by saying that he is the husband of Mrs. Jellyby . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 7]: `` A nonentity , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 7]: said Richard with a droll look .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 13]: `` I do n't say that , '' returned Mr. Kenge gravely .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 18]: `` I ca n't say that , indeed , for I know nothing whatever OF Mr. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 15]: I never , to my knowledge , had the pleasure of seeing Mr. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 30]: He may be a very superior man , but he is , so to speak , merged -- merged -- in the more shining qualities of his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 44]: Mr. Kenge proceeded to tell us that as the road to Bleak House would have been very long , dark , and tedious on such an evening , and as we had been travelling already , Mr. Jarndyce had himself proposed this arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 21]: A carriage would be at Mrs. Jellyby 's to convey us out of town early in the forenoon of to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 14]: He then rang a little bell , and the young gentleman came in .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 29]: Addressing him by the name of Guppy , Mr. Kenge inquired whether Miss Summerson 's boxes and the rest of the baggage had been `` sent round . ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 27]: Mr. Guppy said yes , they had been sent round , and a coach was waiting to take us round too as soon as we pleased .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 33]: `` Then it only remains , '' said Mr. Kenge , shaking hands with us , `` for me to express my lively satisfaction in -LRB- good day , Miss Clare ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 16]: the arrangement this day concluded and my -LRB- GOOD-bye to you , Miss Summerson ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 27]: lively hope that it will conduce to the happiness , the -LRB- glad to have had the honour of making your acquaintance , Mr. Carstone ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 14]: welfare , the advantage in all points of view , of all concerned !
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 9]: Guppy , see the party safely there . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 11]: `` Where IS ` there , ' Mr. Guppy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 7]: said Richard as we went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 19]: `` No distance , '' said Mr. Guppy ; `` round in Thavies Inn , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 23]: `` I ca n't say I know where it is , for I come from Winchester and am strange in London . ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 11]: `` Only round the corner , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 29]: `` We just twist up Chancery Lane , and cut along Holborn , and there we are in four minutes ' time , as near as a toucher .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 15]: This is about a London particular NOW , ai n't it , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 10]: He seemed quite delighted with it on my account .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 9]: `` The fog is very dense indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 25]: said I. `` Not that it affects you , though , I 'm sure , '' said Mr. Guppy , putting up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 20]: `` On the contrary , it seems to do you good , miss , judging from your appearance . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 73]: I knew he meant well in paying me this compliment , so I laughed at myself for blushing at it when he had shut the door and got upon the box ; and we all three laughed and chatted about our inexperience and the strangeness of London until we turned up under an archway to our destination -- a narrow street of high houses like an oblong cistern to hold the fog .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 35]: There was a confused little crowd of people , principally children , gathered about the house at which we stopped , which had a tarnished brass plate on the door with the inscription JELLYBY .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 7]: `` Do n't be frightened ! ''
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 10]: said Mr. Guppy , looking in at the coach-window .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 17]: `` One of the young Jellybys been and got his head through the area railings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 20]: `` Oh , poor child , '' said I ; `` let me out , if you please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 9]: `` Pray be careful of yourself , miss .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 14]: The young Jellybys are always up to something , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 77]: I made my way to the poor child , who was one of the dirtiest little unfortunates I ever saw , and found him very hot and frightened and crying loudly , fixed by the neck between two iron railings , while a milkman and a beadle , with the kindest intentions possible , were endeavouring to drag him back by the legs , under a general impression that his skull was compressible by those means .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 50]: As I found -LRB- after pacifying him -RRB- that he was a little boy with a naturally large head , I thought that perhaps where his head could go , his body could follow , and mentioned that the best mode of extrication might be to push him forward .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 46]: This was so favourably received by the milkman and beadle that he would immediately have been pushed into the area if I had not held his pinafore while Richard and Mr. Guppy ran down through the kitchen to catch him when he should be released .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 28]: At last he was happily got down without any accident , and then he began to beat Mr. Guppy with a hoop-stick in quite a frantic manner .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 42]: Nobody had appeared belonging to the house except a person in pattens , who had been poking at the child from below with a broom ; I do n't know with what object , and I do n't think she did .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 56]: I therefore supposed that Mrs. Jellyby was not at home , and was quite surprised when the person appeared in the passage without the pattens , and going up to the back room on the first floor before Ada and me , announced us as , `` Them two young ladies , Missis Jellyby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 58]: We passed several more children on the way up , whom it was difficult to avoid treading on in the dark ; and as we came into Mrs. Jellyby 's presence , one of the poor little things fell downstairs -- down a whole flight -LRB- as it sounded to me -RRB- , with a great noise .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 55]: Mrs. Jellyby , whose face reflected none of the uneasiness which we could not help showing in our own faces as the dear child 's head recorded its passage with a bump on every stair -- Richard afterwards said he counted seven , besides one for the landing -- received us with perfect equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 35]: She was a pretty , very diminutive , plump woman of from forty to fifty , with handsome eyes , though they had a curious habit of seeming to look a long way off .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 17]: As if -- I am quoting Richard again -- they could see nothing nearer than Africa !
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 25]: `` I am very glad indeed , '' said Mrs. Jellyby in an agreeable voice , `` to have the pleasure of receiving you .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 27]: I have a great respect for Mr. Jarndyce , and no one in whom he is interested can be an object of indifference to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 21]: We expressed our acknowledgments and sat down behind the door , where there was a lame invalid of a sofa .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 19]: Mrs. Jellyby had very good hair but was too much occupied with her African duties to brush it .
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 61]: The shawl in which she had been loosely muffled dropped onto her chair when she advanced to us ; and as she turned to resume her seat , we could not help noticing that her dress did n't nearly meet up the back and that the open space was railed across with a lattice-work of stay-lace -- like a summer-house .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 34]: The room , which was strewn with papers and nearly filled by a great writing-table covered with similar litter , was , I must say , not only very untidy but very dirty .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 47]: We were obliged to take notice of that with our sense of sight , even while , with our sense of hearing , we followed the poor child who had tumbled downstairs : I think into the back kitchen , where somebody seemed to stifle him .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 33]: But what principally struck us was a jaded and unhealthy-looking though by no means plain girl at the writing-table , who sat biting the feather of her pen and staring at us .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 12]: I suppose nobody ever was in such a state of ink .
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 52]: And from her tumbled hair to her pretty feet , which were disfigured with frayed and broken satin slippers trodden down at heel , she really seemed to have no article of dress upon her , from a pin upwards , that was in its proper condition or its right place .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 79]: `` You find me , my dears , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , snuffing the two great office candles in tin candlesticks , which made the room taste strongly of hot tallow -LRB- the fire had gone out , and there was nothing in the grate but ashes , a bundle of wood , and a poker -RRB- , `` you find me , my dears , as usual , very busy ; but that you will excuse .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 10]: The African project at present employs my whole time .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 24]: It involves me in correspondence with public bodies and with private individuals anxious for the welfare of their species all over the country .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 9]: I am happy to say it is advancing .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 39]: We hope by this time next year to have from a hundred and fifty to two hundred healthy families cultivating coffee and educating the natives of Borrioboola -- Gha , on the left bank of the Niger . ''
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 18]: As Ada said nothing , but looked at me , I said it must be very gratifying .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 10]: `` It IS gratifying , '' said Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 35]: `` It involves the devotion of all my energies , such as they are ; but that is nothing , so that it succeeds ; and I am more confident of success every day .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 20]: Do you know , Miss Summerson , I almost wonder that YOU never turned your thoughts to Africa . ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 23]: This application of the subject was really so unexpected to me that I was quite at a loss how to receive it .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 15]: I hinted that the climate -- `` The finest climate in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 4]: said Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 6]: `` Indeed , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 8]: With precaution , '' said Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 15]: `` You may go into Holborn , without precaution , and be run over .
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 15]: You may go into Holborn , with precaution , and never be run over .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 6]: Just so with Africa . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 8]: I said , `` No doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 6]: I meant as to Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 88]: `` If you would like , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , putting a number of papers towards us , `` to look over some remarks on that head , and on the general subject , which have been extensively circulated , while I finish a letter I am now dictating to my eldest daughter , who is my amanuensis -- '' The girl at the table left off biting her pen and made a return to our recognition , which was half bashful and half sulky . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 27]: -- I shall then have finished for the present , '' proceeded Mrs. Jellyby with a sweet smile , `` though my work is never done .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 8]: Where are you , Caddy ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 17]: ` Presents her compliments to Mr. Swallow , and begs -- ' '' said Caddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 35]: ` And begs , ' '' said Mrs. Jellyby , dictating , '' ` to inform him , in reference to his letter of inquiry on the African project -- ' No , Peepy !
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 6]: Not on my account ! ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 57]: Peepy -LRB- so self-named -RRB- was the unfortunate child who had fallen downstairs , who now interrupted the correspondence by presenting himself , with a strip of plaster on his forehead , to exhibit his wounded knees , in which Ada and I did not know which to pity most -- the bruises or the dirt .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 24]: Mrs. Jellyby merely added , with the serene composure with which she said everything , `` Go along , you naughty Peepy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 9]: and fixed her fine eyes on Africa again .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 40]: However , as she at once proceeded with her dictation , and as I interrupted nothing by doing it , I ventured quietly to stop poor Peepy as he was going out and to take him up to nurse .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 35]: He looked very much astonished at it and at Ada 's kissing him , but soon fell fast asleep in my arms , sobbing at longer and longer intervals , until he was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 54]: I was so occupied with Peepy that I lost the letter in detail , though I derived such a general impression from it of the momentous importance of Africa , and the utter insignificance of all other places and things , that I felt quite ashamed to have thought so little about it .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 5]: `` Six o'clock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 4]: said Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 17]: `` And our dinner hour is nominally -LRB- for we dine at all hours -RRB- five !
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 11]: Caddy , show Miss Clare and Miss Summerson their rooms .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 10]: You will like to make some change , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 13]: You will excuse me , I know , being so much occupied .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 7]: Oh , that very bad child !
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: Pray put him down , Miss Summerson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 28]: I begged permission to retain him , truly saying that he was not at all troublesome , and carried him upstairs and laid him on my bed .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 14]: Ada and I had two upper rooms with a door of communication between .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 20]: They were excessively bare and disorderly , and the curtain to my window was fastened up with a fork .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 13]: `` You would like some hot water , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 20]: said Miss Jellyby , looking round for a jug with a handle to it , but looking in vain .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 12]: `` If it is not being troublesome , '' said we .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 25]: `` Oh , it 's not the trouble , '' returned Miss Jellyby ; `` the question is , if there IS any . ''
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 30]: The evening was so very cold and the rooms had such a marshy smell that I must confess it was a little miserable , and Ada was half crying .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 43]: We soon laughed , however , and were busily unpacking when Miss Jellyby came back to say that she was sorry there was no hot water , but they could n't find the kettle , and the boiler was out of order .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 22]: We begged her not to mention it and made all the haste we could to get down to the fire again .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 48]: But all the little children had come up to the landing outside to look at the phenomenon of Peepy lying on my bed , and our attention was distracted by the constant apparition of noses and fingers in situations of danger between the hinges of the doors .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 58]: It was impossible to shut the door of either room , for my lock , with no knob to it , looked as if it wanted to be wound up ; and though the handle of Ada 's went round and round with the greatest smoothness , it was attended with no effect whatever on the door .
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 59]: Therefore I proposed to the children that they should come in and be very good at my table , and I would tell them the story of Little Red Riding Hood while I dressed ; which they did , and were as quiet as mice , including Peepy , who awoke opportunely before the appearance of the wolf .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 67]: When we went downstairs we found a mug with `` A Present from Tunbridge Wells '' on it lighted up in the staircase window with a floating wick , and a young woman , with a swelled face bound up in a flannel bandage blowing the fire of the drawing-room -LRB- now connected by an open door with Mrs. Jellyby 's room -RRB- and choking dreadfully .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 42]: It smoked to that degree , in short , that we all sat coughing and crying with the windows open for half an hour , during which Mrs. Jellyby , with the same sweetness of temper , directed letters about Africa .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 57]: Her being so employed was , I must say , a great relief to me , for Richard told us that he had washed his hands in a pie-dish and that they had found the kettle on his dressing-table , and he made Ada laugh so that they made me laugh in the most ridiculous manner .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 38]: Soon after seven o'clock we went down to dinner , carefully , by Mrs. Jellyby 's advice , for the stair-carpets , besides being very deficient in stair-wires , were so torn as to be absolute traps .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 41]: We had a fine cod-fish , a piece of roast beef , a dish of cutlets , and a pudding ; an excellent dinner , if it had had any cooking to speak of , but it was almost raw .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 34]: The young woman with the flannel bandage waited , and dropped everything on the table wherever it happened to go , and never moved it again until she put it on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 37]: The person I had seen in pattens , who I suppose to have been the cook , frequently came and skirmished with her at the door , and there appeared to be ill will between them .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 50]: All through dinner -- which was long , in consequence of such accidents as the dish of potatoes being mislaid in the coal skuttle and the handle of the corkscrew coming off and striking the young woman in the chin -- Mrs. Jellyby preserved the evenness of her disposition .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 39]: She told us a great deal that was interesting about Borrioboola -- Gha and the natives , and received so many letters that Richard , who sat by her , saw four envelopes in the gravy at once .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 62]: Some of the letters were proceedings of ladies ' committees or resolutions of ladies ' meetings , which she read to us ; others were applications from people excited in various ways about the cultivation of coffee , and natives ; others required answers , and these she sent her eldest daughter from the table three or four times to write .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 20]: She was full of business and undoubtedly was , as she had told us , devoted to the cause .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 58]: I was a little curious to know who a mild bald gentleman in spectacles was , who dropped into a vacant chair -LRB- there was no top or bottom in particular -RRB- after the fish was taken away and seemed passively to submit himself to Borriohoola -- Gha but not to be actively interested in that settlement .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 18]: As he never spoke a word , he might have been a native but for his complexion .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 27]: It was not until we left the table and he remained alone with Richard that the possibility of his being Mr. Jellyby ever entered my head .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 69]: But he WAS Mr. Jellyby ; and a loquacious young man called Mr. Quale , with large shining knobs for temples and his hair all brushed to the back of his head , who came in the evening , and told Ada he was a philanthropist , also informed her that he called the matrimonial alliance of Mrs. Jellyby with Mr. Jellyby the union of mind and matter .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 83]: This young man , besides having a great deal to say for himself about Africa and a project of his for teaching the coffee colonists to teach the natives to turn piano-forte legs and establish an export trade , delighted in drawing Mrs. Jellyby out by saving , `` I believe now , Mrs. Jellyby , you have received as many as from one hundred and fifty to two hundred letters respecting Africa in a single day , have you not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 33]: or , `` If my memory does not deceive me , Mrs. Jellyby , you once mentioned that you had sent off five thousand circulars from one post-office at one time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 13]: -- always repeating Mrs. Jellyby 's answer to us like an interpreter .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 26]: During the whole evening , Mr. Jellyby sat in a corner with his head against the wall as if he were subject to low spirits .
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 43]: It seemed that he had several times opened his mouth when alone with Richard after dinner , as if he had something on his mind , but had always shut it again , to Richard 's extreme confusion , without saying anything .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 26]: Mrs. Jellyby , sitting in quite a nest of waste paper , drank coffee all the evening and dictated at intervals to her eldest daughter .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 35]: She also held a discussion with Mr. Quale , of which the subject seemed to be -- if I understood it -- the brotherhood of humanity , and gave utterance to some beautiful sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 77]: I was not so attentive an auditor as I might have wished to be , however , for Peepy and the other children came flocking about Ada and me in a corner of the drawing-room to ask for another story ; so we sat down among them and told them in whispers `` Puss in Boots '' and I do n't know what else until Mrs. Jellyby , accidentally remembering them , sent them to bed .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 41]: As Peepy cried for me to take him to bed , I carried him upstairs , where the young woman with the flannel bandage charged into the midst of the little family like a dragon and overturned them into cribs .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 35]: After that I occupied myself in making our room a little tidy and in coaxing a very cross fire that had been lighted to burn , which at last it did , quite brightly .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 41]: On my return downstairs , I felt that Mrs. Jellyby looked down upon me rather for being so frivolous , and I was sorry for it , though at the same time I knew that I had no higher pretensions .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 36]: It was nearly midnight before we found an opportunity of going to bed , and even then we left Mrs. Jellyby among her papers drinking coffee and Miss Jellyby biting the feather of her pen .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 7]: `` What a strange house ! ''
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 7]: said Ada when we got upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 13]: `` How curious of my cousin Jarndyce to send us here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 14]: `` My love , '' said I , `` it quite confuses me .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 16]: I want to understand it , and I ca n't understand it at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 7]: asked Ada with her pretty smile .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 41]: `` All this , my dear , '' said I. `` It MUST be very good of Mrs. Jellyby to take such pains about a scheme for the benefit of natives -- and yet -- Peepy and the housekeeping ! ''
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 35]: Ada laughed and put her arm about my neck as I stood looking at the fire , and told me I was a quiet , dear , good creature and had won her heart .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 18]: `` You are so thoughtful , Esther , '' she said , `` and yet so cheerful !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 9]: And you do so much , so unpretendingly !
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 12]: You would make a home out of even this house . ''
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 4]: My simple darling !
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 28]: She was quite unconscious that she only praised herself and that it was in the goodness of her own heart that she made so much of me !
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 9]: `` May I ask you a question ? ''
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 13]: said I when we had sat before the fire a little while .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 8]: `` Five hundred , '' said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 7]: `` Your cousin , Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 7]: I owe so much to him .
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 9]: Would you mind describing him to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 33]: Shaking her golden hair , Ada turned her eyes upon me with such laughing wonder that I was full of wonder too , partly at her beauty , partly at her surprise .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 4]: `` Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 11]: `` You want a description of my cousin Jarndyce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 10]: `` My dear , I never saw him . ''
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: `` And I never saw him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 3]: returned Ada .
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 6]: Well , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 8]: No , she had never seen him .
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 51]: Young as she was when her mama died , she remembered how the tears would come into her eyes when she spoke of him and of the noble generosity of his character , which she had said was to be trusted above all earthly things ; and Ada trusted it .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 54]: Her cousin Jarndyce had written to her a few months ago -- `` a plain , honest letter , '' Ada said -- proposing the arrangement we were now to enter on and telling her that `` in time it might heal some of the wounds made by the miserable Chancery suit . ''
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 9]: She had replied , gratefully accepting his proposal .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 13]: Richard had received a similar letter and had made a similar response .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 19]: He HAD seen Mr. Jarndyce once , but only once , five years ago , at Winchester school .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 33]: He had told Ada , when they were leaning on the screen before the fire where I found them , that he recollected him as `` a bluff , rosy fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 10]: This was the utmost description Ada could give me .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 38]: It set me thinking so that when Ada was asleep , I still remained before the fire , wondering and wondering about Bleak House , and wondering and wondering that yesterday morning should seem so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 20]: I do n't know where my thoughts had wandered when they were recalled by a tap at the door .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 28]: I opened it softly and found Miss Jellyby shivering there with a broken candle in a broken candlestick in one hand and an egg-cup in the other .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 5]: `` Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 5]: she said very sulkily .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 5]: `` Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 9]: said I. `` May I come in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 12]: she shortly and unexpectedly asked me in the same sulky way .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 14]: `` Certainly , '' said I. `` Do n't wake Miss Clare . ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 44]: She would not sit down , but stood by the fire dipping her inky middle finger in the egg-cup , which contained vinegar , and smearing it over the ink stains on her face , frowning the whole time and looking very gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 8]: `` I wish Africa was dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 6]: she said on a sudden .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 6]: I was going to remonstrate .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 5]: `` I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 12]: she said `` Do n't talk to me , Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 7]: I hate it and detest it .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 6]: It 's a beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 12]: I told her she was tired , and I was sorry .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 25]: I put my hand upon her head , and touched her forehead , and said it was hot now but would be cool tomorrow .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 25]: She still stood pouting and frowning at me , but presently put down her egg-cup and turned softly towards the bed where Ada lay .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 7]: `` She is very pretty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 14]: she said with the same knitted brow and in the same uncivil manner .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 6]: I assented with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 4]: `` An orphan .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: Ai n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 9]: `` But knows a quantity , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 10]: Can dance , and play music , and sing ?
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 22]: She can talk French , I suppose , and do geography , and globes , and needlework , and everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 16]: `` No doubt , '' said I. `` I ca n't , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: `` I ca n't do anything hardly , except write .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 7]: I 'm always writing for Ma .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 23]: I wonder you two were not ashamed of yourselves to come in this afternoon and see me able to do nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 7]: It was like your ill nature .
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 12]: Yet you think yourselves very fine , I dare say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 34]: I could see that the poor girl was near crying , and I resumed my chair without speaking and looked at her -LRB- I hope -RRB- as mildly as I felt towards her .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 9]: `` It 's disgraceful , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 6]: `` You know it is .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 6]: The whole house is disgraceful .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 5]: The children are disgraceful .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 4]: I 'M disgraceful .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 8]: Pa 's miserable , and no wonder !
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 8]: Priscilla drinks -- she 's always drinking .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 21]: It 's a great shame and a great story of you if you say you did n't smell her today .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 18]: It was as bad as a public-house , waiting at dinner ; you know it was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 23]: `` My dear , I do n't know it , '' said I. `` You do , '' she said very shortly .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 9]: `` You sha n't say you do n't .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 4]: You do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 7]: `` Oh , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 18]: said I. `` If you wo n't let me speak -- '' `` You 're speaking now .
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 5]: You know you are .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 9]: Do n't tell stories , Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 31]: `` My dear , '' said I , `` as long as you wo n't hear me out -- '' `` I do n't want to hear you out . ''
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 23]: `` Oh , yes , I think you do , '' said I , `` because that would be so very unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 38]: I did not know what you tell me because the servant did not come near me at dinner ; but I do n't doubt what you tell me , and I am sorry to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 14]: `` You need n't make a merit of that , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 17]: `` No , my dear , '' said I. `` That would be very foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 25]: She was still standing by the bed , and now stooped down -LRB- but still with the same discontented face -RRB- and kissed Ada .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 16]: That done , she came softly back and stood by the side of my chair .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 22]: Her bosom was heaving in a distressful manner that I greatly pitied , but I thought it better not to speak .
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 8]: `` I wish I was dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 4]: she broke out .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 8]: `` I wish we were all dead .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 10]: It would be a great deal better for us .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 29]: In a moment afterwards , she knelt on the ground at my side , hid her face in my dress , passionately begged my pardon , and wept .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 22]: I comforted her and would have raised her , but she cried no , no ; she wanted to stay there !
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 27]: `` You used to teach girls , '' she said , `` If you could only have taught me , I could have learnt from you !
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 14]: I am so very miserable , and I like you so much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 38]: I could not persuade her to sit by me or to do anything but move a ragged stool to where she was kneeling , and take that , and still hold my dress in the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 34]: By degrees the poor tired girl fell asleep , and then I contrived to raise her head so that it should rest on my lap , and to cover us both with shawls .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 17]: The fire went out , and all night long she slumbered thus before the ashy grate .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 25]: At first I was painfully awake and vainly tried to lose myself , with my eyes closed , among the scenes of the day .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 13]: At length , by slow degrees , they became indistinct and mingled .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 13]: I began to lose the identity of the sleeper resting on me .
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 24]: Now it was Ada , now one of my old Reading friends from whom I could not believe I had so recently parted .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 23]: Now it was the little mad woman worn out with curtsying and smiling , now some one in authority at Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 13]: Lastly , it was no one , and I was no one .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 26]: The purblind day was feebly struggling with the fog when I opened my eyes to encounter those of a dirty-faced little spectre fixed upon me .
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 32]: Peepy had scaled his crib , and crept down in his bed-gown and cap , and was so cold that his teeth were chattering as if he had cut them all .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 83]: Chapter V -- A Morning Adventure Although the morning was raw , and although the fog still seemed heavy -- I say seemed , for the windows were so encrusted with dirt that they would have made midsummer sunshine dim -- I was sufficiently forewarned of the discomfort within doors at that early hour and sufficiently curious about London to think it a good idea on the part of Miss Jellyby when she proposed that we should go out for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 35]: `` Ma wo n't be down for ever so long , '' she said , `` and then it 's a chance if breakfast 's ready for an hour afterwards , they dawdle so .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 15]: As to Pa , he gets what he can and goes to the office .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 11]: He never has what you would call a regular breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 17]: Priscilla leaves him out the loaf and some milk , when there is any , overnight .
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 14]: Sometimes there is n't any milk , and sometimes the cat drinks it .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 22]: But I 'm afraid you must be tired , Miss Summerson , and perhaps you would rather go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 25]: `` I am not at all tired , my dear , '' said I , `` and would much prefer to go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 22]: `` If you 're sure you would , '' returned Miss Jellyby , `` I 'll get my things on . ''
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 12]: Ada said she would go too , and was soon astir .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 36]: I made a proposal to Peepy , in default of being able to do anything better for him , that he should let me wash him and afterwards lay him down on my bed again .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 60]: To this he submitted with the best grace possible , staring at me during the whole operation as if he never had been , and never could again be , so astonished in his life -- looking very miserable also , certainly , but making no complaint , and going snugly to sleep as soon as it was over .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 28]: At first I was in two minds about taking such a liberty , but I soon reflected that nobody in the house was likely to notice it .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 26]: What with the bustle of dispatching Peepy and the bustle of getting myself ready and helping Ada , I was soon quite in a glow .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 36]: We found Miss Jellyby trying to warm herself at the fire in the writing-room , which Priscilla was then lighting with a smutty parlour candlestick , throwing the candle in to make it burn better .
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 18]: Everything was just as we had left it last night and was evidently intended to remain so .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 17]: Below-stairs the dinner-cloth had not been taken away , but had been left ready for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 12]: Crumbs , dust , and waste-paper were all over the house .
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 35]: Some pewter pots and a milk-can hung on the area railings ; the door stood open ; and we met the cook round the corner coming out of a public-house , wiping her mouth .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 19]: She mentioned , as she passed us , that she had been to see what o'clock it was .
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 24]: But before we met the cook , we met Richard , who was dancing up and down Thavies Inn to warm his feet .
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 19]: He was agreeably surprised to see us stirring so soon and said he would gladly share our walk .
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 15]: So he took care of Ada , and Miss Jellyby and I went first .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 31]: I may mention that Miss Jellyby had relapsed into her sulky manner and that I really should not have thought she liked me much unless she had told me so .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 9]: `` Where would you wish to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 10]: `` Anywhere , my dear , '' I replied .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 13]: `` Anywhere 's nowhere , '' said Miss Jellyby , stopping perversely .
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 13]: `` Let us go somewhere at any rate , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 8]: She then walked me on very fast .
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 7]: `` I do n't care ! ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 54]: `` Now , you are my witness , Miss Summerson , I say I do n't care-but if he was to come to our house with his great , shining , lumpy forehead night after night till he was as old as Methuselah , I would n't have anything to say to him .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 11]: Such ASSES as he and Ma make of themselves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 18]: I remonstrated , in allusion to the epithet and the vigorous emphasis Miss Jellyby set upon it .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 11]: `` Your duty as a child -- '' `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 21]: Do n't talk of duty as a child , Miss Summerson ; where 's Ma 's duty as a parent ?
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 12]: All made over to the public and Africa , I suppose !
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 21]: Then let the public and Africa show duty as a child ; it 's much more their affair than mine .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 8]: You are shocked , I dare say !
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 24]: Very well , so am I shocked too ; so we are both shocked , and there 's an end of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 7]: She walked me on faster yet .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 31]: `` But for all that , I say again , he may come , and come , and come , and I wo n't have anything to say to him .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 6]: I ca n't bear him .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 23]: If there 's any stuff in the world that I hate and detest , it 's the stuff he and Ma talk .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 36]: I wonder the very paving-stones opposite our house can have the patience to stay there and be a witness of such inconsistencies and contradictions as all that sounding nonsense , and Ma 's management ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 22]: I could not but understand her to refer to Mr. Quale , the young gentleman who had appeared after dinner yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 33]: I was saved the disagreeable necessity of pursuing the subject by Richard and Ada coming up at a round pace , laughing and asking us if we meant to run a race .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 78]: Thus interrupted , Miss Jellyby became silent and walked moodily on at my side while I admired the long successions and varieties of streets , the quantity of people already going to and fro , the number of vehicles passing and repassing , the busy preparations in the setting forth of shop windows and the sweeping out of shops , and the extraordinary creatures in rags secretly groping among the swept-out rubbish for pins and other refuse .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 17]: `` So , cousin , '' said the cheerful voice of Richard to Ada behind me .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 10]: `` We are never to get out of Chancery !
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 28]: We have come by another way to our place of meeting yesterday , and -- by the Great Seal , here 's the old lady again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 33]: Truly , there she was , immediately in front of us , curtsying , and smiling , and saying with her yesterday 's air of patronage , `` The wards in Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 8]: Ve-ry happy , I am sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 17]: `` You are out early , ma'am , '' said I as she curtsied to me .
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: `` Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 6]: I usually walk here early .
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 5]: Before the court sits .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 4]: It 's retired .
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 19]: I collect my thoughts here for the business of the day , '' said the old lady mincingly .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 13]: `` The business of the day requires a great deal of thought .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 10]: Chancery justice is so ve-ry difficult to follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 9]: `` Who 's this , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 12]: whispered Miss Jellyby , drawing my arm tighter through her own .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 10]: The little old lady 's hearing was remarkably quick .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 6]: She answered for herself directly .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 7]: `` A suitor , my child .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 4]: At your service .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 9]: I have the honour to attend court regularly .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 4]: With my documents .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 15]: Have I the pleasure of addressing another of the youthful parties in Jarndyce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 21]: said the old lady , recovering herself , with her head on one side , from a very low curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 23]: Richard , anxious to atone for his thoughtlessness of yesterday , good-naturedly explained that Miss Jellyby was not connected with the suit .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 5]: said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 8]: `` She does not expect a judgment ?
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 6]: She will still grow old .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 5]: But not so old .
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 6]: Oh , dear , no !
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 9]: This is the garden of Lincoln 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 6]: I call it my garden .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 9]: It is quite a bower in the summer-time .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 6]: Where the birds sing melodiously .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 11]: I pass the greater part of the long vacation here .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 3]: In contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 13]: You find the long vacation exceedingly long , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 14]: We said yes , as she seemed to expect us to say so .
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 53]: `` When the leaves are falling from the trees and there are no more flowers in bloom to make up into nosegays for the Lord Chancellor 's court , '' said the old lady , `` the vacation is fulfilled and the sixth seal , mentioned in the Revelations , again prevails .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 7]: Pray come and see my lodging .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 9]: It will be a good omen for me .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 12]: Youth , and hope , and beauty are very seldom there .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 16]: It is a long , long time since I had a visit from either . ''
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 22]: She had taken my hand , and leading me and Miss Jellyby away , beckoned Richard and Ada to come too .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 15]: I did not know how to excuse myself and looked to Richard for aid .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 58]: As he was half amused and half curious and all in doubt how to get rid of the old lady without offence , she continued to lead us away , and he and Ada continued to follow , our strange conductress informing us all the time , with much smiling condescension , that she lived close by .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 10]: It was quite true , as it soon appeared .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 25]: She lived so close by that we had not time to have done humouring her for a few moments before she was at home .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 44]: Slipping us out at a little side gate , the old lady stopped most unexpectedly in a narrow back street , part of some courts and lanes immediately outside the wall of the inn , and said , `` This is my lodging .
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 5]: Pray walk up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 17]: She had stopped at a shop over which was written KROOK , RAG AND BOTTLE WAREHOUSE .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 14]: Also , in long thin letters , KROOK , DEALER IN MARINE STORES .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 28]: In one part of the window was a picture of a red paper mill at which a cart was unloading a quantity of sacks of old rags .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 8]: In another was the inscription BONES BOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 8]: In another , KITCHEN -- STUFF BOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 7]: In another , OLD IRON BOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 8]: In another , WASTE -- PAPER BOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 11]: In another , LADIES ' AND GENTLEMEN 'S WARDROBES BOUGHT .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 12]: Everything seemed to be bought and nothing to be sold there .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 73]: In all parts of the window were quantities of dirty bottles -- blacking bottles , medicine bottles , ginger-beer and soda-water bottles , pickle bottles , wine bottles , ink bottles ; I am reminded by mentioning the latter that the shop had in several little particulars the air of being in a legal neighbourhood and of being , as it were , a dirty hanger-on and disowned relation of the law .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 8]: There were a great many ink bottles .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 24]: There was a little tottering bench of shabby old volumes outside the door , labelled `` Law Books , all at 9d . ''
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 36]: Some of the inscriptions I have enumerated were written in law-hand , like the papers I had seen in Kenge and Carboy 's office and the letters I had so long received from the firm .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 51]: Among them was one , in the same writing , having nothing to do with the business of the shop , but announcing that a respectable man aged forty-five wanted engrossing or copying to execute with neatness and dispatch : Address to Nemo , care of Mr. Krook , within .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 13]: There were several second-hand bags , blue and red , hanging up .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 22]: A little way within the shop-door lay heaps of old crackled parchment scrolls and discoloured and dog 's - eared law-papers .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 38]: I could have fancied that all the rusty keys , of which there must have been hundreds huddled together as old iron , had once belonged to doors of rooms or strong chests in lawyers ' offices .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 35]: The litter of rags tumbled partly into and partly out of a one-legged wooden scale , hanging without any counterpoise from a beam , might have been counsellors ' bands and gowns torn up .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 46]: One had only to fancy , as Richard whispered to Ada and me while we all stood looking in , that yonder bones in a corner , piled together and picked very clean , were the bones of clients , to make the picture complete .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 61]: As it was still foggy and dark , and as the shop was blinded besides by the wall of Lincoln 's Inn , intercepting the light within a couple of yards , we should not have seen so much but for a lighted lantern that an old man in spectacles and a hairy cap was carrying about in the shop .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 12]: Turning towards the door , he now caught sight of us .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 35]: He was short , cadaverous , and withered , with his head sunk sideways between his shoulders and the breath issuing in visible smoke from his mouth as if he were on fire within .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 38]: His throat , chin , and eyebrows were so frosted with white hairs and so gnarled with veins and puckered skin that he looked from his breast upward like some old root in a fall of snow .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 6]: `` Hi , hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 10]: said the old man , coming to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 8]: `` Have you anything to sell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 57]: We naturally drew back and glanced at our conductress , who had been trying to open the house-door with a key she had taken from her pocket , and to whom Richard now said that as we had had the pleasure of seeing where she lived , we would leave her , being pressed for time .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 10]: But she was not to be so easily left .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 64]: She became so fantastically and pressingly earnest in her entreaties that we would walk up and see her apartment for an instant , and was so bent , in her harmless way , on leading me in , as part of the good omen she desired , that I -LRB- whatever the others might do -RRB- saw nothing for it but to comply .
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 31]: I suppose we were all more or less curious ; at any rate , when the old man added his persuasions to hers and said , `` Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 3]: Please her !
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 7]: It wo n't take a minute !
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 6]: Come in , come in !
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 16]: Come in through the shop if t ` other door 's out of order ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 17]: we all went in , stimulated by Richard 's laughing encouragement and relying on his protection .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 27]: `` My landlord , Krook , '' said the little old lady , condescending to him from her lofty station as she presented him to us .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 11]: `` He is called among the neighbours the Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 9]: His shop is called the Court of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 7]: He is a very eccentric person .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 5]: He is very odd .
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 11]: Oh , I assure you he is very odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 42]: She shook her head a great many times and tapped her forehead with her finger to express to us that we must have the goodness to excuse him , `` For he is a little -- you know -- M ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 8]: said the old lady with great stateliness .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 8]: The old man overheard , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 31]: `` It 's true enough , '' he said , going before us with the lantern , `` that they call me the lord chancellor and call my shop Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 17]: And why do you think they call me the Lord Chancellor and my shop Chancery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: `` I do n't know , I am sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 5]: said Richard rather carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 20]: `` You see , '' said the old man , stopping and turning round , `` they -- Hi !
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 5]: Here 's lovely hair !
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 20]: I have got three sacks of ladies ' hair below , but none so beautiful and fine as this .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 8]: What colour , and what texture ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 10]: `` That 'll do , my good friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 19]: said Richard , strongly disapproving of his having drawn one of Ada 's tresses through his yellow hand .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 16]: `` You can admire as the rest of us do without taking that liberty . ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 42]: The old man darted at him a sudden look which even called my attention from Ada , who , startled and blushing , was so remarkably beautiful that she seemed to fix the wandering attention of the little old lady herself .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 34]: But as Ada interposed and laughingly said she could only feel proud of such genuine admiration , Mr. Krook shrunk into his former self as suddenly as he had leaped out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 62]: `` You see , I have so many things here , '' he resumed , holding up the lantern , `` of so many kinds , and all as the neighbours think -LRB- but THEY know nothing -RRB- , wasting away and going to rack and ruin , that that 's why they have given me and my place a christening .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 13]: And I have so many old parchmentses and papers in my stock .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 12]: And I have a liking for rust and must and cobwebs .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 10]: And all 's fish that comes to my net .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 28]: And I ca n't abear to part with anything I once lay hold of -LRB- or so my neighbours think , but what do THEY know ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 24]: or to alter anything , or to have any sweeping , nor scouring , nor cleaning , nor repairing going on about me .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 13]: That 's the way I 've got the ill name of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 5]: I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 21]: I go to see my noble and learned brother pretty well every day , when he sits in the Inn .
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 11]: He do n't notice me , but I notice him .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 8]: There 's no great odds betwixt us .
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 8]: We both grub on in a muddle .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 6]: Hi , Lady Jane ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 17]: A large grey cat leaped from some neighbouring shelf on his shoulder and startled us all .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 6]: Show 'em how you scratch .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 2]: Hi !
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 6]: Tear , my lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 4]: said her master .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 29]: The cat leaped down and ripped at a bundle of rags with her tigerish claws , with a sound that it set my teeth on edge to hear .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 22]: `` She 'd do as much for any one I was to set her on , '' said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 17]: `` I deal in cat-skins among other general matters , and hers was offered to me .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 21]: It 's a very fine skin , as you may see , but I did n't have it stripped off !
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 12]: THAT war n't like Chancery practice though , says you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 28]: He had by this time led us across the shop , and now opened a door in the back part of it , leading to the house-entry .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 29]: As he stood with his hand upon the lock , the little old lady graciously observed to him before passing out , `` That will do , Krook .
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 8]: You mean well , but are tiresome .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 8]: My young friends are pressed for time .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 14]: I have none to spare myself , having to attend court very soon .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 10]: My young friends are the wards in Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 4]: `` Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 8]: said the old man with a start .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 5]: `` Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 11]: The great suit , Krook , '' returned his lodger .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 4]: `` Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 18]: exclaimed the old man in a tone of thoughtful amazement and with a wider stare than before .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 6]: `` Think of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 44]: He seemed so rapt all in a moment and looked so curiously at us that Richard said , `` Why , you appear to trouble yourself a good deal about the causes before your noble and learned brother , the other Chancellor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 10]: `` Yes , '' said the old man abstractedly .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 3]: `` Sure !
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 12]: YOUR name now will be -- '' `` Richard Carstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 31]: `` Carstone , '' he repeated , slowly checking off that name upon his forefinger ; and each of the others he went on to mention upon a separate finger .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 25]: There was the name of Barbary , and the name of Clare , and the name of Dedlock , too , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 15]: `` He knows as much of the cause as the real salaried Chancellor ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 11]: said Richard , quite astonished , to Ada and me .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 4]: `` Aye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 12]: said the old man , coming slowly out of his abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 42]: Tom Jarndyce -- you 'll excuse me , being related ; but he was never known about court by any other name , and was as well known there as -- she is now , '' nodding slightly at his lodger .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 8]: `` Tom Jarndyce was often in here .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 36]: He got into a restless habit of strolling about when the cause was on , or expected , talking to the little shopkeepers and telling 'em to keep out of Chancery , whatever they did .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 53]: ` For , ' says he , ` it 's being ground to bits in a slow mill ; it 's being roasted at a slow fire ; it 's being stung to death by single bees ; it 's being drowned by drops ; it 's going mad by grains . '
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 22]: He was as near making away with himself , just where the young lady stands , as near could be . ''
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 5]: We listened with horror .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 99]: `` He come in at the door , '' said the old man , slowly pointing an imaginary track along the shop , `` on the day he did it -- the whole neighbourhood had said for months before that he would do it , of a certainty sooner or later -- he come in at the door that day , and walked along there , and sat himself on a bench that stood there , and asked me -LRB- you 'll judge I was a mortal sight younger then -RRB- to fetch him a pint of wine .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 34]: ` For , ' says he , ` Krook , I am much depressed ; my cause is on again , and I think I 'm nearer judgment than I ever was . '
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 68]: I had n't a mind to leave him alone ; and I persuaded him to go to the tavern over the way there , t ` other side my lane -LRB- I mean Chancery Lane -RRB- ; and I followed and looked in at the window , and saw him , comfortable as I thought , in the arm-chair by the fire , and company with him .
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 22]: I had n't hardly got back here when I heard a shot go echoing and rattling right away into the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 21]: I ran out -- neighbours ran out -- twenty of us cried at once , ` Tom Jarndyce ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 27]: The old man stopped , looked hard at us , looked down into the lantern , blew the light out , and shut the lantern up .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 13]: `` We were right , I need n't tell the present hearers .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 2]: Hi !
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 18]: To be sure , how the neighbourhood poured into court that afternoon while the cause was on !
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 50]: How my noble and learned brother , and all the rest of 'em , grubbed and muddled away as usual and tried to look as if they had n't heard a word of the last fact in the case or as if they had -- Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 19]: -- nothing at all to do with it if they had heard of it by any chance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 15]: Ada 's colour had entirely left her , and Richard was scarcely less pale .
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 53]: Nor could I wonder , judging even from my emotions , and I was no party in the suit , that to hearts so untried and fresh it was a shock to come into the inheritance of a protracted misery , attended in the minds of many people with such dreadful recollections .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 72]: I had another uneasiness , in the application of the painful story to the poor half-witted creature who had brought us there ; but , to my surprise , she seemed perfectly unconscious of that and only led the way upstairs again , informing us with the toleration of a superior creature for the infirmities of a common mortal that her landlord was `` a little M , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 27]: She lived at the top of the house , in a pretty large room , from which she had a glimpse of Lincoln 's Inn Hall .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 18]: This seemed to have been her principal inducement , originally , for taking up her residence there .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 18]: She could look at it , she said , in the night , especially in the moonshine .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 11]: Her room was clean , but very , very bare .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 45]: I noticed the scantiest necessaries in the way of furniture ; a few old prints from books , of Chancellors and barristers , wafered against the wall ; and some half-dozen reticles and work-bags , `` containing documents , '' as she informed us .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 25]: There were neither coals nor ashes in the grate , and I saw no articles of clothing anywhere , nor any kind of food .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 28]: Upon a shelf in an open cupboard were a plate or two , a cup or two , and so forth , but all dry and empty .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 24]: There was a more affecting meaning in her pinched appearance , I thought as I looked round , than I had understood before .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 28]: `` Extremely honoured , I am sure , '' said our poor hostess with the greatest suavity , `` by this visit from the wards in Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 8]: And very much indebted for the omen .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 6]: It is a retired situation .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 2]: Considering .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 7]: I am limited as to situation .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 11]: In consequence of the necessity of attending on the Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 7]: I have lived here many years .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 14]: I pass my days in court , my evenings and my nights here .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 15]: I find the nights long , for I sleep but little and think much .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 12]: That is , of course , unavoidable , being in Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 9]: I am sorry I can not offer chocolate .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 16]: I expect a judgment shortly and shall then place my establishment on a superior footing .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 31]: At present , I do n't mind confessing to the wards in Jarndyce -LRB- in strict confidence -RRB- that I sometimes find it difficult to keep up a genteel appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 7]: I have felt the cold here .
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 8]: I have felt something sharper than cold .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 5]: It matters very little .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 10]: Pray excuse the introduction of such mean topics . ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 30]: She partly drew aside the curtain of the long , low garret window and called our attention to a number of bird-cages hanging there , some containing several birds .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 16]: There were larks , linnets , and goldfinches -- I should think at least twenty .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 24]: `` I began to keep the little creatures , '' she said , `` with an object that the wards will readily comprehend .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 9]: With the intention of restoring them to liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 7]: When my judgment should be given .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 2]: Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 7]: They die in prison , though .
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 31]: Their lives , poor silly things , are so short in comparison with Chancery proceedings that , one by one , the whole collection has died over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 24]: I doubt , do you know , whether one of these , though they are all young , will live to be free !
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 8]: Ve-ry mortifying , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 36]: Although she sometimes asked a question , she never seemed to expect a reply , but rambled on as if she were in the habit of doing so when no one but herself was present .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 56]: `` Indeed , '' she pursued , `` I positively doubt sometimes , I do assure you , whether while matters are still unsettled , and the sixth or Great Seal still prevails , I may not one day be found lying stark and senseless here , as I have found so many birds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 28]: Richard , answering what he saw in Ada 's compassionate eyes , took the opportunity of laying some money , softly and unobserved , on the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 14]: We all drew nearer to the cages , feigning to examine the birds .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 47]: `` I ca n't allow them to sing much , '' said the little old lady , `` for -LRB- you 'll think this curious -RRB- I find my mind confused by the idea that they are singing while I am following the arguments in court .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 13]: And my mind requires to be so very clear , you know !
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 10]: Another time , I 'll tell you their names .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 4]: Not at present .
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 17]: On a day of such good omen , they shall sing as much as they like .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 30]: In honour of youth , '' a smile and curtsy , `` hope , '' a smile and curtsy , `` and beauty , '' a smile and curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 9]: We 'll let in the full light . ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 8]: The birds began to stir and chirp .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 48]: `` I can not admit the air freely , '' said the little old lady -- the room was close , and would have been the better for it -- `` because the cat you saw downstairs , called Lady Jane , is greedy for their lives .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 11]: She crouches on the parapet outside for hours and hours .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 25]: I have discovered , '' whispering mysteriously , `` that her natural cruelty is sharpened by a jealous fear of their regaining their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 11]: In consequence of the judgment I expect being shortly given .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 8]: She is sly and full of malice .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 20]: I half believe , sometimes , that she is no cat , but the wolf of the old saying .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 13]: It is so very difficult to keep her from the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 37]: Some neighbouring bells , reminding the poor soul that it was half-past nine , did more for us in the way of bringing our visit to an end than we could easily have done for ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 31]: She hurriedly took up her little bag of documents , which she had laid upon the table on coming in , and asked if we were also going into court .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 24]: On our answering no , and that we would on no account detain her , she opened the door to attend us downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 39]: `` With such an omen , it is even more necessary than usual that I should be there before the Chancellor comes in , '' said she , `` for he might mention my case the first thing .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 58]: I have a presentiment that he WILL mention it the first thing this morning '' She stopped to tell us in a whisper as we were going down that the whole house was filled with strange lumber which her landlord had bought piecemeal and had no wish to sell , in consequence of being a little M .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 7]: This was on the first floor .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 21]: But she had made a previous stoppage on the second floor and had silently pointed at a dark door there .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 17]: `` The only other lodger , '' she now whispered in explanation , `` a law-writer .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 15]: The children in the lanes here say he has sold himself to the devil .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 13]: I do n't know what he can have done with the money .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 3]: Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 19]: She appeared to mistrust that the lodger might hear her even there , and repeating `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 22]: went before us on tiptoe as though even the sound of her footsteps might reveal to him what she had said .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 41]: Passing through the shop on our way out , as we had passed through it on our way in , we found the old man storing a quantity of packets of waste-paper in a kind of well in the floor .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 49]: He seemed to be working hard , with the perspiration standing on his forehead , and had a piece of chalk by him , with which , as he put each separate package or bundle down , he made a crooked mark on the panelling of the wall .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 60]: Richard and Ada , and Miss Jellyby , and the little old lady had gone by him , and I was going when he touched me on the arm to stay me , and chalked the letter J upon the wall -- in a very curious manner , beginning with the end of the letter and shaping it backward .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 30]: It was a capital letter , not a printed one , but just such a letter as any clerk in Messrs. Kenge and Carboy 's office would have made .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 7]: `` Can you read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 8]: he asked me with a keen glance .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 13]: `` Surely , '' said I. `` It 's very plain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 47]: `` J. '' With another glance at me , and a glance at the door , he rubbed it out and turned an `` a '' in its place -LRB- not a capital letter this time -RRB- , and said , `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 4]: I told him .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 20]: He then rubbed that out and turned the letter `` r , '' and asked me the same question .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 38]: He went on quickly until he had formed in the same curious manner , beginning at the ends and bottoms of the letters , the word Jarndyce , without once leaving two letters on the wall together .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 7]: `` What does that spell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 4]: he asked me .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 8]: When I told him , he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 30]: In the same odd way , yet with the same rapidity , he then produced singly , and rubbed out singly , the letters forming the words Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 15]: These , in some astonishment , I also read ; and he laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 4]: `` Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 10]: said the old man , laying aside the chalk .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 24]: `` I have a turn for copying from memory , you see , miss , though I can neither read nor write . ''
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 56]: He looked so disagreeable and his cat looked so wickedly at me , as if I were a blood-relation of the birds upstairs , that I was quite relieved by Richard 's appearing at the door and saying , `` Miss Summerson , I hope you are not bargaining for the sale of your hair .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 5]: Do n't be tempted .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 11]: Three sacks below are quite enough for Mr. Krook ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 52]: I lost no time in wishing Mr. Krook good morning and joining my friends outside , where we parted with the little old lady , who gave us her blessing with great ceremony and renewed her assurance of yesterday in reference to her intention of settling estates on Ada and me .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 53]: Before we finally turned out of those lanes , we looked back and saw Mr. Krook standing at his shop-door , in his spectacles , looking after us , with his cat upon his shoulder , and her tail sticking up on one side of his hairy cap like a tall feather .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 11]: `` Quite an adventure for a morning in London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 6]: said Richard with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 16]: `` Ah , cousin , cousin , it 's a weary word this Chancery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 19]: `` It is to me , and has been ever since I can remember , '' returned Ada .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 66]: `` I am grieved that I should be the enemy -- - as I suppose I am -- of a great number of relations and others , and that they should be my enemies -- as I suppose they are -- and that we should all be ruining one another without knowing how or why and be in constant doubt and discord all our lives .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 35]: It seems very strange , as there must be right somewhere , that an honest judge in real earnest has not been able to find out through all these years where it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 6]: `` Ah , cousin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 5]: `` Strange , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 10]: All this wasteful , wanton chess-playing IS very strange .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 32]: To see that composed court yesterday jogging on so serenely and to think of the wretchedness of the pieces on the board gave me the headache and the heartache both together .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 29]: My head ached with wondering how it happened , if men were neither fools nor rascals ; and my heart ached to think they could possibly be either .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 14]: But at all events , Ada -- I may call you Ada ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 10]: `` Of course you may , cousin Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 16]: `` At all events , Chancery will work none of its bad influences on US .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 22]: We have happily been brought together , thanks to our good kinsman , and it ca n't divide us now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 10]: `` Never , I hope , cousin Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 4]: said Ada gently .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 14]: Miss Jellyby gave my arm a squeeze and me a very significant look .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 17]: I smiled in return , and we made the rest of the way back very pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 33]: In half an hour after our arrival , Mrs. Jellyby appeared ; and in the course of an hour the various things necessary for breakfast straggled one by one into the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 30]: I do not doubt that Mrs. Jellyby had gone to bed and got up in the usual manner , but she presented no appearance of having changed her dress .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 36]: She was greatly occupied during breakfast , for the morning 's post brought a heavy correspondence relative to Borrioboola -- Gha , which would occasion her -LRB- she said -RRB- to pass a busy day .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 44]: The children tumbled about , and notched memoranda of their accidents in their legs , which were perfect little calendars of distress ; and Peepy was lost for an hour and a half , and brought home from Newgate market by a policeman .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 22]: The equable manner in which Mrs. Jellyby sustained both his absence and his restoration to the family circle surprised us all .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 26]: She was by that time perseveringly dictating to Caddy , and Caddy was fast relapsing into the inky condition in which we had found her .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 17]: At one o'clock an open carriage arrived for us , and a cart for our luggage .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 113]: Mrs. Jellyby charged us with many remembrances to her good friend Mr. Jarndyce ; Caddy left her desk to see us depart , kissed me in the passage , and stood biting her pen and sobbing on the steps ; Peepy , I am happy to say , was asleep and spared the pain of separation -LRB- I was not without misgivings that he had gone to Newgate market in search of me -RRB- ; and all the other children got up behind the barouche and fell off , and we saw them , with great concern , scattered over the surface of Thavies Inn as we rolled out of its precincts .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 21]: Chapter VI -- Quite at Home The day had brightened very much , and still brightened as we went westward .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 51]: We went our way through the sunshine and the fresh air , wondering more and more at the extent of the streets , the brilliancy of the shops , the great traffic , and the crowds of people whom the pleasanter weather seemed to have brought out like many-coloured flowers .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 73]: By and by we began to leave the wonderful city and to proceed through suburbs which , of themselves , would have made a pretty large town in my eyes ; and at last we got into a real country road again , with windmills , rick-yards , milestones , farmers ' waggons , scents of old hay , swinging signs , and horse troughs : trees , fields , and hedge-rows .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 61]: It was delightful to see the green landscape before us and the immense metropolis behind ; and when a waggon with a train of beautiful horses , furnished with red trappings and clear-sounding bells , came by us with its music , I believe we could all three have sung to the bells , so cheerful were the influences around .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 26]: `` The whole road has been reminding me of my name-sake Whittington , '' said Richard , `` and that waggon is the finishing touch .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 2]: Halloa !
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 11]: We had stopped , and the waggon had stopped too .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 37]: Its music changed as the horses came to a stand , and subsided to a gentle tinkling , except when a horse tossed his head or shook himself and sprinkled off a little shower of bell-ringing .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 23]: `` Our postilion is looking after the waggoner , '' said Richard , `` and the waggoner is coming back after us .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 6]: Good day , friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 7]: The waggoner was at our coach-door .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 10]: `` Why , here 's an extraordinary thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 9]: added Richard , looking closely at the man .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 14]: `` He has got your name , Ada , in his hat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 9]: He had all our names in his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 22]: Tucked within the band were three small notes -- one addressed to Ada , one to Richard , one to me .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 16]: These the waggoner delivered to each of us respectively , reading the name aloud first .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 53]: In answer to Richard 's inquiry from whom they came , he briefly answered , `` Master , sir , if you please '' ; and putting on his hat again -LRB- which was like a soft bowl -RRB- , cracked his whip , re-awakened his music , and went melodiously away .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 9]: `` Is that Mr. Jarndyce 's waggon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 8]: said Richard , calling to our post-boy .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 6]: `` Going to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 5]: We opened the notes .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 18]: Each was a counterpart of the other and contained these words in a solid , plain hand .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 19]: `` I look forward , my dear , to our meeting easily and without constraint on either side .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 18]: I therefore have to propose that we meet as old friends and take the past for granted .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 21]: It will be a relief to you possibly , and to me certainly , and so my love to you .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 40]: John Jarndyce '' I had perhaps less reason to be surprised than either of my companions , having never yet enjoyed an opportunity of thanking one who had been my benefactor and sole earthly dependence through so many years .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 45]: I had not considered how I could thank him , my gratitude lying too deep in my heart for that ; but I now began to consider how I could meet him without thanking him , and felt it would be very difficult indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 59]: The notes revived in Richard and Ada a general impression that they both had , without quite knowing how they came by it , that their cousin Jarndyce could never bear acknowledgments for any kindness he performed and that sooner than receive any he would resort to the most singular expedients and evasions or would even run away .
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 71]: Ada dimly remembered to have heard her mother tell , when she was a very little child , that he had once done her an act of uncommon generosity and that on her going to his house to thank him , he happened to see her through a window coming to the door , and immediately escaped by the back gate , and was not heard of for three months .
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 29]: This discourse led to a great deal more on the same theme , and indeed it lasted us all day , and we talked of scarcely anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 66]: If we did by any chance diverge into another subject , we soon returned to this , and wondered what the house would be like , and when we should get there , and whether we should see Mr. Jarndyce as soon as we arrived or after a delay , and what he would say to us , and what we should say to him .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 12]: All of which we wondered about , over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 47]: The roads were very heavy for the horses , but the pathway was generally good , so we alighted and walked up all the hills , and liked it so well that we prolonged our walk on the level ground when we got to the top .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 46]: At Barnet there were other horses waiting for us , but as they had only just been fed , we had to wait for them too , and got a long fresh walk over a common and an old battle-field before the carriage came up .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 37]: These delays so protracted the journey that the short day was spent and the long night had closed in before we came to St. Albans , near to which town Bleak House was , we knew .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 35]: By that time we were so anxious and nervous that even Richard confessed , as we rattled over the stones of the old street , to feeling an irrational desire to drive back again .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 29]: As to Ada and me , whom he had wrapped up with great care , the night being sharp and frosty , we trembled from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 71]: When we turned out of the town , round a corner , and Richard told us that the post-boy , who had for a long time sympathized with our heightened expectation , was looking back and nodding , we both stood up in the carriage -LRB- Richard holding Ada lest she should be jolted down -RRB- and gazed round upon the open country and the starlight night for our destination .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 34]: There was a light sparkling on the top of a hill before us , and the driver , pointing to it with his whip and crying , `` That 's Bleak House ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 37]: put his horses into a canter and took us forward at such a rate , uphill though it was , that the wheels sent the road drift flying about our heads like spray from a water-mill .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 35]: Presently we lost the light , presently saw it , presently lost it , presently saw it , and turned into an avenue of trees and cantered up towards where it was beaming brightly .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 30]: It was in a window of what seemed to be an old-fashioned house with three peaks in the roof in front and a circular sweep leading to the porch .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 66]: A bell was rung as we drew up , and amidst the sound of its deep voice in the still air , and the distant barking of some dogs , and a gush of light from the opened door , and the smoking and steaming of the heated horses , and the quickened beating of our own hearts , we alighted in no inconsiderable confusion .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 15]: `` Ada , my love , Esther , my dear , you are welcome .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 6]: I rejoice to see you !
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 19]: Rick , if I had a hand to spare at present , I would give it you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 59]: The gentleman who said these words in a clear , bright , hospitable voice had one of his arms round Ada 's waist and the other round mine , and kissed us both in a fatherly way , and bore us across the hall into a ruddy little room , all in a glow with a blazing fire .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 28]: Here he kissed us again , and opening his arms , made us sit down side by side on a sofa ready drawn out near the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 20]: I felt that if we had been at all demonstrative , he would have run away in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 6]: `` Now , Rick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 8]: `` I have a hand at liberty .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 11]: A word in earnest is as good as a speech .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 8]: I am heartily glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 5]: You are at home .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 4]: Warm yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 48]: Richard shook him by both hands with an intuitive mixture of respect and frankness , and only saying -LRB- though with an earnestness that rather alarmed me , I was so afraid of Mr. Jarndyce 's suddenly disappearing -RRB- , `` You are very kind , sir !
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 9]: We are very much obliged to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 13]: laid aside his hat and coat and came up to the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 9]: `` And how did you like the ride ?
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 12]: And how did you like Mrs. Jellyby , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 6]: said Mr. Jarndyce to Ada .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 25]: While Ada was speaking to him in reply , I glanced -LRB- I need not say with how much interest -RRB- at his face .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 24]: It was a handsome , lively , quick face , full of change and motion ; and his hair was a silvered iron-grey .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 20]: I took him to be nearer sixty than fifty , but he was upright , hearty , and robust .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 65]: From the moment of his first speaking to us his voice had connected itself with an association in my mind that I could not define ; but now , all at once , a something sudden in his manner and a pleasant expression in his eyes recalled the gentleman in the stagecoach six years ago on the memorable day of my journey to Reading .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: I was certain it was he .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 43]: I never was so frightened in my life as when I made the discovery , for he caught my glance , and appearing to read my thoughts , gave such a look at the door that I thought we had lost him .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 23]: However , I am happy to say he remained where he was , and asked me what I thought of Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 15]: `` She exerts herself very much for Africa , sir , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 4]: `` Nobly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 4]: returned Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 8]: `` But you answer like Ada . ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 6]: Whom I had not heard .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 11]: `` You all think something else , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 37]: `` We rather thought , '' said I , glancing at Richard and Ada , who entreated me with their eyes to speak , `` that perhaps she was a little unmindful of her home . ''
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 4]: `` Floored ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 4]: cried Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 6]: I was rather alarmed again .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 11]: I want to know your real thoughts , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 10]: I may have sent you there on purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 50]: `` We thought that , perhaps , '' said I , hesitating , `` it is right to begin with the obligations of home , sir ; and that , perhaps , while those are overlooked and neglected , no other duties can possibly be substituted for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 36]: `` The little Jellybys , '' said Richard , coming to my relief , `` are really -- I ca n't help expressing myself strongly , sir -- in a devil of a state . ''
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 11]: `` She means well , '' said Mr. Jarndyce hastily .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 9]: `` The wind 's in the east . ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 18]: `` It was in the north , sir , as we came down , '' observed Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 31]: `` My dear Rick , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , poking the fire , `` I 'll take an oath it 's either in the east or going to be .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 21]: I am always conscious of an uncomfortable sensation now and then when the wind is blowing in the east . ''
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 6]: `` Rheumatism , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 9]: `` I dare say it is , Rick .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 5]: I believe it is .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 28]: And so the little Jell -- I had my doubts about 'em -- are in a -- oh , Lord , yes , it 's easterly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 62]: He had taken two or three undecided turns up and down while uttering these broken sentences , retaining the poker in one hand and rubbing his hair with the other , with a good-natured vexation at once so whimsical and so lovable that I am sure we were more delighted with him than we could possibly have expressed in any words .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 33]: He gave an arm to Ada and an arm to me , and bidding Richard bring a candle , was leading the way out when he suddenly turned us all back again .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 5]: `` Those little Jellybys .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 28]: Could n't you -- did n't you -- now , if it had rained sugar-plums , or three-cornered raspberry tarts , or anything of that sort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 10]: `` Oh , cousin -- '' Ada hastily began .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 7]: `` Good , my pretty pet .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 4]: I like cousin .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 9]: Cousin John , perhaps , is better . ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 12]: `` Then , cousin John -- '' Ada laughingly began again .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 5]: `` Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 5]: Very good indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 7]: said Mr. Jarndyce with great enjoyment .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 5]: `` Sounds uncommonly natural .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 6]: Yes , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 7]: `` It did better than that .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 5]: It rained Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 4]: `` Aye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 7]: `` What did Esther do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 40]: `` Why , cousin John , '' said Ada , clasping her hands upon his arm and shaking her head at me across him -- for I wanted her to be quiet -- `` Esther was their friend directly .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 31]: Esther nursed them , coaxed them to sleep , washed and dressed them , told them stories , kept them quiet , bought them keepsakes '' -- My dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 20]: I had only gone out with Peepy after he was found and given him a little , tiny horse !
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 28]: -- `` and , cousin John , she softened poor Caroline , the eldest one , so much and was so thoughtful for me and so amiable !
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 13]: No , no , I wo n't be contradicted , Esther dear !
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 11]: You know , you know , it 's true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 44]: The warm-hearted darling leaned across her cousin John and kissed me , and then looking up in his face , boldly said , `` At all events , cousin John , I WILL thank you for the companion you have given me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 11]: I felt as if she challenged him to run away .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 5]: But he did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 12]: `` Where did you say the wind was , Rick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 4]: asked Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 12]: `` In the north as we came down , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 7]: There 's no east in it .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 5]: A mistake of mine .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 11]: Come , girls , come and see your home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 72]: It was one of those delightfully irregular houses where you go up and down steps out of one room into another , and where you come upon more rooms when you think you have seen all there are , and where there is a bountiful provision of little halls and passages , and where you find still older cottage-rooms in unexpected places with lattice windows and green growth pressing through them .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 62]: Mine , which we entered first , was of this kind , with an up-and-down roof that had more corners in it than I ever counted afterwards and a chimney -LRB- there was a wood fire on the hearth -RRB- paved all around with pure white tiles , in every one of which a bright miniature of the fire was blazing .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 32]: Out of this room , you went down two steps into a charming little sitting-room looking down upon a flower-garden , which room was henceforth to belong to Ada and me .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 62]: Out of this you went up three steps into Ada 's bedroom , which had a fine broad window commanding a beautiful view -LRB- we saw a great expanse of darkness lying underneath the stars -RRB- , to which there was a hollow window-seat , in which , with a spring-lock , three dear Adas might have been lost at once .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 51]: Out of this room you passed into a little gallery , with which the other best rooms -LRB- only two -RRB- communicated , and so , by a little staircase of shallow steps with a number of corner stairs in it , considering its length , down into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 110]: But if instead of going out at Ada 's door you came back into my room , and went out at the door by which you had entered it , and turned up a few crooked steps that branched off in an unexpected manner from the stairs , you lost yourself in passages , with mangles in them , and three-cornered tables , and a native Hindu chair , which was also a sofa , a box , and a bedstead , and looked in every form something between a bamboo skeleton and a great bird-cage , and had been brought from India nobody knew by whom or when .
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 30]: From these you came on Richard 's room , which was part library , part sitting-room , part bedroom , and seemed indeed a comfortable compound of many rooms .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 62]: Out of that you went straight , with a little interval of passage , to the plain room where Mr. Jarndyce slept , all the year round , with his window open , his bedstead without any furniture standing in the middle of the floor for more air , and his cold bath gaping for him in a smaller room adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 51]: Out of that you came into another passage , where there were back-stairs and where you could hear the horses being rubbed down outside the stable and being told to `` Hold up '' and `` Get over , '' as they slipped about very much on the uneven stones .
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 50]: Or you might , if you came out at another door -LRB- every room had at least two doors -RRB- , go straight down to the hall again by half-a-dozen steps and a low archway , wondering how you got back there or had ever got out of it .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 17]: The furniture , old-fashioned rather than old , like the house , was as pleasantly irregular .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 49]: Ada 's sleeping-room was all flowers -- in chintz and paper , in velvet , in needlework , in the brocade of two stiff courtly chairs which stood , each attended by a little page of a stool for greater state , on either side of the fire-place .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 68]: Our sitting-room was green and had framed and glazed upon the walls numbers of surprising and surprised birds , staring out of pictures at a real trout in a case , as brown and shining as if it had been served with gravy ; at the death of Captain Cook ; and at the whole process of preparing tea in China , as depicted by Chinese artists .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 39]: In my room there were oval engravings of the months -- ladies haymaking in short waists and large hats tied under the chin , for June ; smooth-legged noblemen pointing with cocked-hats to village steeples , for October .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 50]: Half-length portraits in crayons abounded all through the house , but were so dispersed that I found the brother of a youthful officer of mine in the china-closet and the grey old age of my pretty young bride , with a flower in her bodice , in the breakfast-room .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 43]: As substitutes , I had four angels , of Queen Anne 's reign , taking a complacent gentleman to heaven , in festoons , with some difficulty ; and a composition in needlework representing fruit , a kettle , and an alphabet .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 33]: All the movables , from the wardrobes to the chairs and tables , hangings , glasses , even to the pincushions and scent-bottles on the dressing-tables , displayed the same quaint variety .
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 43]: They agreed in nothing but their perfect neatness , their display of the whitest linen , and their storing-up , wheresoever the existence of a drawer , small or large , rendered it possible , of quantities of rose-leaves and sweet lavender .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 82]: Such , with its illuminated windows , softened here and there by shadows of curtains , shining out upon the starlight night ; with its light , and warmth , and comfort ; with its hospitable jingle , at a distance , of preparations for dinner ; with the face of its generous master brightening everything we saw ; and just wind enough without to sound a low accompaniment to everything we heard , were our first impressions of Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 24]: `` I am glad you like it , '' said Mr. Jarndyce when he had brought us round again to Ada 's sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 30]: `` It makes no pretensions , but it is a comfortable little place , I hope , and will be more so with such bright young looks in it .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 9]: You have barely half an hour before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 16]: There 's no one here but the finest creature upon earth -- a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 7]: `` More children , Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 3]: said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 21]: `` I do n't mean literally a child , '' pursued Mr. Jarndyce ; `` not a child in years .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 42]: He is grown up -- he is at least as old as I am -- but in simplicity , and freshness , and enthusiasm , and a fine guileless inaptitude for all worldly affairs , he is a perfect child . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 9]: We felt that he must be very interesting .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 11]: `` He knows Mrs. Jellyby , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 17]: `` He is a musical man , an amateur , but might have been a professional .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 16]: He is an artist too , an amateur , but might have been a professional .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 11]: He is a man of attainments and of captivating manners .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 32]: He has been unfortunate in his affairs , and unfortunate in his pursuits , and unfortunate in his family ; but he do n't care -- he 's a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 15]: `` Did you imply that he has children of his own , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 3]: inquired Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 5]: `` Yes , Rick !
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 2]: Half-a-dozen .
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 2]: More !
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 8]: Nearer a dozen , I should think .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 8]: But he has never looked after them .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 4]: How could he ?
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 8]: He wanted somebody to look after HIM .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 9]: He is a child , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 14]: `` And have the children looked after themselves at all , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 3]: inquired Richard .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 19]: `` Why , just as you may suppose , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , his countenance suddenly falling .
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 20]: `` It is said that the children of the very poor are not brought up , but dragged up .
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 11]: Harold Skimpole 's children have tumbled up somehow or other .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 11]: The wind 's getting round again , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 6]: I feel it rather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 12]: Richard observed that the situation was exposed on a sharp night .
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 10]: `` It IS exposed , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 8]: `` No doubt that 's the cause .
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 7]: Bleak House has an exposed sound .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 7]: But you are coming my way .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 4]: Come along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 63]: Our luggage having arrived and being all at hand , I was dressed in a few minutes and engaged in putting my worldly goods away when a maid -LRB- not the one in attendance upon Ada , but another , whom I had not seen -RRB- brought a basket into my room with two bunches of keys in it , all labelled .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 14]: `` For you , miss , if you please , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 5]: `` For me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 10]: said I. `` The housekeeping keys , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 33]: I showed my surprise , for she added with some little surprise on her own part , `` I was told to bring them as soon as you was alone , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 11]: Miss Summerson , if I do n't deceive myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' said I. `` That is my name . ''
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 18]: `` The large bunch is the housekeeping , and the little bunch is the cellars , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 24]: Any time you was pleased to appoint tomorrow morning , I was to show you the presses and things they belong to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 31]: I said I would be ready at half-past six , and after she was gone , stood looking at the basket , quite lost in the magnitude of my trust .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 36]: Ada found me thus and had such a delightful confidence in me when I showed her the keys and told her about them that it would have been insensibility and ingratitude not to feel encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 25]: I knew , to be sure , that it was the dear girl 's kindness , but I liked to be so pleasantly cheated .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 34]: When we went downstairs , we were presented to Mr. Skimpole , who was standing before the fire telling Richard how fond he used to be , in his school-time , of football .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 30]: He was a little bright creature with a rather large head , but a delicate face and a sweet voice , and there was a perfect charm in him .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 27]: All he said was so free from effort and spontaneous and was said with such a captivating gaiety that it was fascinating to hear him talk .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 23]: Being of a more slender figure than Mr. Jarndyce and having a richer complexion , with browner hair , he looked younger .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 21]: Indeed , he had more the appearance in all respects of a damaged young man than a well-preserved elderly one .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 57]: There was an easy negligence in his manner and even in his dress -LRB- his hair carelessly disposed , and his neckkerchief loose and flowing , as I have seen artists paint their own portraits -RRB- which I could not separate from the idea of a romantic youth who had undergone some unique process of depreciation .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 33]: It struck me as being not at all like the manner or appearance of a man who had advanced in life by the usual road of years , cares , and experiences .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 33]: I gathered from the conversation that Mr. Skimpole had been educated for the medical profession and had once lived , in his professional capacity , in the household of a German prince .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 50]: He told us , however , that as he had always been a mere child in point of weights and measures and had never known anything about them -LRB- except that they disgusted him -RRB- , he had never been able to prescribe with the requisite accuracy of detail .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 13]: In fact , he said , he had no head for detail .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 50]: And he told us , with great humour , that when he was wanted to bleed the prince or physic any of his people , he was generally found lying on his back in bed , reading the newspapers or making fancy-sketches in pencil , and could n't come .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 70]: The prince , at last , objecting to this , `` in which , '' said Mr. Skimpole , in the frankest manner , `` he was perfectly right , '' the engagement terminated , and Mr. Skimpole having -LRB- as he added with delightful gaiety -RRB- `` nothing to live upon but love , fell in love , and married , and surrounded himself with rosy cheeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 66]: His good friend Jarndyce and some other of his good friends then helped him , in quicker or slower succession , to several openings in life , but to no purpose , for he must confess to two of the oldest infirmities in the world : one was that he had no idea of time , the other that he had no idea of money .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 24]: In consequence of which he never kept an appointment , never could transact any business , and never knew the value of anything !
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 13]: So he had got on in life , and here he was !
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 28]: He was very fond of reading the papers , very fond of making fancy-sketches with a pencil , very fond of nature , very fond of art .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 11]: All he asked of society was to let him live .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 5]: THAT was n't much .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 5]: His wants were few .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 37]: Give him the papers , conversation , music , mutton , coffee , landscape , fruit in the season , a few sheets of Bristol-board , and a little claret , and he asked no more .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 18]: He was a mere child in the world , but he did n't cry for the moon .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 14]: He said to the world , `` Go your several ways in peace !
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 42]: Wear red coats , blue coats , lawn sleeves ; put pens behind your ears , wear aprons ; go after glory , holiness , commerce , trade , any object you prefer ; only -- let Harold Skimpole live ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 79]: All this and a great deal more he told us , not only with the utmost brilliancy and enjoyment , but with a certain vivacious candour -- speaking of himself as if he were not at all his own affair , as if Skimpole were a third person , as if he knew that Skimpole had his singularities but still had his claims too , which were the general business of the community and must not be slighted .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 5]: He was quite enchanting .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 53]: If I felt at all confused at that early time in endeavouring to reconcile anything he said with anything I had thought about the duties and accountabilities of life -LRB- which I am far from sure of -RRB- , I was confused by not exactly understanding why he was free of them .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 20]: That he WAS free of them , I scarcely doubted ; he was so very clear about it himself .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 15]: `` I covet nothing , '' said Mr. Skimpole in the same light way .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 7]: `` Possession is nothing to me .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 9]: Here is my friend Jarndyce 's excellent house .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 9]: I feel obliged to him for possessing it .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 8]: I can sketch it and alter it .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 7]: I can set it to music .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 21]: When I am here , I have sufficient possession of it and have neither trouble , cost , nor responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 18]: My steward 's name , in short , is Jarndyce , and he ca n't cheat me .
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 7]: We have been mentioning Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 26]: There is a bright-eyed woman , of a strong will and immense power of business detail , who throws herself into objects with surprising ardour !
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 27]: I do n't regret that I have not a strong will and an immense power of business detail to throw myself into objects with surprising ardour .
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 7]: I can admire her without envy .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 7]: I can sympathize with the objects .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 6]: I can dream of them .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 47]: I can lie down on the grass -- in fine weather -- and float along an African river , embracing all the natives I meet , as sensible of the deep silence and sketching the dense overhanging tropical growth as accurately as if I were there .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 29]: I do n't know that it 's of any direct use my doing so , but it 's all I can do , and I do it thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 59]: Then , for heaven 's sake , having Harold Skimpole , a confiding child , petitioning you , the world , an agglomeration of practical people of business habits , to let him live and admire the human family , do it somehow or other , like good souls , and suffer him to ride his rocking-horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 15]: It was plain enough that Mr. Jarndyce had not been neglectful of the adjuration .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 20]: Mr. Skimpole 's general position there would have rendered it so without the addition of what he presently said .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 31]: `` It 's only you , the generous creatures , whom I envy , '' said Mr. Skimpole , addressing us , his new friends , in an impersonal manner .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 12]: `` I envy you your power of doing what you do .
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: It is what I should revel in myself .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 10]: I do n't feel any vulgar gratitude to you .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 24]: I almost feel as if YOU ought to be grateful to ME for giving you the opportunity of enjoying the luxury of generosity .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 6]: I know you like it .
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 24]: For anything I can tell , I may have come into the world expressly for the purpose of increasing your stock of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 25]: I may have been born to be a benefactor to you by sometimes giving you an opportunity of assisting me in my little perplexities .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 19]: Why should I regret my incapacity for details and worldly affairs when it leads to such pleasant consequences ?
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 8]: I do n't regret it therefore . ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 30]: Of all his playful speeches -LRB- playful , yet always fully meaning what they expressed -RRB- none seemed to be more to the taste of Mr. Jarndyce than this .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 48]: I had often new temptations , afterwards , to wonder whether it was really singular , or only singular to me , that he , who was probably the most grateful of mankind upon the least occasion , should so desire to escape the gratitude of others .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 5]: We were all enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 40]: I felt it a merited tribute to the engaging qualities of Ada and Richard that Mr. Skimpole , seeing them for the first time , should he so unreserved and should lay himself out to be so exquisitely agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 32]: They -LRB- and especially Richard -RRB- were naturally pleased ; for similar reasons , and considered it no common privilege to be so freely confided in by such an attractive man .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 12]: The more we listened , the more gaily Mr. Skimpole talked .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 38]: And what with his fine hilarious manner and his engaging candour and his genial way of lightly tossing his own weaknesses about , as if he had said , `` I am a child , you know !
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 37]: You are designing people compared with me '' -LRB- he really made me consider myself in that light -RRB- `` but I am gay and innocent ; forget your worldly arts and play with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 6]: the effect was absolutely dazzling .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 30]: He was so full of feeling too and had such a delicate sentiment for what was beautiful or tender that he could have won a heart by that alone .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 59]: In the evening , when I was preparing to make tea and Ada was touching the piano in the adjoining room and softly humming a tune to her cousin Richard , which they had happened to mention , he came and sat down on the sofa near me and so spoke of Ada that I almost loved him .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 11]: `` She is like the morning , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 25]: `` With that golden hair , those blue eyes , and that fresh bloom on her cheek , she is like the summer morning .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 9]: The birds here will mistake her for it .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 23]: We will not call such a lovely young creature as that , who is a joy to all mankind , an orphan .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 9]: She is the child of the universe . ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 23]: Mr. Jarndyce , I found , was standing near us with his hands behind him and an attentive smile upon his face .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 20]: `` The universe , '' he observed , `` makes rather an indifferent parent , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 6]: I do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 5]: cried Mr. Skimpole buoyantly .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 12]: `` I think I do know , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 4]: cried Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 29]: `` You know the world -LRB- which in your sense is the universe -RRB- , and I know nothing of it , so you shall have your way .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 28]: But if I had mine , '' glancing at the cousins , `` there should be no brambles of sordid realities in such a path as that .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 28]: It should be strewn with roses ; it should lie through bowers , where there was no spring , autumn , nor winter , but perpetual summer .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 8]: Age or change should never wither it .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 12]: The base word money should never be breathed near it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 39]: Mr. Jarndyce patted him on the head with a smile , as if he had been really a child , and passing a step or two on , and stopping a moment , glanced at the young cousins .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 20]: His look was thoughtful , but had a benignant expression in it which I often -LRB- how often ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 12]: saw again , which has long been engraven on my heart .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 22]: The room in which they were , communicating with that in which he stood , was only lighted by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 14]: Ada sat at the piano ; Richard stood beside her , bending down .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 31]: Upon the wall , their shadows blended together , surrounded by strange forms , not without a ghostly motion caught from the unsteady fire , though reflecting from motionless objects .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 28]: Ada touched the notes so softly and sang so low that the wind , sighing away to the distant hills , was as audible as the music .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 25]: The mystery of the future and the little clue afforded to it by the voice of the present seemed expressed in the whole picture .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 21]: But it is not to recall this fancy , well as I remember it , that I recall the scene .
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 33]: First , I was not quite unconscious of the contrast in respect of meaning and intention between the silent look directed that way and the flow of words that had preceded it .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 60]: Secondly , though Mr. Jarndyce 's glance as he withdrew it rested for but a moment on me , I felt as if in that moment he confided to me -- and knew that he confided to me and that I received the confidence -- his hope that Ada and Richard might one day enter on a dearer relationship .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 38]: Mr. Skimpole could play on the piano and the violoncello , and he was a composer -- had composed half an opera once , but got tired of it -- and played what he composed with taste .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 46]: After tea we had quite a little concert , in which Richard -- who was enthralled by Ada 's singing and told me that she seemed to know all the songs that ever were written -- and Mr. Jarndyce , and I were the audience .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 60]: After a little while I missed first Mr. Skimpole and afterwards Richard , and while I was thinking how could Richard stay away so long and lose so much , the maid who had given me the keys looked in at the door , saying , `` If you please , miss , could you spare a minute ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 41]: When I was shut out with her in the hall , she said , holding up her hands , `` Oh , if you please , miss , Mr. Carstone says would you come upstairs to Mr. Skimpole 's room .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 8]: He has been took , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 4]: `` Took ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 7]: said I. `` Took , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 7]: Sudden , '' said the maid .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 58]: I was apprehensive that his illness might be of a dangerous kind , but of course I begged her to be quiet and not disturb any one and collected myself , as I followed her quickly upstairs , sufficiently to consider what were the best remedies to be applied if it should prove to be a fit .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 93]: She threw open a door and I went into a chamber , where , to my unspeakable surprise , instead of finding Mr. Skimpole stretched upon the bed or prostrate on the floor , I found him standing before the fire smiling at Richard , while Richard , with a face of great embarrassment , looked at a person on the sofa , in a white great-coat , with smooth hair upon his head and not much of it , which he was wiping smoother and making less of with a pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 17]: `` Miss Summerson , '' said Richard hurriedly , `` I am glad you are come .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 8]: You will be able to advise us .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 10]: Our friend Mr. Skimpole -- do n't be alarmed !
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 7]: -- is arrested for debt . ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 64]: `` And really , my dear Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Skimpole with his agreeable candour , `` I never was in a situation in which that excellent sense and quiet habit of method and usefulness , which anybody must observe in you who has the happiness of being a quarter of an hour in your society , was more needed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 27]: The person on the sofa , who appeared to have a cold in his head , gave such a very loud snort that he startled me .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 10]: `` Are you arrested for much , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 6]: I inquired of Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 21]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , '' said he , shaking his head pleasantly , `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 16]: Some pounds , odd shillings , and halfpence , I think , were mentioned . ''
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 19]: `` It 's twenty-four pound , sixteen , and sevenpence ha ` penny , '' observed the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 8]: `` That 's wot it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 21]: `` And it sounds -- somehow it sounds , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` like a small sum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 10]: The strange man said nothing but made another snort .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 18]: It was such a powerful one that it seemed quite to lift him out of his seat .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 45]: `` Mr. Skimpole , '' said Richard to me , `` has a delicacy in applying to my cousin Jarndyce because he has lately -- I think , sir , I understood you that you had lately -- '' `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 6]: returned Mr. Skimpole , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 13]: `` Though I forgot how much it was and when it was .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 52]: Jarndyce would readily do it again , but I have the epicure-like feeling that I would prefer a novelty in help , that I would rather , '' and he looked at Richard and me , `` develop generosity in a new soil and in a new form of flower . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 13]: `` What do you think will be best , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 5]: said Richard , aside .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 20]: I ventured to inquire , generally , before replying , what would happen if the money were not produced .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 26]: `` Jail , '' said the strange man , coolly putting his handkerchief into his hat , which was on the floor at his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 5]: `` Or Coavinses . ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 15]: `` May I ask , sir , what is -- '' `` Coavinses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 5]: said the strange man .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 6]: `` A ` ouse . ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 9]: Richard and I looked at one another again .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 18]: It was a most singular thing that the arrest was our embarrassment and not Mr. Skimpole 's .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 26]: He observed us with a genial interest , but there seemed , if I may venture on such a contradiction , nothing selfish in it .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 16]: He had entirely washed his hands of the difficulty , and it had become ours .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 68]: `` I thought , '' he suggested , as if good-naturedly to help us out , `` that being parties in a Chancery suit concerning -LRB- as people say -RRB- a large amount of property , Mr. Richard or his beautiful cousin , or both , could sign something , or make over something , or give some sort of undertaking , or pledge , or bond ?
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 29]: I do n't know what the business name of it may be , but I suppose there is some instrument within their power that would settle this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 13]: `` Not a bit on it , '' said the strange man .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 4]: `` Really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 4]: returned Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 18]: `` That seems odd , now , to one who is no judge of these things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 23]: `` Odd or even , '' said the stranger gruffly , `` I tell you , not a bit on it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 14]: `` Keep your temper , my good fellow , keep your temper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 22]: Mr. Skimpole gently reasoned with him as he made a little drawing of his head on the fly-leaf of a book .
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 9]: `` Do n't be ruffled by your occupation .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 17]: We can separate you from your office ; we can separate the individual from the pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 39]: We are not so prejudiced as to suppose that in private life you are otherwise than a very estimable man , with a great deal of poetry in your nature , of which you may not be conscious .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 29]: The stranger only answered with another violent snort , whether in acceptance of the poetry-tribute or in disdainful rejection of it , he did not express to me .
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 54]: `` Now , my dear Miss Summerson , and my dear Mr. Richard , '' said Mr. Skimpole gaily , innocently , and confidingly as he looked at his drawing with his head on one side , `` here you see me utterly incapable of helping myself , and entirely in your hands !
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 7]: I only ask to be free .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 5]: The butterflies are free .
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 16]: Mankind will surely not deny to Harold Skimpole what it concedes to the butterflies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 25]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , '' said Richard in a whisper , `` I have ten pounds that I received from Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 9]: I must try what that will do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 20]: I possessed fifteen pounds , odd shillings , which I had saved from my quarterly allowance during several years .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 44]: I had always thought that some accident might happen which would throw me suddenly , without any relation or any property , on the world and had always tried to keep some little money by me that I might not be quite penniless .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 47]: I told Richard of my having this little store and having no present need of it , and I asked him delicately to inform Mr. Skimpole , while I should be gone to fetch it , that we would have the pleasure of paying his debt .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 15]: When I came back , Mr. Skimpole kissed my hand and seemed quite touched .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 40]: Not on his own account -LRB- I was again aware of that perplexing and extraordinary contradiction -RRB- , but on ours , as if personal considerations were impossible with him and the contemplation of our happiness alone affected him .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 42]: Richard , begging me , for the greater grace of the transaction , as he said , to settle with Coavinses -LRB- as Mr. Skimpole now jocularly called him -RRB- , I counted out the money and received the necessary acknowledgment .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 8]: This , too , delighted Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 29]: His compliments were so delicately administered that I blushed less than I might have done and settled with the stranger in the white coat without making any mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 26]: He put the money in his pocket and shortly said , `` Well , then , I 'll wish you a good evening , miss .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 40]: `` My friend , '' said Mr. Skimpole , standing with his back to the fire after giving up the sketch when it was half finished , `` I should like to ask you something , without offence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 13]: I think the reply was , `` Cut away , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 19]: `` Did you know this morning , now , that you were coming out on this errand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 4]: said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 17]: `` Know 'd it yes ` day aft ` noon at tea-time , '' said Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 8]: `` It did n't affect your appetite ?
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 9]: Did n't make you at all uneasy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 9]: `` Not a hit , '' said Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 17]: `` I know 'd if you wos missed to-day , you would n't be missed to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 8]: A day makes no such odds . ''
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 20]: `` But when you came down here , '' proceeded Mr. Skimpole , `` it was a fine day .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 26]: The sun was shining , the wind was blowing , the lights and shadows were passing across the fields , the birds were singing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 15]: `` Nobody said they war n't , in MY hearing , '' returned Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 8]: `` No , '' observed Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 11]: `` But what did you think upon the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 7]: `` Wot do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 9]: growled Coavinses with an appearance of strong resentment .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 3]: `` Think !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 17]: I 've got enough to do , and little enough to get for it without thinking .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 3]: Thinking ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 6]: -LRB- with profound contempt -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 61]: `` Then you did n't think , at all events , '' proceeded Mr. Skimpole , `` to this effect : ` Harold Skimpole loves to see the sun shine , loves to hear the wind blow , loves to watch the changing lights and shadows , loves to hear the birds , those choristers in Nature 's great cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 28]: And does it seem to me that I am about to deprive Harold Skimpole of his share in such possessions , which are his only birthright ! '
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 8]: You thought nothing to that effect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 57]: `` I -- certainly -- did -- NOT , '' said Coavinses , whose doggedness in utterly renouncing the idea was of that intense kind that he could only give adequate expression to it by putting a long interval between each word , and accompanying the last with a jerk that might have dislocated his neck .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 19]: `` Very odd and very curious , the mental process is , in you men of business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 5]: said Mr. Skimpole thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 7]: `` Thank you , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 4]: Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 32]: As our absence had been long enough already to seem strange downstairs , I returned at once and found Ada sitting at work by the fireside talking to her cousin John .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 11]: Mr. Skimpole presently appeared , and Richard shortly after him .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 66]: I was sufficiently engaged during the remainder of the evening in taking my first lesson in backgammon from Mr. Jarndyce , who was very fond of the game and from whom I wished of course to learn it as quickly as I could in order that I might be of the very small use of being able to play when he had no better adversary .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 74]: But I thought , occasionally , when Mr. Skimpole played some fragments of his own compositions or when , both at the piano and the violoncello , and at our table , he preserved with an absence of all effort his delightful spirits and his easy flow of conversation , that Richard and I seemed to retain the transferred impression of having been arrested since dinner and that it was very curious altogether .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 47]: It was late before we separated , for when Ada was going at eleven o'clock , Mr. Skimpole went to the piano and rattled hilariously that the best of all ways to lengthen our days was to steal a few hours from night , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 37]: It was past twelve before he took his candle and his radiant face out of the room , and I think he might have kept us there , if he had seen fit , until daybreak .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 40]: Ada and Richard were lingering for a few moments by the fire , wondering whether Mrs. Jellyby had yet finished her dictation for the day , when Mr. Jarndyce , who had been out of the room , returned .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 15]: `` Oh , dear me , what 's this , what 's this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 14]: he said , rubbing his head and walking about with his good-humoured vexation .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 8]: `` What 's this they tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 16]: Rick , my boy , Esther , my dear , what have you been doing ?
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 6]: Why did you do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 6]: How could you do it ?
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 6]: How much apiece was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 6]: The wind 's round again .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 8]: I feel it all over me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 10]: We neither of us quite knew what to answer .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 7]: `` Come , Rick , come !
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 8]: I must settle this before I sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 8]: How much are you out of pocket ?
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 10]: You two made the money up , you know !
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 4]: Why did you ?
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 4]: How could you ?
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 15]: Oh , Lord , yes , it 's due east -- must be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 24]: `` Really , sir , '' said Richard , `` I do n't think it would be honourable in me to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 16]: Mr. Skimpole relied upon us -- '' `` Lord bless you , my dear boy !
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 6]: He relies upon everybody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: said Mr. Jarndyce , giving his head a great rub and stopping short .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 6]: `` Indeed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 3]: `` Everybody !
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 13]: And he 'll be in the same scrape again next week ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 22]: said Mr. Jarndyce , walking again at a great pace , with a candle in his hand that had gone out .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 9]: `` He 's always in the same scrape .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 8]: He was born in the same scrape .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 37]: I verily believe that the announcement in the newspapers when his mother was confined was ` On Tuesday last , at her residence in Botheration Buildings , Mrs. Skimpole of a son in difficulties . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 55]: Richard laughed heartily but added , `` Still , sir , I do n't want to shake his confidence or to break his confidence , and if I submit to your better knowledge again , that I ought to keep his secret , I hope you will consider before you press me any more .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 23]: Of course , if you do press me , sir , I shall know I am wrong and will tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 20]: cried Mr. Jarndyce , stopping again , and making several absent endeavours to put his candlestick in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 5]: `` I -- here !
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 7]: Take it away , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 35]: I do n't know what I am about with it ; it 's all the wind -- invariably has that effect -- I wo n't press you , Rick ; you may be right .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 26]: But really -- to get hold of you and Esther -- and to squeeze you like a couple of tender young Saint Michael 's oranges !
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 13]: It 'll blow a gale in the course of the night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 37]: He was now alternately putting his hands into his pockets as if he were going to keep them there a long time , and taking them out again and vehemently rubbing them all over his head .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 28]: I ventured to take this opportunity of hinting that Mr. Skimpole , being in all such matters quite a child -- `` Eh , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 9]: said Mr. Jarndyce , catching at the word .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 26]: Being quite a child , sir , '' said I , `` and so different from other people -- '' `` You are right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 6]: said Mr. Jarndyce , brightening .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 9]: `` Your woman 's wit hits the mark .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 9]: He is a child -- an absolute child .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 18]: I told you he was a child , you know , when I first mentioned him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 2]: Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 2]: Certainly !
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 3]: we said .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 7]: `` And he IS a child .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 7]: Now , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 9]: asked Mr. Jarndyce , brightening more and more .
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 7]: He was indeed , we said .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 38]: `` When you come to think of it , it 's the height of childishness in you -- I mean me -- '' said Mr. Jarodyce , `` to regard him for a moment as a man .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 7]: You ca n't make HIM responsible .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 15]: The idea of Harold Skimpole with designs or plans , or knowledge of consequences !
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 81]: It was so delicious to see the clouds about his bright face clearing , and to see him so heartily pleased , and to know , as it was impossible not to know , that the source of his pleasure was the goodness which was tortured by condemning , or mistrusting , or secretly accusing any one , that I saw the tears in Ada 's eyes , while she echoed his laugh , and felt them in my own .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 25]: `` Why , what a cod 's head and shoulders I am , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` to require reminding of it !
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 11]: The whole business shows the child from beginning to end .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 18]: Nobody but a child would have thought of singling YOU two out for parties in the affair !
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 13]: Nobody but a child would have thought of YOUR having the money !
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 17]: If it had been a thousand pounds , it would have been just the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 11]: said Mr. Jarndyce with his whole face in a glow .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 10]: We all confirmed it from our night 's experience .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 10]: `` To be sure , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 48]: `` However , Rick , Esther , and you too , Ada , for I do n't know that even your little purse is safe from his inexperience -- I must have a promise all round that nothing of this sort shall ever be done any more .
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 3]: No advances !
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 5]: Not even sixpences . ''
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 29]: We all promised faithfully , Richard with a merry glance at me touching his pocket as if to remind me that there was no danger of OUR transgressing .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 41]: `` As to Skimpole , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` a habitable doll 's house with good board and a few tin people to get into debt with and borrow money of would set the boy up in life .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 29]: He is in a child 's sleep by this time , I suppose ; it 's time I should take my craftier head to my more worldly pillow .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 6]: Good night , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 5]: God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 23]: He peeped in again , with a smiling face , before we had lighted our candles , and said , `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 8]: I have been looking at the weather-cock .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 11]: I find it was a false alarm about the wind .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 7]: It 's in the south ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 7]: And went away singing to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 57]: Ada and I agreed , as we talked together for a little while upstairs , that this caprice about the wind was a fiction and that he used the pretence to account for any disappointment he could not conceal , rather than he would blame the real cause of it or disparage or depreciate any one .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 50]: We thought this very characteristic of his eccentric gentleness and of the difference between him and those petulant people who make the weather and the winds -LRB- particularly that unlucky wind which he had chosen for such a different purpose -RRB- the stalking-horses of their splenetic and gloomy humours .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 31]: Indeed , so much affection for him had been added in this one evening to my gratitude that I hoped I already began to understand him through that mingled feeling .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 28]: Any seeming inconsistencies in Mr. Skimpole or in Mrs. Jellyby I could not expect to be able to reconcile , having so little experience or practical knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 31]: Neither did I try , for my thoughts were busy when I was alone , with Ada and Richard and with the confidence I had seemed to receive concerning them .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 35]: My fancy , made a little wild by the wind perhaps , would not consent to be all unselfish , either , though I would have persuaded it to be so if I could .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 59]: It wandered back to my godmother 's house and came along the intervening track , raising up shadowy speculations which had sometimes trembled there in the dark as to what knowledge Mr. Jarndyce had of my earliest history -- even as to the possibility of his being my father , though that idle dream was quite gone now .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 15]: It was all gone now , I remembered , getting up from the fire .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 22]: It was not for me to muse over bygones , but to act with a cheerful spirit and a grateful heart .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 13]: So I said to myself , `` Esther , Esther , Esther !
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 6]: Duty , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 24]: and gave my little basket of housekeeping keys such a shake that they sounded like little bells and rang me hopefully to bed .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 28]: Chapter VII -- The Ghost 's Walk While Esther sleeps , and while Esther wakes , it is still wet weather down at the place in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 27]: The rain is ever falling -- drip , drip , drip -- by day and night upon the broad flagged terrace-pavement , the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 22]: The weather is so very bad down in Lincolnshire that the liveliest imagination can scarcely apprehend its ever being fine again .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 61]: Not that there is any superabundant life of imagination on the spot , for Sir Leicester is not here -LRB- and , truly , even if he were , would not do much for it in that particular -RRB- , but is in Paris with my Lady ; and solitude , with dusky wings , sits brooding upon Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 15]: There may be some motions of fancy among the lower animals at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 78]: The horses in the stables -- the long stables in a barren , red-brick court-yard , where there is a great bell in a turret , and a clock with a large face , which the pigeons who live near it and who love to perch upon its shoulders seem to be always consulting -- THEY may contemplate some mental pictures of fine weather on occasions , and may be better artists at them than the grooms .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 69]: The old roan , so famous for cross-country work , turning his large eyeball to the grated window near his rack , may remember the fresh leaves that glisten there at other times and the scents that stream in , and may have a fine run with the hounds , while the human helper , clearing out the next stall , never stirs beyond his pitchfork and birch-broom .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 48]: The grey , whose place is opposite the door and who with an impatient rattle of his halter pricks his ears and turns his head so wistfully when it is opened , and to whom the opener says , '' ` Woa grey , then , steady !
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 6]: Noabody wants you to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 10]: may know it quite as well as the man .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 60]: The whole seemingly monotonous and uncompanionable half-dozen , stabled together , may pass the long wet hours when the door is shut in livelier communication than is held in the servants ' hall or at the Dedlock Arms , or may even beguile the time by improving -LRB- perhaps corrupting -RRB- the pony in the loose-box in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 81]: So the mastiff , dozing in his kennel in the court-yard with his large head on his paws , may think of the hot sunshine when the shadows of the stable-buildings tire his patience out by changing and leave him at one time of the day no broader refuge than the shadow of his own house , where he sits on end , panting and growling short , and very much wanting something to worry besides himself and his chain .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 53]: So now , half-waking and all-winking , he may recall the house full of company , the coach-houses full of vehicles , the stables fall of horses , and the out-buildings full of attendants upon horses , until he is undecided about the present and comes forth to see how it is .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 23]: Then , with that impatient shake of himself , he may growl in the spirit , `` Rain , rain , rain !
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 10]: Nothing but rain -- and no family here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 13]: as he goes in again and lies down with a gloomy yawn .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 48]: So with the dogs in the kennel-buildings across the park , who have their resfless fits and whose doleful voices when the wind has been very obstinate have even made it known in the house itself -- upstairs , downstairs , and in my Lady 's chamber .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 16]: They may hunt the whole country-side , while the raindrops are pattering round their inactivity .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 49]: So the rabbits with their self-betraying tails , frisking in and out of holes at roots of trees , may be lively with ideas of the breezy days when their ears are blown about or of those seasons of interest when there are sweet young plants to gnaw .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 46]: The turkey in the poultry-yard , always troubled with a class-grievance -LRB- probably Christmas -RRB- , may be reminiscent of that summer morning wrongfully taken from him when he got into the lane among the felled trees , where there was a barn and barley .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 42]: The discontented goose , who stoops to pass under the old gateway , twenty feet high , may gabble out , if we only knew it , a waddling preference for weather when the gateway casts its shadow on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 17]: Be this as it may , there is not much fancy otherwise stirring at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 35]: If there be a little at any odd moment , it goes , like a little noise in that old echoing place , a long way and usually leads off to ghosts and mystery .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 45]: It has rained so hard and rained so long down in Lincolnshire that Mrs. Rouncewell , the old housekeeper at Chesney Wold , has several times taken off her spectacles and cleaned them to make certain that the drops were not upon the glasses .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 27]: Mrs. Rouncewell might have been sufficiently assured by hearing the rain , but that she is rather deaf , which nothing will induce her to believe .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 53]: She is a fine old lady , handsome , stately , wonderfully neat , and has such a back and such a stomacher that if her stays should turn out when she dies to have been a broad old-fashioned family fire-grate , nobody who knows her would have cause to be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 6]: Weather affects Mrs. Rouncewell little .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 25]: The house is there in all weathers , and the house , as she expresses it , `` is what she looks at . ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 63]: She sits in her room -LRB- in a side passage on the ground floor , with an arched window commanding a smooth quadrangle , adorned at regular intervals with smooth round trees and smooth round blocks of stone , as if the trees were going to play at bowls with the stones -RRB- , and the whole house reposes on her mind .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 34]: She can open it on occasion and be busy and fluttered , but it is shut up now and lies on the breadth of Mrs. Rouncewell 's iron-bound bosom in a majestic sleep .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 26]: It is the next difficult thing to an impossibility to imagine Chesney Wold without Mrs. Rouncewell , but she has only been here fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 37]: Ask her how long , this rainy day , and she shall answer `` fifty year , three months , and a fortnight , by the blessing of heaven , if I live till Tuesday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 42]: Mr. Rouncewell died some time before the decease of the pretty fashion of pig-tails , and modestly hid his own -LRB- if he took it with him -RRB- in a corner of the churchyard in the park near the mouldy porch .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 14]: He was born in the market-town , and so was his young widow .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 20]: Her progress in the family began in the time of the last Sir Leicester and originated in the still-room .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 11]: The present representative of the Dedlocks is an excellent master .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 34]: He supposes all his dependents to be utterly bereft of individual characters , intentions , or opinions , and is persuaded that he was born to supersede the necessity of their having any .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 31]: If he were to make a discovery to the contrary , he would be simply stunned -- would never recover himself , most likely , except to gasp and die .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 19]: But he is an excellent master still , holding it a part of his state to be so .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 20]: He has a great liking for Mrs. Rouncewell ; he says she is a most respectable , creditable woman .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 71]: He always shakes hands with her when he comes down to Chesney Wold and when he goes away ; and if he were very ill , or if he were knocked down by accident , or run over , or placed in any situation expressive of a Dedlock at a disadvantage , he would say if he could speak , `` Leave me , and send Mrs. Rouncewell here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 17]: feeling his dignity , at such a pass , safer with her than with anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 6]: Mrs. Rouncewell has known trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 24]: She has had two sons , of whom the younger ran wild , and went for a soldier , and never came back .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 57]: Even to this hour , Mrs. Rouncewell 's calm hands lose their composure when she speaks of him , and unfolding themselves from her stomacher , hover about her in an agitated manner as she says what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay , good-humoured , clever lad he was !
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 87]: Her second son would have been provided for at Chesney Wold and would have been made steward in due season , but he took , when he was a schoolboy , to constructing steam-engines out of saucepans and setting birds to draw their own water with the least possible amount of labour , so assisting them with artful contrivance of hydraulic pressure that a thirsty canary had only , in a literal sense , to put his shoulder to the wheel and the job was done .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 8]: This propensity gave Mrs. Rouncewell great uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 45]: She felt it with a mother 's anguish to be a move in the Wat Tyler direction , well knowing that Sir Leicester had that general impression of an aptitude for any art to which smoke and a tall chimney might be considered essential .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 54]: But the doomed young rebel -LRB- otherwise a mild youth , and very persevering -RRB- , showing no sign of grace as he got older but , on the contrary , constructing a model of a power-loom , she was fain , with many tears , to mention his backslidings to the baronet .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 28]: `` Mrs. Rouncewell , '' said Sir Leicester , `` I can never consent to argue , as you know , with any one on any subject .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 18]: You had better get rid of your boy ; you had better get him into some Works .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 21]: The iron country farther north is , I suppose , the congenial direction for a boy with these tendencies . ''
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 82]: Farther north he went , and farther north he grew up ; and if Sir Leicester Dedlock ever saw him when he came to Chesney Wold to visit his mother , or ever thought of him afterwards , it is certain that he only regarded him as one of a body of some odd thousand conspirators , swarthy and grim , who were in the habit of turning out by torchlight two or three nights in the week for unlawful purposes .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 88]: Nevertheless , Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has , in the course of nature and art , grown up , and established himself , and married , and called unto him Mrs. Rouncewell 's grandson , who , being out of his apprenticeship , and home from a journey in far countries , whither he was sent to enlarge his knowledge and complete his preparations for the venture of this life , stands leaning against the chimney-piece this very day in Mrs. Rouncewell 's room at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 16]: `` And , again and again , I am glad to see you , Watt !
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 15]: And , once again , I am glad to see you , Watt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 4]: says Mrs. Rouncewell .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 8]: `` You are a fine young fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 8]: You are like your poor uncle George .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 13]: Mrs. Rouncewell 's hands unquiet , as usual , on this reference .
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 12]: `` They say I am like my father , grandmother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 17]: `` Like him , also , my dear -- but most like your poor uncle George !
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 6]: And your dear father . ''
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 7]: Mrs. Rouncewell folds her hands again .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 6]: `` He is well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 10]: `` Thriving , grandmother , in every way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 6]: `` I am thankful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 32]: Mrs. Rouncewell is fond of her son but has a plaintive feeling towards him , much as if he were a very honourable soldier who had gone over to the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 7]: `` He is quite happy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 3]: says she .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 4]: `` Quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 5]: `` I am thankful !
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 22]: So he has brought you up to follow in his ways and has sent you into foreign countries and the like ?
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 6]: Well , he knows best .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 14]: There may be a world beyond Chesney Wold that I do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 8]: Though I am not young , either .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: And I have seen a quantity of good company too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 28]: `` Grandmother , '' says the young man , changing the subject , `` what a very pretty girl that was I found with you just now .
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 6]: You called her Rosa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 5]: `` Yes , child .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 10]: She is daughter of a widow in the village .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 18]: Maids are so hard to teach , now-a-days , that I have put her about me young .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 10]: She 's an apt scholar and will do well .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 9]: She shows the house already , very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 10]: She lives with me at my table here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 11]: `` I hope I have not driven her away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 15]: `` She supposes we have family affairs to speak about , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 5]: She is very modest .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 10]: It is a fine quality in a young woman .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 23]: And scarcer , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell , expanding her stomacher to its utmost limits , `` than it formerly was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 14]: The young man inclines his head in acknowledgment of the precepts of experience .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 4]: Mrs. Rouncewell listens .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 4]: `` Wheels ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 3]: says she .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 13]: They have long been audible to the younger ears of her companion .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 15]: `` What wheels on such a day as this , for gracious sake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 11]: After a short interval , a tap at the door .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 5]: `` Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 42]: A dark-eyed , dark-haired , shy , village beauty comes in -- so fresh in her rosy and yet delicate bloom that the drops of rain which have beaten on her hair look like the dew upon a flower fresh gathered .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 9]: `` What company is this , Rosa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 4]: says Mrs. Rouncewell .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 32]: `` It 's two young men in a gig , ma'am , who want to see the house -- yes , and if you please , I told them so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 12]: in quick reply to a gesture of dissent from the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 44]: `` I went to the hall-door and told them it was the wrong day and the wrong hour , but the young man who was driving took off his hat in the wet and begged me to bring this card to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 13]: `` Read it , my dear Watt , '' says the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 28]: Rosa is so shy as she gives it to him that they drop it between them and almost knock their foreheads together as they pick it up .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 6]: Rosa is shyer than before .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 12]: `` Mr. Guppy '' is all the information the card yields .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 4]: `` Guppy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 8]: repeats Mrs. Rouncewell , `` MR. Guppy !
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 9]: Nonsense , I never heard of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 11]: `` If you please , he told ME that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 3]: says Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 78]: `` But he said that he and the other young gentleman came from London only last night by the mail , on business at the magistrates ' meeting , ten miles off , this morning , and that as their business was soon over , and they had heard a great deal said of Chesney Wold , and really did n't know what to do with themselves , they had come through the wet to see it .
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 4]: They are lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 28]: He says he is not in Mr. Tulkinghorn 's office , but he is sure he may make use of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's name if necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 23]: Finding , now she leaves off , that she has been making quite a long speech , Rosa is shyer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 30]: Now , Mr. Tulkinghorn is , in a manner , part and parcel of the place , and besides , is supposed to have made Mrs. Rouncewell 's will .
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 20]: The old lady relaxes , consents to the admission of the visitors as a favour , and dismisses Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 23]: The grandson , however , being smitten by a sudden wish to see the house himself , proposes to join the party .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 30]: The grandmother , who is pleased that he should have that interest , accompanies him -- though to do him justice , he is exceedingly unwilling to trouble her .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 9]: `` Much obliged to you , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 14]: says Mr. Guppy , divesting himself of his wet dreadnought in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 29]: `` Us London lawyers do n't often get an out , and when we do , we like to make the most of it , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 19]: The old housekeeper , with a gracious severity of deportment , waves her hand towards the great staircase .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 26]: Mr. Guppy and his friend follow Rosa ; Mrs. Rouncewell and her grandson follow them ; a young gardener goes before to open the shutters .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 26]: As is usually the case with people who go over houses , Mr. Guppy and his friend are dead beat before they have well begun .
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 39]: They straggle about in wrong places , look at wrong things , do n't care for the right things , gape when more rooms are opened , exhibit profound depression of spirits , and are clearly knocked up .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 39]: In each successive chamber that they enter , Mrs. Rouncewell , who is as upright as the house itself , rests apart in a window-seat or other such nook and listens with stately approval to Rosa 's exposition .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 17]: Her grandson is so attentive to it that Rosa is shyer than ever -- and prettier .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 39]: Thus they pass on from room to room , raising the pictured Dedlocks for a few brief minutes as the young gardener admits the light , and reconsigning them to their graves as he shuts it out again .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 40]: It appears to the afflicted Mr. Guppy and his inconsolable friend that there is no end to the Dedlocks , whose family greatness seems to consist in their never having done anything to distinguish themselves for seven hundred years .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 15]: Even the long drawing-room of Chesney Wold can not revive Mr. Guppy 's spirits .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 19]: He is so low that he droops on the threshold and has hardly strength of mind to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 23]: But a portrait over the chimney-piece , painted by the fashionable artist of the day , acts upon him like a charm .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 6]: He recovers in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 18]: He stares at it with uncommon interest ; he seems to be fixed and fascinated by it .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 6]: `` Who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 21]: `` The picture over the fire-place , '' says Rosa , `` is the portrait of the present Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 17]: It is considered a perfect likeness , and the best work of the master . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 27]: ` Blest , '' says Mr. Guppy , staring in a kind of dismay at his friend , `` if I can ever have seen her .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 5]: Yet I know her !
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: Has the picture been engraved , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 8]: `` The picture has never been engraved .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 8]: Sir Leicester has always refused permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 8]: says Mr. Guppy in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 18]: `` I 'll be shot if it ai n't very curious how well I know that picture !
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 10]: So that 's Lady Dedlock , is it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 13]: `` The picture on the right is the present Sir Leicester Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 15]: The picture on the left is his father , the late Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 11]: Mr. Guppy has no eyes for either of these magnates .
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 25]: `` It 's unaccountable to me , '' he says , still staring at the portrait , `` how well I know that picture !
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 32]: I 'm dashed , '' adds Mr. Guppy , looking round , `` if I do n't think I must have had a dream of that picture , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 20]: As no one present takes any especial interest in Mr. Guppy 's dreams , the probability is not pursued .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 67]: But he still remains so absorbed by the portrait that he stands immovable before it until the young gardener has closed the shutters , when he comes out of the room in a dazed state that is an odd though a sufficient substitute for interest and follows into the succeeding rooms with a confused stare , as if he were looking everywhere for Lady Dedlock again .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 7]: He sees no more of her .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 42]: He sees her rooms , which are the last shown , as being very elegant , and he looks out of the windows from which she looked out , not long ago , upon the weather that bored her to death .
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 26]: All things have an end , even houses that people take infinite pains to see and are tired of before they begin to see them .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 35]: He has come to the end of the sight , and the fresh village beauty to the end of her description ; which is always this : `` The terrace below is much admired .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 18]: It is called , from an old story in the family , the Ghost 's Walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 7]: says Mr. Guppy , greedily curious .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 8]: `` What 's the story , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 8]: Is it anything about a picture ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 15]: `` Pray tell us the story , '' says Watt in a half whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 10]: `` I do n't know it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 6]: Rosa is shyer than ever .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 20]: `` It is not related to visitors ; it is almost forgotten , '' says the housekeeper , advancing .
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 12]: `` It has never been more than a family anecdote . ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 52]: `` You 'll excuse my asking again if it has anything to do with a picture , ma'am , '' observes Mr. Guppy , `` because I do assure you that the more I think of that picture the better I know it , without knowing how I know it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 16]: The story has nothing to do with a picture ; the housekeeper can guarantee that .
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 17]: Mr. Guppy is obliged to her for the information and is , moreover , generally obliged .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 23]: He retires with his friend , guided down another staircase by the young gardener , and presently is heard to drive away .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 5]: It is now dusk .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 26]: Mrs. Rouncewell can trust to the discretion of her two young hearers and may tell THEM how the terrace came to have that ghostly name .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 61]: She seats herself in a large chair by the fast-darkening window and tells them : `` In the wicked days , my dears , of King Charles the First -- I mean , of course , in the wicked days of the rebels who leagued themselves against that excellent king -- Sir Morbury Dedlock was the owner of Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 20]: Whether there was any account of a ghost in the family before those days , I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 9]: I should think it very likely indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 23]: Mrs. Rouncewell holds this opinion because she considers that a family of such antiquity and importance has a right to a ghost .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 26]: She regards a ghost as one of the privileges of the upper classes , a genteel distinction to which the common people have no claim .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 28]: `` Sir Morbury Dedlock , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell , `` was , I have no occasion to say , on the side of the blessed martyr .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 24]: But it IS supposed that his Lady , who had none of the family blood in her veins , favoured the bad cause .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 28]: It is said that she had relations among King Charles 's enemies , that she was in correspondence with them , and that she gave them information .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 34]: When any of the country gentlemen who followed his Majesty 's cause met here , it is said that my Lady was always nearer to the door of their council-room than they supposed .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 16]: Do you hear a sound like a footstep passing along the terrace , Watt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 7]: Rosa draws nearer to the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 37]: `` I hear the rain-drip on the stones , '' replies the young man , `` and I hear a curious echo -- I suppose an echo -- which is very like a halting step . ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 33]: The housekeeper gravely nods and continues : `` Partly on account of this division between them , and partly on other accounts , Sir Morbury and his Lady led a troubled life .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 9]: She was a lady of a haughty temper .
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 23]: They were not well suited to each other in age or character , and they had no children to moderate between them .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 40]: After her favourite brother , a young gentleman , was killed in the civil wars -LRB- by Sir Morbury 's near kinsman -RRB- , her feeling was so violent that she hated the race into which she had married .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 72]: When the Dedlocks were about to ride out from Chesney Wold in the king 's cause , she is supposed to have more than once stolen down into the stables in the dead of night and lamed their horses ; and the story is that once at such an hour , her husband saw her gliding down the stairs and followed her into the stall where his own favourite horse stood .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 42]: There he seized her by the wrist , and in a struggle or in a fall or through the horse being frightened and lashing out , she was lamed in the hip and from that hour began to pine away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 14]: The housekeeper has dropped her voice to a little more than a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 15]: `` She had been a lady of a handsome figure and a noble carriage .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 67]: She never complained of the change ; she never spoke to any one of being crippled or of being in pain , but day by day she tried to walk upon the terrace , and with the help of the stone balustrade , went up and down , up and down , up and down , in sun and shadow , with greater difficulty every day .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 40]: At last , one afternoon her husband -LRB- to whom she had never , on any persuasion , opened her lips since that night -RRB- , standing at the great south window , saw her drop upon the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 37]: He hastened down to raise her , but she repulsed him as he bent over her , and looking at him fixedly and coldly , said , ' I will die here where I have walked .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 13]: And I will walk here , though I am in my grave .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 13]: I will walk here until the pride of this house is humbled .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 20]: And when calamity or when disgrace is coming to it , let the Dedlocks listen for my step ! '
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 5]: Watt looks at Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 17]: Rosa in the deepening gloom looks down upon the ground , half frightened and half shy .
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 7]: `` There and then she died .
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 22]: And from those days , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell , `` the name has come down -- the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 28]: If the tread is an echo , it is an echo that is only heard after dark , and is often unheard for a long while together .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 29]: But it comes back from time to time ; and so sure as there is sickness or death in the family , it will be heard then . ''
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 10]: `` And disgrace , grandmother -- '' says Watt .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 13]: `` Disgrace never comes to Chesney Wold , '' returns the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 7]: Her grandson apologizes with `` True .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 3]: True . ''
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 6]: `` That is the story .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 38]: Whatever the sound is , it is a worrying sound , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell , getting up from her chair ; `` and what is to be noticed in it is that it MUST BE HEARD .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 21]: My Lady , who is afraid of nothing , admits that when it is there , it must be heard .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 7]: You can not shut it out .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 33]: Watt , there is a tall French clock behind you -LRB- placed there , ' a purpose -RRB- that has a loud beat when it is in motion and can play music .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 9]: You understand how those things are managed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 10]: `` Pretty well , grandmother , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 6]: `` Set it a-going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 9]: Watt sets it a-going -- music and all .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 11]: `` Now , come hither , '' says the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 11]: `` Hither , child , towards my Lady 's pillow .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 14]: I am not sure that it is dark enough yet , but listen !
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 21]: Can you hear the sound upon the terrace , through the music , and the beat , and everything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 6]: `` I certainly can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 7]: `` So my Lady says . ''
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 60]: Chapter VIII -- Covering a Multitude of Sins It was interesting when I dressed before daylight to peep out of window , where my candles were reflected in the black panes like two beacons , and finding all beyond still enshrouded in the indistinctness of last night , to watch how it turned out when the day came on .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 45]: As the prospect gradually revealed itself and disclosed the scene over which the wind had wandered in the dark , like my memory over my life , I had a pleasure in discovering the unknown objects that had been around me in my sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 19]: At first they were faintly discernible in the mist , and above them the later stars still glimmered .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 32]: That pale interval over , the picture began to enlarge and fill up so fast that at every new peep I could have found enough to look at for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 62]: Imperceptibly my candles became the only incongruous part of the morning , the dark places in my room all melted away , and the day shone bright upon a cheerful landscape , prominent in which the old Abbey Church , with its massive tower , threw a softer train of shadow on the view than seemed compatible with its rugged character .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 20]: But so from rough outsides -LRB- I hope I have learnt -RRB- , serene and gentle influences often proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 114]: Every part of the house was in such order , and every one was so attentive to me , that I had no trouble with my two bunches of keys , though what with trying to remember the contents of each little store-room drawer and cupboard ; and what with making notes on a slate about jams , and pickles , and preserves , and bottles , and glass , and china , and a great many other things ; and what with being generally a methodical , old-maidish sort of foolish little person , I was so busy that I could not believe it was breakfast-time when I heard the bell ring .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 56]: Away I ran , however , and made tea , as I had already been installed into the responsibility of the tea-pot ; and then , as they were all rather late and nobody was down yet , I thought I would take a peep at the garden and get some knowledge of that too .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 86]: I found it quite a delightful place -- in front , the pretty avenue and drive by which we had approached -LRB- and where , by the by , we had cut up the gravel so terribly with our wheels that I asked the gardener to roll it -RRB- ; at the back , the flower-garden , with my darling at her window up there , throwing it open to smile out at me , as if she would have kissed me from that distance .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 26]: Beyond the flower-garden was a kitchen-garden , and then a paddock , and then a snug little rick-yard , and then a dear little farm-yard .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 95]: As to the house itself , with its three peaks in the roof ; its various-shaped windows , some so large , some so small , and all so pretty ; its trellis-work , against the southfront for roses and honey-suckle , and its homely , comfortable , welcoming look -- it was , as Ada said when she came out to meet me with her arm through that of its master , worthy of her cousin John , a bold thing to say , though he only pinched her dear cheek for it .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 13]: Mr. Skimpole was as agreeable at breakfast as he had been overnight .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 17]: There was honey on the table , and it led him into a discourse about bees .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 36]: He had no objection to honey , he said -LRB- and I should think he had not , for he seemed to like it -RRB- , but he protested against the overweening assumptions of bees .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 39]: He did n't at all see why the busy bee should be proposed as a model to him ; he supposed the bee liked to make honey , or he would n't do it -- nobody asked him .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 16]: It was not necessary for the bee to make such a merit of his tastes .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 46]: If every confectioner went buzzing about the world banging against everything that came in his way and egotistically calling upon everybody to take notice that he was going to his work and must not be interrupted , the world would be quite an unsupportable place .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 27]: Then , after all , it was a ridiculous position to be smoked out of your fortune with brimstone as soon as you had made it .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 20]: You would have a very mean opinion of a Manchester man if he spun cotton for no other purpose .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 16]: He must say he thought a drone the embodiment of a pleasanter and wiser idea .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 20]: The drone said unaffectedly , `` You will excuse me ; I really can not attend to the shop !
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 51]: I find myself in a world in which there is so much to see and so short a time to see it in that I must take the liberty of looking about me and begging to be provided for by somebody who does n't want to look about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 68]: This appeared to Mr. Skimpole to be the drone philosophy , and he thought it a very good philosophy , always supposing the drone to be willing to be on good terms with the bee , which , so far as he knew , the easy fellow always was , if the consequential creature would only let him , and not be so conceited about his honey !
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 40]: He pursued this fancy with the lightest foot over a variety of ground and made us all merry , though again he seemed to have as serious a meaning in what he said as he was capable of having .
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 17]: I left them still listening to him when I withdrew to attend to my new duties .
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 68]: They had occupied me for some time , and I was passing through the passages on my return with my basket of keys on my arm when Mr. Jarndyce called me into a small room next his bed-chamber , which I found to be in part a little library of books and papers and in part quite a little museum of his boots and shoes and hat-boxes .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 12]: `` Sit down , my dear , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 11]: `` This , you must know , is the growlery .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 14]: When I am out of humour , I come and growl here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 23]: `` You must be here very seldom , sir , '' said I. `` Oh , you do n't know me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 22]: `` When I am deceived or disappointed in -- the wind , and it 's easterly , I take refuge here .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 10]: The growlery is the best-used room in the house .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 10]: You are not aware of half my humours yet .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 9]: My dear , how you are trembling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 45]: I could not help it ; I tried very hard , but being alone with that benevolent presence , and meeting his kind eyes , and feeling so happy and so honoured there , and my heart so full -- I kissed his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 14]: I do n't know what I said , or even that I spoke .
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 39]: He was disconcerted and walked to the window ; I almost believed with an intention of jumping out , until he turned and I was reassured by seeing in his eyes what he had gone there to hide .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 13]: He gently patted me on the head , and I sat down .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 5]: `` That 's over .
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 2]: Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 6]: Do n't be foolish . ''
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 26]: `` It shall not happen again , sir , '' I returned , `` but at first it is difficult -- '' `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 7]: `` It 's easy , easy .
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 24]: I hear of a good little orphan girl without a protector , and I take it into my head to be that protector .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 21]: She grows up , and more than justifies my good opinion , and I remain her guardian and her friend .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 7]: What is there in all this ?
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 4]: So , so !
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 24]: Now , we have cleared off old scores , and I have before me thy pleasant , trusting , trusty face again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 15]: I said to myself , `` Esther , my dear , you surprise me !
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 11]: This really is not what I expected of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 20]: And it had such a good effect that I folded my hands upon my basket and quite recovered myself .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 39]: Mr. Jarndyce , expressing his approval in his face , began to talk to me as confidentially as if I had been in the habit of conversing with him every morning for I do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 8]: I almost felt as if I had .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 20]: `` Of course , Esther , '' he said , `` you do n't understand this Chancery business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 8]: And of course I shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 12]: `` I do n't know who does , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 29]: `` The lawyers have twisted it into such a state of bedevilment that the original merits of the case have long disappeared from the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 17]: It 's about a will and the trusts under a will -- or it was once .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 8]: It 's about nothing but costs now .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 58]: We are always appearing , and disappearing , and swearing , and interrogating , and filing , and cross-filing , and arguing , and sealing , and motioning , and referring , and reporting , and revolving about the Lord Chancellor and all his satellites , and equitably waltzing ourselves off to dusty death , about costs .
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 6]: That 's the great question .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 14]: All the rest , by some extraordinary means , has melted away . ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 30]: `` But it was , sir , '' said I , to bring him back , for he began to rub his head , `` about a will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 20]: `` Why , yes , it was about a will when it was about anything , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 21]: `` A certain Jarndyce , in an evil hour , made a great fortune , and made a great will .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 65]: In the question how the trusts under that will are to be administered , the fortune left by the will is squandered away ; the legatees under the will are reduced to such a miserable condition that they would be sufficiently punished if they had committed an enormous crime in having money left them , and the will itself is made a dead letter .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 122]: All through the deplorable cause , everything that everybody in it , except one man , knows already is referred to that only one man who do n't know it to find out -- all through the deplorable cause , everybody must have copies , over and over again , of everything that has accumulated about it in the way of cartloads of papers -LRB- or must pay for them without having them , which is the usual course , for nobody wants them -RRB- and must go down the middle and up again through such an infernal country-dance of costs and fees and nonsense and corruption as was never dreamed of in the wildest visions of a witch 's Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 79]: Equity sends questions to law , law sends questions back to equity ; law finds it ca n't do this , equity finds it ca n't do that ; neither can so much as say it ca n't do anything , without this solicitor instructing and this counsel appearing for A , and that solicitor instructing and that counsel appearing for B ; and so on through the whole alphabet , like the history of the apple pie .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 29]: And thus , through years and years , and lives and lives , everything goes on , constantly beginning over and over again , and nothing ever ends .
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 35]: And we ca n't get out of the suit on any terms , for we are made parties to it , and MUST BE parties to it , whether we like it or not .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 10]: But it wo n't do to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 24]: When my great uncle , poor Tom Jarndyce , began to think of it , it was the beginning of the end ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 14]: `` The Mr. Jarndyce , sir , whose story I have heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 4]: He nodded gravely .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 14]: `` I was his heir , and this was his house , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 10]: When I came here , it was bleak indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 12]: He had left the signs of his misery upon it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 9]: `` How changed it must be now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 13]: `` It had been called , before his time , the Peaks .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 42]: He gave it its present name and lived here shut up , day and night poring over the wicked heaps of papers in the suit and hoping against hope to disentangle it from its mystification and bring it to a close .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 35]: In the meantime , the place became dilapidated , the wind whistled through the cracked walls , the rain fell through the broken roof , the weeds choked the passage to the rotting door .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 33]: When I brought what remained of him home here , the brains seemed to me to have been blown out of the house too , it was so shattered and ruined . ''
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 38]: He walked a little to and fro after saying this to himself with a shudder , and then looked at me , and brightened , and came and sat down again with his hands in his pockets .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 12]: `` I told you this was the growlery , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 5]: Where was I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 15]: I reminded him , at the hopeful change he had made in Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 6]: `` Bleak House ; true .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 80]: There is , in that city of London there , some property of ours which is much at this day what Bleak House was then ; I say property of ours , meaning of the suit 's , but I ought to call it the property of costs , for costs is the only power on earth that will ever get anything out of it now or will ever know it for anything but an eyesore and a heartsore .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 87]: It is a street of perishing blind houses , with their eyes stoned out , without a pane of glass , without so much as a window-frame , with the bare blank shutters tumbling from their hinges and falling asunder , the iron rails peeling away in flakes of rust , the chimneys sinking in , the stone steps to every door -LRB- and every door might be death 's door -RRB- turning stagnant green , the very crutches on which the ruins are propped decaying .
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 21]: Although Bleak House was not in Chancery , its master was , and it was stamped with the same seal .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 21]: These are the Great Seal 's impressions , my dear , all over England -- the children know them ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 7]: `` How changed it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 4]: I said again .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 33]: `` Why , so it is , '' he answered much more cheerfully ; `` and it is wisdom in you to keep me to the bright side of the picture . ''
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 8]: -LRB- The idea of my wisdom ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 19]: `` These are things I never talk about or even think about , excepting in the growlery here .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 23]: If you consider it right to mention them to Rick and Ada , '' looking seriously at me , `` you can .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 10]: I leave it to your discretion , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 23]: `` I hope , sir -- '' said I. `` I think you had better call me guardian , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 25]: I felt that I was choking again -- I taxed myself with it , `` Esther , now , you know you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 21]: -- when he feigned to say this slightly , as if it were a whim instead of a thoughtful tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 37]: But I gave the housekeeping keys the least shake in the world as a reminder to myself , and folding my hands in a still more determined manner on the basket , looked at him quietly .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 22]: `` I hope , guardian , '' said I , `` that you may not trust too much to my discretion .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 8]: I hope you may not mistake me .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 43]: I am afraid it will be a disappointment to you to know that I am not clever , but it really is the truth , and you would soon find it out if I had not the honesty to confess it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 12]: He did not seem at all disappointed ; quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 29]: He told me , with a smile all over his face , that he knew me very well indeed and that I was quite clever enough for him .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 25]: `` I hope I may turn out so , '' said I , `` but I am much afraid of it , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 54]: `` You are clever enough to be the good little woman of our lives here , my dear , '' he returned playfully ; `` the little old woman of the child 's -LRB- I do n't mean Skimpole 's -RRB- rhyme : ` Little old woman , and whither so high ? '
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 11]: ` To sweep the cobwebs out of the sky . '
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 38]: You will sweep them so neatly out of OUR sky in the course of your housekeeping , Esther , that one of these days we shall have to abandon the growlery and nail up the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 49]: This was the beginning of my being called Old Woman , and Little Old Woman , and Cobweb , and Mrs. Shipton , and Mother Hubbard , and Dame Durden , and so many names of that sort that my own name soon became quite lost among them .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 15]: `` However , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` to return to our gossip .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 12]: Here 's Rick , a fine young fellow full of promise .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 9]: What 's to be done with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 16]: Oh , my goodness , the idea of asking my advice on such a point !
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 25]: `` Here he is , Esther , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , comfortably putting his hands into his pockets and stretching out his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 15]: `` He must have a profession ; he must make some choice for himself .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 20]: There will be a world more wiglomeration about it , I suppose , but it must be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 7]: `` More what , guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 10]: said I. `` More wiglomeration , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 12]: `` It 's the only name I know for the thing .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 10]: He is a ward in Chancery , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 118]: Kenge and Carboy will have something to say about it ; Master Somebody -- a sort of ridiculous sexton , digging graves for the merits of causes in a back room at the end of Quality Court , Chancery Lane -- will have something to say about it ; counsel will have something to say about it ; the Chancellor will have something to say about it ; the satellites will have something to say about it ; they will all have to be handsomely feed , all round , about it ; the whole thing will be vastly ceremonious , wordy , unsatisfactory , and expensive , and I call it , in general , wiglomeration .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 35]: How mankind ever came to be afflicted with wiglomeration , or for whose sins these young people ever fell into a pit of it , I do n't know ; so it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 16]: He began to rub his head again and to hint that he felt the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 62]: But it was a delightful instance of his kindness towards me that whether he rubbed his head , or walked about , or did both , his face was sure to recover its benignant expression as it looked at mine ; and he was sure to turn comfortable again and put his hands in his pockets and stretch out his legs .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 27]: `` Perhaps it would be best , first of all , '' said I , `` to ask Mr. Richard what he inclines to himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 8]: `` Exactly so , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 7]: `` That 's what I mean !
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 34]: You know , just accustom yourself to talk it over , with your tact and in your quiet way , with him and Ada , and see what you all make of it .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 19]: We are sure to come at the heart of the matter by your means , little woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 25]: I really was frightened at the thought of the importance I was attaining and the number of things that were being confided to me .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 18]: I had not meant this at all ; I had meant that he should speak to Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 40]: But of course I said nothing in reply except that I would do my best , though I feared -LRB- I realty felt it necessary to repeat this -RRB- that he thought me much more sagacious than I was .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 13]: At which my guardian only laughed the pleasantest laugh I ever heard .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 10]: he said , rising and pushing back his chair .
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 14]: `` I think we may have done with the growlery for one day !
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 5]: Only a concluding word .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 14]: Esther , my dear , do you wish to ask me anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 19]: He looked so attentively at me that I looked attentively at him and felt sure I understood him .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 7]: `` About myself , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 6]: said I. `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 29]: `` Guardian , '' said I , venturing to put my hand , which was suddenly colder than I could have wished , in his , `` nothing !
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 33]: I am quite sure that if there were anything I ought to know or had any need to know , I should not have to ask you to tell it to me .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 20]: If my whole reliance and confidence were not placed in you , I must have a hard heart indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 13]: I have nothing to ask you , nothing in the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 16]: He drew my hand through his arm and we went away to look for Ada .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 23]: From that hour I felt quite easy with him , quite unreserved , quite content to know no more , quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 34]: We lived , at first , rather a busy life at Bleak House , for we had to become acquainted with many residents in and out of the neighbourhood who knew Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 21]: It seemed to Ada and me that everybody knew him who wanted to do anything with anybody else 's money .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 54]: It amazed us when we began to sort his letters and to answer some of them for him in the growlery of a morning to find how the great object of the lives of nearly all his correspondents appeared to be to form themselves into committees for getting in and laying out money .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 19]: The ladies were as desperate as the gentlemen ; indeed , I think they were even more so .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 19]: They threw themselves into committees in the most impassioned manner and collected subscriptions with a vehemence quite extraordinary .
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 35]: It appeared to us that some of them must pass their whole lives in dealing out subscription-cards to the whole post-office directory -- shilling cards , half-crown cards , half-sovereign cards , penny cards .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 4]: They wanted everything .
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 45]: They wanted wearing apparel , they wanted linen rags , they wanted money , they wanted coals , they wanted soup , they wanted interest , they wanted autographs , they wanted flannel , they wanted whatever Mr. Jarndyce had -- or had not .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 9]: Their objects were as various as their demands .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 108]: They were going to raise new buildings , they were going to pay off debts on old buildings , they were going to establish in a picturesque building -LRB- engraving of proposed west elevation attached -RRB- the Sisterhood of Mediaeval Marys , they were going to give a testimonial to Mrs. Jellyby , they were going to have their secretary 's portrait painted and presented to his mother-in-law , whose deep devotion to him was well known , they were going to get up everything , I really believe , from five hundred thousand tracts to an annuity and from a marble monument to a silver tea-pot .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 7]: They took a multitude of titles .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 33]: They were the Women of England , the Daughters of Britain , the Sisters of all the cardinal virtues separately , the Females of America , the Ladies of a hundred denominations .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 11]: They appeared to be always excited about canvassing and electing .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 33]: They seemed to our poor wits , and according to their own accounts , to be constantly polling people by tens of thousands , yet never bringing their candidates in for anything .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 19]: It made our heads ache to think , on the whole , what feverish lives they must lead .
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 52]: Among the ladies who were most distinguished for this rapacious benevolence -LRB- if I may use the expression -RRB- was a Mrs. Pardiggle , who seemed , as I judged from the number of her letters to Mr. Jarndyce , to be almost as powerful a correspondent as Mrs. Jellyby herself .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 75]: We observed that the wind always changed when Mrs. Pardiggle became the subject of conversation and that it invariably interrupted Mr. Jarndyce and prevented his going any farther , when he had remarked that there were two classes of charitable people ; one , the people who did a little and made a great deal of noise ; the other , the people who did a great deal and made no noise at all .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 34]: We were therefore curious to see Mrs. Pardiggle , suspecting her to be a type of the former class , and were glad when she called one day with her five young sons .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 31]: She was a formidable style of lady with spectacles , a prominent nose , and a loud voice , who had the effect of wanting a great deal of room .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 22]: And she really did , for she knocked down little chairs with her skirts that were quite a great way off .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 34]: As only Ada and I were at home , we received her timidly , for she seemed to come in like cold weather and to make the little Pardiggles blue as they followed .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 24]: `` These , young ladies , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle with great volubility after the first salutations , `` are my five boys .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 27]: You may have seen their names in a printed subscription list -LRB- perhaps more than one -RRB- in the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 30]: Egbert , my eldest -LRB- twelve -RRB- , is the boy who sent out his pocket-money , to the amount of five and threepence , to the Tockahoopo Indians .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 26]: Oswald , my second -LRB- ten and a half -RRB- , is the child who contributed two and nine-pence to the Great National Smithers Testimonial .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 62]: Francis , my third -LRB- nine -RRB- , one and sixpence halfpenny ; Felix , my fourth -LRB- seven -RRB- , eightpence to the Superannuated Widows ; Alfred , my youngest -LRB- five -RRB- , has voluntarily enrolled himself in the Infant Bonds of Joy , and is pledged never , through life , to use tobacco in any form . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 8]: We had never seen such dissatisfied children .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 26]: It was not merely that they were weazened and shrivelled -- though they were certainly that to -- but they looked absolutely ferocious with discontent .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 34]: At the mention of the Tockahoopo Indians , I could really have supposed Eghert to be one of the most baleful members of that tribe , he gave me such a savage frown .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 30]: The face of each child , as the amount of his contribution was mentioned , darkened in a peculiarly vindictive manner , but his was by far the worst .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 23]: I must except , however , the little recruit into the Infant Bonds of Joy , who was stolidly and evenly miserable .
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 21]: `` You have been visiting , I understand , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle , `` at Mrs. Jellyby 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 11]: We said yes , we had passed one night there .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 85]: `` Mrs. Jellyby , '' pursued the lady , always speaking in the same demonstrative , loud , hard tone , so that her voice impressed my fancy as if it had a sort of spectacles on too -- and I may take the opportunity of remarking that her spectacles were made the less engaging by her eyes being what Ada called `` choking eyes , '' meaning very prominent -- `` Mrs. Jellyby is a benefactor to society and deserves a helping hand .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 44]: My boys have contributed to the African project -- Egbert , one and six , being the entire allowance of nine weeks ; Oswald , one and a penny halfpenny , being the same ; the rest , according to their little means .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 13]: Nevertheless , I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in all things .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 15]: I do not go with Mrs. Jellyby in her treatment of her young family .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 5]: It has been noticed .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 21]: It has been observed that her young family are excluded from participation in the objects to which she is devoted .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 26]: She may be right , she may be wrong ; but , right or wrong , this is not my course with MY young family .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 6]: I take them everywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 24]: I was afterwards convinced -LRB- and so was Ada -RRB- that from the ill-conditioned eldest child , these words extorted a sharp yell .
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 15]: He turned it off into a yawn , but it began as a yell .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 51]: `` They attend matins with me -LRB- very prettily done -RRB- at half-past six o'clock in the morning all the year round , including of course the depth of winter , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle rapidly , `` and they are with me during the revolving duties of the day .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 52]: I am a School lady , I am a Visiting lady , I am a Reading lady , I am a Distributing lady ; I am on the local Linen Box Committee and many general committees ; and my canvassing alone is very extensive -- perhaps no one 's more so .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 58]: But they are my companions everywhere ; and by these means they acquire that knowledge of the poor , and that capacity of doing charitable business in general -- in short , that taste for the sort of thing -- which will render them in after life a service to their neighbours and a satisfaction to themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 52]: My young family are not frivolous ; they expend the entire amount of their allowance in subscriptions , under my direction ; and they have attended as many public meetings and listened to as many lectures , orations , and discussions as generally fall to the lot of few grown people .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 51]: Alfred -LRB- five -RRB- , who , as I mentioned , has of his own election joined the Infant Bonds of Joy , was one of the very few children who manifested consciousness on that occasion after a fervid address of two hours from the chairman of the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 20]: Alfred glowered at us as if he never could , or would , forgive the injury of that night .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 58]: `` You may have observed , Miss Summerson , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle , `` in some of the lists to which I have referred , in the possession of our esteemed friend Mr. Jarndyce , that the names of my young family are concluded with the name of O. A. Pardiggle , F.R.S. , one pound .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 5]: That is their father .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 7]: We usually observe the same routine .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 33]: I put down my mite first ; then my young family enrol their contributions , according to their ages and their little means ; and then Mr. Pardiggle brings up the rear .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 36]: Mr. Pardiggle is happy to throw in his limited donation , under my direction ; and thus things are made not only pleasant to ourselves , but , we trust , improving to others . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 40]: Suppose Mr. Pardiggle were to dine with Mr. Jellyby , and suppose Mr. Jellyby were to relieve his mind after dinner to Mr. Pardiggle , would Mr. Pardiggle , in return , make any confidential communication to Mr. Jellyby ?
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 17]: I was quite confused to find myself thinking this , but it came into my head .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 9]: `` You are very pleasantly situated here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 4]: said Mrs. Pardiggle .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 35]: We were glad to change the subject , and going to the window , pointed out the beauties of the prospect , on which the spectacles appeared to me to rest with curious indifference .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 7]: `` You know Mr. Gusher ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 4]: said our visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: We were obliged to say that we had not the pleasure of Mr. Gusher 's acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 19]: `` The loss is yours , I assure you , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle with her commanding deportment .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 12]: `` He is a very fervid , impassioned speaker-full of fire !
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 41]: Stationed in a waggon on this lawn , now , which , from the shape of the land , is naturally adapted to a public meeting , he would improve almost any occasion you could mention for hours and hours !
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 55]: By this time , young ladies , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle , moving back to her chair and overturning , as if by invisible agency , a little round table at a considerable distance with my work-basket on it , `` by this time you have found me out , I dare say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 16]: This was really such a confusing question that Ada looked at me in perfect dismay .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 28]: As to the guilty nature of my own consciousness after what I had been thinking , it must have been expressed in the colour of my cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 20]: `` Found out , I mean , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle , `` the prominent point in my character .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 14]: I am aware that it is so prominent as to be discoverable immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 10]: I lay myself open to detection , I know .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 11]: I freely admit , I am a woman of business .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 10]: I love hard work ; I enjoy hard work .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 6]: The excitement does me good .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 19]: I am so accustomed and inured to hard work that I do n't know what fatigue is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 17]: We murmured that it was very astonishing and very gratifying , or something to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 19]: I do n't think we knew what it was either , but this is what our politeness expressed .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 22]: `` I do not understand what it is to be tired ; you can not tire me if you try ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 4]: said Mrs. Pardiggle .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 34]: `` The quantity of exertion -LRB- which is no exertion to me -RRB- , the amount of business -LRB- which I regard as nothing -RRB- , that I go through sometimes astonishes myself .
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 33]: I have seen my young family , and Mr. Pardiggle , quite worn out with witnessing it , when I may truly say I have been as fresh as a lark ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 24]: If that dark-visaged eldest boy could look more malicious than he had already looked , this was the time when he did it .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 27]: I observed that he doubled his right fist and delivered a secret blow into the crown of his cap , which was under his left arm .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 19]: `` This gives me a great advantage when I am making my rounds , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 49]: `` If I find a person unwilling to hear what I have to say , I tell that person directly , ' I am incapable of fatigue , my good friend , I am never tired , and I mean to go on until I have done . '
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 4]: It answers admirably !
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 24]: Miss Summerson , I hope I shall have your assistance in my visiting rounds immediately , and Miss Clare 's very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 26]: At first I tried to excuse myself for the present on the general ground of having occupations to attend to which I must not neglect .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 24]: But as this was an ineffectual protest , I then said , more particularly , that I was not sure of my qualifications .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 26]: That I was inexperienced in the art of adapting my mind to minds very differently situated , and addressing them from suitable points of view .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 19]: That I had not that delicate knowledge of the heart which must be essential to such a work .
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 27]: That I had much to learn , myself , before I could teach others , and that I could not confide in my good intentions alone .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 44]: For these reasons I thought it best to be as useful as I could , and to render what kind services I could to those immediately about me , and to try to let that circle of duty gradually and naturally expand itself .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 32]: All this I said with anything but confidence , because Mrs. Pardiggle was much older than I , and had great experience , and was so very military in her manners .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 35]: `` You are wrong , Miss Summerson , '' said she , `` but perhaps you are not equal to hard work or the excitement of it , and that makes a vast difference .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 46]: If you would like to see how I go through my work , I am now about -- with my young family -- to visit a brickmaker in the neighbourhood -LRB- a very bad character -RRB- and shall be glad to take you with me .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 13]: Miss Clare also , if she will do me the favour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 20]: Ada and I interchanged looks , and as we were going out in any case , accepted the offer .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 37]: When we hastily returned from putting on our bonnets , we found the young family languishing in a corner and Mrs. Pardiggle sweeping about the room , knocking down nearly all the light objects it contained .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 14]: Mrs. Pardiggle took possession of Ada , and I followed with the family .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 58]: Ada told me afterwards that Mrs. Pardiggle talked in the same loud tone -LRB- that , indeed , I overheard -RRB- all the way to the brickmaker 's about an exciting contest which she had for two or three years waged against another lady relative to the bringing in of their rival candidates for a pension somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 39]: There had been a quantity of printing , and promising , and proxying , and polling , and it appeared to have imparted great liveliness to all concerned , except the pensioners -- who were not elected yet .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 31]: I am very fond of being confided in by children and am happy in being usually favoured in that respect , but on this occasion it gave me great uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 37]: As soon as we were out of doors , Egbert , with the manner of a little footpad , demanded a shilling of me on the ground that his pocket-money was `` boned '' from him .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 28]: On my pointing out the great impropriety of the word , especially in connexion with his parent -LRB- for he added sulkily `` By her ! '' -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 12]: , he pinched me and said , `` Oh , then !
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 4]: Who are you !
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 9]: YOU would n't like it , I think ?
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 21]: What does she make a sham for , and pretend to give me money , and take it away again ?
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 16]: Why do you call it my allowance , and never let me spend it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 45]: These exasperating questions so inflamed his mind and the minds of Oswald and Francis that they all pinched me at once , and in a dreadfully expert way -- screwing up such little pieces of my arms that I could hardly forbear crying out .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 12]: Felix , at the same time , stamped upon my toes .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 53]: And the Bond of Joy , who on account of always having the whole of his little income anticipated stood in fact pledged to abstain from cakes as well as tobacco , so swelled with grief and rage when we passed a pastry-cook 's shop that he terrified me by becoming purple .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 37]: I never underwent so much , both in body and mind , in the course of a walk with young people as from these unnaturally constrained children when they paid me the compliment of being natural .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 46]: I was glad when we came to the brickmaker 's house , though it was one of a cluster of wretched hovels in a brick-field , with pigsties close to the broken windows and miserable little gardens before the doors growing nothing but stagnant pools .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 34]: Here and there an old tub was put to catch the droppings of rain-water from a roof , or they were banked up with mud into a little pond like a large dirt-pie .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 57]: At the doors and windows some men and women lounged or prowled about , and took little notice of us except to laugh to one another or to say something as we passed about gentlefolks minding their own business and not troubling their heads and muddying their shoes with coming to look after other people 's .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 63]: Mrs. Pardiggle , leading the way with a great show of moral determination and talking with much volubility about the untidy habits of the people -LRB- though I doubted if the best of us could have been tidy in such a place -RRB- , conducted us into a cottage at the farthest corner , the ground-floor room of which we nearly filled .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 79]: Besides ourselves , there were in this damp , offensive room a woman with a black eye , nursing a poor little gasping baby by the fire ; a man , all stained with clay and mud and looking very dissipated , lying at full length on the ground , smoking a pipe ; a powerful young man fastening a collar on a dog ; and a bold girl doing some kind of washing in very dirty water .
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 36]: They all looked up at us as we came in , and the woman seemed to turn her face towards the fire as if to hide her bruised eye ; nobody gave us any welcome .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 31]: `` Well , my friends , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle , but her voice had not a friendly sound , I thought ; it was much too businesslike and systematic .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 10]: `` How do you do , all of you ?
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 5]: I am here again .
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 13]: I told you , you could n't tire me , you know .
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 15]: I am fond of hard work , and am true to my word . ''
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 38]: `` There a n't , '' growled the man on the floor , whose head rested on his hand as he stared at us , `` any more on you to come in , is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 21]: `` No , my friend , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle , seating herself on one stool and knocking down another .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 7]: `` We are all here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 14]: `` Because I thought there war n't enough of you , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 17]: said the man , with his pipe between his lips as he looked round upon us .
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 9]: The young man and the girl both laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 30]: Two friends of the young man , whom we had attracted to the doorway and who stood there with their hands in their pockets , echoed the laugh noisily .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 18]: `` You ca n't tire me , good people , '' said Mrs. Pardiggle to these latter .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 20]: `` I enjoy hard work , and the harder you make mine , the better I like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 9]: `` Then make it easy for her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 7]: growled the man upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 9]: `` I wants it done , and over .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 12]: I wants a end of these liberties took with my place .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 11]: I wants an end of being drawed like a badger .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 23]: Now you 're a-going to poll-pry and question according to custom -- I know what you 're a-going to be up to .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 12]: You have n't got no occasion to be up to it .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 7]: I 'll save you the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 5]: Is my daughter a-washin ?
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 6]: Yes , she IS a-washin .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 5]: Look at the water .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 3]: Smell it !
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 6]: That 's wot we drinks .
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 15]: How do you like it , and what do you think of gin instead !
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 6]: A n't my place dirty ?
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 50]: Yes , it is dirty -- it 's nat ` rally dirty , and it 's nat ` rally onwholesome ; and we 've had five dirty and onwholesome children , as is all dead infants , and so much the better for them , and for us besides .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 10]: Have I read the little book wot you left ?
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 13]: No , I a n't read the little book wot you left .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 25]: There a n't nobody here as knows how to read it ; and if there wos , it would n't be suitable to me .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 16]: It 's a book fit for a babby , and I 'm not a babby .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 15]: If you was to leave me a doll , I should n't nuss it .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 8]: How have I been conducting of myself ?
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 25]: Why , I 've been drunk for three days ; and I ` da been drunk four if I ` da had the money .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 11]: Do n't I never mean for to go to church ?
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 13]: No , I do n't never mean for to go to church .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 19]: I should n't be expected there , if I did ; the beadle 's too gen-teel for me .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 10]: And how did my wife get that black eye ?
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 21]: Why , I give it her ; and if she says I did n't , she 's a lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 27]: He had pulled his pipe out of his mouth to say all this , and he now turned over on his other side and smoked again .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 50]: Mrs. Pardiggle , who had been regarding him through her spectacles with a forcible composure , calculated , I could not help thinking , to increase his antagonism , pulled out a good book as if it were a constable 's staff and took the whole family into custody .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 30]: I mean into religious custody , of course ; but she really did it as if she were an inexorable moral policeman carrying them all off to a station-house .
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 7]: Ada and I were very uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 37]: We both felt intrusive and out of place , and we both thought that Mrs. Pardiggle would have got on infinitely better if she had not had such a mechanical way of taking possession of people .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 36]: The children sulked and stared ; the family took no notice of us whatever , except when the young man made the dog bark , which he usually did when Mrs. Pardiggle was most emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 26]: We both felt painfully sensible that between us and these people there was an iron barrier which could not be removed by our new friend .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 19]: By whom or how it could be removed , we did not know , but we knew that .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 31]: Even what she read and said seemed to us to be ill-chosen for such auditors , if it had been imparted ever so modestly and with ever so much tact .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 48]: As to the little book to which the man on the floor had referred , we acqulred a knowledge of it afterwards , and Mr. Jarndyce said he doubted if Robinson Crusoe could have read it , though he had had no other on his desolate island .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 15]: We were much relieved , under these circumstances , when Mrs. Pardiggle left off .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 19]: The man on the floor , then turning his bead round again , said morosely , `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 8]: You 've done , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 10]: `` For to-day , I have , my friend .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 6]: But I am never fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 19]: I shall come to you again in your regular order , '' returned Mrs. Pardiggle with demonstrative cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 32]: `` So long as you goes now , '' said he , folding his arms and shutting his eyes with an oath , `` you may do wot you like ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 22]: Mrs. Pardiggle accordingly rose and made a little vortex in the confined room from which the pipe itself very narrowly escaped .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 45]: Taking one of her young family in each hand , and telling the others to follow closely , and expressing her hope that the brickmaker and all his house would be improved when she saw them next , she then proceeded to another cottage .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 44]: I hope it is not unkind in me to say that she certainly did make , in this as in everything else , a show that was not conciliatory of doing charity by wholesale and of dealing in it to a large extent .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 34]: She supposed that we were following her , but as soon as the space was left clear , we approached the woman sitting by the fire to ask if the baby were ill .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 12]: She only looked at it as it lay on her lap .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 40]: We had observed before that when she looked at it she covered her discoloured eye with her hand , as though she wished to separate any association with noise and violence and ill treatment from the poor little child .
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 19]: Ada , whose gentle heart was moved by its appearance , bent down to touch its little face .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 14]: As she did so , I saw what happened and drew her back .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 4]: The child died .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 6]: `` Oh , Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 10]: cried Ada , sinking on her knees beside it .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 11]: Oh , Esther , my love , the little thing !
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 9]: The suffering , quiet , pretty little thing !
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 7]: I am so sorry for it .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 8]: I am so sorry for the mother .
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 11]: I never saw a sight so pitiful as this before !
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 7]: Oh , baby , baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 33]: Such compassion , such gentleness , as that with which she bent down weeping and put her hand upon the mother 's might have softened any mother 's heart that ever beat .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 15]: The woman at first gazed at her in astonishment and then burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 39]: Presently I took the light burden from her lap , did what I could to make the baby 's rest the prettier and gentler , laid it on a shelf , and covered it with my own handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 19]: We tried to comfort the mother , and we whispered to her what Our Saviour said of children .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 12]: She answered nothing , but sat weeping -- weeping very much .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 32]: When I turned , I found that the young man had taken out the dog and was standing at the door looking in upon us with dry eyes , but quiet .
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 15]: The girl was quiet too and sat in a corner looking on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 5]: The man had risen .
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 16]: He still smoked his pipe with an air of defiance , but he was silent .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 30]: An ugly woman , very poorly clothed , hurried in while I was glancing at them , and coming straight up to the mother , said , `` Jenny !
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 3]: Jenny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 15]: The mother rose on being so addressed and fell upon the woman 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 14]: She also had upon her face and arms the marks of ill usage .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 34]: She had no kind of grace about her , but the grace of sympathy ; but when she condoled with the woman , and her own tears fell , she wanted no beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 12]: I say condoled , but her only words were `` Jenny !
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 3]: Jenny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 13]: All the rest was in the tone in which she said them .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 56]: I thought it very touching to see these two women , coarse and shabby and beaten , so united ; to see what they could be to one another ; to see how they felt for one another , how the heart of each to each was softened by the hard trials of their lives .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 14]: I think the best side of such people is almost hidden from us .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 17]: What the poor are to the poor is little known , excepting to themselves and God .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 11]: We felt it better to withdraw and leave them uninterrupted .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 14]: We stole out quietly and without notice from any one except the man .
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 27]: He was leaning against the wall near the door , and finding that there was scarcely room for us to pass , went out before us .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 25]: He seemed to want to hide that he did this on our account , but we perceived that be did , and thanked him .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 5]: He made no answer .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 48]: Ada was so full of grief all the way home , and Richard , whom we found at home , was so distressed to see her in tears -LRB- though he said to me , when she was not present , how beautiful it was too ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 22]: , that we arranged to return at night with some little comforts and repeat our visit at the brick-maker 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 17]: We said as little as we could to Mr. Jarndyce , but the wind changed directly .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 13]: Richard accompanied us at night to the scene of our morning expedition .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 24]: On our way there , we had to pass a noisy drinking-house , where a number of men were flocking about the door .
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 17]: Among them , and prominent in some dispute , was the father of the little child .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 18]: At a short distance , we passed the young man and the dog , in congenial company .
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 33]: The sister was standing laughing and talking with some other young women at the corner of the row of cottages , but she seemed ashamed and turned away as we went by .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 16]: We left our escort within sight of the brickmaker 's dwelling and proceeded by ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 24]: When we came to the door , we found the woman who had brought such consolation with her standing there looking anxiously out .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 12]: `` It 's you , young ladies , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 6]: she said in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 8]: `` I 'm a-watching for my master .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 7]: My heart 's in my mouth .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 18]: If he was to catch me away from home , he 'd pretty near murder me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 8]: `` Do you mean your husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 10]: said I. `` Yes , miss , my master .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 7]: Jennys asleep , quite worn out .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 35]: She 's scarcely had the child off her lap , poor thing , these seven days and nights , except when I 've been able to take it for a minute or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 27]: As she gave way for us , she went softly in and put what we had brought near the miserable bed on which the mother slept .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 86]: No effort had been made to clean the room -- it seemed in its nature almost hopeless of being clean ; but the small waxen form from which so much solemnity diffused itself had been composed afresh , and washed , and neatly dressed in some fragments of white linen ; and on my handkerchief , which still covered the poor baby , a little bunch of sweet herbs had been laid by the same rough , scarred hands , so lightly , so tenderly !
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 7]: `` May heaven reward you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 5]: we said to her .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 8]: `` You are a good woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 7]: `` Me , young ladies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 5]: she returned with surprise .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 5]: Jenny , Jenny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 10]: The mother had moaned in her sleep and moved .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 12]: The sound of the familiar voice seemed to calm her again .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 6]: She was quiet once more .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 61]: How little I thought , when I raised my handkerchief to look upon the tiny sleeper underneath and seemed to see a halo shine around the child through Ada 's drooping hair as her pity bent her head -- how little I thought in whose unquiet bosom that handkerchief would come to lie after covering the motionless and peaceful breast !
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 72]: I only thought that perhaps the Angel of the child might not be all unconscious of the woman who replaced it with so compassionate a hand ; not all unconscious of her presently , when we had taken leave , and left her at the door , by turns looking , and listening in terror for herself , and saying in her old soothing manner , `` Jenny , Jenny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 22]: Chapter IX -- Signs and Tokens I do n't know how it is I seem to be always writing about myself .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 62]: I mean all the time to write about other people , and I try to think about myself as little as possible , and I am sure , when I find myself coming into the story again , I am really vexed and say , `` Dear , dear , you tiresome little creature , I wish you would n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 8]: but it is all of no use .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 46]: I hope any one who may read what I write will understand that if these pages contain a great deal about me , I can only suppose it must be because I have really something to do with them and ca n't be kept out .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 32]: My darling and I read together , and worked , and practised , and found so much employment for our time that the winter days flew by us like bright-winged birds .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 17]: Generally in the afternoons , and always in the evenings , Richard gave us his company .
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 22]: Although he was one of the most restless creatures in the world , he certainly was very fond of our society .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 11]: He was very , very , very fond of Ada .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 13]: I mean it , and I had better say it at once .
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 20]: I had never seen any young people falling in love before , but I found them out quite soon .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 18]: I could not say so , of course , or show that I knew anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 34]: On the contrary , I was so demure and used to seem so unconscious that sometimes I considered within myself while I was sitting at work whether I was not growing quite deceitful .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 8]: But there was no help for it .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 19]: All I had to do was to be quiet , and I was as quiet as a mouse .
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 54]: They were as quiet as mice too , so far as any words were concerned , but the innocent manner in which they relied more and more upon me as they took more and more to one another was so charming that I had great difficulty in not showing how it interested me .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 51]: `` Our dear little old woman is such a capital old woman , '' Richard would say , coming up to meet me in the garden early , with his pleasant laugh and perhaps the least tinge of a blush , `` that I ca n't get on without her .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 57]: Before I begin my harum-scarum day -- grinding away at those books and instruments and then galloping up hill and down dale , all the country round , like a highwayman -- it does me so much good to come and have a steady walk with our comfortable friend , that here I am again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 44]: `` You know , Dame Durden , dear , '' Ada would say at night , with her head upon my shoulder and the firelight shining in her thoughtful eyes , `` I do n't want to talk when we come upstairs here .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 31]: Only to sit a little while thinking , with your dear face for company , and to hear the wind and remember the poor sailors at sea -- '' Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 9]: Perhaps Richard was going to be a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 25]: We had talked it over very often now , and there was some talk of gratifying the inclination of his childhood for the sea .
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 112]: Mr. Jarndyce had written to a relation of the family , a great Sir Leicester Dedlock , for his interest in Richard 's favour , generally ; and Sir Leicester had replied in a gracious manner that he would be happy to advance the prospects of the young gentleman if it should ever prove to be within his power , which was not at all probable , and that my Lady sent her compliments to the young gentleman -LRB- to whom she perfectly remembered that she was allied by remote consanguinity -RRB- and trusted that he would ever do his duty in any honourable profession to which he might devote himself .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 26]: `` So I apprehend it 's pretty clear , '' said Richard to me , `` that I shall have to work my own way .
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 3]: Never mind !
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 16]: Plenty of people have had to do that before now , and have done it .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 34]: I only wish I had the command of a clipping privateer to begin with and could carry off the Chancellor and keep him on short allowance until he gave judgment in our cause .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 15]: He 'd find himself growing thin , if he did n't look sharp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 41]: With a buoyancy and hopefulness and a gaiety that hardly ever flagged , Richard had a carelessness in his character that quite perplexed me , principally because he mistook it , in such a very odd way , for prudence .
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 34]: It entered into all his calculations about money in a singular manner which I do n't think I can better explain than by reverting for a moment to our loan to Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 42]: Mr. Jarndyce had ascertained the amount , either from Mr. Skimpole himself or from Coavinses , and had placed the money in my hands with instructions to me to retain my own part of it and hand the rest to Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 46]: The number of little acts of thoughtless expenditure which Richard justified by the recovery of his ten pounds , and the number of times he talked to me as if he had saved or realized that amount , would form a sum in simple addition .
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 10]: `` My prudent Mother Hubbard , why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 21]: he said to me when he wanted , without the least consideration , to bestow five pounds on the brickmaker .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 15]: `` I made ten pounds , clear , out of Coavinses ' business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 6]: `` How was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 28]: said I. `` Why , I got rid of ten pounds which I was quite content to get rid of and never expected to see any more .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 7]: You do n't deny that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 10]: `` No , '' said I. `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 20]: Then I came into possession of ten pounds -- '' `` The same ten pounds , '' I hinted .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 10]: `` That has nothing to do with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 3]: returned Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 26]: `` I have got ten pounds more than I expected to have , and consequently I can afford to spend it without being particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 40]: In exactly the same way , when he was persuaded out of the sacrifice of these five pounds by being convinced that it would do no good , he carried that sum to his credit and drew upon it .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 6]: `` Let me see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 4]: he would say .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 40]: `` I saved five pounds out of the brickmaker 's affair , so if I have a good rattle to London and back in a post-chaise and put that down at four pounds , I shall have saved one .
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 25]: And it 's a very good thing to save one , let me tell you : a penny saved is a penny got ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 17]: I believe Richard 's was as frank and generous a nature as there possibly can be .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 31]: He was ardent and brave , and in the midst of all his wild restlessness , was so gentle that I knew him like a brother in a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 48]: His gentleness was natural to him and would have shown itself abundantly even without Ada 's influence ; but with it , he became one of the most winning of companions , always so ready to be interested and always so happy , sanguine , and light-hearted .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 87]: I am sure that I , sitting with them , and walking with them , and talking with them , and noticing from day to day how they went on , falling deeper and deeper in love , and saying nothing about it , and each shyly thinking that this love was the greatest of secrets , perhaps not yet suspected even by the other -- I am sure that I was scarcely less enchanted than they were and scarcely less pleased with the pretty dream .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 31]: We were going on in this way , when one morning at breakfast Mr. Jarndyce received a letter , and looking at the superscription , said , `` From Boythorn ?
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 5]: Aye , aye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 33]: and opened and read it with evident pleasure , announcing to us in a parenthesis when he was about half-way through , that Boythorn was `` coming down '' on a visit .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 9]: Now who was Boythorn , we all thought .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 29]: And I dare say we all thought too -- I am sure I did , for one -- would Boythorn at all interfere with what was going forward ?
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 37]: `` I went to school with this fellow , Lawrence Boythorn , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , tapping the letter as he laid it on the table , `` more than five and forty years ago .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 20]: He was then the most impetuous boy in the world , and he is now the most impetuous man .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 18]: He was then the loudest boy in the world , and he is now the loudest man .
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 22]: He was then the heartiest and sturdiest boy in the world , and he is now the heartiest and sturdiest man .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 7]: He is a tremendous fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 7]: `` In stature , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 3]: asked Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 57]: `` Pretty well , Rick , in that respect , '' said Mr. Jarndyce ; `` being some ten years older than I and a couple of inches taller , with his head thrown back like an old soldier , his stalwart chest squared , his hands like a clean blacksmith 's , and his lungs !
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 8]: There 's no simile for his lungs .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 17]: Talking , laughing , or snoring , they make the beams of the house shake . ''
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 31]: As Mr. Jarndyce sat enjoying the image of his friend Boythorn , we observed the favourable omen that there was not the least indication of any change in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 58]: `` But it 's the inside of the man , the warm heart of the man , the passion of the man , the fresh blood of the man , Rick -- and Ada , and little Cobweb too , for you are all interested in a visitor -- that I speak of , '' he pursued .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 10]: `` His language is as sounding as his voice .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 12]: He is always in extremes , perpetually in the superlative degree .
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 8]: In his condemnation he is all ferocity .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 26]: You might suppose him to be an ogre from what he says , and I believe he has the reputation of one with some people .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 9]: I tell you no more of him beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 51]: You must not be surprised to see him take me under his protection , for he has never forgotten that I was a low boy at school and that our friendship began in his knocking two of my head tyrant 's teeth out -LRB- he says six -RRB- before breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 20]: Boythorn and his man , '' to me , `` will be here this afternoon , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 26]: I took care that the necessary preparations were made for Mr. Boythorn 's reception , and we looked forward to his arrival with some curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 13]: The afternoon wore away , however , and he did not appear .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 11]: The dinner-hour arrived , and still he did not appear .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 76]: The dinner was put back an hour , and we were sitting round the fire with no light but the blaze when the hall-door suddenly burst open and the hall resounded with these words , uttered with the greatest vehemence and in a stentorian tone : `` We have been misdirected , Jarndyce , by a most abandoned ruffian , who told us to take the turning to the right instead of to the left .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 13]: He is the most intolerable scoundrel on the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 17]: His father must have been a most consummate villain , ever to have such a son .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 13]: I would have had that fellow shot without the least remorse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 9]: `` Did he do it on purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 4]: Mr. Jarndyce inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 20]: `` I have not the slightest doubt that the scoundrel has passed his whole existence in misdirecting travellers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 28]: `` By my soul , I thought him the worst-looking dog I had ever beheld when he was telling me to take the turning to the right .
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 19]: And yet I stood before that fellow face to face and did n't knock his brains out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 7]: `` Teeth , you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 8]: `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 12]: laughed Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , really making the whole house vibrate .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 10]: `` What , you have not forgotten it yet !
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 8]: And that was another most consummate vagabond !
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 37]: By my soul , the countenance of that fellow when he was a boy was the blackest image of perfidy , cowardice , and cruelty ever set up as a scarecrow in a field of scoundrels .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 24]: If I were to meet that most unparalleled despot in the streets to-morrow , I would fell him like a rotten tree ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 13]: `` I have no doubt of it , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 9]: `` Now , will you come upstairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 59]: `` By my soul , Jarndyce , '' returned his guest , who seemed to refer to his watch , `` if you had been married , I would have turned back at the garden-gate and gone away to the remotest summits of the Himalaya Mountains sooner than I would have presented myself at this unseasonable hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 10]: `` Not quite so far , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 10]: `` By my life and honour , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 4]: cried the visitor .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 26]: `` I would n't be guilty of the audacious insolence of keeping a lady of the house waiting all this time for any earthly consideration .
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 11]: I would infinitely rather destroy myself -- infinitely rather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 24]: Talking thus , they went upstairs , and presently we heard him in his bedroom thundering `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 10]: and again `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 30]: until the flattest echo in the neighbourhood seemed to catch the contagion and to laugh as enjoyingly as he did or as we did when we heard him laugh .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 63]: We all conceived a prepossession in his favour , for there was a sterling quality in this laugh , and in his vigorous , healthy voice , and in the roundness and fullness with which he uttered every word he spoke , and in the very fury of his superlatives , which seemed to go off like blank cannons and hurt nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 19]: But we were hardly prepared to have it so confirmed by his appearance when Mr. Jarndyce presented him .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 221]: He was not only a very handsome old gentleman -- upright and stalwart as he had been described to us -- with a massive grey head , a fine composure of face when silent , a figure that might have become corpulent but for his being so continually in earnest that he gave it no rest , and a chin that might have subsided into a double chin but for the vehement emphasis in which it was constantly required to assist ; but he was such a true gentleman in his manner , so chivalrously polite , his face was lighted by a smile of so much sweetness and tenderness , and it seemed so plain that he had nothing to hide , but showed himself exactly as he was -- incapable , as Richard said , of anything on a limited scale , and firing away with those blank great guns because he carried no small arms whatever -- that really I could not help looking at him with equal pleasure as he sat at dinner , whether he smilingly conversed with Ada and me , or was led by Mr. Jarndyce into some great volley of superlatives , or threw up his head like a bloodhound and gave out that tremendous `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 13]: `` You have brought your bird with you , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 14]: `` By heaven , he is the most astonishing bird in Europe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 4]: replied the other .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 8]: `` He IS the most wonderful creature !
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 11]: I would n't take ten thousand guineas for that bird .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 16]: I have left an annuity for his sole support in case he should outlive me .
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 11]: He is , in sense and attachment , a phenomenon .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 17]: And his father before him was one of the most astonishing birds that ever lived ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 47]: The subject of this laudation was a very little canary , who was so tame that he was brought down by Mr. Boythorn 's man , on his forefinger , and after taking a gentle flight round the room , alighted on his master 's head .
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 39]: To hear Mr. Boythorn presently expressing the most implacable and passionate sentiments , with this fragile mite of a creature quietly perched on his forehead , was to have a good illustration of his character , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 64]: `` By my soul , Jarndyce , '' he said , very gently holding up a bit of bread to the canary to peck at , `` if I were in your place I would seize every master in Chancery by the throat tomorrow morning and shake him until his money rolled out of his pockets and his bones rattled in his skin .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 16]: I would have a settlement out of somebody , by fair means or by foul .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 21]: If you would empower me to do it , I would do it for you with the greatest satisfaction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 16]: -LRB- All this time the very small canary was eating out of his hand . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 48]: `` I thank you , Lawrence , but the suit is hardly at such a point at present , '' returned Mr. Jarndyce , laughing , `` that it would be greatly advanced even by the legal process of shaking the bench and the whole bar . ''
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 19]: `` There never was such an infernal cauldron as that Chancery on the face of the earth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 4]: said Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 77]: `` Nothing but a mine below it on a busy day in term time , with all its records , rules , and precedents collected in it and every functionary belonging to it also , high and low , upward and downward , from its son the Accountant -- General to its father the Devil , and the whole blown to atoms with ten thousand hundredweight of gunpowder , would reform it in the least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 20]: It was impossible not to laugh at the energetic gravity with which he recommended this strong measure of reform .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 33]: When we laughed , he threw up his head and shook his broad chest , and again the whole country seemed to echo to his `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 54]: It had not the least effect in disturbing the bird , whose sense of security was complete and who hopped about the table with its quick head now on this side and now on that , turning its bright sudden eye on its master as if he were no more than another bird .
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 18]: `` But how do you and your neighbour get on about the disputed right of way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 14]: `` You are not free from the toils of the law yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 26]: `` The fellow has brought actions against ME for trespass , and I have brought actions against HIM for trespass , '' returned Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 11]: `` By heaven , he is the proudest fellow breathing .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 12]: It is morally impossible that his name can be Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 7]: It must be Sir Lucifer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 8]: `` Complimentary to our distant relation ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 9]: said my guardian laughingly to Ada and Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 58]: `` I would beg Miss Clare 's pardon and Mr. Carstone 's pardon , '' resumed our visitor , `` if I were not reassured by seeing in the fair face of the lady and the smile of the gentleman that it is quite unnecessary and that they keep their distant relation at a comfortable distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 10]: `` Or he keeps us , '' suggested Richard .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 60]: `` By my soul , '' exclaimed Mr. Boythorn , suddenly firing another volley , `` that fellow is , and his father was , and his grandfather was , the most stiff-necked , arrogant imbecile , pig-headed numskull , ever , by some inexplicable mistake of Nature , born in any station of life but a walking-stick 's !
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 14]: The whole of that family are the most solemnly conceited and consummate blockheads !
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 42]: But it 's no matter ; he should not shut up my path if he were fifty baronets melted into one and living in a hundred Chesney Wolds , one within another , like the ivory balls in a Chinese carving .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 91]: The fellow , by his agent , or secretary , or somebody , writes to me ` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , presents his compliments to Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , and has to call his attention to the fact that the green pathway by the old parsonage-house , now the property of Mr. Lawrence Boythorn , is Sir Leicester 's right of way , being in fact a portion of the park of chesney Wold , and that Sir Leicester finds it convenient to close up the same . '
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 75]: I write to the fellow , ` Mr. Lawrence Boythorn presents his compliments to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and has to call HIS attention to the fact that he totally denies the whole of Sir Leicester Dedlock 's positions on every possible subject and has to add , in reference to closing up the pathway , that he will be glad to see the man who may undertake to do it . '
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 15]: The fellow sends a most abandoned villain with one eye to construct a gateway .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 20]: I play upon that execrable scoundrel with a fire-engine until the breath is nearly driven out of his body .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 9]: The fellow erects a gate in the night .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 11]: I chop it down and burn it in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 14]: He sends his myrmidons to come over the fence and pass and repass .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 38]: I catch them in humane man traps , fire split peas at their legs , play upon them with the engine -- resolve to free mankind from the insupportable burden of the existence of those lurking ruffians .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 12]: He brings actions for trespass ; I bring actions for trespass .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 18]: He brings actions for assault and battery ; I defend them and continue to assault and batter .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 20]: To hear him say all this with unimaginable energy , one might have thought him the angriest of mankind .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 35]: To see him at the very same time , looking at the bird now perched upon his thumb and softly smoothing its feathers with his forefinger , one might have thought him the gentlest .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 47]: To hear him laugh and see the broad good nature of his face then , one might have supposed that he had not a care in the world , or a dispute , or a dislike , but that his whole existence was a summer joke .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 20]: `` No , no , '' he said , `` no closing up of my paths by any Dedlock !
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 51]: Though I willingly confess , '' here he softened in a moment , `` that Lady Dedlock is the most accomplished lady in the world , to whom I would do any homage that a plain gentleman , and no baronet with a head seven hundred years thick , may .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 63]: A man who joined his regiment at twenty and within a week challenged the most imperious and presumptuous coxcomb of a commanding officer that ever drew the breath of life through a tight waist -- and got broke for it -- is not the man to be walked over by all the Sir Lucifers , dead or alive , locked or unlocked .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 7]: Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 15]: `` Nor the man to allow his junior to be walked over either ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 6]: `` Most assuredly not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 25]: said Mr. Boythorn , clapping him on the shoulder with an air of protection that had something serious in it , though he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 11]: `` He will stand by the low boy , always .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 8]: Jarndyce , you may rely upon him !
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 40]: But speaking of this trespass -- with apologies to Miss Clare and Miss Summerson for the length at which I have pursued so dry a subject -- is there nothing for me from your men Kenge and Carboy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 8]: `` I think not , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 6]: `` Nothing , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 5]: `` Much obliged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 4]: said Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 24]: `` Had no need to ask , after even my slight experience of Miss Summerson 's forethought for every one about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 14]: -LRB- They all encouraged me ; they were determined to do it . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 31]: `` I inquired because , coming from Lincolnshire , I of course have not yet been in town , and I thought some letters might have been sent down here .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 11]: I dare say they will report progress to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 91]: I saw him so often in the course of the evening , which passed very pleasantly , contemplate Richard and Ada with an interest and a satisfaction that made his fine face remarkably agreeable as he sat at a little distance from the piano listening to the music -- and he had small occasion to tell us that he was passionately fond of music , for his face showed it -- that I asked my guardian as we sat at the backgammon board whether Mr. Boythorn had ever been married .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 7]: `` No , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 8]: `` But he meant to be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 11]: said I. `` How did you find out that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 6]: he returned with a smile .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 66]: `` Why , guardian , '' I explained , not without reddening a little at hazarding what was in my thoughts , `` there is something so tender in his manner , after all , and he is so very courtly and gentle to us , and -- '' Mr. Jarndyce directed his eyes to where he was sitting as I have just described him .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 5]: I said no more .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 12]: `` You are right , little woman , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 8]: `` He was all but married once .
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 3]: Long ago .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 4]: And once . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 7]: `` Did the lady die ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 9]: `` No -- but she died to him .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 12]: That time has had its influence on all his later life .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 17]: Would you suppose him to have a head and a heart full of romance yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 12]: `` I think , guardian , I might have supposed so .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 15]: But it is easy to say that when you have told me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 40]: `` He has never since been what he might have been , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` and now you see him in his age with no one near him but his servant and his little yellow friend .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 9]: It 's your throw , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 24]: I felt , from my guardian 's manner , that beyond this point I could not pursue the subject without changing the wind .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 9]: I therefore forbore to ask any further questions .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 8]: I was interested , but not curious .
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 48]: I thought a little while about this old love story in the night , when I was awakened by Mr. Boythorn 's lusty snoring ; and I tried to do that very difficult thing , imagine old people young again and invested with the graces of youth .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 23]: But I fell asleep before I had succeeded , and dreamed of the days when I lived in my godmother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 28]: I am not sufficiently acquainted with such subjects to know whether it is at all remarkable that I almost always dreamed of that period of my life .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 29]: With the morning there came a letter from Messrs. Kenge and Carboy to Mr. Boythorn informing him that one of their clerks would wait upon him at noon .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 82]: As it was the day of the week on which I paid the bills , and added up my books , and made all the household affairs as compact as possible , I remained at home while Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and Richard took advantage of a very fine day to make a little excursion , Mr. Boythorn was to wait for Kenge and Carboy 's clerk and then was to go on foot to meet them on their return .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 40]: I was full of business , examining tradesmen 's books , adding up columns , paying money , filing receipts , and I dare say making a great bustle about it when Mr. Guppy was announced and shown in .
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 44]: I had had some idea that the clerk who was to be sent down might be the young gentleman who had met me at the coach-office , and I was glad to see him , because he was associated with my present happiness .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 12]: I scarcely knew him again , he was so uncommonly smart .
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 44]: He had an entirely new suit of glossy clothes on , a shining hat , lilac-kid gloves , a neckerchief of a variety of colours , a large hot-house flower in his button-hole , and a thick gold ring on his little finger .
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 17]: Besides which , he quite scented the dining-room with bear 's - grease and other perfumery .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 80]: He looked at me with an attention that quite confused me when I begged him to take a seat until the servant should return ; and as he sat there crossing and uncrossing his legs in a corner , and I asked him if he had had a pleasant ride , and hoped that Mr. Kenge was well , I never looked at him , but I found him looking at me in the same scrutinizing and curious way .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 42]: When the request was brought to him that he would go up-stairs to Mr. Boythorn 's room , I mentioned that he would find lunch prepared for him when he came down , of which Mr. Jarndyce hoped he would partake .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 28]: He said with some embarrassment , holding the handle of the door , ' `` Shall I have the honour of finding you here , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 20]: I replied yes , I should be there ; and he went out with a bow and another look .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 46]: I thought him only awkward and shy , for he was evidently much embarrassed ; and I fancied that the best thing I could do would be to wait until I saw that he had everything he wanted and then to leave him to himself .
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 16]: The lunch was soon brought , but it remained for some time on the table .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 51]: The interview with Mr. Boythorn was a long one , and a stormy one too , I should think , for although his room was at some distance I heard his loud voice rising every now and then like a high wind , and evidently blowing perfect broadsides of denunciation .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 15]: At last Mr. Guppy came back , looking something the worse for the conference .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 21]: `` My eye , miss , '' he said in a low voice , `` he 's a Tartar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 12]: `` Pray take some refreshment , sir , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 38]: Mr. Guppy sat down at the table and began nervously sharpening the carving-knife on the carving-fork , still looking at me -LRB- as I felt quite sure without looking at him -RRB- in the same unusual manner .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 43]: The sharpening lasted so long that at last I felt a kind of obligation on me to raise my eyes in order that I might break the spell under which he seemed to labour , of not being able to leave off .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 11]: He immediately looked at the dish and began to carve .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: `` What will you take yourself , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: You 'll take a morsel of something ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 25]: `` No , thank you , '' said I. `` Sha n't I give you a piece of anything at all , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 12]: said Mr. Guppy , hurriedly drinking off a glass of wine .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 23]: `` Nothing , thank you , '' said I. `` I have only waited to see that you have everything you want .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 10]: Is there anything I can order for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 16]: `` No , I am much obliged to you , miss , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 25]: I 've everything that I can require to make me comfortable -- at least I -- not comfortable -- I 'm never that . ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 13]: He drank off two more glasses of wine , one after another .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 7]: I thought I had better go .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 11]: said Mr. Guppy , rising when he saw me rise .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 16]: `` But would you allow me the favour of a minute 's private conversation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 11]: Not knowing what to say , I sat down again .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 10]: `` What follows is without prejudice , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 12]: said Mr. Guppy , anxiously bringing a chair towards my table .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 15]: `` I do n't understand what you mean , '' said I , wondering .
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: `` It 's one of our law terms , miss .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 19]: You wo n't make any use of it to my detriment at Kenge and Carboy 's or elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 29]: If our conversation should n't lead to anything , I am to be as I was and am not to be prejudiced in my situation or worldly prospects .
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 10]: In short , it 's in total confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 49]: `` I am at a loss , sir , '' said I , `` to imagine what you can have to communicate in total confidence to me , whom you have never seen but once ; but I should be very sorry to do you any injury . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 6]: `` Thank you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 12]: I 'm sure of it -- that 's quite sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 29]: All this time Mr. Guppy was either planing his forehead with his handkerchief or tightly rubbing the palm of his left hand with the palm of his right .
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 37]: `` If you would excuse my taking another glass of wine , miss , I think it might assist me in getting on without a continual choke that can not fail to be mutually unpleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 9]: He did so , and came back again .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 11]: I took the opportunity of moving well behind my table .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 16]: `` You would n't allow me to offer you one , would you miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 7]: said Mr. Guppy , apparently refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 14]: `` Not any , '' said I. `` Not half a glass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 4]: said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 3]: `` Quarter ?
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 5]: Then , to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 19]: My present salary , Miss Summerson , at Kenge and Carboy 's , is two pound a week .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 27]: When I first had the happiness of looking upon you , it was one fifteen , and had stood at that figure for a lengthened period .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 32]: A rise of five has since taken place , and a further rise of five is guaranteed at the expiration of a term not exceeding twelve months from the present date .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 33]: My mother has a little property , which takes the form of a small life annuity , upon which she lives in an independent though unassuming manner in the Old Street Road .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 8]: She is eminently calculated for a mother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 14]: She never interferes , is all for peace , and her disposition easy .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 10]: She has her failings -- as who has not ?
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 30]: -- but I never knew her do it when company was present , at which time you may freely trust her with wines , spirits , or malt liquors .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 11]: My own abode is lodgings at Penton Place , Pentonville .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 21]: It is lowly , but airy , open at the back , and considered one of the ` ealthiest outlets .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 3]: Miss Summerson !
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 9]: In the mildest language , I adore you .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 26]: Would you be so kind as to allow me -LRB- as I may say -RRB- to file a declaration -- to make an offer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 8]: Mr. Guppy went down on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 11]: I was well behind my table and not much frightened .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 30]: I said , `` Get up from that ridiculous position lmmediately , sir , or you will oblige me to break my implied promise and ring the bell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 8]: `` Hear me out , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 8]: said Mr. Guppy , folding his hands .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 47]: `` I can not consent to hear another word , sir , '' I returned , `` Unless you get up from the carpet directly and go and sit down at the table as you ought to do if you have any sense at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 11]: He looked piteously , but slowly rose and did so .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 44]: `` Yet what a mockery it is , miss , '' he said with his hand upon his heart and shaking his head at me in a melancholy manner over the tray , `` to be stationed behind food at such a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 13]: The soul recoils from food at such a moment , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 29]: `` I beg you to conclude , '' said I ; `` you have asked me to hear you out , and I beg you to conclude . ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 11]: `` I will , miss , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 12]: `` As I love and honour , so likewise I obey .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 16]: Would that I could make thee the subject of that vow before the shrine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 19]: `` That is quite impossible , '' said I , `` and entirely out of the question . ''
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 64]: `` I am aware , '' said Mr. Guppy , leaning forward over the tray and regarding me , as I again strangely felt , though my eyes were not directed to him , with his late intent look , `` I am aware that in a worldly point of view , according to all appearances , my offer is a poor one .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 5]: But , Miss Summerson !
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 2]: Angel !
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 25]: No , do n't ring -- I have been brought up in a sharp school and am accustomed to a variety of general practice .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 21]: Though a young man , I have ferreted out evidence , got up cases , and seen lots of life .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 20]: Blest with your hand , what means might I not find of advancing your interests and pushing your fortunes !
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 12]: What might I not get to know , nearly concerning you ?
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 25]: I know nothing now , certainly ; but what MIGHT I not if I had your confidence , and you set me on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 44]: I told him that he addressed my interest or what he supposed to be my interest quite as unsuccessfully as he addressed my inclination , and he would now understand that I requested him , if he pleased , to go away immediately .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 15]: `` Cruel miss , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` hear but another word !
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 23]: I think you must have seen that I was struck with those charms on the day when I waited at the Whytorseller .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 27]: I think you must have remarked that I could not forbear a tribute to those charms when I put up the steps of the ` ackney-coach .
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 14]: It was a feeble tribute to thee , but it was well meant .
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 11]: Thy image has ever since been fixed in my breast .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 24]: I have walked up and down of an evening opposite Jellyby 's house only to look upon the bricks that once contained thee .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 32]: This out of to-day , quite an unnecessary out so far as the attendance , which was its pretended object , went , was planned by me alone for thee alone .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 17]: If I speak of interest , it is only to recommend myself and my respectful wretchedness .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 11]: Love was before it , and is before it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 44]: `` I should be pained , Mr. Guppy , '' said I , rising and putting my hand upon the bell-rope , `` to do you or any one who was sincere the injustice of slighting any honest feeling , however disagreeably expressed .
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 29]: If you have really meant to give me a proof of your good opinion , though ill-timed and misplaced , I feel that I ought to thank you .
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 15]: I have very little reason to be proud , and I am not proud .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 44]: I hope , '' I think I added , without very well knowing what I said , `` that you will now go away as if you had never been so exceedingly foolish and attend to Messrs. Kenge and Carboy 's business . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 8]: `` Half a minute , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 13]: cried Mr. Guppy , checking me as I was about to ring .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 8]: `` This has been without prejudice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 24]: `` I will never mention it , '' said I , `` unless you should give me future occasion to do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 9]: `` A quarter of a minute , miss !
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 83]: In case you should think better at any time , however distant -- THAT 'S no consequence , for my feelings can never alter -- of anything I have said , particularly what might I not do , Mr. William Guppy , eighty-seven , Penton Place , or if removed , or dead -LRB- of blighted hopes or anything of that sort -RRB- , care of Mrs. Guppy , three hundred and two , Old Street Road , will be sufficient . ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 28]: I rang the bell , the servant came , and Mr. Guppy , laying his written card upon the table and making a dejected bow , departed .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 23]: Raising my eyes as he went out , I once more saw him looking at me after he had passed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 21]: I sat there for another hour or more , finishing my books and payments and getting through plenty of business .
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 28]: Then I arranged my desk , and put everything away , and was so composed and cheerful that I thought I had quite dismissed this unexpected incident .
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 33]: But , when I went upstairs to my own room , I surprised myself by beginning to laugh about it and then surprised myself still more by beginning to cry about it .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 44]: In short , I was in a flutter for a little while and felt as if an old chord had been more coarsely touched than it ever had been since the days of the dear old doll , long buried in the garden .
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 40]: Chapter X -- The Law -- Writer On the eastern borders of Chancery Lane , that is to say , more particularly in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby , law-stationer , pursues his lawful calling .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 143]: In the shade of Cook 's Court , at most times a shady place , Mr. Snagsby has dealt in all sorts of blank forms of legal process ; in skins and rolls of parchment ; in paper -- foolscap , brief , draft , brown , white , whitey-brown , and blotting ; in stamps ; in office-quills , pens , ink , India-rubber , pounce , pins , pencils , sealing-wax , and wafers ; in red tape and green ferret ; in pocket-books , almanacs , diaries , and law lists ; in string boxes , rulers , inkstands -- glass and leaden -- pen-knives , scissors , bodkins , and other small office-cutlery ; in short , in articles too numerous to mention , ever since he was out of his time and went into partnership with Peffer .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 37]: On that occasion , Cook 's Court was in a manner revolutionized by the new inscription in fresh paint , PEFFER AND SNAGSBY , displacing the time-honoured and not easily to be deciphered legend PEFFER only .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 32]: For smoke , which is the London ivy , had so wreathed itself round Peffer 's name and clung to his dwelling-place that the affectionate parasite quite overpowered the parent tree .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 10]: Peffer is never seen in Cook 's Court now .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 45]: He is not expected there , for he has been recumbent this quarter of a century in the churchyard of St. Andrews , Holborn , with the waggons and hackney-coaches roaring past him all the day and half the night like one great dragon .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 101]: If he ever steal forth when the dragon is at rest to air himself again in Cook 's Court until admonished to return by the crowing of the sanguine cock in the cellar at the little dairy in Cursitor Street , whose ideas of daylight it would be curious to ascertain , since he knows from his personal observation next to nothing about it -- if Peffer ever do revisit the pale glimpses of Cook 's Court , which no law-stationer in the trade can positively deny , he comes invisibly , and no one is the worse or wiser .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 65]: In his lifetime , and likewise in the period of Snagsby 's `` time '' of seven long years , there dwelt with Peffer in the same law-stationering premises a niece -- a short , shrewd niece , something too violently compressed about the waist , and with a sharp nose like a sharp autumn evening , inclining to be frosty towards the end .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 86]: The Cook 's Courtiers had a rumour flying among them that the mother of this niece did , in her daughter 's childhood , moved by too jealous a solicitude that her figure should approach perfection , lace her up every morning with her maternal foot against the bed-post for a stronger hold and purchase ; and further , that she exhibited internally pints of vinegar and lemon-juice , which acids , they held , had mounted to the nose and temper of the patient .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 50]: With whichsoever of the many tongues of Rumour this frothy report originated , it either never reached or never influenced the ears of young Snagsby , who , having wooed and won its fair subject on his arrival at man 's estate , entered into two partnerships at once .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 47]: So now , in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , Mr. Snagsby and the niece are one ; and the niece still cherishes her figure , which , however tastes may differ , is unquestionably so far precious that there is mighty little of it .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 25]: Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are not only one bone and one flesh , but , to the neighbours ' thinking , one voice too .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 20]: That voice , appearing to proceed from Mrs. Snagsby alone , is heard in Cook 's Court very often .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 18]: Mr. Snagsby , otherwise than as he finds expression through these dulcet tones , is rarely heard .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 26]: He is a mild , bald , timid man with a shining head and a scrubby clump of black hair sticking out at the back .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 7]: He tends to meekness and obesity .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 62]: As he stands at his door in Cook 's Court in his grey shop-coat and black calico sleeves , looking up at the clouds , or stands behind a desk in his dark shop with a heavy flat ruler , snipping and slicing at sheepskin in company with his two ` prentices , he is emphatically a retiring and unassuming man .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 67]: From beneath his feet , at such times , as from a shrill ghost unquiet in its grave , there frequently arise complainings and lamentations in the voice already mentioned ; and haply , on some occasions when these reach a sharper pitch than usual , Mr. Snagsby mentions to the ` prentices , `` I think my little woman is a-giving it to Guster ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 55]: This proper name , so used by Mr. Snagsby , has before now sharpened the wit of the Cook 's Courtiers to remark that it ought to be the name of Mrs. Snagsby , seeing that she might with great force and expression be termed a Guster , in compliment to her stormy character .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 96]: It is , however , the possession , and the only possession except fifty shillings per annum and a very small box indifferently filled with clothing , of a lean young woman from a workhouse -LRB- by some supposed to have been christened Augusta -RRB- who , although she was farmed or contracted for during her growing time by an amiable benefactor of his species resident at Tooting , and can not fail to have been developed under the most favourable circumstances , `` has fits , '' which the parish ca n't account for .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 88]: Guster , really aged three or four and twenty , but looking a round ten years older , goes cheap with this unaccountable drawback of fits , and is so apprehensive of being returned on the hands of her patron saint that except when she is found with her head in the pail , or the sink , or the copper , or the dinner , or anything else that happens to be near her at the time of her seizure , she is always at work .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 65]: She is a satisfaction to the parents and guardians of the ` prentices , who feel that there is little danger of her inspiring tender emotions in the breast of youth ; she is a satisfaction to Mrs. Snagsby , who can always find fault with her ; she is a satisfaction to Mr. Snagsby , who thinks it a charity to keep her .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 18]: The law-stationer 's establishment is , in Guster 's eyes , a temple of plenty and splendour .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 34]: She believes the little drawing-room upstairs , always kept , as one may say , with its hair in papers and its pinafore on , to be the most elegant apartment in Christendom .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 43]: The view it commands of Cook 's Court at one end -LRB- not to mention a squint into Cursitor Street -RRB- and of Coavinses ' the sheriff 's officer 's backyard at the other she regards as a prospect of unequalled beauty .
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 39]: The portraits it displays in oil -- and plenty of it too -- of Mr. Snagsby looking at Mrs. Snagsby and of Mrs. Snagsby looking at Mr. Snagsby are in her eyes as achievements of Raphael or Titian .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 9]: Guster has some recompenses for her many privations .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 16]: Mr. Snagsby refers everything not in the practical mysteries of the business to Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 112]: She manages the money , reproaches the tax-gatherers , appoints the times and places of devotion on Sundays , licenses Mr. Snagsby 's entertainments , and acknowledges no responsibility as to what she thinks fit to provide for dinner , insomuch that she is the high standard of comparison among the neighbouring wives a long way down Chancery Lane on both sides , and even out in Holborn , who in any domestic passages of arms habitually call upon their husbands to look at the difference between their -LRB- the wives ' -RRB- position and Mrs. Snagsby 's , and their -LRB- the husbands ' -RRB- behaviour and Mr. Snagsby 's .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 57]: Rumour , always flying bat-like about Cook 's Court and skimming in and out at everybody 's windows , does say that Mrs. Snagsby is jealous and inquisitive and that Mr. Snagsby is sometimes worried out of house and home , and that if he had the spirit of a mouse he would n't stand it .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 54]: It is even observed that the wives who quote him to their self-willed husbands as a shining example in reality look down upon him and that nobody does so with greater superciliousness than one particular lady whose lord is more than suspected of laying his umbrella on her as an instrument of correction .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 96]: But these vague whisperings may arise from Mr. Snagsby 's being in his way rather a meditative and poetical man , loving to walk in Staple Inn in the summer-time and to observe how countrified the sparrows and the leaves are , also to lounge about the Rolls Yard of a Sunday afternoon and to remark -LRB- if in good spirits -RRB- that there were old times once and that you 'd find a stone coffin or two now under that chapel , he 'll be bound , if you was to dig for it .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 96]: He solaces his imagination , too , by thinking of the many Chancellors and Vices , and Masters of the Rolls who are deceased ; and he gets such a flavour of the country out of telling the two ` prentices how he HAS heard say that a brook `` as clear as crystial '' once ran right down the middle of Holborn , when Turnstile really was a turnstile , leading slap away into the meadows -- gets such a flavour of the country out of this that he never wants to go there .
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 25]: The day is closing in and the gas is lighted , but is not yet fully effective , for it is not quite dark .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 31]: Mr. Snagsby standing at his shop-door looking up at the clouds sees a crow who is out late skim westward over the slice of sky belonging to Cook 's Court .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 18]: The crow flies straight across Chancery Lane and Lincoln 's Inn Garden into Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 17]: Here , in a large house , formerly a house of state , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 26]: It is let off in sets of chambers now , and in those shrunken fragments of its greatness , lawyers lie like maggots in nuts .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 62]: But its roomy staircases , passages , and antechambers still remain ; and even its painted ceilings , where Allegory , in Roman helmet and celestial linen , sprawls among balustrades and pillars , flowers , clouds , and big-legged boys , and makes the head ache -- as would seem to be Allegory 's object always , more or less .
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 34]: Here , among his many boxes labelled with transcendent names , lives Mr. Tulkinghorn , when not speechlessly at home in country-houses where the great ones of the earth are bored to death .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 10]: Here he is to-day , quiet at his table .
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 11]: An oyster of the old school whom nobody can open .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 20]: Like as he is to look at , so is his apartment in the dusk of the present afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 15]: Rusty , out of date , withdrawing from attention , able to afford it .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 43]: Heavy , broad-backed , old-fashioned , mahogany-and-horsehair chairs , not easily lifted ; obsolete tables with spindle-legs and dusty baize covers ; presentation prints of the holders of great titles in the last generation or the last but one , environ him .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 31]: A thick and dingy Turkey-carpet muffles the floor where he sits , attended by two candles in old-fashioned silver candlesticks that give a very insufficient light to his large room .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 29]: The titles on the backs of his books have retired into the binding ; everything that can have a lock has got one ; no key is visible .
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 7]: Very few loose papers are about .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 14]: He has some manuscript near him , but is not referring to it .
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 29]: With the round top of an inkstand and two broken bits of sealing-wax he is silently and slowly working out whatever train of indecision is in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 21]: Now tbe inkstand top is in the middle , now the red bit of sealing-wax , now the black bit .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 5]: That 's not it .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 11]: Mr. Tulkinghorn must gather them all up and begin again .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 40]: Here , beneath the painted ceiling , with foreshortened Allegory staring down at his intrusion as if it meant to swoop upon him , and he cutting it dead , Mr. Tulkinghorn has at once his house and office .
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 33]: He keeps no staff , only one middle-aged man , usually a little out at elbows , who sits in a high pew in the hall and is rarely overburdened with business .
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 9]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is not in a common way .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 5]: He wants no clerks .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 14]: He is a great reservoir of confidences , not to be so tapped .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 11]: His clients want HIM ; he is all in all .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 38]: Drafts that he requires to be drawn are drawn by special-pleaders in the temple on mysterious instructions ; fair copies that he requires to be made are made at the stationers ' , expense being no consideration .
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 21]: The middle-aged man in the pew knows scarcely more of the affairs of the peerage than any crossing-sweeper in Holborn .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 21]: The red bit , the black bit , the inkstand top , the other inkstand top , the little sand-box .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 15]: You to the middle , you to the right , you to the left .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 13]: This train of indecision must surely be worked out now or never .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 40]: Mr. Tulkinghorn gets up , adjusts his spectacles , puts on his hat , puts the manuscript in his pocket , goes out , tells the middle-aged man out at elbows , `` I shall be back presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 8]: Very rarely tells him anything more explicit .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 25]: Mr. Tulkinghorn goes , as the crow came -- not quite so straight , but nearly -- to Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 32]: To Snagsby 's , Law -- Stationer 's , Deeds engrossed and copied , Law -- Writing executed in all its branches , & c. , & c. , & c .
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 25]: It is somewhere about five or six o'clock in the afternoon , and a balmy fragrance of warm tea hovers in Cook 's Court .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 7]: It hovers about Snagsby 's door .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 16]: The hours are early there : dinner at half-past one and supper at half-past nine .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 31]: Mr. Snagsby was about to descend into the subterranean regions to take tea when he looked out of his door just now and saw the crow who was out late .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 6]: `` Master at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 89]: Guster is minding the shop , for the ` prentices take tea in the kitchen with Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby ; consequently , the robe-maker 's two daughters , combing their curls at the two glasses in the two second-floor windows of the opposite house , are not driving the two ` prentices to distraction as they fondly suppose , but are merely awakening the unprofitable admiration of Guster , whose hair wo n't grow , and never would , and it is confidently thought , never will .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 6]: `` Master at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 4]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: Master is at home , and Guster will fetch him .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 46]: Guster disappears , glad to get out of the shop , which she regards with mingled dread and veneration as a storehouse of awful implements of the great torture of the law -- a place not to be entered after the gas is turned off .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 13]: Mr. Snagsby appears , greasy , warm , herbaceous , and chewing .
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 8]: Bolts a bit of bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: Says , `` Bless my soul , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 4]: Mr. Tulkinghorn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 12]: `` I want half a word with you , Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 5]: `` Certainly , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 17]: Dear me , sir , why did n't you send your young man round for me ?
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 10]: Pray walk into the back shop , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 7]: Snagsby has brightened in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 16]: The confined room , strong of parchment-grease , is warehouse , counting-house , and copying-office .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 14]: Mr. Tulkinghorn sits , facing round , on a stool at the desk .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 8]: `` Jarndyce and Jarndyce , Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 16]: Mr. Snagsby turns up the gas and coughs behind his hand , modestly anticipating profit .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 24]: Mr. Snagsby , as a timid man , is accustomed to cough with a variety of expressions , and so to save words .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 13]: `` You copied some affidavits in that cause for me lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 9]: `` Yes , sir , we did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 24]: `` There was one of them , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , carelessly feeling -- tight , unopenable oyster of the old school !
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 19]: -- in the wrong coat-pocket , `` the handwriting of which is peculiar , and I rather like .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 29]: As I happened to be passing , and thought I had it about me , I looked in to ask you -- but I have n't got it .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: No matter , any other time will do .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 4]: here it is !
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: I looked in to ask you who copied this . '' '
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 8]: `` Who copied this , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 35]: says Mr. Snagsby , taking it , laying it flat on the desk , and separating all the sheets at once with a twirl and a twist of the left hand peculiar to lawstationers .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 8]: `` We gave this out , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 15]: We were giving out rather a large quantity of work just at that time .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 20]: I can tell you in a moment who copied it , sir , by referring to my book . ''
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 53]: Mr. Snagsby takes his book down from the safe , makes another bolt of the bit of bread and butter which seemed to have stopped short , eyes the affidavit aside , and brings his right forefinger travelling down a page of the book , `` Jewby -- Packer -- Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 3]: `` Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 11]: Here we are , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 5]: `` To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 6]: I might have remembered it .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 23]: This was given out , sir , to a writer who lodges just over on the opposite side of the lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 24]: Mr. Tulkinghorn has seen the entry , found it before the law-stationer , read it while the forefinger was coming down the hill .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 7]: `` WHAT do you call him ?
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 3]: Nemo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 4]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 5]: `` Nemo , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 3]: Forty-two folio .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 22]: Given out on the Wednesday night at eight o'clock , brought in on the Thursday morning at half after nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 4]: `` Nemo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 4]: repeats Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 9]: `` Nemo is Latin for no one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 23]: `` It must be English for some one , sir , I think , '' Mr. Snagsby submits with his deferential cough .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 8]: `` It is a person 's name .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 9]: Here it is , you see , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 3]: Forty-two folio .
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 18]: Given out Wednesday night , eight o'clock ; brought in Thursday morning , half after nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 30]: The tail of Mr. Snagsby 's eye becomes conscious of the head of Mrs. Snagsby looking in at the shop-door to know what he means by deserting his tea .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 23]: Mr. Snagsby addresses an explanatory cough to Mrs. Snagsby , as who should say , `` My dear , a customer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 12]: `` Half after nine , sir , '' repeats Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 31]: `` Our law-writers , who live by job-work , are a queer lot ; and this may not be his name , but it 's the name he goes by .
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 40]: I remember now , sir , that he gives it in a written advertisement he sticks up down at the Rule Office , and the King 's Bench Office , and the Judges ' Chambers , and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 13]: You know the kind of document , sir -- wanting employ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 28]: Mr. Tulkinghorn glances through the little window at the back of Coavinses ' , the sheriff 's officer 's , where lights shine in Coavinses ' windows .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 23]: Coavinses ' coffee-room is at the back , and the shadows of several gentlemen under a cloud loom cloudily upon the blinds .
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 39]: Mr. Snagsby takes the opportunity of slightly turning his head to glance over his shoulder at his little woman and to make apologetic motions with his mouth to this effect : `` Tul-king-horn -- rich -- in-flu-en-tial ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 10]: `` Have you given this man work before ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 4]: asks Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 9]: `` Oh , dear , yes , sir !
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 5]: Work of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 16]: `` Thinking of more important matters , I forget where you said he lived ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 7]: `` Across the lane , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 35]: In fact , he lodges at a -- '' Mr. Snagsby makes another bolt , as if the bit of bread and buffer were insurmountable '' -- at a rag and bottle shop . ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 13]: `` Can you show me the place as I go back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 9]: `` With the greatest pleasure , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 24]: Mr. Snagsby pulls off his sleeves and his grey coat , pulls on his black coat , takes his hat from its peg .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 7]: Here is my little woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 4]: he says aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 31]: `` My dear , will you be so kind as to tell one of the lads to look after the shop while I step across the lane with Mr. Tulkinghorn ?
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 16]: Mrs. Snagsby , sir -- I sha n't be two minutes , my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 37]: Mrs. Snagsby bends to the lawyer , retires behind the counter , peeps at them through the window-blind , goes softly into the back office , refers to the entries in the book still lying open .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 4]: Is evidently curious .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 39]: `` You will find that the place is rough , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby , walking deferentially in the road and leaving the narrow pavement to the lawyer ; `` and the party is very rough .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 11]: But they 're a wild lot in general , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 13]: The advantage of this particular man is that he never wants sleep .
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 22]: He 'll go at it right on end if you want him to , as long as ever you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 15]: It is quite dark now , and the gas-lamps have acquired their full effect .
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 171]: Jostling against clerks going to post the day 's letters , and against counsel and attorneys going home to dinner , and against plaintiffs and defendants and suitors of all sorts , and against the general crowd , in whose way the forensic wisdom of ages has interposed a million of obstacles to the transaction of the commonest business of life ; diving through law and equity , and through that kindred mystery , the street mud , which is made of nobody knows what and collects about us nobody knows whence or how -- we only knowing in general that when there is too much of it we find it necessary to shovel it away -- the lawyer and the law-stationer come to a rag and bottle shop and general emporium of much disregarded merchandise , lying and being in the shadow of the wall of Lincoln 's Inn , and kept , as is announced in paint , to all whom it may concern , by one Krook .
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 14]: `` This is where he lives , sir , '' says the law-stationer .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 11]: `` This is where he lives , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 5]: says the lawyer unconcernedly .
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 5]: `` Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 10]: `` Are you not going in , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 18]: `` No , thank you , no ; I am going on to the Fields at present .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 3]: Good evening .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 4]: Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 15]: Mr. Snagsby lifts his hat and returns to his little woman and his tea .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 13]: But Mr. Tulkinghorn does not go on to the Fields at present .
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 23]: He goes a short way , turns back , comes again to the shop of Mr. Krook , and enters it straight .
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 31]: It is dim enough , with a blot-headed candle or so in the windows , and an old man and a cat sitting in the back part by a fire .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 16]: The old man rises and comes forward , with another blot-headed candle in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 8]: `` Pray is your lodger within ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 8]: `` Male or female , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 4]: says Mr. Krook .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 3]: `` Male .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 7]: The person who does copying . ''
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 8]: Mr. Krook has eyed his man narrowly .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 5]: Knows him by sight .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 9]: Has an indistinct impression of his aristocratic repute .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 11]: `` Did you wish to see him , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 17]: `` It 's what I seldom do myself , '' says Mr. Krook with a grin .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 7]: `` Shall I call him down ?
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 14]: But it 's a weak chance if he 'd come , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 15]: `` I 'll go up to him , then , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 6]: `` Second floor , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 4]: Take the candle .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 4]: Up there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 22]: Mr. Krook , with his cat beside him , stands at the bottom of the staircase , looking after Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 4]: `` Hi-hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 9]: he says when Mr. Tulkinghorn has nearly disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 8]: The lawyer looks down over the hand-rail .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 11]: The cat expands her wicked mouth and snarls at him .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 6]: `` Order , Lady Jane !
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 8]: Behave yourself to visitors , my lady !
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 10]: You know what they say of my lodger ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 10]: whispers Krook , going up a step or two .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 9]: `` What do they say of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 23]: `` They say he has sold himself to the enemy , but you and I know better -- he do n't buy .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 29]: I 'll tell you what , though ; my lodger is so black-humoured and gloomy that I believe he 'd as soon make that bargain as any other .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 8]: Do n't put him out , sir .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 6]: That 's my advice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 10]: Mr. Tulkinghorn with a nod goes on his way .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 11]: He comes to the dark door on the second floor .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 19]: He knocks , receives no answer , opens it , and accidentally extinguishes his candle in doing so .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 18]: The air of the room is almost bad enough to have extinguished it if he had not .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 17]: It is a small room , nearly black with soot , and grease , and dirt .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 26]: In the rusty skeleton of a grate , pinched at the middle as if poverty had gripped it , a red coke fire burns low .
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 24]: In the corner by the chimney stand a deal table and a broken desk , a wilderness marked with a rain of ink .
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 36]: In another corner a ragged old portmanteau on one of the two chairs serves for cabinet or wardrobe ; no larger one is needed , for it collapses like the cheeks of a starved man .
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 23]: The floor is bare , except that one old mat , trodden to shreds of rope-yarn , lies perishing upon the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 42]: No curtain veils the darkness of the night , but the discoloured shutters are drawn together , and through the two gaunt holes pierced in them , famine might be staring in -- the banshee of the man upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 36]: For , on a low bed opposite the fire , a confusion of dirty patchwork , lean-ribbed ticking , and coarse sacking , the lawyer , hesitating just within the doorway , sees a man .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 14]: He lies there , dressed in shirt and trousers , with bare feet .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 39]: He has a yellow look in the spectral darkness of a candle that has guttered down until the whole length of its wick -LRB- still burning -RRB- has doubled over and left a tower of winding-sheet above it .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 33]: His hair is ragged , mingling with his whiskers and his beard -- the latter , ragged too , and grown , like the scum and mist around him , in neglect .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 64]: Foul and filthy as the room is , foul and filthy as the air is , it is not easy to perceive what fumes those are which most oppress the senses in it ; but through the general sickliness and faintness , and the odour of stale tobacco , there comes into the lawyer 's mouth the bitter , vapid taste of opium .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 7]: `` Hallo , my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 12]: he cries , and strikes his iron candlestick against the door .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 8]: He thinks he has awakened his friend .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 14]: He lies a little turned away , but his eyes are surely open .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 7]: `` Hallo , my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 4]: he cries again .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 3]: `` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 3]: Hallo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 36]: As he rattles on the door , the candle which has drooped so long goes out and leaves him in the dark , with the gaunt eyes in the shutters staring down upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 36]: Chapter XI -- Our Dear Brother A touch on the lawyer 's wrinkled hand as he stands in the dark room , irresolute , makes him start and say , `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 21]: `` It 's me , '' returns the old man of the house , whose breath is in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 8]: `` Ca n't you wake him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 10]: `` What have you done with your candle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: `` It 's gone out .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 5]: Here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 22]: Krook takes it , goes to the fire , stoops over the red embers , and tries to get a light .
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 15]: The dying ashes have no light to spare , and his endeavours are vain .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 29]: Muttering , after an ineffectual call to his lodger , that he will go downstairs and bring a lighted candle from the shop , the old man departs .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 26]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , for some new reason that he has , does not await his return in the room , but on the stairs outside .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 23]: The welcome light soon shines upon the wall , as Krook comes slowly up with his green-eyed cat following at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 10]: `` Does the man generally sleep like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 8]: inquired the lawyer in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 17]: I do n't know , '' says Krook , shaking his head and lifting his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 18]: `` I know next to nothing of his habits except that he keeps himself very close . ''
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 9]: Thus whispering , they both go in together .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 19]: As the light goes in , the great eyes in the shutters , darkening , seem to close .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 8]: Not so the eyes upon the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 6]: `` God save us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 4]: exclaims Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 6]: `` He is dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 19]: Krook drops the heavy hand he has taken up so suddenly that the arm swings over the bedside .
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 9]: They look at one another for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 6]: `` Send for some doctor !
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 10]: Call for Miss Flite up the stairs , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 7]: Here 's poison by the bed !
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 9]: Call out for Flite , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 18]: says Krook , with his lean hands spread out above the body like a vampire 's wings .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 13]: Mr. Tulkinghorn hurries to the landing and calls , `` Miss Flite !
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 2]: Flite !
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 9]: Make haste , here , whoever you are !
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 3]: Flite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 26]: Krook follows him with his eyes , and while he is calling , finds opportunity to steal to the old portmanteau and steal back again .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 7]: `` Run , Flite , run !
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 4]: The nearest doctor !
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 3]: Run ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 49]: So Mr. Krook addresses a crazy little woman who is his female lodger , who appears and vanishes in a breath , who soon returns accompanied by a testy medical man brought from his dinner , with a broad , snuffy upper lip and a broad Scotch tongue .
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 3]: `` Ey !
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 23]: Bless the hearts o ' ye , '' says the medical man , looking up at them after a moment 's examination .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 10]: `` He 's just as dead as Phairy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 18]: Mr. Tulkinghorn -LRB- standing by the old portmanteau -RRB- inquires if he has been dead any time .
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 7]: `` Any time , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 5]: says the medical gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 14]: `` It 's probable he wull have been dead aboot three hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 23]: `` About that time , I should say , '' observes a dark young man on the other side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 12]: `` Air you in the maydickle prayfession yourself , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 4]: inquires the first .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 7]: The dark young man says yes .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 24]: `` Then I 'll just tak ' my depairture , '' replies the other , `` for I 'm nae gude here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 15]: With which remark he finishes his brief attendance and returns to finish his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 32]: The dark young surgeon passes the candle across and across the face and carefully examines the law-writer , who has established his pretensions to his name by becoming indeed No one .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 14]: `` I knew this person by sight very well , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 15]: `` He has purchased opium of me for the last year and a half .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 8]: Was anybody present related to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 7]: glancing round upon the three bystanders .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 21]: `` I was his landlord , '' grimly answers Krook , taking the candle from the surgeon 's outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 14]: `` He told me once I was the nearest relation he had . ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 22]: `` He has died , '' says the surgeon , `` of an over-dose of opium , there is no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 8]: The room is strongly flavoured with it .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 23]: There is enough here now , '' taking an old teapot from Mr. Krook , `` to kill a dozen people . ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 11]: `` Do you think he did it on purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 3]: asks Krook .
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 6]: `` Took the over-dose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 13]: Krook almost smacks his lips with the unction of a horrible interest .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 6]: `` I ca n't say .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 18]: I should think it unlikely , as he has been in the habit of taking so much .
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 5]: But nobody can tell .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 9]: He was very poor , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 6]: `` I suppose he was .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 29]: His room -- do n't look rich , '' says Krook , who might have changed eyes with his cat , as he casts his sharp glance around .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 26]: `` But I have never been in it since he had it , and he was too close to name his circumstances to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 9]: `` Did he owe you any rent ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 5]: `` Six weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 8]: `` He will never pay it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 9]: says the young man , resuming his examination .
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 32]: `` It is beyond a doubt that he is indeed as dead as Pharaoh ; and to judge from his appearance and condition , I should think it a happy release .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 20]: Yet he must have been a good figure when a youth , and I dare say , good-looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 31]: He says this , not unfeelingly , while sitting on the bedstead 's edge with his face towards that other face and his hand upon the region of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 24]: `` I recollect once thinking there was something in his manner , uncouth as it was , that denoted a fall in life .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 5]: Was that so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 6]: he continues , looking round .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 25]: Krook replies , `` You might as well ask me to describe the ladies whose heads of hair I have got in sacks downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 31]: Than that he was my lodger for a year and a half and lived -- or did n't live -- by law-writing , I know no more of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 77]: During this dialogue Mr. Tulkinghorn has stood aloof by the old portmanteau , with his hands behind him , equally removed , to all appearance , from all three kinds of interest exhibited near the bed -- from the young surgeon 's professional interest in death , noticeable as being quite apart from his remarks on the deceased as an individual ; from the old man 's unction ; and the little crazy woman 's awe .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 12]: His imperturbable face has been as inexpressive as his rusty clothes .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 13]: One could not even say he has been thinking all this while .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 13]: He has shown neither patience nor impatience , nor attention nor abstraction .
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 8]: He has shown nothing but his shell .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 26]: As easily might the tone of a delicate musical instrument be inferred from its case , as the tone of Mr. Tulkinghorn from his case .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 15]: He now interposes , addressing the young surgeon in his unmoved , professional way .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 38]: `` I looked in here , '' he observes , `` just before you , with the intention of giving this deceased man , whom I never saw alive , some employment at his trade of copying .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 15]: I had heard of him from my stationer -- Snagsby of Cook 's Court .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 19]: Since no one here knows anything about him , it might be as well to send for Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 3]: Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 35]: to the little crazy woman , who has often seen him in court , and whom he has often seen , and who proposes , in frightened dumb-show , to go for the law-stationer .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 6]: `` Suppose you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 20]: While she is gone , the surgeon abandons his hopeless investigation and covers its subject with the patchwork counterpane .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 10]: Mr. Krook and he interchange a word or two .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 15]: Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , but stands , ever , near the old portmanteau .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 13]: Mr. Snagsby arrives hastily in his grey coat and his black sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 22]: `` Dear me , dear me , '' he says ; `` and it has come to this , has it !
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 5]: Bless my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 19]: `` Can you give the person of the house any information about this unfortunate creature , Snagsby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 4]: inquires Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 12]: `` He was in arrears with his rent , it seems .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 10]: And he must be buried , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 37]: `` Well , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby , coughing his apologetic cough behind his hand , `` I really do n't know what advice I could offer , except sending for the beadle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 13]: `` I do n't speak of advice , '' returns Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 27]: `` I could advise -- '' `` No one better , sir , I am sure , '' says Mr. Snagsby , with his deferential cough .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 25]: `` I speak of affording some clue to his connexions , or to where he came from , or to anything concerning him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 55]: `` I assure you , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby after prefacing his reply with his cough of general propitiation , `` that I no more know where he came from than I know -- '' `` Where he has gone to , perhaps , '' suggests the surgeon to help him out .
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 7]: Mr. Tulkinghorn looking at the law-stationer .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 15]: Mr. Krook , with his mouth open , looking for somebody to speak next .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 59]: `` As to his connexions , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby , `` if a person was to say to me , `` Snagsby , here 's twenty thousand pound down , ready for you in the Bank of England if you 'll only name one of 'em , ' I could n't do it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 40]: About a year and a half ago -- to the best of my belief , at the time when he first came to lodge at the present rag and bottle shop -- '' `` That was the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 6]: says Krook with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 108]: `` About a year and a half ago , '' says Mr. Snagsby , strengthened , `` he came into our place one morning after breakfast , and finding my little woman -LRB- which I name Mrs. Snagsby when I use that appellation -RRB- in our shop , produced a specimen of his handwriting and gave her to understand that he was in want of copying work to do and was , not to put too fine a point upon it , '' a favourite apology for plain speaking with Mr. Snagsby , which he always offers with a sort of argumentative frankness , `` hard up !
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 28]: My little woman is not in general partial to strangers , particular -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- when they want anything .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 54]: But she was rather took by something about this person , whether by his being unshaved , or by his hair being in want of attention , or by what other ladies ' reasons , I leave you to judge ; and she accepted of the specimen , and likewise of the address .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 36]: My little woman has n't a good ear for names , '' proceeds Mr. Snagsby after consulting his cough of consideration behind his hand , `` and she considered Nemo equally the same as Nimrod .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 31]: In consequence of which , she got into a habit of saying to me at meals , ` Mr. Snagsby , you have n't found Nimrod any work yet ! '
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 22]: or ` Mr. Snagsby , why did n't you give that eight and thirty Chancery folio in Jarndyce to Nimrod ? '
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 4]: or such like .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 69]: And that is the way he gradually fell into job-work at our place ; and that is the most I know of him except that he was a quick hand , and a hand not sparing of night-work , and that if you gave him out , say , five and forty folio on the Wednesday night , you would have it brought in on the Thursday morning .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 45]: All of which -- '' Mr. Snagsby concludes by politely motioning with his hat towards the bed , as much as to add , `` I have no doubt my honourable friend would confirm if he were in a condition to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 25]: `` Had n't you better see , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn to Krook , `` whether he had any papers that may enlighten you ?
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 14]: There will be an inquest , and you will be asked the question .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 5]: You can read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 17]: `` No , I ca n't , '' returns the old man with a sudden grin .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 16]: `` Snagsby , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` look over the room for him .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 10]: He will get into some trouble or difficulty otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 34]: Being here , I 'll wait if you make haste , and then I can testify on his behalf , if it should ever be necessary , that all was fair and right .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 26]: If you will hold the candle for Mr. Snagsby , my friend , he 'll soon see whether there is anything to help you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 18]: `` In the first place , here 's an old portmanteau , sir , '' says Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: Ah , to be sure , so there is !
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 31]: Mr. Tulkinghorn does not appear to have seen it before , though he is standing so close to it , and though there is very little else , heaven knows .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 14]: The marine-store merchant holds the light , and the law-stationer conducts the search .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 20]: The surgeon leans against the corner of the chimney-piece ; Miss Flite peeps and trembles just within the door .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 57]: The apt old scholar of the old school , with his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees , his large black waistcoat , his long-sleeved black coat , and his wisp of limp white neckerchief tied in the bow the peerage knows so well , stands in exactly the same place and attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 89]: There are some worthless articles of clothing in the old portmanteau ; there is a bundle of pawnbrokers ' duplicates , those turnpike tickets on the road of poverty ; there is a crumpled paper , smelling of opium , on which are scrawled rough memoranda -- as , took , such a day , so many grains ; took , such another day , so many more -- begun some time ago , as if with the intention of being regularly continued , but soon left off .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 21]: There are a few dirty scraps of newspapers , all referring to coroners ' inquests ; there is nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 12]: They search the cupboard and the drawer of the ink-splashed table .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 17]: There is not a morsel of an old letter or of any other writing in either .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 10]: The young surgeon examines the dress on the law-writer .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 11]: A knife and some odd halfpence are all he finds .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 19]: Mr. Snagsby 's suggestion is the practical suggestion after all , and the beadle must be called in .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 19]: So the little crazy lodger goes for the beadle , and the rest come out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 9]: `` Do n't leave the cat there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 11]: says the surgeon ; `` that wo n't do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 24]: Mr. Krook therefore drives her out before him , and she goes furtively downstairs , winding her lithe tail and licking her lips .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 5]: `` Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 12]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn , and goes home to Allegory and meditation .
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 11]: By this time the news has got into the court .
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 36]: Groups of its inhabitants assemble to discuss the thing , and the outposts of the army of observation -LRB- principally boys -RRB- are pushed forward to Mr. Krook 's window , which they closely invest .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 49]: A policeman has already walked up to the room , and walked down again to the door , where he stands like a tower , only condescending to see the boys at his base occasionally ; but whenever he does see them , they quail and fall back .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 46]: Mrs. Perkins , who has not been for some weeks on speaking terms with Mrs. Piper in consequence for an unpleasantness originating in young Perkins ' having `` fetched '' young Piper `` a crack , '' renews her friendly intercourse on this auspicious occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 50]: The potboy at the corner , who is a privileged amateur , as possessing official knowledge of life and having to deal with drunken men occasionally , exchanges confidential communications with the policeman and has the appearance of an impregnable youth , unassailable by truncheons and unconfinable in station-houses .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 25]: People talk across the court out of window , and bare-headed scouts come hurrying in from Chancery Lane to know what 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 31]: The general feeling seems to be that it 's a blessing Mr. Krook war n't made away with first , mingled with a little natural disappointment that he was not .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 11]: In the midst of this sensation , the beadle arrives .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 40]: The beadle , though generally understood in the neighbourhood to be a ridiculous institution , is not without a certain popularity for the moment , if it were only as a man who is going to see the body .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 33]: The policeman considers him an imbecile civilian , a remnant of the barbarous watchmen times , but gives him admission as something that must be borne with until government shall abolish him .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 24]: The sensation is heightened as the tidings spread from mouth to mouth that the beadle is on the ground and has gone in .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 22]: By and by the beadle comes out , once more intensifying the sensation , which has rather languished in the interval .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 26]: He is understood to be in want of witnesses for the inquest to-morrow who can tell the coroner and jury anything whatever respecting the deceased .
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 12]: Is immediately referred to innumerable people who can tell nothing whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 68]: Is made more imbecile by being constantly informed that Mrs. Green 's son `` was a law-writer his-self and knowed him better than anybody , '' which son of Mrs. Green 's appears , on inquiry , to be at the present time aboard a vessel bound for China , three months out , but considered accessible by telegraph on application to the Lords of the Admiralty .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 31]: Beadle goes into various shops and parlours , examining the inhabitants , always shutting the door first , and by exclusion , delay , and general idiotcy exasperating the public .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 7]: Policeman seen to smile to potboy .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 7]: Public loses interest and undergoes reaction .
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 35]: Taunts the beadle in shrill youthful voices with having boiled a boy , choruses fragments of a popular song to that effect and importing that the boy was made into soup for the workhouse .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 46]: Policeman at last finds it necessary to support the law and seize a vocalist , who is released upon the flight of the rest on condition of his getting out of this then , come , and cutting it -- a condition he immediately observes .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 91]: So the sensation dies off for the time ; and the unmoved policeman -LRB- to whom a little opium , more or less , is nothing -RRB- , with his shining hat , stiff stock , inflexible great-coat , stout belt and bracelet , and all things fitting , pursues his lounging way with a heavy tread , beating the palms of his white gloves one against the other and stopping now and then at a street-corner to look casually about for anything between a lost child and a murder .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 48]: Under cover of the night , the feeble-minded beadle comes flitting about Chancery Lane with his summonses , in which every juror 's name is wrongly spelt , and nothing rightly spelt but the beadle 's own name , which nobody can read or wants to know .
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 68]: The summonses served and his witnesses forewarned , the beadle goes to Mr. Krook 's to keep a small appointment he has made with certain paupers , who , presently arriving , are conducted upstairs , where they leave the great eyes in the shutter something new to stare at , in that last shape which earthly lodgings take for No one -- and for Every one .
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 51]: And all that night the coffin stands ready by the old portmanteau ; and the lonely figure on the bed , whose path in life has lain through five and forty years , lies there with no more track behind him that any one can trace than a deserted infant .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 33]: Next day the court is all alive -- is like a fair , as Mrs. Perkins , more than reconciled to Mrs. Piper , says in amicable conversation with that excellent woman .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 69]: The coroner is to sit in the first-floor room at the Sol 's Arms , where the Harmonic Meetings take place twice a week and where the chair is filled by a gentleman of professional celebrity , faced by Little Swills , the comic vocalist , who hopes -LRB- according to the bill in the window -RRB- that his friends will rally round him and support first-rate talent .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 14]: The Sol 's Arms does a brisk stroke of business all the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 33]: Even children so require sustaining under the general excitement that a pieman who has established himself for the occasion at the corner of the court says his brandy-balls go off like smoke .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 48]: What time the beadle , hovering between the door of Mr. Krook 's establishment and the door of the Sol 's Arms , shows the curiosity in his keeping to a few discreet spirits and accepts the compliment of a glass of ale or so in return .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 35]: At the appointed hour arrives the coroner , for whom the jurymen are waiting and who is received with a salute of skittles from the good dry skittle-ground attached to the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 10]: The coroner frequents more public-houses than any man alive .
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 24]: The smell of sawdust , beer , tobacco-smoke , and spirits is inseparable in his vocation from death in its most awful shapes .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 56]: He is conducted by the beadle and the landlord to the Harmonic Meeting Room , where he puts his hat on the piano and takes a Windsor-chair at the head of a long table formed of several short tables put together and ornamented with glutinous rings in endless involutions , made by pots and glasses .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 15]: As many of the jury as can crowd together at the table sit there .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 14]: The rest get among the spittoons and pipes or lean against the piano .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 35]: Over the coroner 's head is a small iron garland , the pendant handle of a bell , which rather gives the majesty of the court the appearance of going to be hanged presently .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 7]: Call over and swear the jury !
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 55]: While the ceremony is in progress , sensation is created by the entrance of a chubby little man in a large shirt-collar , with a moist eye and an inflamed nose , who modestly takes a position near the door as one of the general public , but seems familiar with the room too .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 9]: A whisper circulates that this is Little Swills .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 29]: It is considered not unlikely that he will get up an imitation of the coroner and make it the principal feature of the Harmonic Meeting in the evenlng .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 10]: `` Well , gentlemen -- '' the coroner begins .
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 8]: `` Silence there , will you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 4]: says the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 11]: Not to the coroner , though it might appear so .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 10]: `` Well , gentlemen , '' resumes the coroner .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 15]: `` You are impanelled here to inquire into the death of a certain man .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 36]: Evidence will be given before you as to the circumstances attending that death , and you will give your verdict according to the -- skittles ; they must be stopped , you know , beadle !
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 10]: -- evidence , and not according to anything else .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 13]: The first thing to be done is to view the body . ''
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 6]: `` Make way there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 4]: cries the beadle .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 42]: So they go out in a loose procession , something after the manner of a straggling funeral , and make their inspection in Mr. Krook 's back second floor , from which a few of the jurymen retire pale and precipitately .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 45]: The beadle is very careful that two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons -LRB- for whose accommodation he has provided a special little table near the coroner in the Harmonic Meeting Room -RRB- should see all that is to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 75]: For they are the public chroniclers of such inquiries by the line ; and he is not superior to the universal human infirmity , but hopes to read in print what `` Mooney , the active and intelligent beadle of the district , '' said and did and even aspires to see the name of Mooney as familiarly and patronizingly mentioned as the name of the hangman is , according to the latest examples .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 13]: Little Swills is waiting for the coroner and jury on their return .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 5]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , also .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 24]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is received with distinction and seated near the coroner between that high judicial officer , a bagatelle-board , and the coal-box .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 4]: The inquiry proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 18]: The jury learn how the subject of their inquiry died , and learn no more about him .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 68]: `` A very eminent solicitor is in attendance , gentlemen , '' says the coroner , `` who , I am informed , was accidentally present when discovery of the death was made , but he could only repeat the evidence you have already heard from the surgeon , the landlord , the lodger , and the law-stationer , and it is not necessary to trouble him .
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 10]: Is anybody in attendance who knows anything more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 8]: Mrs. Piper pushed forward by Mrs. Perkins .
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 4]: Mrs. Piper sworn .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 5]: Anastasia Piper , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 3]: Married woman .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 14]: Now , Mrs. Piper , what have you got to say about this ?
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 24]: Why , Mrs. Piper has a good deal to say , chiefly in parentheses and without punctuation , but not much to tell .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 87]: Mrs. Piper lives in the court -LRB- which her husband is a cabinet-maker -RRB- , and it has long been well beknown among the neighbours -LRB- counting from the day next but one before the half-baptizing of Alexander James Piper aged eighteen months and four days old on accounts of not being expected to live such was the sufferings gentlemen of that child in his gums -RRB- as the plaintive -- so Mrs. Piper insists on calling the deceased -- was reported to have sold himself .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 13]: Thinks it was the plaintive 's air in which that report originatinin .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 51]: See the plaintive often and considered as his air was feariocious and not to be allowed to go about some children being timid -LRB- and if doubted hoping Mrs. Perkins may be brought forard for she is here and will do credit to her husband and herself and family -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 38]: Has seen the plaintive wexed and worrited by the children -LRB- for children they will ever be and you can not expect them specially if of playful dispositions to be Methoozellers which you was not yourself -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 45]: On accounts of this and his dark looks has often dreamed as she see him take a pick-axe from his pocket and split Johnny 's head -LRB- which the child knows not fear and has repeatually called after him close at his eels -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 16]: Never however see the plaintive take a pick-axe or any other wepping far from it .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 66]: Has seen him hurry away when run and called after as if not partial to children and never see him speak to neither child nor grown person at any time -LRB- excepting the boy that sweeps the crossing down the lane over the way round the corner which if he was here would tell you that he has been seen a-speaking to him frequent -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 9]: Says the coroner , is that boy here ?
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 13]: Says the beadle , no , sir , he is not here .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 10]: Says the coroner , go and fetch him then .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 16]: In the absence of the active and intelligent , the coroner converses with Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 7]: Here 's the boy , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 13]: Here he is , very muddy , very hoarse , very ragged .
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 4]: Now , boy !
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 5]: But stop a minute .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 2]: Caution .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 11]: This boy must be put through a few preliminary paces .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 4]: Name , Jo .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 7]: Nothing else that he knows on .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 9]: Do n't know that everybody has two names .
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 7]: Never heerd of sich a think .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 12]: Do n't know that Jo is short for a longer name .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 7]: Thinks it long enough for HIM .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 9]: HE do n't find no fault with it .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 3]: Spell it ?
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 6]: HE ca n't spell it .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 9]: No father , no mother , no friends .
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 5]: Never been to school .
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: What 's home ?
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 17]: Knows a broom 's a broom , and knows it 's wicked to tell a lie .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 18]: Do n't recollect who told him about the broom or about the lie , but knows both .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 49]: Ca n't exactly say what 'll be done to him arter he 's dead if he tells a lie to the gentlemen here , but believes it 'll be something wery bad to punish him , and serve him right -- and so he 'll tell the truth .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 9]: `` This wo n't do , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 11]: says the coroner with a melancholy shake of the head .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 14]: `` Do n't you think you can receive his evidence , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 5]: asks an attentive juryman .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 11]: `` Out of the question , '' says the coroner .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 7]: `` You have heard the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 13]: ` Ca n't exactly say ' wo n't do , you know .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 13]: We ca n't take THAT in a court of justice , gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 5]: It 's terrible depravity .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 6]: Put the boy aside . ''
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 21]: Boy put aside , to the great edification of the audience , especially of Little Swills , the comic vocalist .
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 2]: Now .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: Is there any other witness ?
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 4]: No other witness .
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 5]: Very well , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 33]: Here 's a man unknown , proved to have been in the habit of taking opium in large quantities for a year and a half , found dead of too much opium .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 25]: If you think you have any evidence to lead you to the conclusion that he committed suicide , you will come to that conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 18]: If you think it is a case of accidental death , you will find a verdict accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 3]: Verdict accordingly .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 3]: Accidental death .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 3]: No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 6]: Gentlemen , you are discharged .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 3]: Good afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 22]: While the coroner buttons his great-coat , Mr. Tulkinghorn and he give private audience to the rejected witness in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 32]: That graceless creature only knows that the dead man -LRB- whom he recognized just now by his yellow face and black hair -RRB- was sometimes hooted and pursued about the streets .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 58]: That one cold winter night when he , the boy , was shivering in a doorway near his crossing , the man turned to look at him , and came back , and having questioned him and found that he had not a friend in the world , said , `` Neither have I. Not one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 14]: and gave him the price of a supper and a night 's lodging .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 40]: That the man had often spoken to him since and asked him whether he slept sound at night , and how he bore cold and hunger , and whether he ever wished to die , and similar strange questions .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 51]: That when the man had no money , he would say in passing , `` I am as poor as you to-day , Jo , '' but that when he had any , he had always -LRB- as the boy most heartily believes -RRB- been glad to give him some .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 21]: `` He was wery good to me , '' says the boy , wiping his eyes with his wretched sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 24]: `` Wen I see him a-layin ' so stritched out just now , I wished he could have heerd me tell him so .
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 11]: He wos wery good to me , he wos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 21]: As he shuffles downstairs , Mr. Snagsby , lying in wait for him , puts a half-crown in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 39]: `` If you ever see me coming past your crossing with my little woman -- I mean a lady -- '' says Mr. Snagsby with his finger on his nose , `` do n't allude to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 14]: For some little time the jurymen hang about the Sol 's Arms colloquially .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 46]: In the sequel , half-a-dozen are caught up in a cloud of pipe-smoke that pervades the parlour of the Sol 's Arms ; two stroll to Hampstead ; and four engage to go half-price to the play at night , and top up with oysters .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 8]: Little Swills is treated on several hands .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 27]: Being asked what he thinks of the proceedings , characterizes them -LRB- his strength lying in a slangular direction -RRB- as `` a rummy start . ''
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 47]: The landlord of the Sol 's Arms , finding Little Swills so popular , commends him highly to the jurymen and public , observing that for a song in character he do n't know his equal and that that man 's character-wardrobe would fill a cart .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 22]: Thus , gradually the Sol 's Arms melts into the shadowy night and then flares out of it strong in gas .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 34]: The Harmonic Meeting hour arriving , the gentleman of professional celebrity takes the chair , is faced -LRB- red-faced -RRB- by Little Swills ; their friends rally round them and support first-rate talent .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 39]: In the zenith of the evening , Little Swills says , `` Gentlemen , if you 'll permit me , I 'll attempt a short description of a scene of real life that came off here to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 69]: Is much applauded and encouraged ; goes out of the room as Swills ; comes in as the coroner -LRB- not the least in the world like him -RRB- ; describes the inquest , with recreative intervals of piano-forte accompaniment , to the refrain : With his -LRB- the coroner 's -RRB- tippy tol li doll , tippy tol lo doll , tippy tol li doll , Dee !
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 17]: The jingling piano at last is silent , and the Harmonic friends rally round their pillows .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 35]: Then there is rest around the lonely figure , now laid in its last earthly habitation ; and it is watched by the gaunt eyes in the shutters through some quiet hours of night .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 57]: If this forlorn man could have been prophetically seen lying here by the mother at whose breast he nestled , a little child , with eyes upraised to her loving face , and soft hand scarcely knowing how to close upon the neck to which it crept , what an impossibility the vision would have seemed !
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 35]: Oh , if in brighter days the now-extinguished fire within him ever burned for one woman who held him in her heart , where is she , while these ashes are above the ground !
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 48]: It is anything but a night of rest at Mr. Snagsby 's , in Cook 's Court , where Guster murders sleep by going , as Mr. Snagsby himself allows -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- out of one fit into twenty .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 31]: The occasion of this seizure is that Guster has a tender heart and a susceptible something that possibly might have been imagination , but for Tooting and her patron saint .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 130]: Be it what it may , now , it was so direfully impressed at tea-time by Mr. Snagsby 's account of the inquiry at which he had assisted that at supper-time she projected herself into the kitchen , preceded by a flying Dutch cheese , and fell into a fit of unusual duration , which she only came out of to go into another , and another , and so on through a chain of fits , with short intervals between , of which she has pathetically availed herself by consuming them in entreaties to Mrs. Snagsby not to give her warning `` when she quite comes to , '' and also in appeals to the whole establishment to lay her down on the stones and go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 56]: Hence , Mr. Snagsby , at last hearing the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street go into that disinterested ecstasy of his on the subject of daylight , says , drawing a long breath , though the most patient of men , `` I thought you was dead , I am sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 50]: What question this enthusiastic fowl supposes he settles when he strains himself to such an extent , or why he should thus crow -LRB- so men crow on various triumphant public occasions , however -RRB- about what can not be of any moment to him , is his affair .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 13]: It is enough that daylight comes , morning comes , noon comes .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 83]: Then the active and intelligent , who has got into the morning papers as such , comes with his pauper company to Mr. Krook 's and bears off the body of our dear brother here departed to a hemmed-in churchyard , pestiferous and obscene , whence malignant diseases are communicated to the bodies of our dear brothers and sisters who have not departed , while our dear brothers and sisters who hang about official back-stairs -- would to heaven they HAD departed !
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 7]: -- are very complacent and agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 34]: Into a beastly scrap of ground which a Turk would reject as a savage abomination and a Caffre would shudder at , they bring our dear brother here departed to receive Christian burial .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 96]: With houses looking on , on every side , save where a reeking little tunnel of a court gives access to the iron gate -- with every villainy of life in action close on death , and every poisonous element of death in action close on life -- here they lower our dear brother down a foot or two , here sow him in corruption , to be raised in corruption : an avenging ghost at many a sick-bedside , a shameful testimony to future ages how civilization and barbarism walked this boastful island together .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 24]: Come night , come darkness , for you can not come too soon or stay too long by such a place as this !
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 30]: Come , straggling lights into the windows of the ugly houses ; and you who do iniquity therein , do it at least with this dread scene shut out !
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 27]: Come , flame of gas , burning so sullenly above the iron gate , on which the poisoned air deposits its witch-ointment slimy to the touch !
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 16]: It is well that you should call to every passerby , `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 18]: With the night comes a slouching figure through the tunnel-court to the outside of the iron gate .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 22]: It holds the gate with its hands and looks in between the bars , stands looking in for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 20]: It then , with an old broom it carries , softly sweeps the step and makes the archway clean .
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 19]: It does so very busily and trimly , looks in again a little while , and so departs .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 6]: Jo , is it thou ?
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 33]: Though a rejected witness , who `` ca n't exactly say '' what will be done to him in greater hands than men 's , thou art not quite in outer darkness .
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 28]: There is something like a distant ray of light in thy muttered reason for this : `` He wos wery good to me , he wos ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 24]: Chapter XII -- On the Watch It has left off raining down in Lincolnshire at last , and Chesney Wold has taken heart .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 20]: Mrs. Rouncewell is full of hospitable cares , for Sir Leicester and my Lady are coming home from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 16]: The fashionable intelligence has found it out and communicates the glad tidings to benighted England .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 47]: It has also found out that they will entertain a brilliant and distinguished circle of the ELITE of the BEAU MONDE -LRB- the fashionable intelligence is weak in English , but a giant refreshed in French -RRB- at the ancient and hospitable family seat in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 56]: For the greater honour of the brilliant and distinguished circle , and of Chesney Wold into the bargain , the broken arch of the bridge in the park is mended ; and the water , now retired within its proper limits and again spanned gracefully , makes a figure in the prospect from the house .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 24]: The clear , cold sunshine glances into the brittle woods and approvingly beholds the sharp wind scattering the leaves and drying the moss .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 25]: It glides over the park after the moving shadows of the clouds , and chases them , and never catches them , all day .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 23]: It looks in at the windows and touches the ancestral portraits with bars and patches of brightness never contemplated by the painters .
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 32]: Athwart the picture of my Lady , over the great chimney-piece , it throws a broad bend-sinister of light that strikes down crookedly into the hearth and seems to rend it .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 41]: Through the same cold sunshine and the same sharp wind , my Lady and Sir Leicester , in their travelling chariot -LRB- my Lady 's woman and Sir Leicester 's man affectionate in the rumble -RRB- , start for home .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 97]: With a considerable amount of jingling and whip-cracking , and many plunging demonstrations on the part of two bare-backed horses and two centaurs with glazed hats , jack-boots , and flowing manes and tails , they rattle out of the yard of the Hotel Bristol in the Place Vendome and canter between the sun-and-shadow-chequered colonnade of the Rue de Rivoli and the garden of the ill-fated palace of a headless king and queen , off by the Place of Concord , and the Elysian Fields , and the Gate of the Star , out of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 24]: Sooth to say , they can not go away too fast , for even here my Lady Dedlock has been bored to death .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 21]: Concert , assembly , opera , theatre , drive , nothing is new to my Lady under the worn-out heavens .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 149]: Only last Sunday , when poor wretches were gay -- within the walls playing with children among the clipped trees and the statues in the Palace Garden ; walking , a score abreast , in the Elysian Fields , made more Elysian by performing dogs and wooden horses ; between whiles filtering -LRB- a few -RRB- through the gloomy Cathedral of Our Lady to say a word or two at the base of a pillar within flare of a rusty little gridiron-full of gusty little tapers ; without the walls encompassing Paris with dancing , love-making , wine-drinking , tobacco-smoking , tomb-visiting , billiard card and domino playing , quack-doctoring , and much murderous refuse , animate and inanimate -- only last Sunday , my Lady , in the desolation of Boredom and the clutch of Giant Despair , almost hated her own maid for being in spirits .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 12]: She can not , therefore , go too fast from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 50]: Weariness of soul lies before her , as it lies behind -- her Ariel has put a girdle of it round the whole earth , and it can not be unclasped -- but the imperfect remedy is always to fly from the last place where it has been experienced .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 20]: Fling Paris back into the distance , then , exchanging it for endless avenues and cross-avenues of wintry trees !
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 63]: And , when next beheld , let it be some leagues away , with the Gate of the Star a white speck glittering in the sun , and the city a mere mound in a plain -- two dark square towers rising out of it , and light and shadow descending on it aslant , like the angels in Jacob 's dream !
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 13]: Sir Leicester is generally in a complacent state , and rarely bored .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 16]: When he has nothing else to do , he can always contemplate his own greatness .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 15]: It is a considerable advantage to a man to have so inexhaustible a subject .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 22]: After reading his letters , he leans back in his corner of the carriage and generally reviews his importance to society .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 12]: `` You have an unusual amount of correspondence this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 8]: says my Lady after a long time .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 6]: She is fatigued with reading .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 9]: Has almost read a page in twenty miles .
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 7]: `` Nothing in it , though .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 4]: Nothing whatever . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 15]: `` I saw one of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's long effusions , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 12]: `` You see everything , '' says Sir Leicester with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 4]: sighs my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 10]: `` He is the most tiresome of men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 31]: `` He sends -- I really beg your pardon -- he sends , '' says Sir Leicester , selecting the letter and unfolding it , `` a message to you .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 18]: Our stopping to change horses as I came to his postscript drove it out of my memory .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 7]: I beg you 'll excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 25]: He says -- '' Sir Leicester is so long in taking out his eye-glass and adjusting it that my Lady looks a little irritated .
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 25]: `` He says ` In the matter of the right of way -- ' I beg your pardon , that 's not the place .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 5]: He says -- yes !
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 5]: Here I have it !
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 24]: He says , ' I beg my respectful compliments to my Lady , who , I hope , has benefited by the change .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 46]: Will you do me the favour to mention -LRB- as it may interest her -RRB- that I have something to tell her on her return in reference to the person who copied the affidavit in the Chancery suit , which so powerfully stimulated her curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 7]: I have seen him . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 12]: My Lady , leaning forward , looks out of her window .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 11]: `` That 's the message , '' observes Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 21]: `` I should like to walk a little , '' says my Lady , still looking out of her window .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 4]: `` Walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 9]: repeats Sir Leicester in a tone of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 17]: `` I should like to walk a little , '' says my Lady with unmistakable distinctness .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 8]: `` Please to stop the carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 34]: The carriage is stopped , the affectionate man alights from the rumble , opens the door , and lets down the steps , obedient to an impatient motion of my Lady 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 31]: My Lady alights so quickly and walks away so quickly that Sir Leicester , for all his scrupulous politeness , is unable to assist her , and is left behind .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 16]: A space of a minute or two has elapsed before he comes up with her .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 34]: She smiles , looks very handsome , takes his arm , lounges with him for a quarter of a mile , is very much bored , and resumes her seat in the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 33]: The rattle and clatter continue through the greater part of three days , with more or less of bell-jingling and whip-cracking , and more or less plunging of centaurs and bare-backed horses .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 19]: Their courtly politeness to each other at the hotels where they tarry is the theme of general admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 42]: Though my Lord IS a little aged for my Lady , says Madame , the hostess of the Golden Ape , and though he might be her amiable father , one can see at a glance that they love each other .
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 25]: One observes my Lord with his white hair , standing , hat in hand , to help my Lady to and from the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 28]: One observes my Lady , how recognisant of my Lord 's politeness , with an inclination of her gracious head and the concession of her so-genteel fingers !
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 4]: It is ravishing !
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 18]: The sea has no appreciation of great men , but knocks them about like the small fry .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 29]: It is habitually hard upon Sir Leicester , whose countenance it greenly mottles in the manner of sage-cheese and in whose aristocratic system it effects a dismal revolution .
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 9]: It is the Radical of Nature to him .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 35]: Nevertheless , his dignity gets over it after stopping to refit , and he goes on with my Lady for Chesney Wold , lying only one night in London on the way to Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 66]: Through the same cold sunlight , colder as the day declines , and through the same sharp wind , sharper as the separate shadows of bare trees gloom together in the woods , and as the Ghost 's Walk , touched at the western corner by a pile of fire in the sky , resigns itself to coming night , they drive into the park .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 88]: The rooks , swinging in their lofty houses in the elm-tree avenue , seem to discuss the question of the occupancy of the carriage as it passes underneath , some agreeing that Sir Leicester and my Lady are come down , some arguing with malcontents who wo n't admit it , now all consenting to consider the question disposed of , now all breaking out again in violent debate , incited by one obstinate and drowsy bird who will persist in putting in a last contradictory croak .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 44]: Leaving them to swing and caw , the travelling chariot rolls on to the house , where fires gleam warmly through some of the windows , though not through so many as to give an inhabited expression to the darkening mass of front .
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 11]: But the brilliant and distinguished circle will soon do that .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 20]: Mrs. Rouncewell is in attendance and receives Sir Leicester 's customary shake of the hand with a profound curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Mrs. Rouncewell ?
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 8]: I am glad to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 18]: `` I hope I have the honour of welcoming you in good health , Sir Leicester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 9]: `` In excellent health , Mrs. Rouncewell . ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 16]: `` My Lady is looking charmingly well , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell with another curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 23]: My Lady signifies , without profuse expenditure of words , that she is as wearily well as she can hope to be .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 41]: But Rosa is in the distance , behind the housekeeper ; and my Lady , who has not subdued the quickness of her observation , whatever else she may have conquered , asks , `` Who is that girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 10]: `` A young scholar of mine , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 3]: Rosa . ''
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 7]: `` Come here , Rosa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 12]: Lady Dedlock beckons her , with even an appearance of interest .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 14]: `` Why , do you know how pretty you are , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 11]: she says , touching her shoulder with her two forefingers .
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 19]: Rosa , very much abashed , says , `` No , if you please , my Lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 22]: and glances up , and glances down , and do n't know where to look , but looks all the prettier .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 7]: `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 7]: `` Nineteen , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 9]: `` Nineteen , '' repeats my Lady thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 12]: `` Take care they do n't spoil you by flattery . ''
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 7]: `` Yes , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 34]: My Lady taps her dimpled cheek with the same delicate gloved fingers and goes on to the foot of the oak staircase , where Sir Leicester pauses for her as her knightly escort .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 44]: A staring old Dedlock in a panel , as large as life and as dull , looks as if he did n't know what to make of it , which was probably his general state of mind in the days of Queen Elizabeth .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 20]: That evening , in the housekeeper 's room , Rosa can do nothing but murmur Lady Dedlock 's praises .
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 31]: She is so affable , so graceful , so beautiful , so elegant ; has such a sweet voice and such a thrilling touch that Rosa can feel it yet !
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 19]: Mrs. Rouncewell confirms all this , not without personal pride , reserving only the one point of affability .
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 10]: Mrs. Rouncewell is not quite sure as to that .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 62]: Heaven forbid that she should say a syllable in dispraise of any member of that excellent family , above all , of my Lady , whom the whole world admires ; but if my Lady would only be `` a little more free , '' not quite so cold and distant , Mrs. Rounceweil thinks she would be more affable . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 49]: 'T is almost a pity , '' Mrs. Rouncewell adds -- only `` almost '' because it borders on impiety to suppose that anything could be better than it is , in such an express dispensation as the Dedlock affairs -- `` that my Lady has no family .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 32]: If she had had a daughter now , a grown young lady , to interest her , I think she would have had the only kind of excellence she wants . ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 14]: `` Might not that have made her still more proud , grandmother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 19]: says Watt , who has been home and come back again , he is such a good grandson .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 42]: `` More and most , my dear , '' returns the housekeeper with dignity , `` are words it 's not my place to use -- nor so much as to hear -- applied to any drawback on my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 8]: `` I beg your pardon , grandmother .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 10]: But she is proud , is she not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 11]: `` If she is , she has reason to be .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 10]: The Dedlock family have always reason to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 31]: `` Well , '' says Watt , `` it 's to be hoped they line out of their prayer-books a certain passage for the common people about pride and vainglory .
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 5]: Forgive me , grandmother !
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 5]: Only a joke ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 18]: `` Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , my dear , are not fit subjects for joking . ''
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 22]: `` Sir Leicester is no joke by any means , '' says Watt , `` and I humbly ask his pardon .
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 42]: I suppose , grandmother , that even with the family and their guests down here , there is no ojection to my prolonging my stay at the Dedlock Arms for a day or two , as any other traveller might ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 11]: `` Surely , none in the world , child . ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 28]: `` I am glad of that , '' says Watt , `` because I have an inexpressible desire to extend my knowledge of this beautiful neighbourhood . ''
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 16]: He happens to glance at Rosa , who looks down and is very shy indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 40]: But according to the old superstition , it should be Rosa 's ears that burn , and not her fresh bright cheeks , for my Lady 's maid is holding forth about her at this moment with surpassing energy .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 58]: My Lady 's maid is a Frenchwoman of two and thirty , from somewhere in the southern country about Avignon and Marseilles , a large-eyed brown woman with black hair who would be handsome but for a certain feline mouth and general uncomfortable tightness of face , rendering the jaws too eager and the skull too prominent .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 49]: There is something indefinably keen and wan about her anatomy , and she has a watchful way of looking out of the corners of her eyes without turning her head which could be pleasantly dispensed with , especially when she is in an ill humour and near knives .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 31]: Through all the good taste of her dress and little adornments , these objections so express themselves that she seems to go about like a very neat she-wolf imperfectly tamed .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 81]: Besides being accomplished in all the knowledge appertaining to her post , she is almost an Englishwoman in her acquaintance with the language ; consequently , she is in no want of words to shower upon Rosa for having attracted my Lady 's attention , and she pours them out with such grim ridicule as she sits at dinner that her companion , the affectionate man , is rather relieved when she arrives at the spoon stage of that performance .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 45]: She , Hortense , been in my Lady 's service since five years and always kept at the distance , and this doll , this puppet , caressed -- absolutely caressed -- by my Lady on the moment of her arriving at the house !
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 6]: Ha , ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 13]: `` And do you know how pretty you are , child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 7]: `` No , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 5]: You are right there !
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 9]: `` And how old are you , child !
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 14]: And take care they do not spoil you by flattery , child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 5]: Oh , how droll !
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 7]: It is the BEST thing altogether .
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 96]: In short , it is such an admirable thing that Mademoiselle Hortense ca n't forget it ; but at meals for days afterwards , even among her countrywomen and others attached in like capacity to the troop of visitors , relapses into silent enjoyment of the joke -- an enjoyment expressed , in her own convivial manner , by an additional tightness of face , thin elongation of compressed lips , and sidewise look , which intense appreciation of humour is frequently reflected in my Lady 's mirrors when my Lady is not among them .
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 20]: All the mirrors in the house are brought into action now , many of them after a long blank .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 81]: They reflect handsome faces , simpering faces , youthful faces , faces of threescore and ten that will not submit to be old ; the entire collection of faces that have come to pass a January week or two at Chesney Wold , and which the fashionable intelligence , a mighty hunter before the Lord , hunts with a keen scent , from their breaking cover at the Court of St. James 's to their being run down to death .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 8]: The place in Lincolnshire is all alive .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 31]: By day guns and voices are heard ringing in the woods , horsemen and carriages enliven the park roads , servants and hangers-on pervade the village and the Dedlock Arms .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 42]: Seen by night from distant openings in the trees , the row of windows in the long drawing-room , where my Lady 's picture hangs over the great chimney-piece , is like a row of jewels set in a black frame .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 29]: On Sunday the chill little church is almost warmed by so much gallant company , and the general flavour of the Dedlock dust is quenched in delicate perfumes .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 25]: The brilliant and distinguished circle comprehends within it no contracted amount of education , sense , courage , honour , beauty , and virtue .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 16]: Yet there is something a little wrong about it in despite of its immense advantages .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 5]: What can it be ?
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 2]: Dandyism ?
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 37]: There is no King George the Fourth now -LRB- more the pity -RRB- to set the dandy fashion ; there are no clear-starched jack-towel neckcloths , no short-waisted coats , no false calves , no stays .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 35]: There are no caricatures , now , of effeminate exquisites so arrayed , swooning in opera boxes with excess of delight and being revived by other dainty creatures poking long-necked scent-bottles at their noses .
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 40]: There is no beau whom it takes four men at once to shake into his buckskins , or who goes to see all the executions , or who is troubled with the self-reproach of having once consumed a pea .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 49]: But is there dandyism in the brilliant and distinguished circle notwithstanding , dandyism of a more mischievous sort , that has got below the surface and is doing less harmless things than jack-towelling itself and stopping its own digestion , to which no rational person need particularly object ?
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 4]: Why , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 6]: It can not be disguised .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 30]: There ARE at Chesney Wold this January week some ladies and gentlemen of the newest fashion , who have set up a dandyism -- in religion , for instance .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 55]: Who in mere lackadaisical want of an emotion have agreed upon a little dandy talk about the vulgar wanting faith in things in general , meaning in the things that have been tried and found wanting , as though a low fellow should unaccountably lose faith in a bad shilling after finding it out !
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 28]: Who would make the vulgar very picturesque and faithful by putting back the hands upon the clock of time and cancelling a few hundred years of history .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 37]: There are also ladies and gentlemen of another fashion , not so new , but very elegant , who have agreed to put a smooth glaze on the world and to keep down all its realities .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 9]: For whom everything must be languid and pretty .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 8]: Who have found out the perpetual stoppage .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 12]: Who are to rejoice at nothing and be sorry for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 9]: Who are not to be disturbed by ideas .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 51]: On whom even the fine arts , attending in powder and walking backward like the Lord Chamberlain , must array themselves in the milliners ' and tailors ' patterns of past generations and be particularly careful not to be in earnest or to receive any impress from the moving age .
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 47]: Then there is my Lord Boodle , of considerable reputation with his party , who has known what office is and who tells Sir Leicester Dedlock with much gravity , after dinner , that he really does not see to what the present age is tending .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 32]: A debate is not what a debate used to be ; the House is not what the House used to be ; even a Cabinet is not what it formerly was .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 74]: He perceives with astonishment that supposing the present government to be overthrown , the limited choice of the Crown , in the formation of a new ministry , would lie between Lord Coodle and Sir Thomas Doodle -- supposing it to be impossible for the Duke of Foodle to act with Goodle , which may be assumed to be the case in consequence of the breach arising out of that affair with Hoodle .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 42]: Then , giving the Home Department and the leadership of the House of Commons to Joodle , the Exchequer to Koodle , the Colonies to Loodle , and the Foreign Office to Moodle , what are you to do with Noodle ?
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 17]: You ca n't offer him the Presidency of the Council ; that is reserved for Poodle .
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 19]: You ca n't put him in the Woods and Forests ; that is hardly good enough for Quoodle .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 3]: What follows ?
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 33]: That the country is shipwrecked , lost , and gone to pieces -LRB- as is made manifest to the patriotism of Sir Leicester Dedlock -RRB- because you ca n't provide for Noodle !
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 52]: On the other hand , the Right Honourable William Buffy , M.P. , contends across the table with some one else that the shipwreck of the country -- about which there is no doubt ; it is only the manner of it that is in question -- is attributable to Cuffy .
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 102]: If you had done with Cuffy what you ought to have done when he first came into Parliament , and had prevented him from going over to Duffy , you would have got him into alliance with Fuffy , you would have had with you the weight attaching as a smart debater to Guffy , you would have brought to bear upon the elections the wealth of Huffy , you would have got in for three counties Juffy , Kuffy , and Luffy , and you would have strengthened your administration by the official knowledge and the business habits of Muffy .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 19]: All this , instead of being as you now are , dependent on the mere caprice of Puffy !
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 50]: As to this point , and as to some minor topics , there are differences of opinion ; but it is perfectly clear to the brilliant and distinguished circle , all round , that nobody is in question but Boodle and his retinue , and Buffy and HIS retinue .
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 12]: These are the great actors for whom the stage is reserved .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 79]: A People there are , no doubt -- a certain large number of supernumeraries , who are to be occasionally addressed , and relied upon for shouts and choruses , as on the theatrical stage ; but Boodle and Buffy , their followers and families , their heirs , executors , administrators , and assigns , are the born first-actors , managers , and leaders , and no others can appear upon the scene for ever and ever .
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 29]: In this , too , there is perhaps more dandyism at Chesney Wold than the brilliant and distinguished circle will find good for itself in the long run .
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 33]: For it is , even with the stillest and politest circles , as with the circle the necromancer draws around him -- very strange appearances may be seen in active motion outside .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 21]: With this difference , that being realities and not phantoms , there is the greater danger of their breaking in .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 33]: Chesney Wold is quite full anyhow , so full that a burning sense of injury arises in the breasts of ill-lodged ladies ' - maids , and is not to he extinguished .
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 6]: Only one room is empty .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 23]: It is a turret chamber of the third order of merit , plainly but comfortably furnished and having an old-fashioned business air .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 23]: It is Mr. Tulkinghorn 's room , and is never bestowed on anybody else , for he may come at any time .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: He is not come yet .
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 71]: It is his quiet habit to walk across the park from the village in fine weather , to drop into this room as if he had never been out of it since he was last seen there , to request a servant to inform Sir Leicester that he is arrived in case he should be wanted , and to appear ten minutes before dinner in the shadow of the library-door .
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 46]: He sleeps in his turret with a complaining flag-staff over his head , and has some leads outside on which , any fine morning when he is down here , his black figure may be seen walking before breakfast like a larger species of rook .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 23]: Every day before dinner , my Lady looks for him in the dusk of the library , but he is not there .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 35]: Every day at dinner , my Lady glances down the table for the vacant place that would be waiting to receive him if he had just arrived , but there is no vacant place .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 16]: Every night my Lady casually asks her maid , `` Is Mr. Tulkinghorn come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 16]: Every night the answer is , `` No , my Lady , not yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 41]: One night , while having her hair undressed , my Lady loses herself in deep thought after this reply until she sees her own brooding face in the opposite glass , and a pair of black eyes curiously observing her .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 25]: `` Be so good as to attend , '' says my Lady then , addressing the reflection of Hortense , `` to your business .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 10]: You can contemplate your beauty at another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 3]: `` Pardon !
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 8]: It was your Ladyship 's beauty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 17]: `` That , '' says my Lady , `` you need n't contemplate at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 48]: At length , one afternoon a little before sunset , when the bright groups of figures which have for the last hour or two enlivened the Ghost 's Walk are all dispersed and only Sir Leicester and my Lady remain upon the terrace , Mr. Tulkinghorn appears .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 18]: He comes towards them at his usual methodical pace , which is never quickened , never slackened .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 30]: He wears his usual expressionless mask -- if it be a mask -- and carries family secrets in every limb of his body and every crease of his dress .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 25]: Whether his whole soul is devoted to the great or whether he yields them nothing beyond the services he sells is his personal secret .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 28]: He keeps it , as he keeps the secrets of his clients ; he is his own client in that matter , and will never betray himself .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 10]: `` How do you do , Mr. Tulkinghorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 9]: says Sir Leicester , giving him his hand .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 6]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 6]: Sir Leicester is quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 6]: My Lady is quite well .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 4]: All highly satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 19]: The lawyer , with his hands behind him , walks at Sir Leicester 's side along the terrace .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 8]: My Lady walks upon the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 11]: `` We expected you before , '' says Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 4]: A gracious observation .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 28]: As much as to say , `` Mr. Tulkinghorn , we remember your existence when you are not here to remind us of it by your presence .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 16]: We bestow a fragment of our minds upon you , sir , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 16]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , comprehending it , inclines his head and says he is much obliged .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 33]: `` I should have come down sooner , '' he explains , `` but that I have been much engaged with those matters in the several suits between yourself and Boythorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 16]: `` A man of a very ill-regulated mind , '' observes Sir Leicester with severity .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 9]: `` An extremely dangerous person in any community .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 11]: A man of a very low character of mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 10]: `` He is obstinate , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 23]: `` It is natural to such a man to be so , '' says Sir Leicester , looking most profoundly obstinate himself .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 12]: `` I am not at all surprised to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 20]: `` The only question is , '' pursues the lawyer , `` whether you will give up anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 10]: `` No , sir , '' replies Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 5]: I give up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 9]: `` I do n't mean anything of importance .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 12]: That , of course , I know you would not abandon .
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 7]: I mean any minor point . ''
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 22]: `` Mr. Tulkinghorn , '' returns Sir Leicester , `` there can be no minor point between myself and Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 52]: If I go farther , and observe that I can not readily conceive how ANY right of mine can be a minor point , I speak not so much in reference to myself as an individual as in reference to the family position I have it in charge to maintain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 7]: Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head again .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 11]: `` I have now my instructions , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 37]: `` Mr. Boythorn will give us a good deal of trouble -- '' `` It is the character of such a mind , Mr. Tulkinghorn , '' Sir Leicester interrupts him , `` TO give trouble .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 7]: An exceedingly ill-conditioned , levelling person .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 50]: A person who , fifty years ago , would probably have been tried at the Old Bailey for some demagogue proceeding , and severely punished -- if not , '' adds Sir Leicester after a moment 's pause , `` if not hanged , drawn , and quartered . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 31]: Sir Leicester appears to discharge his stately breast of a burden in passing this capital sentence , as if it were the next satisfactory thing to having the sentence executed .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 19]: `` But night is coming on , '' says he , `` and my Lady will take cold .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 9]: My dear , let us go in . ''
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 17]: As they turn towards the hall-door , Lady Dedlock addresses Mr. Tulkinghorn for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 17]: `` You sent me a message respecting the person whose writing I happened to inquire about .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 15]: It was like you to remember the circumstance ; I had quite forgotten it .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: Your message reminded me of it again .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 21]: I ca n't imagine what association I had with a hand like that , but I surely had some . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 6]: `` You had some ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 4]: Mr. Tulkinghorn repeats .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 5]: returns my Lady carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 9]: `` I think I must have had some .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 21]: And did you really take the trouble to find out the writer of that actual thing -- what is it !
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 4]: -- affidavit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 6]: `` How very odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 20]: They pass into a sombre breakfast-room on the ground floor , lighted in the day by two deep windows .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 5]: It is now twilight .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 47]: The fire glows brightly on the panelled wall and palely on the window-glass , where , through the cold reflection of the blaze , the colder landscape shudders in the wind and a grey mist creeps along , the only traveller besides the waste of clouds .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 20]: My Lady lounges in a great chair in the chimney-corner , and Sir Leicester takes another great chair opposite .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 19]: The lawyer stands before the fire with his hand out at arm 's length , shading his face .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 9]: He looks across his arm at my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' he says , `` I inquired about the man , and found him .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 25]: And , what is very strange , I found him -- '' `` Not to be any out-of-the-way person , I am afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 5]: Lady Dedlock languidly anticipates .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 7]: `` I found him dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: remonstrated Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 17]: Not so much shocked by the fact as by the fact of the fact being mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 21]: `` I was directed to his lodging -- a miserable , poverty-stricken place -- and I found him dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 14]: `` You will excuse me , Mr. Tulkinghorn , '' observes Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 29]: `` I think the less said -- '' `` Pray , Sir Leicester , let me hear the story out '' -LRB- it is my Lady speaking -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 9]: `` It is quite a story for twilight .
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 4]: How very shocking !
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 3]: Dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 12]: Mr , Tulkinghorn re-asserts it by another inclination of his head .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 14]: `` Whether by his own hand -- '' `` Upon my honour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 4]: cries Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 4]: `` Really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 9]: `` Do let me hear the story ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 4]: says my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 8]: `` Whatever you desire , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 15]: But , I must say -- '' `` No , you must n't say !
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 7]: Go on , Mr. Tulkinghorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 65]: Sir Leicester 's gallantry concedes the point , though he still feels that to bring this sort of squalor among the upper classes is really -- really -- `` I was about to say , '' resumes the lawyer with undisturbed calmness , `` that whether he had died by his own hand or not , it was beyond my power to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 36]: I should amend that phrase , however , by saying that he had unquestionably died of his own act , though whether by his own deliberate intention or by mischance can never certainly be known .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 13]: The coroner 's jury found that he took the poison accidentally . ''
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 19]: `` And what kind of man , '' my Lady asks , `` was this deplorable creature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 15]: `` Very difficult to say , '' returns the lawyer , shaking his bead .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 35]: `` He had lived so wretchedly and was so neglected , with his gipsy colour and his wild black hair and beard , that I should have considered him the commonest of the common .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 20]: The surgeon had a notion that he had once been something better , both in appearance and condition . ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 10]: `` What did they call the wretched being ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 18]: `` They called him what he had called himself , but no one knew his name . ''
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 12]: `` Not even any one who had attended on him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 8]: `` No one had attended on him .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 5]: He was found dead .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 8]: In fact , I found him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 9]: `` Without any clue to anything more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 28]: `` Without any ; there was , '' says the lawyer meditatively , `` an old portmanteau , but -- No , there were no papers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 49]: During the utterance of every word of this short dialogue , Lady Dedlock and Mr. Tulkinghorn , without any other alteration in their customary deportment , have looked very steadily at one another -- as was natural , perhaps , in the discussion of so unusual a subject .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 19]: Sir Leicester has looked at the fire , with the general expression of the Dedlock on the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 61]: The story being told , he renews his stately protest , saying that as it is quite clear that no association in my Lady 's mind can possibly be traceable to this poor wretch -LRB- unless he was a begging-letter writer -RRB- , he trusts to hear no more about a subject so far removed from my Lady 's station .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 29]: `` Certainly , a collection of horrors , '' says my Lady , gathering up her mantles and furs , `` but they interest one for the moment !
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 15]: Have the kindness , Mr. Tulkinghorn , to open the door for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 15]: Mr. Tulkinghorn does so with deference and holds it open while she passes out .
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 15]: She passes close to him , with her usual fatigued manner and insolent grace .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 19]: They meet again at dinner -- again , next day -- again , for many days in succession .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 30]: Lady Dedlock is always the same exhausted deity , surrounded by worshippers , and terribly liable to be bored to death , even while presiding at her own shrine .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 24]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is always the same speechless repository of noble confidences , so oddly but of place and yet so perfectly at home .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 21]: They appear to take as little note of one another as any two people enclosed within the same walls could .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 62]: But whether each evermore watches and suspects the other , evermore mistrustful of some great reservation ; whether each is evermore prepared at all points for the other , and never to be taken unawares ; what each would give to know how much the other knows -- all this is hidden , for the time , in their own hearts .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 45]: Chapter XIII -- Esther 's Narrative We held many consultations about what Richard was to be , first without Mr. Jarndyce , as he had requested , and afterwards with him , but it was a long time before we seemed to make progress .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 8]: Richard said he was ready for anything .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 30]: When Mr. Jarndyce doubted whether he might not already be too old to enter the Navy , Richard said he had thought of that , and perhaps he was .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 30]: When Mr. Jarndyce asked him what he thought of the Army , Richard said he had thought of that , too , and it was n't a bad idea .
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 46]: When Mr. Jarndyce advised him to try and decide within himself whether his old preference for the sea was an ordinary boyish inclination or a strong impulse , Richard answered , Well he really HAD tried very often , and he could n't make out .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 65]: `` How much of this indecision of character , '' Mr. Jarndyce said to me , `` is chargeable on that incomprehensible heap of uncertainty and procrastination on which he has been thrown from his birth , I do n't pretend to say ; but that Chancery , among its other sins , is responsible for some of it , I can plainly see .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 41]: It has engendered or confirmed in him a habit of putting off -- and trusting to this , that , and the other chance , without knowing what chance -- and dismissing everything as unsettled , uncertain , and confused .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 18]: The character of much older and steadier people may be even changed by the circumstances surrounding them .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 28]: It would be too much to expect that a boy 's , in its formation , should be the subject of such influences and escape them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 40]: I felt this to be true ; though if I may venture to mention what I thought besides , I thought it much to be regretted that Richard 's education had not counteracted those influences or directed his character .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 29]: He had been eight years at a public school and had learnt , I understood , to make Latin verses of several sorts in the most admirable manner .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 36]: But I never heard that it had been anybody 's business to find out what his natural bent was , or where his failings lay , or to adapt any kind of knowledge to HIM .
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 58]: HE had been adapted to the verses and had learnt the art of making them to such perfection that if he had remained at school until he was of age , I suppose he could only have gone on making them over and over again unless he had enlarged his education by forgetting how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 61]: Still , although I had no doubt that they were very beautiful , and very improving , and very sufficient for a great many purposes of life , and always remembered all through life , I did doubt whether Richard would not have profited by some one studying him a little , instead of his studying them quite so much .
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 43]: To be sure , I knew nothing of the subject and do not even now know whether the young gentlemen of classic Rome or Greece made verses to the same extent -- or whether the young gentlemen of any country ever did .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 21]: `` I have n't the least idea , '' said Richard , musing , `` what I had better be .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 22]: Except that I am quite sure I do n't want to go into the Church , it 's a toss-up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 12]: `` You have no inclination in Mr. Kenge 's way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: suggested Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 10]: `` I do n't know that , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 3]: replied Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 7]: `` I am fond of boating .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 10]: Articled clerks go a good deal on the water .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 7]: It 's a capital profession ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 8]: `` Surgeon -- '' suggested Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 9]: `` That 's the thing , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 3]: cried Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 12]: I doubt if he had ever once thought of it before .
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 16]: `` That 's the thing , sir , '' repeated Richard with the greatest enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 8]: `` We have got it at last .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 3]: M.R.C.S. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 17]: He was not to be laughed out of it , though he laughed at it heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 39]: He said he had chosen his profession , and the more he thought of it , the more he felt that his destiny was clear ; the art of healing was the art of all others for him .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 72]: Mistrusting that he only came to this conclusion because , having never had much chance of finding out for himself what he was fitted for and having never been guided to the discovery , he was taken by the newest idea and was glad to get rid of the trouble of consideration , I wondered whether the Latin verses often ended in this or whether Richard 's was a solitary case .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 28]: Mr. Jarndyce took great pains to talk with him seriously and to put it to his good sense not to deceive himself in so important a matter .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 30]: Richard was a little grave after these interviews , but invariably told Ada and me that it was all right , and then began to talk about something else .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 5]: `` By heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 45]: cried Mr. Boythorn , who interested himself strongly in the subject -- though I need not say that , for he could do nothing weakly ; `` I rejoice to find a young gentleman of spirit and gallantry devoting himself to that noble profession !
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 36]: The more spirit there is in it , the better for mankind and the worse for those mercenary task-masters and low tricksters who delight in putting that illustrious art at a disadvantage in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 70]: By all that is base and despicable , '' cried Mr. Boythorn , `` the treatment of surgeons aboard ship is such that I would submit the legs -- both legs -- of every member of the Admiralty Board to a compound fracture and render it a transportable offence in any qualified practitioner to set them if the system were not wholly changed in eight and forty hours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 10]: `` Would n't you give them a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 4]: asked Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 5]: cried Mr. Boythorn firmly .
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 6]: `` Not on any consideration !
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 5]: Eight and forty hours !
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 162]: As to corporations , parishes , vestry-boards , and similar gatherings of jolter-headed clods who assemble to exchange such speeches that , by heaven , they ought to be worked in quicksilver mines for the short remainder of their miserable existence , if it were only to prevent their detestable English from contaminating a language spoken in the presence of the sun -- as to those fellows , who meanly take advantage of the ardour of gentlemen in the pursuit of knowledge to recompense the inestimable services of the best years of their lives , their long study , and their expensive education with pittances too small for the acceptance of clerks , I would have the necks of every one of them wrung and their skulls arranged in Surgeons ' Hall for the contemplation of the whole profession in order that its younger members might understand from actual measurement , in early life , HOW thick skulls may become ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 28]: He wound up this vehement declaration by looking round upon us with a most agreeable smile and suddenly thundering , `` Ha , ha , ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 20]: over and over again , until anybody else might have been expected to be quite subdued by the exertion .
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 60]: As Richard still continued to say that he was fixed in his choice after repeated periods for consideration had been recommended by Mr. Jarndyce and had expired , and he still continued to assure Ada and me in the same final manner that it was `` all right , '' it became advisable to take Mr. Kenge into council .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 52]: Mr. Kenge , therefore , came down to dinner one day , and leaned back in his chair , and turned his eye-glasses over and over , and spoke in a sonorous voice , and did exactly what I remembered to have seen him do when I was a little girl .
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 14]: A very good profession , Mr. Jarndyce , a very good profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 23]: `` The course of study and preparation requires to be diligently pursued , '' observed my guardian with a glance at Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 11]: `` Oh , no doubt , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 4]: `` Diligently . ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 41]: `` But that being the case , more or less , with all pursuits that are worth much , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` it is not a special consideration which another choice would be likely to escape . ''
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 8]: `` Truly , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 22]: `` And Mr. Richard Carstone , who has so meritoriously acquitted himself in the -- shall I say the classic shades ?
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 62]: -- in which his youth had been passed , will , no doubt , apply the habits , if not the principles and practice , of versification in that tongue in which a poet was said -LRB- unless I mistake -RRB- to be born , not made , to the more eminently practical field of action on which he enters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 28]: `` You may rely upon it , '' said Richard in his off-hand manner , `` that I shall go at it and do my best . ''
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 8]: `` Very well , Mr. Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 9]: said Mr. Kenge , gently nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 57]: `` Really , when we are assured by Mr. Richard that he means to go at it and to do his best , '' nodding feelingly and smoothly over those expressions , `` I would submit to you that we have only to inquire into the best mode of carrying out the object of his ambition .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 14]: Now , with reference to placing Mr. Richard with some sufficiently eminent practitioner .
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 10]: Is there any one in view at present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 10]: `` No one , Rick , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 10]: `` No one , sir , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 5]: `` Quite so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 4]: observed Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 7]: `` As to situation , now .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 10]: Is there any particular feeling on that head ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 9]: `` N -- no , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 5]: `` Quite so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 5]: observed Mr. Kenge again .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 22]: `` I should like a little variety , '' said Richard ; `` I mean a good range of experience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 12]: `` Very requisite , no doubt , '' returned Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 12]: `` I think this may be easily arranged , Mr. Jarndyce ?
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 37]: We have only , in the first place , to discover a sufficiently eligible practitioner ; and as soon as we make our want -- and shall I add , our ability to pay a premium ?
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 18]: -- known , our only difficulty will be in the selection of one from a large number .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 33]: We have only , in the second place , to observe those little formalities which are rendered necessary by our time of life and our being under the guardianship of the court .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 29]: We shall soon be -- shall I say , in Mr. Richard 's own light-hearted manner , ` going at it ' -- to our heart 's content .
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 47]: It is a coincidence , '' said Mr. Kenge with a tinge of melancholy in his smile , `` one of those coincidences which may or may not require an explanation beyond our present limited faculties , that I have a cousin in the medical profession .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 17]: He might be deemed eligible by you and might be disposed to respond to this proposal .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 16]: I can answer for him as little as for you , but he MIGHT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 20]: As this was an opening in the prospect , it was arranged that Mr. Kenge should see his cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 38]: And as Mr. Jarndyce had before proposed to take us to London for a few weeks , it was settled next day that we should make our visit at once and combine Richard 's business with it .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 26]: Mr. Boythorn leaving us within a week , we took up our abode at a cheerful lodging near Oxford Street over an upholsterer 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 36]: London was a great wonder to us , and we were out for hours and hours at a time , seeing the sights , which appeared to be less capable of exhaustion than we were .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 25]: We made the round of the principal theatres , too , with great delight , and saw all the plays that were worth seeing .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 21]: I mention this because it was at the theatre that I began to be made uncomfortable again by Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 63]: I was sitting in front of the box one night with Ada , and Richard was in the place he liked best , behind Ada 's chair , when , happening to look down into the pit , I saw Mr. Guppy , with his hair flattened down upon his head and woe depicted in his face , looking up at me .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 35]: I felt all through the performance that he never looked at the actors but constantly looked at me , and always with a carefully prepared expression of the deepest misery and the profoundest dejection .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 19]: It quite spoiled my pleasure for that night because it was so very embarrassing and so very ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 41]: But from that time forth , we never went to the play without my seeing Mr. Guppy in the pit , always with his hair straight and flat , his shirt-collar turned down , and a general feebleness about him .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 66]: If he were not there when we went in , and I began to hope he would not come and yielded myself for a little while to the interest of the scene , I was certain to encounter his languishing eyes when I least expected it and , from that time , to be quite sure that they were fixed upon me all the evening .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 11]: I really can not express how uneasy this made me .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 75]: If he would only have brushed up his hair or turned up his collar , it would have been bad enough ; but to know that that absurd figure was always gazing at me , and always in that demonstrative state of despondency , put such a constraint upon me that I did not like to laugh at the play , or to cry at it , or to move , or to speak .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 8]: I seemed able to do nothing naturally .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 52]: As to escaping Mr. Guppy by going to the back of the box , I could not bear to do that because I knew Richard and Ada relied on having me next them and that they could never have talked together so happily if anybody else had been in my place .
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 44]: So there I sat , not knowing where to look -- for wherever I looked , I knew Mr. Guppy 's eyes were following me -- and thinking of the dreadful expense to which this young man was putting himself on my account .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 8]: Sometimes I thought of telling Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 18]: Then I feared that the young man would lose his situation and that I might ruin him .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 25]: Sometimes I thought of confiding in Richard , but was deterred by the possibility of his fighting Mr. Guppy and giving him black eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 14]: Sometimes I thought , should I frown at him or shake my head .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 9]: Then I felt I could not do it .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 31]: Sometimes I considered whether I should write to his mother , but that ended in my being convinced that to open a correspondence would he to make the matter worse .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 15]: I always came to the conclusion , finally , that I could do nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 65]: Mr. Guppy 's perseverance , all this time , not only produced him regularly at any theatre to which we went , but caused him to appear in the crowd as we were coming out , and even to get up behind our fly -- where I am sure I saw him , two or three times , struggling among the most dreadful spikes .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 13]: After we got home , he haunted a post opposite our house .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 58]: The upholsterer 's where we lodged being at the corner of two streets , and my bedroom window being opposite the post , I was afraid to go near the window when I went upstairs , lest I should see him -LRB- as I did one moonlight night -RRB- leaning against the post and evidenfly catching cold .
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 26]: If Mr. Guppy had not been , fortunately for me , engaged in the daytime , I really should have had no rest from him .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 31]: While we were making this round of gaieties , in which Mr. Guppy so extraordinarily participated , the business which had helped to bring us to town was not neglected .
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 25]: Mr. Kenge 's cousin was a Mr. Bayham Badger , who had a good practice at Chelsea and attended a large public institution besides .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 70]: He was quite willing to receive Richard into his house and to superintend his studies , and as it seemed that those could be pursued advantageously under Mr. Badger 's roof , and Mr. Badger liked Richard , and as Richard said he liked Mr. Badger `` well enough , '' an agreement was made , the Lord Chancellor 's consent was obtained , and it was all settled .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 26]: On the day when matters were concluded between Richard and Mr. Badger , we were all under engagement to dine at Mr. Badger 's house .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 28]: We were to be `` merely a family party , '' Mrs. Badger 's note said ; and we found no lady there but Mrs. Badger herself .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 57]: She was surrounded in the drawing-room by various objects , indicative of her painting a little , playing the piano a little , playing the guitar a little , playing the harp a little , singing a little , working a little , reading a little , writing poetry a little , and botanizing a little .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 22]: She was a lady of about fifty , I should think , youthfully dressed , and of a very fine complexion .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 28]: If I add to the little list of her accomplishments that she rouged a little , I do not mean that there was any harm in it .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 40]: Mr. Bayham Badger himself was a pink , fresh-faced , crisp-looking gentleman with a weak voice , white teeth , light hair , and surprised eyes , some years younger , I should say , than Mrs. Bayham Badger .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 31]: He admired her exceedingly , but principally , and to begin with , on the curious ground -LRB- as it seemed to us -RRB- of her having had three husbands .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 30]: We had barely taken our seats when he said to Mr. Jarndyce quite triumphantly , `` You would hardly suppose that I am Mrs. Bayham Badger 's third ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 5]: `` Her third ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 4]: said Mr. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 23]: `` Mrs. Bayham Badger has not the appearance , Miss Summerson , of a lady who has had two former husbands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 8]: I said `` Not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 7]: `` And most remarkable men ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 9]: said Mr. Badger in a tone of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 23]: `` Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy , who was Mrs. Badger 's first husband , was a very distinguished officer indeed .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 17]: The name of Professor Dingo , my immediate predecessor , is one of European reputation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 7]: Mrs. Badger overheard him and smiled .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 7]: `` Yes , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 30]: Mr. Badger replied to the smile , `` I was observing to Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson that you had had two former husbands -- both very distinguished men .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 15]: And they found it , as people generally do , difficult to believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 22]: `` I was barely twenty , '' said Mrs. Badger , `` when I married Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 14]: I was in the Mediterranean with him ; I am quite a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 17]: On the twelfth anniversary of my wedding-day , I became the wife of Professor Dingo . ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 13]: `` Of European reputation , '' added Mr. Badger in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 27]: `` And when Mr. Badger and myself were married , '' pursued Mrs. Badger , `` we were married on the same day of the year .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 9]: I had become attached to the day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 45]: `` So that Mrs. Badger has been married to three husbands -- two of them highly distinguished men , '' said Mr. Badger , summing up the facts , `` and each time upon the twenty-first of March at eleven in the forenoon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 6]: We all expressed our admiration .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 28]: `` But for Mr. Badger 's modesty , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` I would take leave to correct him and say three distinguished men . ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 7]: `` Thank you , Mr. Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 7]: What I always tell him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 4]: observed Mrs. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 19]: `` And , my dear , '' said Mr. Badger , `` what do I always tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 70]: That without any affectation of disparaging such professional distinction as I may have attained -LRB- which our friend Mr. Carstone will have many opportunities of estimating -RRB- , I am not so weak -- no , really , '' said Mr. Badger to us generally , `` so unreasonable -- as to put my reputation on the same footing with such first-rate men as Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 31]: Perhaps you may be interested , Mr. Jarndyce , '' continued Mr. Bayham Badger , leading the way into the next drawing-room , `` in this portrait of Captain Swosser .
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 23]: It was taken on his return home from the African station , where he had suffered from the fever of the country .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 7]: Mrs. Badger considers it too yellow .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 8]: But it 's a very fine head .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 6]: A very fine head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 11]: We all echoed , `` A very fine head ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 28]: `` I feel when I look at it , '' said Mr. Badger , '' ` That 's a man I should like to have seen ! '
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 12]: It strikingly bespeaks the first-class man that Captain Swosser pre-eminently was .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 8]: On the other side , Professor Dingo .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 16]: I knew him well -- attended him in his last illness -- a speaking likeness !
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 11]: Over the piano , Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Swosser .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 11]: Over the sofa , Mrs. Bayham Badger when Mrs. Dingo .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 17]: Of Mrs. Bayham Badger IN ESSE , I possess the original and have no copy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 10]: Dinner was now announced , and we went downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 11]: It was a very genteel entertainment , very handsomely served .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 37]: But the captain and the professor still ran in Mr. Badger 's head , and as Ada and I had the honour of being under his particular care , we had the full benefit of them .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 6]: `` Water , Miss Summerson ?
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 3]: Allow me !
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 7]: Not in that tumbler , pray .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 10]: Bring me the professor 's goblet , James ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 11]: Ada very much admired some artificial flowers under a glass .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 7]: `` Astonishing how they keep ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 4]: said Mr. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 16]: `` They were presented to Mrs. Bayham Badger when she was in the Mediterranean . ''
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 11]: He invited Mr. Jarndyce to take a glass of claret .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 6]: `` Not that claret ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 4]: `` Excuse me !
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 20]: This is an occasion , and ON an occasion I produce some very special claret I happen to have .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 9]: -LRB- James , Captain Swosser 's wine ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 23]: Mr. Jarndyce , this is a wine that was imported by the captain , we will not say how many years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 7]: You will find it very curious .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 16]: My dear , I shall he happy to take some of this wine with you .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 12]: -LRB- Captain Swosser 's claret to your mistress , James ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 7]: My love , your health ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 20]: After dinner , when we ladies retired , we took Mrs. Badger 's first and second husband with us .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 61]: Mrs. Badger gave us in the drawing-room a biographical sketch of the life and services of Captain Swosser before his marriage and a more minute account of him dating from the time when he fell in love with her at a ball on board the Crippler , given to the officers of that ship when she lay in Plymouth Harbour .
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 7]: `` The dear old Crippler ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 8]: said Mrs. Badger , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 7]: `` She was a noble vessel .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 15]: Trim , ship-shape , all a taunto , as Captain Swosser used to say .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 19]: You must excuse me if I occasionally introduce a nautical expression ; I was quite a sailor once .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 9]: Captain Swosser loved that craft for my sake .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 69]: When she was no longer in commission , he frequently said that if he were rich enough to buy her old hulk , he would have an inscription let into the timbers of the quarter-deck where we stood as partners in the dance to mark the spot where he fell -- raked fore and aft -LRB- Captain Swosser used to say -RRB- by the fire from my tops .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 11]: It was his naval way of mentioning my eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 14]: Mrs. Badger shook her head , sighed , and looked in the glass .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 21]: `` It was a great change from Captain Swosser to Professor Dingo , '' she resumed with a plaintive smile .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 10]: `` I felt it a good deal at first .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 10]: Such an entire revolution in my mode of life !
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 15]: But custom , combined with science -- particularly science -- inured me to it .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 26]: Being the professor 's sole companion in his botanical excursions , I almost forgot that I had ever been afloat , and became quite learned .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 25]: It is singular that the professor was the antipodes of Captain Swosser and that Mr. Badger is not in the least like either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 27]: We then passed into a narrative of the deaths of Captain Swosser and Professor Dingo , both of whom seem to have had very bad complaints .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 41]: In the course of it , Mrs. Badger signified to us that she had never madly loved but once and that the object of that wild affection , never to be recalled in its fresh enthusiasm , was Captain Swosser .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 35]: The professor was yet dying by inches in the most dismal manner , and Mrs. Badger was giving us imitations of his way of saying , with great difficulty , `` Where is Laura ?
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 10]: Let Laura give me my toast and water ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 12]: when the entrance of the gentlemen consigned him to the tomb .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 47]: Now , I observed that evening , as I had observed for some days past , that Ada and Richard were more than ever attached to each other 's society , which was but natural , seeing that they were going to be separated so soon .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 51]: I was therefore not very much surprised when we got home , and Ada and I retired upstairs , to find Ada more silent than usual , though I was not quite prepared for her coming into my arms and beginning to speak to me , with her face hidden .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 6]: `` My darling Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 3]: murmured Ada .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 11]: `` I have a great secret to tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 11]: A mighty secret , my pretty one , no doubt !
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 8]: `` What is it , Ada ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 11]: `` Oh , Esther , you would never guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 8]: `` Shall I try to guess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 7]: said I. `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: Do n't !
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 5]: Pray do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 14]: cried Ada , very much startled by the idea of my doing so .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 12]: `` Now , I wonder who it can be about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 7]: said I , pretending to consider .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 12]: `` It 's about -- '' said Ada in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 10]: `` It 's about -- my cousin Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 7]: `` Well , my own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 15]: said I , kissing her bright hair , which was all I could see .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 7]: `` And what about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 11]: `` Oh , Esther , you would never guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 51]: It was so pretty to have her clinging to me in that way , hiding her face , and to know that she was not crying in sorrow but in a little glow of joy , and pride , and hope , that I would not help her just yet .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 38]: `` He says -- I know it 's very foolish , we are both so young -- but he says , '' with a burst of tears , `` that he loves me dearly , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 6]: `` Does he indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 11]: said I. `` I never heard of such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 19]: Why , my pet of pets , I could have told you that weeks and weeks ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 32]: To see Ada lift up her flushed face in joyful surprise , and hold me round the neck , and laugh , and cry , and blush , was so pleasant !
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 20]: `` Why , my darling , '' said I , `` what a goose you must take me for !
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 21]: Your cousin Richard has been loving you as plainly as he could for I do n't know how long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 12]: `` And yet you never said a word about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 6]: cried Ada , kissing me .
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 17]: `` No , my love , '' said I. `` I waited to be told . ''
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 21]: `` But now I have told you , you do n't think it wrong of me , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 3]: returned Ada .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 19]: She might have coaxed me to say no if I had been the hardest-hearted duenna in the world .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 11]: Not being that yet , I said no very freely .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 17]: `` And now , '' said I , `` I know the worst of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 16]: `` Oh , that 's not quite the worst of it , Esther dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 16]: cried Ada , holding me tighter and laying down her face again upon my breast .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 8]: said I. `` Not even that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 8]: `` No , not even that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 7]: said Ada , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 16]: `` Why , you never mean to say -- '' I was beginning in joke .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 20]: But Ada , looking up and smiling through her tear 's , cried , `` Yes , I do !
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 9]: You know , you know I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 13]: And then sobbed out , `` With all my heart I do !
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 9]: With all my whole heart , Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 24]: I told her , laughing , why I had known that , too , just as well as I had known the other !
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 37]: And we sat before the fire , and I had all the talking to myself for a little while -LRB- though there was not much of it -RRB- ; and Ada was soon quiet and happy .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 14]: `` Do you think my cousin John knows , dear Dame Durden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 32]: `` Unless my cousin John is blind , my pet , '' said I , `` I should think my cousin John knows pretty well as much as we know . ''
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 31]: `` We want to speak to him before Richard goes , '' said Ada timidly , `` and we wanted you to advise us , and to tell him so .
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 14]: Perhaps you would n't mind Richard 's coming in , Dame Durden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 11]: Richard is outside , is he , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 43]: said I. `` I am not quite certain , '' returned Ada with a bashful simplicity that would have won my heart if she had not won it long before , `` but I think he 's waiting at the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 7]: There he was , of course .
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 46]: They brought a chair on either side of me , and put me between them , and really seemed to have fallen in love with me instead of one another , they were so confiding , and so trustful , and so fond of me .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 101]: They went on in their own wild way for a little while -- I never stopped them ; I enjoyed it too much myself -- and then we gradually fell to considering how young they were , and how there must be a lapse of several years before this early love could come to anything , and how it could come to happiness only if it were real and lasting and inspired them with a steady resolution to do their duty to each other , with constancy , fortitude , and perseverance , each always for the other 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 54]: Richard said that he would work his fingers to the bone for Ada , and Ada said that she would work her fingers to the bone for Richard , and they called me all sorts of endearing and sensible names , and we sat there , advising and talking , half the night .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 19]: Finally , before we parted , I gave them my promise to speak to their cousin John to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 39]: So , when to-morrow came , I went to my guardian after breakfast , in the room that was our town-substitute for the growlery , and told him that I had it in trust to tell him something .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 32]: `` Well , little woman , '' said he , shutting up his book , `` if you have accepted the trust , there can be no harm in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 22]: `` I hope not , guardian , '' said I. `` I can guarantee that there is no secrecy in it .
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 7]: For it only happened yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 3]: `` Aye ?
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 8]: And what is it , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 22]: `` Guardian , '' said I , `` you remember the happy night when first we came down to Bleak House ?
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 10]: When Ada was singing in the dark room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 15]: I wished to call to his remembrance the look he had given me then .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 13]: Unless I am much mistaken , I saw that I did so .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 11]: `` Because -- '' said I with a little hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 7]: `` Yes , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 6]: `` Do n't hurry . ''
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 16]: `` Because , '' said I , `` Ada and Richard have fallen in love .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 8]: And have told each other so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 4]: `` Already ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 7]: cried my guardian , quite astonished .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 18]: said I. `` And to tell you the truth , guardian , I rather expected it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 7]: `` The deuce you did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 41]: He sat considering for a minute or two , with his smile , at once so handsome and so kind , upon his changing face , and then requested me to let them know that he wished to see them .
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 24]: When they came , he encircled Ada with one arm in his fatherly way and addressed himself to Richard with a cheerful gravity .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 18]: `` Rick , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` I am glad to have won your confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 6]: I hope to preserve it .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 58]: When I contemplated these relations between us four which have so brightened my life and so invested it with new interests and pleasures , I certainly did contemplate , afar off , the possibility of you and your pretty cousin here -LRB- do n't be shy , Ada , do n't be shy , my dear ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 10]: being in a mind to go through life together .
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 14]: I saw , and do see , many reasons to make it desirable .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 12]: But that was afar off , Rick , afar off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 12]: `` We look afar off , sir , '' returned Richard .
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 5]: `` That 's rational .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 8]: Now , hear me , my dears !
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 53]: I might tell you that you do n't know your own minds yet , that a thousand things may happen to divert you from one another , that it is well this chain of flowers you have taken up is very easily broken , or it might become a chain of lead .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 7]: But I will not do that .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 19]: Such wisdom will come soon enough , I dare say , if it is to come at all .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 22]: I will assume that a few years hence you will be in your hearts to one another what you are to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 54]: All I say before speaking to you according to that assumption is , if you DO change -- if you DO come to find that you are more commonplace cousins to each other as man and woman than you were as boy and girl -LRB- your manhood will excuse me , Rick ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 22]: -- do n't be ashamed still to confide in me , for there will be nothing monstrous or uncommon in it .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 9]: I am only your friend and distant kinsman .
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 8]: I have no power over you whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 18]: But I wish and hope to retain your confidence if I do nothing to forfeit it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 46]: `` I am very sure , sir , '' returned Richard , `` that I speak for Ada too when I say that you have the strongest power over us both -- rooted in respect , gratitude , and affection -- strengthening every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 24]: `` Dear cousin John , '' said Ada , on his shoulder , `` my father 's place can never be empty again .
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 18]: All the love and duty I could ever have rendered to him is transferred to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 6]: `` Now for our assumption .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 13]: Now we lift our eyes up and look hopefully at the distance !
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 25]: Rick , the world is before you ; and it is most probable that as you enter it , so it will receive you .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 11]: Trust in nothing but in Providence and your own efforts .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 10]: Never separate the two , like the heathen waggoner .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 25]: Constancy in love is a good thing , but it means nothing , and is nothing , without constancy in every kind of effort .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 29]: If you had the abilities of all the great men , past and present , you could do nothing well without sincerely meaning it and setting about it .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 50]: If you entertain the supposition that any real success , in great things or in small , ever was or could be , ever will or can be , wrested from Fortune by fits and starts , leave that wrong idea here or leave your cousin Ada here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 47]: `` I will leave IT here , sir , '' replied Richard smiling , `` if I brought it here just now -LRB- but I hope I did not -RRB- , and will work my way on to my cousin Ada in the hopeful distance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 4]: `` Right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 17]: `` If you are not to make her happy , why should you pursue her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 21]: `` I would n't make her unhappy -- no , not even for her love , '' retorted Richard proudly .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 5]: `` Well said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 4]: cried Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 6]: `` That 's well said !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 10]: She remains here , in her home with me .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 27]: Love her , Rick , in your active life , no less than in her home when you revisit it , and all will go well .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 7]: Otherwise , all will go ill .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 8]: That 's the end of my preaching .
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 12]: I think you and Ada had better take a walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 39]: Ada tenderly embraced him , and Richard heartily shook hands with him , and then the cousins went out of the room , looking back again directly , though , to say that they would wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 35]: The door stood open , and we both followed them with our eyes as they passed down the adjoining room , on which the sun was shining , and out at its farther end .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 38]: Richard with his head bent , and her hand drawn through his arm , was talking to her very earnestly ; and she looked up in his face , listening , and seemed to see nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 41]: So young , so beautiful , so full of hope and promise , they went on lightly through the sunlight as their own happy thoughts might then be traversing the years to come and making them all years of brightness .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 11]: So they passed away into the shadow and were gone .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 13]: It was only a burst of light that had been so radiant .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 15]: The room darkened as they went out , and the sun was clouded over .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 8]: `` Am I right , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 8]: said my guardian when they were gone .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 14]: He was so good and wise to ask ME whether he was right !
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 14]: `` Rick may gain , out of this , the quality he wants .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 13]: Wants , at the core of so much that is good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 8]: said Mr. Jarndyce , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 10]: `` I have said nothing to Ada , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 10]: She has her friend and counsellor always near . ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 10]: And he laid his hand lovingly upon my head .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 22]: I could not help showing that I was a little moved , though I did all I could to conceal it .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 5]: `` Tut tut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 25]: `` But we must take care , too , that our little woman 's life is not all consumed in care for others . ''
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 3]: `` Care ?
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 16]: My dear guardian , I believe I am the happiest creature in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 11]: `` I believe so , too , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 28]: `` But some one may find out what Esther never will -- that the little woman is to be held in remembrance above all other people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 20]: I have omitted to mention in its place that there was some one else at the family dinner party .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 6]: It was not a lady .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 5]: It was a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 13]: It was a gentleman of a dark complexion -- a young surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 14]: He was rather reserved , but I thought him very sensible and agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 16]: At least , Ada asked me if I did not , and I said yes .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 35]: Chapter XIV -- Deportment Richard left us on the very next evening to begin his new career , and committed Ada to my charge with great love for her and great trust in me .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 39]: It touched me then to reflect , and it touches me now , more nearly , to remember -LRB- having what I have to tell -RRB- how they both thought of me , even at that engrossing time .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 42]: I was a part of all their plans , for the present and the future , I was to write Richard once a week , making my faithful report of Ada , who was to write to him every alternate day .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 73]: I was to be informed , under his own hand , of all his labours and successes ; I was to observe how resolute and persevering he would be ; I was to be Ada 's bridesmaid when they were married ; I was to live with them afterwards ; I was to keep all the keys of their house ; I was to be made happy for ever and a day .
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 20]: `` And if the suit SHOULD make us rich , Esther -- which it may , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 6]: said Richard to crown all .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 7]: A shade crossed Ada 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 14]: `` My dearest Ada , '' asked Richard , `` why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 14]: `` It had better declare us poor at once , '' said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 25]: I do n't know about that , '' returned Richard , `` but at all events , it wo n't declare anything at once .
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 13]: It has n't declared anything in heaven knows how many years . ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 8]: `` Too true , '' said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 42]: `` Yes , but , '' urged Richard , answering what her look suggested rather than her words , `` the longer it goes on , dcar cousin , the nearer it must be to a settlement one way or other .
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 8]: Now , is not that reasonable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 7]: `` You know best , Richard .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 17]: But I am afraid if we trust to it , it will make us unhappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 16]: `` But , my Ada , we are not going to trust to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 4]: cried Richard gaily .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 11]: `` We know it better than to trust to it .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 20]: We only say that if it SHOULD make us rich , we have no constitutional objection to being rich .
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 36]: The court is , by solemn settlement of law , our grim old guardian , and we are to suppose that what it gives us -LRB- when it gives us anything -RRB- is our right .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 11]: It is not necessary to quarrel with our right . ''
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 20]: `` No , '' Said Ada , `` but it may be better to forget all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 18]: `` Well , well , '' cried Richard , `` then we will forget all about it !
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 8]: We consign the whole thing to oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 14]: Dame Durden puts on her approving face , and it 's done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 52]: `` Dame Durden 's approving face , '' said I , looking out of the box in which I was packing his books , `` was not very visible when you called it by that name ; but it does approve , and she thinks you ca n't do better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 37]: So , Richard said there was an end of it , and immediately began , on no other foundation , to build as many castles in the air as would man the Great Wall of China .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 7]: He went away in high spirits .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 16]: Ada and I , prepared to miss him very much , commenced our quieter career .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 29]: On our arrival in London , we had called with Mr. Jarndyce at Mrs. Jellyby 's but had not been so fortunate as to find her at home .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 18]: It appeared that she had gone somewhere to a tea-drinking and had taken Miss Jellyby with her .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 35]: Besides the tea-drinking , there was to be some considerable speech-making and letter-writing on the general merits of the cultivation of coffee , conjointly with natives , at the Settlement of Borrioboola -- Gha .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 28]: All this involved , no doubt , sufficient active exercise of pen and ink to make her daughter 's part in the proceedings anything but a holiday .
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 17]: It being now beyond the time appointed for Mrs. Jellyby 's return , we called again .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 36]: She was in town , but not at home , having gone to Mile End directly after breakfast on some Borrioboolan business , arising out of a society called the East London Branch Aid Ramification .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 48]: As I had not seen Peepy on the occasion of our last call -LRB- when he was not to be found anywhere , and when the cook rather thought he must have strolled away with the dustman 's cart -RRB- , I now inquired for him again .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 36]: The oyster shells he had been building a house with were still in the passage , but he was nowhere discoverable , and the cook supposed that he had `` gone after the sheep . ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 13]: When we repeated , with some surprise , `` The sheep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 29]: she said , Oh , yes , on market days he sometimes followed them quite out of town and came back in such a state as never was !
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 72]: I was sitting at the window with my guardian on the following morning , and Ada was busy writing-of course to Richard -- when Miss Jellyby was announced , and entered , leading the identical Peepy , whom she had made some endeavours to render presentable by wiping the dirt into corners of his face and hands and making his hair very wet and then violently frizzling it with her fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 15]: Everything the dear child wore was either too large for him or too small .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 20]: Among his other contradictory decorations he had the hat of a bishop and the little gloves of a baby .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 51]: His boots were , on a small scale , the boots of a ploughman , while his legs , so crossed and recrossed with scratches that they looked like maps , were bare below a very short pair of plaid drawers finished off with two frills of perfectly different patterns .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 30]: The deficient buttons on his plaid frock had evidently been supplied from one of Mr. Jellyby 's coats , they were so extremely brazen and so much too large .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 31]: Most extraordinary specimens of needlework appeared on several parts of his dress , where it had been hastily mended , and I recognized the same hand on Miss Jellyby 's .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 15]: She was , however , unaccountably improved in her appearance and looked very pretty .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 39]: She was conscious of poor little Peepy being but a failure after all her trouble , and she showed it as she came in by the way in which she glanced first at him and then at us .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 5]: `` Due east ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 46]: Ada and I gave her a cordial welcome and presented her to Mr. Jarndyce , to whom she said as she sat down , `` Ma 's compliments , and she hopes you 'll excuse her , because she 's correcting proofs of the plan .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 22]: She 's going to put out five thousand new circulars , and she knows you 'll be interested to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 9]: I have brought one of them with me .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 5]: Ma 's compliments . ''
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 8]: With which she presented it sulkily enough .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 9]: `` Thank you , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 9]: `` I am much obliged to Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 5]: Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 8]: This is a very trying wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 23]: We were busy with Peepy , taking off his clerical hat , asking him if he remembered us , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 31]: Peepy retired behind his elbow at first , but relented at the sight of sponge-cake and allowed me to take him on my lap , where he sat munching quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 19]: Mr. Jarndyce then withdrawing into the temporary growlery , Miss Jellyby opened a conversation with her usual abruptness .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 18]: `` We are going on just as bad as ever in Thavies Inn , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 9]: `` I have no peace of my life .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 4]: Talk of Africa !
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 21]: I could n't be worse off if I was a what 's - his-name -- man and a brother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 7]: I tried to say something soothing .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 30]: `` Oh , it 's of no use , Miss Summerson , '' exclaimed Miss Jellyby , `` though I thank you for the kind intention all the same .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 16]: I know how I am used , and I am not to be talked over .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 12]: YOU would n't be talked over if you were used so .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 13]: Peepy , go and play at Wild Beasts under the piano ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 6]: `` I sha n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 3]: said Peepy .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 13]: `` Very well , you ungrateful , naughty , hard-hearted boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 9]: returned Miss Jellyby with tears in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 13]: `` I 'll never take pains to dress you any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 10]: `` Yes , I will go , Caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 25]: cried Peepy , who was really a good child and who was so moved by his sister 's vexation that he went at once .
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 25]: `` It seems a little thing to cry about , '' said poor Miss Jellyby apologetically , `` but I am quite worn out .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 11]: I was directing the new circulars till two this morning .
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 23]: I detest the whole thing so that that alone makes my head ache till I ca n't see out of my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 8]: And look at that poor unfortunate child !
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 11]: Was there ever such a fright as he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 38]: Peepy , happily unconscious of the defects in his appearance , sat on the carpet behind one of the legs of the piano , looking calmly out of his den at us while he ate his cake .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 36]: `` I have sent him to the other end of the room , '' observed Miss Jellyby , drawing her chair nearer ours , `` because I do n't want him to hear the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 7]: Those little things are so sharp !
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 15]: I was going to say , we really are going on worse than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 17]: Pa will be a bankrupt before long , and then I hope Ma will be satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 12]: There 'll he nobody but Ma to thank for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 18]: We said we hoped Mr. Jellyby 's affairs were not in so bad a state as that .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 25]: `` It 's of no use hoping , though it 's very kind of you , '' returned Miss Jellyby , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 22]: `` Pa told me only yesterday morning -LRB- and dreadfully unhappy he is -RRB- that he could n't weather the storm .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 8]: I should be surprised if he could .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 58]: When all our tradesmen send into our house any stuff they like , and the servants do what they like with it , and I have no time to improve things if I knew how , and Ma do n't care about anything , I should like to make out how Pa is to weather the storm .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 13]: I declare if I was Pa , I 'd run away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 5]: said I , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 12]: `` Your papa , no doubt , considers his family . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 30]: `` Oh , yes , his family is all very fine , Miss Summerson , '' replied Miss Jellyby ; `` but what comfort is his family to him ?
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 21]: His family is nothing but bills , dirt , waste , noise , tumbles downstairs , confusion , and wretchedness .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 25]: His scrambling home , from week 's end to week 's end , is like one great washing-day -- only nothing 's washed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 13]: Miss Jellyby tapped her foot upon the floor and wiped her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 32]: `` I am sure I pity Pa to that degree , '' she said , `` and am so angry with Ma that I ca n't find words to express myself !
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 14]: However , I am not going to bear it , I am determined .
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 23]: I wo n't be a slave all my life , and I wo n't submit to be proposed to by Mr. Quale .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 11]: A pretty thing , indeed , to marry a philanthropist .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 11]: As if I had n't had enough of THAT ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 5]: said poor Miss Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 37]: I must confess that I could not help feeling rather angry with Mrs. Jellyby myself , seeing and hearing this neglected girl and knowing how much of bitterly satirical truth there was in what she said .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 46]: `` If it was n't that we had been intimate when you stopped at our house , '' pursued Miss Jellyby , `` I should have been ashamed to come here to-day , for I know what a figure I must seem to you two .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 32]: But as it is , I made up my mind to call , especially as I am not likely to see you again the next time you come to town . ''
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 20]: She said this with such great significance that Ada and I glanced at one another , foreseeing something more .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 8]: said Miss Jellyby , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 6]: `` Not at all likely !
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 8]: I know I may trust you two .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 9]: I am sure you wo n't betray me .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 5]: I am engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 8]: `` Without their knowledge at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 33]: said I. `` Why , good gracious me , Miss Summerson , '' she returned , justifying herself in a fretful but not angry manner , `` how can it be otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 20]: You know what Ma is -- and I need n't make poor Pa more miserable by telling HIM . ''
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 22]: `` But would it not he adding to his unhappiness to marry without his knowledge or consent , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 13]: said I. `` No , '' said Miss Jellyby , softening . ''
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 5]: `` I hope not .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 45]: I should try to make him happy and comfortable when he came to see me , and Peepy and the others should take it in turns to come and stay with me , and they should have some care taken of them then . ''
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 11]: There was a good deal of affection in poor Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 47]: She softened more and more while saying this and cried so much over the unwonted little home-picture she had raised in her mind that Peepy , in his cave under the piano , was touched , and turned himself over on his back with loud lamentations .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 77]: It was not until I had brought him to kiss his sister , and had restored him to his place on my lap , and had shown him that Caddy was laughing -LRB- she laughed expressly for the purpose -RRB- , that we could recall his peace of mind ; even then it was for some time conditional on his taking us in turns by the chin and smoothing our faces all over with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 39]: At last , as his spirits were not equal to the piano , we put him on a chair to look out of window ; and Miss Jellyby , holding him by one leg , resumed her confidence .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 14]: `` It began in your coming to our house , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 5]: We naturally asked how .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 34]: `` I felt I was so awkward , '' she replied , `` that I made up my mind to be improved in that respect at all events and to learn to dance .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 17]: I told Ma I was ashamed of myself , and I must be taught to dance .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 43]: Ma looked at me in that provoking way of hers as if I was n't in sight , but I was quite determined to be taught to dance , and so I went to Mr. Turveydrop 's Academy in Newman Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 13]: `` And was it there , my dear -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 20]: `` Yes , it was there , '' said Caddy , `` and I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 10]: There are two Mr. Turveydrops , father and son .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 10]: My Mr. Turveydrop is the son , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 28]: I only wish I had been better brought up and was likely to make him a better wife , for I am very fond of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 18]: `` I am sorry to hear this , '' said I , `` I must confess . ''
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 39]: `` I do n't know why you should be sorry , '' she retorted a little anxiously , `` but I am engaged to Mr. Turveydrop , whether or no , and he is very fond of me .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 42]: It 's a secret as yet , even on his side , because old Mr. Turveydrop has a share in the connexion and it might break his heart or give him some other shock if he was told of it abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 14]: Old Mr. Turveydrop is a very gentlemanly man indeed -- very gentlemanly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 9]: `` Does his wife know of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 3]: asked Ada .
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 11]: `` Old Mr. Turveydrop 's wife , Miss Clare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 8]: returned Miss Jellyby , opening her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 7]: `` There 's no such person .
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 6]: He is a widower . ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 43]: We were here interrupted by Peepy , whose leg had undergone so much on account of his sister 's unconsciously jerking it like a bell-rope whenever she was emphatic that the afflicted child now bemoaned his sufferings with a very low-spirited noise .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 22]: As he appealed to me for compassion , and as I was only a listener , I undertook to hold him .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 24]: Miss Jellyby proceeded , after begging Peepy 's pardon with a kiss and assuring him that she had n't meant to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 13]: `` That 's the state of the case , '' said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 16]: `` If I ever blame myself , I still think it 's Ma 's fault .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 24]: We are to be married whenever we can , and then I shall go to Pa at the office and write to Ma .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 16]: It wo n't much agitate Ma ; I am only pen and ink to HER .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 25]: One great comfort is , '' said Caddy with a sob , `` that I shall never hear of Africa after I am married .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 30]: Young Mr. Turveydrop hates it for my sake , and if old Mr. Turveydrop knows there is such a place , it 's as much as he does . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 13]: `` It was he who was very gentlemanly , I think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 11]: said I. `` Very gentlemanly indeed , '' said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 11]: `` He is celebrated almost everywhere for his deportment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 6]: `` Does he teach ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 3]: asked Ada .
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 15]: `` No , he do n't teach anything in particular , '' replied Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 8]: `` But his deportment is beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 38]: Caddy went on to say with considerable hesitation and reluctance that there was one thing more she wished us to know , and felt we ought to know , and which she hoped would not offend us .
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 45]: It was that she had improved her acquaintance with Miss Flite , the little crazy old lady , and that she frequently went there early in the morning and met her lover for a few minutes before breakfast -- only for a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 20]: `` I go there at other times , '' said Caddy , `` but Prince does not come then .
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 30]: Young Mr. Turveydrop 's name is Prince ; I wish it was n't , because it sounds like a dog , but of course be did n't christen himself .
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 14]: Old Mr. Turveydrop had him christened Prince in remembrance of the Prince Regent .
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 13]: Old Mr. Turveydrop adored the Prince Regent on account of his deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 45]: I hope you wo n't think the worse of me for having made these little appointments at Miss Flite 's , where I first went with you , because I like the poor thing for her own sake and I believe she likes me .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 34]: If you could see young Mr. Turveydrop , I am sure you would think well of him -- at least , I am sure you could n't possibly think any ill of him .
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 9]: I am going there now for my lesson .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 42]: I could n't ask you to go with me , Miss Summerson ; but if you would , '' said Caddy , who had said all this earnestly and tremblingly , `` I should be very glad -- very glad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 18]: It happened that we had arranged with my guardian to go to Miss Flite 's that day .
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 28]: We had told him of our former visit , and our account had interested him ; but something had always happened to prevent our going there again .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 73]: As I trusted that I might have sufficient influence with Miss Jellyby to prevent her taking any very rash step if I fully accepted the confidence she was so willing to place in me , poor girl , I proposed that she and I and Peepy should go to the academy and afterwards meet my guardian and Ada at Miss Flite 's , whose name I now learnt for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 17]: This was on condition that Miss Jellyby and Peepy should come back with us to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 52]: The last article of the agreement being joyfully acceded to by both , we smartened Peepy up a little with the assistance of a few pins , some soap and water , and a hair-brush , and went out , bending our steps towards Newman Street , which was very near .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 25]: I found the academy established in a sufficiently dingy house at the corner of an archway , with busts in all the staircase windows .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 42]: In the same house there were also established , as I gathered from the plates on the door , a drawing-master , a coal-merchant -LRB- there was , certainly , no room for his coals -RRB- , and a lithographic artist .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 23]: On the plate which , in size and situation , took precedence of all the rest , I read , MR. TURVEYDROP .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 41]: The door was open , and the hall was blocked up by a grand piano , a harp , and several other musical instruments in cases , all in progress of removal , and all looking rakish in the daylight .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 18]: Miss Jellyby informed me that the academy had been lent , last night , for a concert .
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 62]: We went upstairs -- it had been quite a fine house once , when it was anybody 's business to keep it clean and fresh , and nobody 's business to smoke in it all day -- and into Mr. Turveydrop 's great room , which was built out into a mews at the back and was lighted by a skylight .
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 51]: It was a bare , resounding room smelling of stables , with cane forms along the walls , and the walls ornamented at regular intervals with painted lyres and little cut-glass branches for candles , which seemed to be shedding their old-fashioned drops as other branches might shed autumn leaves .
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 45]: Several young lady pupils , ranging from thirteen or fourteen years of age to two or three and twenty , were assembled ; and I was looking among them for their instructor when Caddy , pinching my arm , repeated the ceremony of introduction .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 9]: `` Miss Summerson , Mr. Prince Turveydrop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 28]: I curtsied to a little blue-eyed fair man of youthful appearance with flaxen hair parted in the middle and curling at the ends all round his head .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 30]: He had a little fiddle , which we used to call at school a kit , under his left arm , and its little bow in the same hand .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 59]: His little dancing-shoes were particularly diminutive , and he had a little innocent , feminine manner which not only appealed to me in an amiable way , but made this singular effect upon me , that I received the impression that he was like his mother and that his mother had not been much considered or well used .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 21]: `` I am very happy to see Miss Jellyby 's friend , '' he said , bowing low to me .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 28]: `` I began to fear , '' with timid tenderness , `` as it was past the usual time , that Miss Jellyby was not coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 36]: `` I beg you will have the goodness to attribute that to me , who have detained her , and to receive my excuses , sir , '' said I. `` Oh , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 23]: `` And pray , '' I entreated , `` do not allow me to be the cause of any more delay . ''
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 52]: With that apology I withdrew to a seat between Peepy -LRB- who , being well used to it , had already climbed into a corner place -RRB- and an old lady of a censorious countenance whose two nieces were in the class and who was very indignant with Peepy 's boots .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 22]: Prince Turveydrop then tinkled the strings of his kit with his fingers , and the young ladies stood up to dance .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 19]: Just then there appeared from a side-door old Mr. Turveydrop , in the full lustre of his deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 21]: He was a fat old gentleman with a false complexion , false teeth , false whiskers , and a wig .
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 30]: He had a fur collar , and he had a padded breast to his coat , which only wanted a star or a broad blue ribbon to be complete .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 25]: He was pinched in , and swelled out , and got up , and strapped down , as much as he could possibly bear .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 46]: He had such a neckcloth on -LRB- puffing his very eyes out of their natural shape -RRB- , and his chin and even his ears so sunk into it , that it seemed as though be must inevitably double up if it were cast loose .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 56]: He had under his arm a hat of great size and weight , shelving downward from the crown to the brim , and in his hand a pair of white gloves with which he flapped it as he stood poised on one leg in a high-shouldered , round-elbowed state of elegance not to be surpassed .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 58]: He had a cane , he had an eye-glass , he had a snuff-box , he had rings , he had wristbands , he had everything but any touch of nature ; he was not like youth , he was not like age , he was not like anything in the world but a model of deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 3]: `` Father !
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 3]: A visitor .
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 9]: Miss Jellyby 's friend , Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 16]: `` Distinguished , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` by Miss Summerson 's presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 24]: As he bowed to me in that tight state , I almost believe I saw creases come into the whites of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 27]: `` My father , '' said the son , aside , to me with quite an affecting belief in him , `` is a celebrated character .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 7]: My father is greatly admired . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 6]: `` Go on , Prince !
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 17]: said Mr. Turveydrop , standing with his back to the fire and waving his gloves condescendingly .
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 8]: `` Go on , my son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 15]: At this command , or by this gracious permission , the lesson went on .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 59]: Prince Turveydrop sometimes played the kit , dancing ; sometimes played the piano , standing ; sometimes hummed the tune with what little breath he could spare , while he set a pupil right ; always conscientiously moved with the least proficient through every step and every part of the figure ; and never rested for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 17]: His distinguished father did nothing whatever but stand before the fire , a model of deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 18]: `` And he never does anything else , '' said the old lady of the censorious countenance .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 15]: `` Yet would you believe that it 's HIS name on the door-plate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 39]: `` His son 's name is the same , you know , '' said I. `` He would n't let his son have any name if he could take it from him , '' returned the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 9]: `` Look at the son 's dress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 10]: It certainly was plain -- threadbare -- almost shabby .
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 23]: `` Yet the father must be garnished and tricked out , '' said the old lady , `` because of his deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 5]: I 'd deport him !
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 7]: Transport him would be better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 10]: I felt curious to know more concerning this person .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 13]: I asked , `` Does he give lessons in deportment now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 6]: returned the old lady shortly .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 5]: `` Never did . ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 16]: After a moment 's consideration , I suggested that perhaps fencing had been his accomplishment .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 19]: `` I do n't believe he can fence at all , ma'am , '' said the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 6]: I looked surprised and inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 38]: The old lady , becoming more and more incensed against the master of deportment as she dwelt upon the subject , gave me some particulars of his career , with strong assurances that they were mildly stated .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 61]: He had married a meek little dancing-mistress , with a tolerable connexion -LRB- having never in his life before done anything but deport himself -RRB- , and had worked her to death , or had , at the best , suffered her to work herself to death , to maintain him in those expenses which were indispensable to his position .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 59]: At once to exhibit his deportment to the best models and to keep the best models constantly before himself , he had found it necessary to frequent all public places of fashionable and lounging resort , to be seen at Brighton and elsewhere at fashionable times , and to lead an idle life in the very best clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 32]: To enable him to do this , the affectionate little dancing-mistress had toiled and laboured and would have toiled and laboured to that hour if her strength had lasted so long .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 74]: For the mainspring of the story was that in spite of the man 's absorbing selfishness , his wife -LRB- overpowered by his deportment -RRB- had , to the last , believed in him and had , on her death-bed , in the most moving terms , confided him to their son as one who had an inextinguishable claim upon him and whom he could never regard with too much pride and deference .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 56]: The son , inheriting his mother 's belief , and having the deportment always before him , had lived and grown in the same faith , and now , at thirty years of age , worked for his father twelve hours a day and looked up to him with veneration on the old imaginary pinnacle .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 9]: `` The airs the fellow gives himself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 32]: said my informant , shaking her head at old Mr. Turveydrop with speechless indignation as he drew on his tight gloves , of course unconscious of the homage she was rendering .
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 11]: `` He fully believes he is one of the aristocracy !
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 23]: And he is so condescending to the son he so egregiously deludes that you might suppose him the most virtuous of parents .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 11]: said the old lady , apostrophizing him with infinite vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 7]: `` I could bite you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 20]: I could not help being amused , though I heard the old lady out with feelings of real concern .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 14]: It was difficult to doubt her with the father and son before me .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 34]: What I might have thought of them without the old lady 's account , or what I might have thought of the old lady 's account without them , I can not say .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 15]: There was a fitness of things in the whole that carried conviction with it .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 36]: My eyes were yet wandering , from young Mr. Turveydrop working so hard , to old Mr. Turveydrop deporting himself so beautifully , when the latter came ambling up to me and entered into conversation .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 23]: He asked me , first of all , whether I conferred a charm and a distinction on London by residing in it ?
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 32]: I did not think it necessary to reply that I was perfectly aware I should not do that , in any case , but merely told him where I did reside .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 33]: `` A lady so graceful and accomplished , '' he said , kissing his right glove and afterwards extending it towards the pupils , `` will look leniently on the deficiencies here .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 12]: We do our best to polish -- polish -- polish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 15]: He sat down beside me , taking some pains to sit on the form .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 16]: I thought , in imitation of the print of his illustrious model on the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 9]: And really he did look very like it .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 9]: `` To polish -- polish -- polish ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 14]: he repeated , taking a pinch of snuff and gently fluttering his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 62]: `` But we are not , if I may say so to one formed to be graceful both by Nature and Art -- '' with the high-shouldered bow , which it seemed impossible for him to make without lifting up his eyebrows and shutting his eyes '' -- we are not what we used to be in point of deportment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 8]: `` Are we not , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 28]: said I. `` We have degenerated , '' he returned , shaking his head , which he could do to a very limited extent in his cravat .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 10]: `` A levelling age is not favourable to deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 4]: It develops vulgarity .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 8]: Perhaps I speak with some little partiality .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 62]: It may not be for me to say that I have been called , for some years now , Gentleman Turveydrop , or that his Royal Highness the Prince Regent did me the honour to inquire , on my removing my hat as he drove out of the Pavilion at Brighton -LRB- that fine building -RRB- , ` Who is he ?
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 6]: Who the devil is he ?
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 7]: Why do n't I know him ?
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 10]: Why has n't he thirty thousand a year ? '
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 23]: But these are little matters of anecdote -- the general property , ma'am -- still repeated occasionally among the upper classes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 7]: He replied with the high-shouldered bow .
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 18]: `` Where what is left among us of deportment , '' he added , `` still lingers .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 7]: England -- alas , my country !
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 12]: -- has degenerated very much , and is degenerating every day .
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 7]: She has not many gentlemen left .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 4]: We are few .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 13]: I see nothing to succeed us but a race of weavers . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 24]: `` One might hope that the race of gentlemen would be perpetuated here , '' said I. `` You are very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: He smiled with a high-shouldered bow again .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 5]: `` You flatter me .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 6]: But , no -- no !
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 17]: I have never been able to imbue my poor boy with that part of his art .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 18]: Heaven forbid that I should disparage my dear child , but he has -- no deportment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 13]: `` He appears to be an excellent master , '' I observed .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 14]: `` Understand me , my dear madam , he IS an excellent master .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 10]: All that can be acquired , he has acquired .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 10]: All that can be imparted , he can impart .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 33]: But there ARE things -- '' He took another pinch of snuff and made the bow again , as if to add , `` This kind of thing , for instance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 28]: I glanced towards the centre of the room , where Miss Jellyby 's lover , now engaged with single pupils , was undergoing greater drudgery than ever .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 14]: `` My amiable child , '' murmured Mr. Turveydrop , adjusting his cravat .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 27]: `` Your son is indefatigable , '' said I. `` It is my reward , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 14]: In some respects , he treads in the footsteps of his sainted mother .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 6]: She was a devoted creature .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 23]: But wooman , lovely wooman , '' said Mr. Turveydrop with very disagreeable gallantry , `` what a sex you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 17]: I rose and joined Miss Jellyby , who was by this time putting on her bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 19]: The time allotted to a lesson having fully elapsed , there was a general putting on of bonnets .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 32]: When Miss Jellyby and the unfortunate Prince found an opportunity to become betrothed I do n't know , but they certainly found none on this occasion to exchange a dozen words .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 21]: `` My dear , '' said Mr. Turveydrop benignly to his son , `` do you know the hour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 6]: `` No , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 6]: The son had no watch .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 22]: The father had a handsome gold one , which he pulled out with an air that was an example to mankind .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 14]: `` My son , '' said he , `` it 's two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 9]: Recollect your school at Kensington at three . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 14]: `` That 's time enough for me , father , '' said Prince .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 14]: `` I can take a morsel of dinner standing and be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 17]: `` My dear boy , '' returned his father , `` you must be very quick .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 11]: You will find the cold mutton on the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 6]: `` Thank you , father .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 8]: Are YOU off now , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 6]: `` Yes , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 34]: I suppose , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , shutting his eyes and lifting up his shoulders with modest consciousness , `` that I must show myself , as usual , about town . ''
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 14]: `` You had better dine out comfortably somewhere , '' said his son .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 9]: `` My dear child , I intend to .
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 21]: I shall take my little meal , I think , at the French house , in the Opera Colonnade . ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 5]: `` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 5]: Good-bye , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 6]: said Prince , shaking hands .
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 6]: `` Good-bye , my son .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 4]: Bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 67]: Mr. Turveydrop said this in quite a pious manner , and it seemed to do his son good , who , in parting from him , was so pleased with him , so dutiful to him , and so proud of him that I almost felt as if it were an unkindness to the younger man not to be able to believe implicitly in the elder .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 41]: The few moments that were occupied by Prince in taking leave of us -LRB- and particularly of one of us , as I saw , being in the secret -RRB- , enhanced my favourable impression of his almost childish character .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 63]: I felt a liking for him and a compassion for him as he put his little kit in his pocket -- and with it his desire to stay a little while with Caddy -- and went away good-humouredly to his cold mutton and his school at Kensington , that made me scarcely less irate with his father than the censorious old lady .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 26]: The father opened the room door for us and bowed us out in a manner , I must acknowledge , worthy of his shining original .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 41]: In the same style he presently passed us on the other side of the street , on his way to the aristocratic part of the town , where he was going to show himself among the few other gentlemen left .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 80]: For some moments , I was so lost in reconsidering what I had heard and seen in Newman Street that I was quite unable to talk to Caddy or even to fix my attention on what she said to me , especially when I began to inquire in my mind whether there were , or ever had been , any other gentlemen , not in the dancing profession , who lived and founded a reputation entirely on their deportment .
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 37]: This became so bewildering and suggested the possibility of so many Mr. Turveydrops that I said , `` Esther , you must make up your mind to abandon this subject altogether and attend to Caddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 19]: I accordingly did so , and we chatted all the rest of the way to Lincoln 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 23]: Caddy told me that her lover 's education had been so neglected that it was not always easy to read his notes .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 44]: She said if he were not so anxious about his spelling and took less pains to make it clear , he would do better ; but he put so many unnecessary letters into short words that they sometimes quite lost their English appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 27]: `` He does it with the best intention , '' observed Caddy , `` but it has n't the effect he means , poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 46]: Caddy then went on to reason , how could he be expected to be a scholar when he had passed his whole life in the dancing-school and had done nothing but teach and fag , fag and teach , morning , noon , and night !
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 6]: And what did it matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 28]: She could write letters enough for both , as she knew to her cost , and it was far better for him to be amiable than learned .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 26]: `` Besides , it 's not as if I was an accomplished girl who had any right to give herself airs , '' said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 14]: `` I know little enough , I am sure , thanks to Ma !
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 38]: `` There 's another thing I want to tell you , now we are alone , '' continued Caddy , `` which I should not have liked to mention unless you had seen Prince , Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 8]: You know what a house ours is .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 25]: It 's of no use my trying to learn anything that it would be useful for Prince 's wife to know in OUR house .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 25]: We live in such a state of muddle that it 's impossible , and I have only been more disheartened whenever I have tried .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 13]: So I get a little practice with -- who do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 4]: Poor Miss Flite !
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 72]: Early in the morning I help her to tidy her room and clean her birds , and I make her cup of coffee for her -LRB- of course she taught me -RRB- , and I have learnt to make it so well that Prince says it 's the very best coffee he ever tasted , and would quite delight old Mr. Turveydrop , who is very particular indeed about his coffee .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 33]: I can make little puddings too ; and I know how to buy neck of mutton , and tea , and sugar , and butter , and a good many housekeeping things .
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 59]: I am not clever at my needle , yet , '' said Caddy , glancing at the repairs on Peepy 's frock , `` but perhaps I shall improve , and since I have been engaged to Prince and have been doing all this , I have felt better-tempered , I hope , and more forgiving to Ma .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 49]: It rather put me out at first this morning to see you and Miss Clare looking so neat and pretty and to feel ashamed of Peepy and myself too , but on the whole I hope I am better-tempered than I was and more forgiving to Ma . ''
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 18]: The poor girl , trying so hard , said it from her heart , and touched mine .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 30]: `` Caddy , my love , '' I replied , `` I begin to have a great affection for you , and I hope we shall become friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 7]: `` Oh , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 3]: cried Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 9]: `` How happy that would make me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 39]: `` My dear Caddy , '' said I , `` let us be friends from this time , and let us often have a chat about these matters and try to find the right way through them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 4]: Caddy was overjoyed .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 38]: I said everything I could in my old-fashioned way to comfort and encourage her , and I would not have objected to old Mr. Turveydrop that day for any smaller consideration than a settlement on his daughter-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 17]: By this time we were come to Mr. Krook 's , whose private door stood open .
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 20]: There was a bill , pasted on the door-post , announcing a room to let on the second floor .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 33]: It reminded Caddy to tell me as we proceeded upstairs that there had been a sudden death there and an inquest and that our little friend had been ill of the fright .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 15]: The door and window of the vacant room being open , we looked in .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 25]: It was the room with the dark door to which Miss Flite had secretly directed my attention when I was last in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 25]: A sad and desolate place it was , a gloomy , sorrowful place that gave me a strange sensation of mournfulness and even dread .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 18]: `` You look pale , '' said Caddy when we came out , `` and cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 10]: I felt as if the room had chilled me .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 19]: We had walked slowly while we were talking , and my guardian and Ada were here before us .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 9]: We found them in Miss Flite 's garret .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 33]: They were looking at the birds , while a medical gentleman who was so good as to attend Miss Flite with much solicitude and compassion spoke with her cheerfully by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 15]: `` I have finished my professional visit , '' he said , coming forward .
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 22]: `` Miss Flite is much better and may appear in court -LRB- as her mind is set upon it -RRB- to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 11]: She has been greatly missed there , I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 15]: Miss Flite received the compliment with complacency and dropped a general curtsy to us .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 19]: `` Honoured , indeed , '' said she , `` by another visit from the wards in Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 14]: Ve-ry happy to receive Jarndyce of Bleak House beneath my humble roof ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 5]: with a special curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 33]: `` Fitz -- Jarndyce , my dear '' -- she had bestowed that name on Caddy , it appeared , and always called her by it -- `` a double welcome ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 8]: `` Has she been very ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 15]: asked Mr. Jarndyce of the gentleman whom we had found in attendance on her .
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 16]: She answered for herself directly , though he had put the question in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 6]: `` Oh , decidedly unwell !
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 11]: Oh , very unwell indeed , '' she said confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 9]: `` Not pain , you know -- trouble .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 9]: Not bodily so much as nervous , nervous !
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 19]: The truth is , '' in a subdued voice and trembling , `` we have had death here .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 7]: There was poison in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: I am very susceptible to such horrid things .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 4]: It frightened me .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 7]: Only Mr. Woodcourt knows how much .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 8]: My physician , Mr , Woodcourt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 4]: with great stateliness .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 16]: `` The wards in Jarndyce -- Jarndyce of Bleak House -- Fitz -- Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 47]: `` Miss Flite , '' said Mr. Woodcourt in a grave kind of voice , as if he were appealing to her while speaking to us , and laying his hand gently on her arm , `` Miss Flite describes her illness with her usual accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 27]: She was alarmed by an occurrence in the house which might have alarmed a stronger person , and was made ill by the distress and agitation .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 27]: She brought me here in the first hurry of the discovery , though too late for me to be of any use to the unfortunate man .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 21]: I have compensated myself for that disappointment by coming here since and being of some small use to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 15]: `` The kindest physician in the college , '' whispered Miss Flite to me .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 6]: `` I expect a judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 6]: On the day of judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 7]: And shall then confer estates . ''
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 32]: `` She will be as well in a day or two , '' said Mr. Woodcourt , looking at her with an observant smile , `` as she ever will be .
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 9]: In other words , quite well of course .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 9]: Have you heard of her good fortune ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 5]: `` Most extraordinary ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 7]: said Miss Flite , smiling brightly .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 12]: `` You never heard of such a thing , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 22]: Every Saturday , Conversation Kenge or Guppy -LRB- clerk to Conversation K. -RRB- places in my hand a paper of shillings .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 2]: Shillings .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 4]: I assure you !
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 8]: Always the same number in the paper .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 9]: Always one for every day in the week .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 6]: Now you know , really !
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 7]: So well-timed , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 2]: Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 10]: From whence do these papers come , you say ?
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 6]: That is the great question .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 2]: Naturally .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 8]: Shall I tell you what I think ?
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 58]: I think , '' said Miss Flite , drawing herself back with a very shrewd look and shaking her right forefinger in a most significant manner , `` that the Lord Chancellor , aware of the length of time during which the Great Seal has been open -LRB- for it has been open a long time ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 4]: , forwards them .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 8]: Until the judgment I expect is given .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 9]: Now that 's very creditable , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 15]: To confess in that way that he IS a little slow for human life .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 3]: So delicate !
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 26]: Attending court the other day -- I attend it regularly , with my documents -- I taxed him with it , and he almost confessed .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 20]: That is , I smiled at him from my bench , and HE smiled at me from his bench .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 11]: But it 's great good fortune , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 14]: And Fitz -- Jarndyce lays the money out for me to great advantage .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 11]: Oh , I assure you to the greatest advantage ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 27]: I congratulated her -LRB- as she addressed herself to me -RRB- upon this fortunate addition to her income and wished her a long continuance of it .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 19]: I did not speculate upon the source from which it came or wonder whose humanity was so considerate .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 20]: My guardian stood before me , contemplating the birds , and I had no need to look beyond him .
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 13]: `` And what do you call these little fellows , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 7]: said he in his pleasant voice .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 7]: `` Have they any names ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 26]: `` I can answer for Miss Elite that they have , '' said I , `` for she promised to tell us what they were .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 4]: Ada remembers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 5]: Ada remembered very well .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 5]: `` Did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 4]: said Miss Elite .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 8]: `` Who 's that at my door ?
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 12]: What are you listening at my door for , Krook ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 29]: The old man of the house , pushing it open before him , appeared there with his fur cap in his hand and his cat at his heels .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 32]: `` I war n't listening , Miss Flite , '' he said , `` I was going to give a rap with my knuckles , only you 're so quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 7]: `` Make your cat go down .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 5]: Drive her away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 6]: the old lady angrily exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 5]: `` Bah , bah !
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 50]: There ai n't no danger , gentlefolks , '' said Mr. Krook , looking slowly and sharply from one to another until he had looked at all of us ; `` she 'd never offer at the birds when I was here unless I told her to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 17]: `` You will excuse my landlord , '' said the old lady with a dignified air .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 6]: `` M , quite M !
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 13]: What do you want , Krook , when I have company ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 4]: `` Hi ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 5]: said the old man .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 9]: `` You know I am the Chancellor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 4]: returned Miss Elite .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 6]: `` What of that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 32]: `` For the Chancellor , '' said the old man with a chuckle , `` not to be acquainted with a Jarndyce is queer , ai n't it , Miss Flite ?
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 7]: Might n't I take the liberty ?
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 5]: Your servant , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 16]: I know Jarndyce and Jarndyce a ` most as well as you do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 8]: I knowed old Squire Tom , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 15]: I never to my knowledge see you afore though , not even in court .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 24]: Yet , I go there a mortal sight of times in the course of the year , taking one day with another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 20]: `` I never go there , '' said Mr. Jarndyce -LRB- which he never did on any consideration -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 10]: `` I would sooner go -- somewhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 6]: `` Would you though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 5]: returned Krook , grinning .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 29]: `` You 're bearing hard upon my noble and learned brother in your meaning , sir , though perhaps it is but nat ` ral in a Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 6]: The burnt child , sir !
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 15]: What , you 're looking at my lodger 's birds , Mr. Jarndyce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 33]: The old man had come by little and little into the room until he now touched my guardian with his elbow and looked close up into his face with his spectacled eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 31]: `` It 's one of her strange ways that she 'll never tell the names of these birds if she can help it , though she named 'em all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 6]: This was in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 10]: `` Shall I run 'em over , Flite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 22]: he asked aloud , winking at us and pointing at her as she turned away , affecting to sweep the grate .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 10]: `` If you like , '' she answered hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 20]: The old man , looking up at the cages after another look at us , went through the list .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 52]: `` Hope , Joy , Youth , Peace , Rest , Life , Dust , Ashes , Waste , Want , Ruin , Despair , Madness , Death , Cunning , Folly , Words , Wigs , Rags , Sheepskin , Plunder , Precedent , Jargon , Gammon , and Spinach .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 26]: That 's the whole collection , '' said the old man , `` all cooped up together , by my noble and learned brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 8]: `` This is a bitter wind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 4]: muttered my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 28]: `` When my noble and learned brother gives his judgment , they 're to be let go free , '' said Krook , winking at us again .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 37]: `` And then , '' he added , whispering and grinning , `` if that ever was to happen -- which it wo n't -- the birds that have never been caged would kill 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 35]: `` If ever the wind was in the east , '' said my guardian , pretending to look out of the window for a weathercock , `` I think it 's there to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 12]: We found it very difficult to get away from the house .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 28]: It was not Miss Flite who detained us ; she was as reasonable a little creature in consulting the convenience of others as there possibly could be .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 5]: It was Mr. Krook .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 10]: He seemed unable to detach himself from Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 17]: If he had been linked to him , he could hardly have attended him more closely .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 74]: He proposed to show us his Court of Chancery and all the strange medley it contained ; during the whole of our inspection -LRB- prolonged by himself -RRB- he kept close to Mr. Jarndyce and sometimes detained him under one pretence or other until we had passed on , as if he were tormented by an inclination to enter upon some secret subject which he could not make up his mind to approach .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 39]: I can not imagine a countenance and manner more singularly expressive of caution and indecision , and a perpetual impulse to do something he could not resolve to venture on , than Mr. Krook 's was that day .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 8]: His watchfulness of my guardian was incessant .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 9]: He rarely removed his eyes from his face .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 19]: If he went on beside him , he observed him with the slyness of an old white fox .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 9]: If he went before , he looked back .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 58]: When we stood still , he got opposite to him , and drawing his hand across and across his open mouth with a curious expression of a sense of power , and turning up his eyes , and lowering his grey eyebrows until they appeared to be shut , seemed to scan every lineament of his face .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 41]: At last , having been -LRB- always attended by the cat -RRB- all over the house and having seen the whole stock of miscellaneous lumber , which was certainly curious , we came into the back part of the shop .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 41]: Here on the head of an empty barrel stood on end were an ink-bottle , some old stumps of pens , and some dirty playbills ; and against the wall were pasted several large printed alphabets in several plain hands .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 8]: `` What are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 4]: asked my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 14]: `` Trying to learn myself to read and write , '' said Krook .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 9]: `` And how do you get on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 3]: `` Slow .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 9]: Bad , '' returned the old man impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 11]: `` It 's hard at my time of life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 17]: `` It would be easier to be taught by some one , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 11]: `` Aye , but they might teach me wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 13]: returned the old man with a wonderfully suspicious flash of his eye .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 16]: `` I do n't know what I may have lost by not being learned afore .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 14]: I would n't like to lose anything by being learned wrong now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 4]: `` Wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 8]: said my guardian with his good-humoured smile .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 11]: `` Who do you suppose would teach you wrong ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 13]: `` I do n't know , Mr. Jarndyce of Bleak House ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 17]: replied the old man , turning up his spectacles on his forehead and rubbing his hands .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 21]: `` I do n't suppose as anybody would , but I 'd rather trust my own self than another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 42]: These answers and his manner were strange enough to cause my guardian to inquire of Mr. Woodcourt , as we all walked across Lincoln 's Inn together , whether Mr. Krook were really , as his lodger represented him , deranged .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 16]: The young surgeon replied , no , he had seen no reason to think so .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 57]: He was exceedingly distrustful , as ignorance usually was , and he was always more or less under the influence of raw gin , of which he drank great quantities and of which he and his back-shop , as we might have observed , smelt strongly ; but he did not think him mad as yet .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 43]: On our way home , I so conciliated Peepy 's affections by buying him a windmill and two flour-sacks that he would suffer nobody else to take off his hat and gloves and would sit nowhere at dinner but at my side .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 30]: Caddy sat upon the other side of me , next to Ada , to whom we imparted the whole history of the engagement as soon as we got back .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 54]: We made much of Caddy , and Peepy too ; and Caddy brightened exceedingly ; and my guardian was as merry as we were ; and we were all very happy indeed until Caddy went home at night in a hackney-coach , with Peepy fast asleep , but holding tight to the windmill .
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 31]: I have forgotten to mention -- at least I have not mentioned -- that Mr. Woodcourt was the same dark young surgeon whom we had met at Mr. Badger 's .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 11]: Or that Mr. Jarndyce invited him to dinner that day .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 5]: Or that he came .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 29]: Or that when they were all gone and I said to Ada , `` Now , my darling , let us have a little talk about Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 17]: Ada laughed and said -- But I do n't think it matters what my darling said .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 5]: She was always merry .
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 31]: Chapter XV -- Bell Yard While we were in London Mr. Jarndyce was constantly beset by the crowd of excitable ladies and gentlemen whose proceedings had so much astonished us .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 17]: Mr. Quale , who presented himself soon after our arrival , was in all such excitements .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 44]: He seemed to project those two shining knobs of temples of his into everything that went on and to brush his hair farther and farther back , until the very roots were almost ready to fly out of his head in inappeasable philanthropy .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 25]: All objects were alike to him , but he was always particularly ready for anything in the way of a testimonial to any one .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 12]: His great power seemed to be his power of indiscriminate admiration .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 26]: He would sit for any length of time , with the utmost enjoyment , bathing his temples in the light of any order of luminary .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 26]: Having first seen him perfectly swallowed up in admiration of Mrs. Jellyby , I had supposed her to be the absorbing object of his devotion .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 20]: I soon discovered my mistake and found him to be train-bearer and organ-blower to a whole procession of people .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 18]: Mrs. Pardiggle came one day for a subscription to something , and with her , Mr. Quale .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 27]: Whatever Mrs. Pardiggle said , Mr. Quale repeated to us ; and just as he had drawn Mrs. Jellyby out , he drew Mrs. Pardiggle out .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 19]: Mrs. Pardiggle wrote a letter of introduction to my guardian in behalf of her eloquent friend Mr. Gusher .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 8]: With Mr. Gusher appeared Mr. Quale again .
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 95]: Mr. Gusher , being a flabby gentleman with a moist surface and eyes so much too small for his moon of a face that they seemed to have been originally made for somebody else , was not at first sight prepossessing ; yet he was scarcely seated before Mr. Quale asked Ada and me , not inaudibly , whether he was not a great creature -- which he certainly was , flabbily speaking , though Mr. Quale meant in intellectual beauty -- and whether we were not struck by his massive configuration of brow .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 57]: In short , we heard of a great many missions of various sorts among this set of people , but nothing respecting them was half so clear to us as that it was Mr. Quale 's mission to be in ecstasies with everybody else 's mission and that it was the most popular mission of all .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 129]: Mr. Jarndyce had fallen into this company in the tenderness of his heart and his earnest desire to do all the good in his power ; but that he felt it to be too often an unsatisfactory company , where benevolence took spasmodic forms , where charity was assumed as a regular uniform by loud professors and speculators in cheap notoriety , vehement in profession , restless and vain in action , servile in the last degree of meanness to the great , adulatory of one another , and intolerable to those who were anxious quietly to help the weak from failing rather than with a great deal of bluster and self-laudation to raise them up a little way when they were down , he plainly told us .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 87]: When a testimonial was originated to Mr. Quale by Mr. Gusher -LRB- who had already got one , originated by Mr. Quale -RRB- , and when Mr. Gusher spoke for an hour and a half on the subject to a meeting , including two charity schools of small boys and girls , who were specially reminded of the widow 's mite , and requested to come forward with halfpence and be acceptable sacrifices , I think the wind was in the east for three whole weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 12]: I mention this because I am coming to Mr. Skimpole again .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 53]: It seemed to me that his off-hand professions of childishness and carelessness were a great relief to my guardian , by contrast with such things , and were the more readily believed in since to find one perfectly undesigning and candid man among many opposites could not fail to give him pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 25]: I should be sorry to imply that Mr. Skimpole divined this and was politic ; I really never understood him well enough to know .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 17]: What he was to my guardian , he certainly was to the rest of the world .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 25]: He had not been very well ; and thus , though he lived in London , we had seen nothing of him until now .
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 18]: He appeared one morning in his usual agreeable way and as full of pleasant spirits as ever .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 9]: Well , he said , here he was !
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 27]: He had been bilious , but rich men were often bilious , and therefore he had been persuading himself that he was a man of property .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 16]: So he was , in a certain point of view -- in his expansive intentions .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 13]: He had been enriching his medical attendant in the most lavish manner .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 12]: He had always doubled , and sometimes quadrupled , his fees .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 31]: He had said to the doctor , `` Now , my dear doctor , it is quite a delusion on your part to suppose that you attend me for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 19]: I am overwhelming you with money -- in my expansive intentions -- if you only knew it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 23]: And really -LRB- he said -RRB- he meant it to that degree that he thought it much the same as doing it .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 37]: If he had had those bits of metal or thin paper to which mankind attached so much importance to put in the doctor 's hand , he would have put them in the doctor 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 12]: Not having them , he substituted the will for the deed .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 3]: Very well !
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 35]: If he really meant it -- if his will were genuine and real , which it was -- it appeared to him that it was the same as coin , and cancelled the obligation .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 29]: `` It may be , partly , because I know nothing of the value of money , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` but I often feel this .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 5]: It seems so reasonable !
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 11]: My butcher says to me he wants that little bill .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 36]: It 's a part of the pleasant unconscious poetry of the man 's nature that he always calls it a ` little ' bill -- to make the payment appear easy to both of us .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 20]: I reply to the butcher , ` My good friend , if you knew it , you are paid .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 15]: You have n't had the trouble of coming to ask for the little bill .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 4]: You are paid .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 6]: I mean it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 28]: `` But , suppose , '' said my guardian , laughing , `` he had meant the meat in the bill , instead of providing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 14]: `` My dear Jarndyce , '' he returned , `` you surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 7]: You take the butcher 's position .
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 11]: A butcher I once dealt with occupied that very ground .
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 19]: Says he , ` Sir , why did you eat spring lamb at eighteen pence a pound ? '
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 17]: ` Why did I eat spring lamb at eighteen-pence a pound , my honest friend ? '
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 10]: said I , naturally amazed by the question . '
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 6]: I like spring lamb ! '
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 6]: This was so far convincing .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 24]: ` Well , sir , ' says he , ' I wish I had meant the lamb as you mean the money ! '
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 18]: ` My good fellow , ' said I , ` pray let us reason like intellectual beings .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 5]: How could that be ?
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 4]: It was impossible .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 14]: You HAD got the lamb , and I have NOT got the money .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 28]: You could n't really mean the lamb without sending it in , whereas I can , and do , really mean the money without paying it ! '
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 6]: He had not a word .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 9]: There was an end of the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 9]: `` Did he take no legal proceedings ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 4]: inquired my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 13]: `` Yes , he took legal proceedings , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 14]: `` But in that he was influenced by passion , not by reason .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 6]: Passion reminds me of Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 21]: He writes me that you and the ladies have promised him a short visit at his bachelor-house in Lincolnshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 24]: `` He is a great favourite with my girls , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` and I have promised for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 20]: `` Nature forgot to shade him off , I think , '' observed Mr. Skimpole to Ada and me .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 10]: `` A little too boisterous -- like the sea .
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 20]: A little too vehement -- like a bull who has made up his mind to consider every colour scarlet .
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 12]: But I grant a sledge-hammering sort of merit in him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 35]: I should have been surprised if those two could have thought very highly of one another , Mr. Boythorn attaching so much importance to many things and Mr. Skimpole caring so little for anything .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 28]: Besides which , I had noticed Mr. Boythorn more than once on the point of breaking out into some strong opinion when Mr. Skimpole was referred to .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 17]: Of course I merely joined Ada in saying that we had been greatly pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 47]: `` He has invited me , '' said Mr. Skimpole ; `` and if a child may trust himself in such hands -- which the present child is encouraged to do , with the united tenderness of two angels to guard him -- I shall go .
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 10]: He proposes to frank me down and back again .
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 7]: I suppose it will cost money ?
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 3]: Shillings perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 3]: Or pounds ?
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 6]: Or something of that sort ?
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 6]: By the by , Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 10]: You remember our friend Coavinses , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 23]: He asked me as the subject arose in his mind , in his graceful , light-hearted manner and without the least embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 17]: said I. `` Coavinses has been arrested by the Great Bailiff , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 13]: `` He will never do violence to the sunshine any more . ''
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 34]: It quite shocked me to hear it , for I had already recalled with anything but a serious association the image of the man sitting on the sofa that night wiping his head .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 14]: `` His successor informed me of it yesterday , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 18]: `` His successor is in my house now -- in possession , I think he calls it .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 11]: He came yesterday , on my blue-eyed daughter 's birthday .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 13]: I put it to him , ` This is unreasonable and inconvenient .
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 21]: If you had a blue-eyed daughter you would n't like ME to come , uninvited , on HER birthday ? '
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 5]: But he stayed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 18]: Mr. Skimpole laughed at the pleasant absurdity and lightly touched the piano by which he was seated .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 26]: `` And he told me , '' he said , playing little chords where I shall put full stops , `` The Coavinses had left .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 3]: Three children .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 3]: No mother .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 6]: And that Coavinses ' profession .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 3]: Being unpopular .
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 4]: The rising Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 7]: Were at a considerable disadvantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 15]: Mr. Jarndyce got up , rubbing his head , and began to walk about .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 13]: Mr. Skimpole played the melody of one of Ada 's favourite songs .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 20]: Ada and I both looked at Mr. Jarndyce , thinking that we knew what was passing in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 33]: After walking and stopping , and several times leaving off rubbing his head , and beginning again , my guardian put his hand upon the keys and stopped Mr. Skimpole 's playing .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 14]: `` I do n't like this , Skimpole , '' he said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 14]: Mr. Skimpole , who had quite forgotten the subject , looked up surprised .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 53]: `` The man was necessary , '' pursued my guardian , walking backward and forward in the very short space between the piano and the end of the room and rubbing his hair up from the back of his head as if a high east wind had blown it into that form .
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 34]: `` If we make such men necessary by our faults and follies , or by our want of worldly knowledge , or by our misfortunes , we must not revenge ourselves upon them .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 8]: There was no harm in his trade .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 5]: He maintained his children .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 10]: One would like to know more about this . ''
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 3]: Coavinses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 11]: cried Mr. Skimpole , at length perceiving what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 4]: `` Nothing easier .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 16]: A walk to Coavinses ' headquarters , and you can know what you will . ''
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 14]: Mr. Jarndyce nodded to us , who were only waiting for the signal .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 3]: `` Come !
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 9]: We will walk that way , my dears .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 10]: Why not that way as soon as another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 8]: We were quickly ready and went out .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 11]: Mr. Skimpole went with us and quite enjoyed the expedition .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 22]: It was so new and so refreshing , he said , for him to want Coavinses instead of Coavinses wanting him !
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 29]: He took us , first , to Cursitor Street , Chancery Lane , where there was a house with barred windows , which he called Coavinses ' Castle .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 31]: On our going into the entry and ringing a bell , a very hideous boy came out of a sort of office and looked at us over a spiked wicket .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 7]: `` Who did you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 13]: said the boy , fitting two of the spikes into his chin .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 26]: `` There was a follower , or an officer , or something , here , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` who is dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 4]: `` Yes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 4]: said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 13]: `` I want to know his name , if you please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 10]: `` Name of Neckett , '' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 6]: `` And his address ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 9]: `` Bell Yard , '' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 14]: `` Chandler 's shop , left hand side , name of Blinder . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 23]: `` Was he -- I do n't know how to shape the question -- '' murmured my guardian , `` industrious ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 5]: `` Was Neckett ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 4]: said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 7]: `` Yes , wery much so .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 7]: He was never tired of watching .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 25]: He 'd set upon a post at a street corner eight or ten hours at a stretch if he undertook to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 14]: `` He might have done worse , '' I heard my guardian soliloquize .
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 13]: `` He might have undertaken to do it and not done it .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 7]: That 's all I want . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 48]: We left the boy , with his head on one side and his arms on the gate , fondling and sucking the spikes , and went back to Lincoln 's Inn , where Mr. Skimpole , who had not cared to remain nearer Coavinses , awaited us .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 17]: Then we all went to Bell Yard , a narrow alley at a very short distance .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 8]: We soon found the chandler 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 19]: In it was a good-natured-looking old woman with a dropsy , or an asthma , or perhaps both .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 6]: `` Neckett 's children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 8]: said she in reply to my inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 7]: `` Yes , Surely , miss .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 7]: Three pair , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 7]: Door right opposite the stairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 10]: And she handed me the key across the counter .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 25]: I glanced at the key and glanced at her , but she took it for granted that I knew what to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 29]: As it could only be intended for the children 's door , I came out without askmg any more questions and led the way up the dark stairs .
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 45]: We went as quietly as we could , but four of us made some noise on the aged boards , and when we came to the second story we found we had disturbed a man who was standing there looking out of his room .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 9]: `` Is it Gridley that 's wanted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 13]: he said , fixing his eyes on me with an angry stare .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 17]: `` No , sir , '' said I ; `` I am going higher up . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 31]: He looked at Ada , and at Mr. Jarndyce , and at Mr. Skimpole , fixing the same angry stare on each in succession as they passed and followed me .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 7]: Mr. Jarndyce gave him good day .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 5]: `` Good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 6]: he said abruptly and fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 27]: He was a tall , sallow man with a careworn head on which but little hair remained , a deeply lined face , and prominent eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 33]: He had a combative look and a chafing , irritable manner which , associated with his figure -- still large and powerful , though evidently in its decline -- rather alarmed me .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 32]: He had a pen in his hand , and in the glimpse I caught of his room in passing , I saw that it was covered with a litter of papers .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 13]: Leaving him standing there , we went up to the top room .
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 20]: I tapped at the door , and a little shrill voice inside said , `` We are locked in .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 8]: Mrs. Blinder 's got the key ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 12]: I applied the key on hearing this and opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 37]: In a poor room with a sloping ceiling and containing very little furniture was a mite of a boy , some five or six years old , nursing and hushing a heavy child of eighteen months .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 25]: There was no fire , though the weather was cold ; both children were wrapped in some poor shawls and tippets as a substitute .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 41]: Their clothing was not so warm , however , but that their noses looked red and pinched and their small figures shrunken as the boy walked up and down nursing and hushing the child with its head on his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 10]: `` Who has locked you up here alone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 4]: we naturally asked .
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 15]: `` Charley , '' said the boy , standing still to gaze at us .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 7]: `` Is Charley your brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 7]: She 's my sister , Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 6]: Father called her Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 11]: `` Are there any more of you besides Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 24]: `` Me , '' said the boy , `` and Emma , '' patting the limp bonnet of the child he was nursing .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 5]: `` And Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 7]: `` Where is Charley now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 37]: `` Out a-washing , '' said the boy , beginning to walk up and down again and taking the nankeen bonnet much too near the bedstead by trying to gaze at us at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 59]: We were looking at one another and at these two children when there came into the room a very little girl , childish in figure but shrewd and older-looking in the face -- pretty-faced too -- wearing a womanly sort of bonnet much too large for her and drying her bare arms on a womanly sort of apron .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 22]: Her fingers were white and wrinkled with washing , and the soap-suds were yet smoking which she wiped off her arms .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 26]: But for this , she might have been a child playing at washing and imitating a poor working-woman with a quick observation of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 19]: She had come running from some place in the neighbourhood and had made all the haste she could .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 36]: Consequently , though she was very light , she was out of breath and could not speak at first , as she stood panting , and wiping her arms , and looking quietly at us .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: `` Oh , here 's Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 4]: said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 18]: The child he was nursing stretched forth its arms and cried out to be taken by Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 35]: The little girl took it , in a womanly sort of manner belonging to the apron and the bonnet , and stood looking at us over the burden that clung to her most affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 49]: `` Is it possible , '' whispered my guardian as we put a chair for the little creature and got her to sit down with her load , the boy keeping close to her , holding to her apron , `` that this child works for the rest ?
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 4]: Look at this !
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 10]: For God 's sake , look at this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 8]: It was a thing to look at .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 39]: The three children close together , and two of them relying solely on the third , and the third so young and yet with an air of age and steadiness that sat so strangely on the childish figure .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 6]: `` Charley , Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 7]: `` How old are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 11]: `` Over thirteen , sir , '' replied the child .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 10]: What a great age , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 9]: `` What a great age , Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 23]: I can not describe the tenderness with which he spoke to her , half playfully yet all the more compassionately and mournfully .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 14]: `` And do you live alone here with these babies , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 25]: `` Yes , sir , '' returned the child , looking up into his face with perfect confidence , `` since father died . ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 9]: `` And how do you live , Charley ?
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 22]: Charley , '' said my guardian , turning his face away for a moment , `` how do you live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 14]: `` Since father died , sir , I 've gone out to work .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 7]: I 'm out washing to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 8]: `` God help you , Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 12]: `` You 're not tall enough to reach the tub ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 13]: `` In pattens I am , sir , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 13]: `` I 've got a high pair as belonged to mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 7]: `` And when did mother die ?
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 4]: Poor mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 22]: `` Mother died just after Emma was born , '' said the child , glancing at the face upon her bosom .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 18]: `` Then father said I was to be as good a mother to her as I could .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 5]: And so I tried .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 24]: And so I worked at home and did cleaning and nursing and washing for a long time before I began to go out .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 16]: And that 's how I know how ; do n't you see , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 9]: `` And do you often go out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 26]: `` As often as I can , '' said Charley , opening her eyes and smiling , `` because of earning sixpences and shillings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 15]: `` And do you always lock the babies up when you go out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 14]: ` To keep 'em safe , sir , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 48]: `` Mrs. Blinder comes up now and then , and Mr. Gridley comes up sometimes , and perhaps I can run in sometimes , and they can play you know , and Tom a n't afraid of being locked up , are you , Tom ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 4]: `` No-o ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 4]: said Tom stoutly .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 28]: `` When it comes on dark , the lamps are lighted down in the court , and they show up here quite bright -- almost quite bright .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 7]: Do n't they , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 15]: `` Yes , Charley , '' said Tom , `` almost quite bright . ''
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 25]: `` Then he 's as good as gold , '' said the little creature -- Oh , in such a motherly , womanly way !
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 13]: `` And when Emma 's tired , he puts her to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 11]: And when he 's tired he goes to bed himself .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 26]: And when I come home and light the candle and has a bit of supper , he sits up again and has it with me .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 7]: Do n't you , Tom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 6]: `` That I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 46]: And either in this glimpse of the great pleasure of his life or in gratitude and love for Charley , who was all in all to him , he laid his face among the scanty folds of her frock and passed from laughing into crying .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 18]: It was the first time since our entry that a tear had been shed among these children .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 44]: The little orphan girl had spoken of their father and their mother as if all that sorrow were subdued by the necessity of taking courage , and by her childish importance in being able to work , and by her bustling busy way .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 47]: But now , when Tom cried , although she sat quite tranquil , looking quietly at us , and did not by any movement disturb a hair of the head of either of her little charges , I saw two silent tears fall down her face .
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 73]: I stood at the window with Ada , pretending to look at the housetops , and the blackened stack of chimneys , and the poor plants , and the birds in little cages belonging to the neighbours , when I found that Mrs. Blinder , from the shop below , had come in -LRB- perhaps it had taken her all this time to get upstairs -RRB- and was talking to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 27]: `` It 's not much to forgive 'em the rent , sir , '' she said ; `` who could take it from them ! '' '
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 7]: said my guardian to us two .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 52]: `` It is enough that the time will come when this good woman will find that it WAS much , and that forasmuch as she did it unto the least of these -- This child , '' he added after a few moments , `` could she possibly continue this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 23]: `` Really , sir , I think she might , '' said Mrs. Blinder , getting her heavy breath by painful degrees .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 12]: `` She 's as handy as it 's possible to be .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 23]: Bless you , sir , the way she tended them two children after the mother died was the talk of the yard !
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 20]: And it was a wonder to see her with him after he was took ill , it really was !
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 56]: ` Mrs. Blinder , ' he said to me the very last he spoke -- he was lying there -- ` Mrs. Blinder , whatever my calling may have been , I see a angel sitting in this room last night along with my child , and I trust her to Our Father ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 8]: `` He had no other calling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 18]: `` No , sir , '' returned Mrs. Blinder , `` he was nothing but a follerers .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 29]: When he first came to lodge here , I did n't know what he was , and I confess that when I found out I gave him notice .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 8]: It was n't liked in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 9]: It was n't approved by the other lodgers .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 21]: It is NOT a genteel calling , '' said Mrs. Blinder , `` and most people do object to it .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 24]: Mr. Gridley objected to it very strong , and he is a good lodger , though his temper has been hard tried . ''
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 8]: `` So you gave him notice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 12]: `` So I gave him notice , '' said Mrs. Blinder .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 22]: `` But really when the time came , and I knew no other ill of him , I was in doubts .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 43]: He was punctual and diligent ; he did what he had to do , sir , '' said Mrs. Blinder , unconsciously fixing Mr. Skimpole with her eye , `` and it 's something in this world even to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 9]: `` So you kept him after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 37]: `` Why , I said that if he could arrange with Mr. Gridley , I could arrange it with the other lodgers and should not so much mind its being liked or disliked in the yard .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 11]: Mr. Gridley gave his consent gruff -- but gave it .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 17]: He was always gruff with him , but he has been kind to the children since .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 12]: A person is never known till a person is proved . ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 11]: `` Have many people been kind to the children ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 4]: asked Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 35]: `` Upon the whole , not so bad , sir , '' said Mrs. Blinder ; `` but certainly not so many as would have been if their father 's calling had been different .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 15]: Mr. Coavins gave a guinea , and the follerers made up a little purse .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 33]: Some neighbours in the yard that had always joked and tapped their shoulders when he went by came forward with a little subscription , and -- in general -- not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 4]: Similarly with Charlotte .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 57]: Some people wo n't employ her because she was a follerer 's child ; some people that do employ her cast it at her ; some make a merit of having her to work for them , with that and all her draw-backs upon her , and perhaps pay her less and put upon her more .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 29]: But she 's patienter than others would be , and is clever too , and always willing , up to the full mark of her strength and over .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 20]: So I should say , in general , not so bad , sir , but might be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 28]: Mrs. Blinder sat down to give herself a more favourable opportunity of recovering her breath , exhausted anew by so much talking before it was fully restored .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 38]: Mr. Jarndyce was turning to speak to us when his attention was attracted by the abrupt entrance into the room of the Mr. Gridley who had been mentioned and whom we had seen on our way up .
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 36]: `` I do n't know what you may be doing here , ladies and gentlemen , '' he said , as if he resented our presence , `` but you 'll excuse my coming in .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 10]: I do n't come in to stare about me .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 4]: Well , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 4]: Well , Tom !
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 5]: Well , little one !
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 9]: How is it with us all to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 40]: He bent over the group in a caressing way and clearly was regarded as a friend by the children , though his face retained its stern character and his manner to us was as rude as it could be .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 8]: My guardian noticed it and respected it .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 19]: `` No one , surely , would come here to stare about him , '' he said mildly .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 27]: `` May be so , sir , may be so , '' returned the other , taking Tom upon his knee and waving him off impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 12]: `` I do n't want to argue with ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 14]: I have had enough of arguing to last one man his life . ''
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 28]: `` You have sufficient reason , I dare say , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` for being chafed and irritated -- '' `` There again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 8]: exclaimed the man , becoming violently angry .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 8]: `` I am of a quarrelsome temper .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 4]: I am irascible .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 6]: I am not polite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 8]: `` Not very , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 35]: `` Sir , '' said Gridley , putting down the child and going up to him as if he meant to strike him , `` do you know anything of Courts of Equity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 10]: `` Perhaps I do , to my sorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 6]: `` To your sorrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 9]: said the man , pausing in his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 9]: `` if so , I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 8]: I am not polite , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 5]: I beg your pardon !
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 32]: Sir , '' with renewed violence , `` I have been dragged for five and twenty years over burning iron , and I have lost the habit of treading upon velvet .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 40]: Go into the Court of Chancery yonder and ask what is one of the standing jokes that brighten up their business sometimes , and they will tell you that the best joke they have is the man from Shropshire .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 22]: I , '' he said , beating one hand on the other passionately , `` am the man from Shropshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 28]: `` I believe I and my family have also had the honour of furnishing some entertainment in the same grave place , '' said my guardian composedly .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 11]: `` You may have heard my name -- Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 27]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , '' said Gridley with a rough sort of salutation , `` you bear your wrongs more quietly than I can bear mine .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 43]: More than that , I tell you -- and I tell this gentleman , and these young ladies , if they are friends of yours -- that if I took my wrongs in any other way , I should be driven mad !
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 35]: It is only by resenting them , and by revenging them in my mind , and by angrily demanding the justice I never get , that I am able to keep my wits together .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 6]: It is only that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 15]: he said , speaking in a homely , rustic way and with great vehemence .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 10]: `` You may tell me that I over-excite myself .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 21]: I answer that it 's in my nature to do it , under wrong , and I must do it .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 24]: There 's nothing between doing it , and sinking into the smiling state of the poor little mad woman that haunts the court .
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 16]: If I was once to sit down under it , I should become imbecile . ''
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 36]: The passion and heat in which he was , and the manner in which his face worked , and the violent gestures with which he accompanied what he said , were most painful to see .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 13]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , '' he said , `` consider my case .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 15]: As true as there is a heaven above us , this is my case .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 7]: I am one of two brothers .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 25]: My father -LRB- a farmer -RRB- made a will and left his farm and stock and so forth to my mother for her life .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 28]: After my mother 's death , all was to come to me except a legacy of three hundred pounds that I was then to pay my brother .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 4]: My mother died .
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 9]: My brother some time afterwards claimed his legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 25]: I and some of my relations said that he had had a part of it already in board and lodging and some other things .
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 3]: Now mind !
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 9]: That was the question , and nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 25]: No one disputed the will ; no one disputed anything but whether part of that three hundred pounds had been already paid or not .
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 38]: To settle that question , my brother filing a bill , I was obliged to go into this accursed Chancery ; I was forced there because the law forced me and would let me go nowhere else .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 10]: Seventeen people were made defendants to that simple suit !
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 8]: It first came on after two years .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 19]: It was then stopped for another two years while the master -LRB- may his head rot off ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 22]: inquired whether I was my father 's son , about which there was no dispute at all with any mortal creature .
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 20]: He then found out that there were not defendants enough -- remember , there were only seventeen as yet !
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 19]: -- but that we must have another who had been left out and must begin all over again .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 12]: The costs at that time -- before the thing was begun !
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 7]: -- were three times the legacy .
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 17]: My brother would have given up the legacy , and joyful , to escape more costs .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 20]: My whole estate , left to me in that will of my father 's , has gone in costs .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 29]: The suit , still undecided , has fallen into rack , and ruin , and despair , with everything else -- and here I stand , this day !
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 22]: Now , Mr. Jarndyce , in your suit there are thousands and thousands involved , where in mine there are hundreds .
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 29]: Is mine less hard to bear or is it harder to bear , when my whole living was in it and has been thus shamefully sucked away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 29]: Mr. Jarndyce said that he condoled with him with all his heart and that he set up no monopoly himself in being unjustly treated by this monstrous system .
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 5]: `` There again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 10]: said Mr. Gridley with no diminution of his rage .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 4]: `` The system !
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 12]: I am told on all hands , it 's the system .
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 7]: I must n't look to individuals .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 5]: It 's the system .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 27]: I must n't go into court and say , ` My Lord , I beg to know this from you -- is this right or wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 17]: Have you the face to tell me I have received justice and therefore am dismissed ? '
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 7]: My Lord knows nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 8]: He sits there to administer the system .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 52]: I must n't go to Mr. Tulkinghorn , the solicitor in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and say to him when he makes me furious by being so cool and satisfied -- as they all do , for I know they gain by it while I lose , do n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 28]: -- I must n't say to him , ' I will have something out of some one for my ruin , by fair means or foul ! '
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 5]: HE is not responsible .
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 5]: It 's the system .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 17]: But , if I do no violence to any of them , here -- I may !
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 16]: I do n't know what may happen if I am carried beyond myself at last !
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 23]: I will accuse the individual workers of that system against me , face to face , before the great eternal bar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 5]: His passion was fearful .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 12]: I could not have believed in such rage without seeing it .
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 6]: `` I have done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 10]: he said , sitting down and wiping his face .
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 8]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , I have done !
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 7]: I am violent , I know .
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 6]: I ought to know it .
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 10]: I have been in prison for contempt of court .
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 10]: I have been in prison for threatening the solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 16]: I have been in this trouble , and that trouble , and shall be again .
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 39]: I am the man from Shropshire , and I sometimes go beyond amusing them , though they have found it amusing , too , to see me committed into custody and brought up in custody and all that .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 16]: It would be better for me , they tell me , if I restrained myself .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 14]: I tell them that if I did restrain myself I should become imbecile .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 10]: I was a good-enough-tempered man once , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 33]: People in my part of the country say they remember me so , but now I must have this vent under my sense of injury or nothing could hold my wits together .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 40]: It would be far better for you , Mr. Gridley , ' the Lord Chancellor told me last week , ` not to waste your time here , and to stay , usefully employed , down in Shropshire . '
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 59]: ` My Lord , my Lord , I know it would , ' said I to him , ` and it would have been far better for me never to have heard the name of your high office , but unhappily for me , I ca n't undo the past , and the past drives me here ! '
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 16]: Besides , '' he added , breaking fiercely out , `` I 'll shame them .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 15]: To the last , I 'll show myself in that court to its shame .
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 48]: If I knew when I was going to die , and could be carried there , and had a voice to speak with , I would die there , saying , ` You have brought me here and sent me from here many and many a time .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 9]: Now send me out feet foremost ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 28]: His countenance had , perhaps for years , become so set in its contentious expression that it did not soften , even now when he was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 31]: `` I came to take these babies down to my room for an hour , '' he said , going to them again , `` and let them play about .
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 16]: I did n't mean to say all this , but it do n't much signify .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 13]: You 're not afraid of me , Tom , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 3]: said Tom .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 9]: `` You ai n't angry with ME . ''
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 8]: `` You are right , my child .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 7]: You 're going back , Charley ?
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 2]: Aye ?
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 7]: Come then , little one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 18]: He took the youngest child on his arm , where she was willing enough to be carried .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 13]: `` I should n't wonder if we found a ginger-bread soldier downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 9]: Let 's go and look for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 32]: He made his former rough salutation , which was not deficient in a certain respect , to Mr. Jarndyce , and bowing slightly to us , went downstairs to his room .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 23]: Upon that , Mr. Skimpole began to talk , for the first time since our arrival , in his usual gay strain .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 20]: He said , Well , it was really very pleasant to see how things lazily adapted themselves to purposes .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 79]: Here was this Mr. Gridley , a man of a robust will and surprising energy -- intellectually speaking , a sort of inharmonious blacksmith -- and he could easily imagine that there Gridley was , years ago , wandering about in life for something to expend his superfluous combativeness upon -- a sort of Young Love among the thorns -- when the Court of Chancery came in his way and accommodated him with the exact thing he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 9]: There they were , matched , ever afterwards !
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 75]: Otherwise he might have been a great general , blowing up all sorts of towns , or he might have been a great politician , dealing in all sorts of parliamentary rhetoric ; but as it was , he and the Court of Chancery had fallen upon each other in the pleasantest way , and nobody was much the worse , and Gridley was , so to speak , from that hour provided for .
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 5]: Then look at Coavinses !
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 16]: How delightfully poor Coavinses -LRB- father of these charming children -RRB- illustrated the same principle !
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 16]: He , Mr. Skimpole , himself , had sometimes repined at the existence of Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 8]: He had found Coavinses in his way .
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 7]: He could had dispensed with Coavinses .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 39]: There had been times when , if he had been a sultan , and his grand vizier had said one morning , `` What does the Commander of the Faithful require at the hands of his slave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 18]: he might have even gone so far as to reply , `` The head of Coavinses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 9]: But what turned out to be the case ?
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 49]: That , all that time , he had been giving employment to a most deserving man , that he had been a benefactor to Coavinses , that he had actually been enabling Coavinses to bring up these charming children in this agreeable way , developing these social virtues !
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 44]: Insomuch that his heart had just now swelled and the tears had come into his eyes when he had looked round the room and thought , `` I was the great patron of Coavinses , and his little comforts were MY work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 54]: There was something so captivating in his light way of touching these fantastic strings , and he was such a mirthful child by the side of the graver childhood we had seen , that he made my guardian smile even as he turned towards us from a little private talk with Mrs. Blinder .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 25]: We kissed Charley , and took her downstairs with us , and stopped outside the house to see her run away to her work .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 54]: I do n't know where she was going , but we saw her run , such a little , little creature in her womanly bonnet and apron , through a covered way at the bottom of the court and melt into the city 's strife and sound like a dewdrop in an ocean .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 16]: Chapter XVI -- Tom-all -- Alone 's My Lady Dedlock is restless , very restless .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 11]: The astonished fashionable intelligence hardly knows where to have her .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 32]: To-day she is at Chesney Wold ; yesterday she was at her house in town ; to-morrow she may be abroad , for anything the fashionable intelligence can with confidence predict .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 14]: Even Sir Leicester 's gallantry has some trouble to keep pace with her .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 36]: It would have more but that his other faithful ally , for better and for worse -- the gout -- darts into the old oak bedchamber at Chesney Wold and grips him by both legs .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 19]: Sir Leicester receives the gout as a troublesome demon , but still a demon of the patrician order .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 34]: All the Dedlocks , in the direct male line , through a course of time during and beyond which the memory of man goeth not to the contrary , have had the gout .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 7]: It can be proved , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 48]: Other men 's fathers may have died of the rheumatism or may have taken base contagion from the tainted blood of the sick vulgar , but the Dedlock family have communicated something exclusive even to the levelling process of dying by dying of their own family gout .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 22]: It has come down through the illustrious line like the plate , or the pictures , or the place in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 6]: It is among their dignities .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 66]: Sir Leicester is perhaps not wholly without an impression , though he has never resolved it into words , that the angel of death in the discharge of his necessary duties may observe to the shades of the aristocracy , `` My lords and gentlemen , I have the honour to present to you another Dedlock certified to have arrived per the family gout . ''
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 25]: Hence Sir Leicester yields up his family legs to the family disorder as if he held his name and fortune on that feudal tenure .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 77]: He feels that for a Dedlock to be laid upon his back and spasmodically twitched and stabbed in his extremities is a liberty taken somewhere , but he thinks , `` We have all yielded to this ; it belongs to us ; it has for some hundreds of years been understood that we are not to make the vaults in the park interesting on more ignoble terms ; and I submit myself to the compromise .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 58]: And a goodly show he makes , lying in a flush of crimson and gold in the midst of the great drawing-room before his favourite picture of my Lady , with broad strips of sunlight shining in , down the long perspective , through the long line of windows , and alternating with soft reliefs of shadow .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 47]: Outside , the stately oaks , rooted for ages in the green ground which has never known ploughshare , but was still a chase when kings rode to battle with sword and shield and rode a-hunting with bow and arrow , bear witness to his greatness .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 59]: Inside , his forefathers , looking on him from the walls , say , `` Each of us was a passing reality here and left this coloured shadow of himself and melted into remembrance as dreamy as the distant voices of the rooks now lulling you to rest , '' and hear their testimony to his greatness too .
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 8]: And he is very great this day .
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 17]: And woe to Boythorn or other daring wight who shall presumptuously contest an inch with him !
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 15]: My Lady is at present represented , near Sir Leicester , by her portrait .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 29]: She has flitted away to town , with no intention of remaining there , and will soon flit hither again , to the confusion of the fashionable intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 11]: The house in town is not prepared for her reception .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 6]: It is muffled and dreary .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 87]: Only one Mercury in powder gapes disconsolate at the hall-window ; and he mentioned last night to another Mercury of his acquaintance , also accustomed to good society , that if that sort of thing was to last -- which it could n't , for a man of his spirits could n't bear it , and a man of his figure could n't be expected to bear it -- there would be no resource for him , upon his honour , but to cut his throat !
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 47]: What connexion can there be between the place in Lincolnshire , the house in town , the Mercury in powder , and the whereabout of Jo the outlaw with the broom , who had that distant ray of light upon him when he swept the churchyard-step ?
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 33]: What connexion can there have been between many people in the innumerable histories of this world who from opposite sides of great gulfs have , nevertheless , been very curiously brought together !
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 19]: Jo sweeps his crossing all day long , unconscious of the link , if any link there be .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 21]: He sums up his mental condition when asked a question by replying that he `` do n't know nothink . ''
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 26]: He knows that it 's hard to keep the mud off the crossing in dirty weather , and harder still to live by doing it .
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 12]: Nobody taught him even that much ; he found it out .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 33]: Jo lives -- that is to say , Jo has not yet died -- in a ruinous place known to the like of him by the name of Tom-all -- Alone 's .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 47]: It is a black , dilapidated street , avoided by all decent people , where the crazy houses were seized upon , when their decay was far advanced , by some bold vagrants who after establishing their own possession took to letting them out in lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 15]: Now , these tumbling tenements contain , by night , a swarm of misery .
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 108]: As on the ruined human wretch vermin parasites appear , so these ruined shelters have bred a crowd of foul existence that crawls in and out of gaps in walls and boards ; and coils itself to sleep , in maggot numbers , where the rain drips in ; and comes and goes , fetching and carrying fever and sowing more evil in its every footprint than Lord Coodle , and Sir Thomas Doodle , and the Duke of Foodle , and all the fine gentlemen in office , down to Zoodle , shall set right in five hundred years -- though born expressly to do it .
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 34]: Twice lately there has been a crash and a cloud of dust , like the springing of a mine , in Tom-all -- Alone 's ; and each time a house has fallen .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 21]: These accidents have made a paragraph in the newspapers and have filled a bed or two in the nearest hospital .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 14]: The gaps remain , and there are not unpopular lodgings among the rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 27]: As several more houses are nearly ready to go , the next crash in Tom-all -- Alone 's may be expected to be a good one .
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 10]: This desirable property is in Chancery , of course .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 20]: It would be an insult to the discernment of any man with half an eye to tell him so .
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 74]: Whether `` Tom '' is the popular representative of the original plaintiff or defendant in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , or whether Tom lived here when the suit had laid the street waste , all alone , until other settlers came to join him , or whether the traditional title is a comprehensive name for a retreat cut off from honest company and put out of the pale of hope , perhaps nobody knows .
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 6]: Certainly Jo do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 18]: `` For I do n't , '' says Jo , `` I do n't know nothink . ''
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 11]: It must be a strange state to be like Jo !
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 48]: To shuffle through the streets , unfamiliar with the shapes , and in utter darkness as to the meaning , of those mysterious symbols , so abundant over the shops , and at the corners of streets , and on the doors , and in the windows !
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 45]: To see people read , and to see people write , and to see the postmen deliver letters , and not to have the least idea of all that language -- to be , to every scrap of it , stone blind and dumb !
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 61]: It must be very puzzling to see the good company going to the churches on Sundays , with their books in their hands , and to think -LRB- for perhaps Jo DOES think at odd times -RRB- what does it all mean , and if it means anything to anybody , how comes it that it means nothing to me ?
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 65]: To be hustled , and jostled , and moved on ; and really to feel that it would appear to be perfectly true that I have no business here , or there , or anywhere ; and yet to be perplexed by the consideration that I AM here somehow , too , and everybody overlooked me until I became the creature that I am !
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 43]: It must be a strange state , not merely to be told that I am scarcely human -LRB- as in the case of my offering myself for a witness -RRB- , but to feel it of my own knowledge all my life !
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 37]: To see the horses , dogs , and cattle go by me and to know that in ignorance I belong to them and not to the superior beings in my shape , whose delicacy I offend !
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 40]: Jo 's ideas of a criminal trial , or a judge , or a bishop , or a govemment , or that inestimable jewel to him -LRB- if he only knew it -RRB- the Constitution , should be strange !
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 19]: His whole material and immaterial life is wonderfully strange ; his death , the strangest thing of all .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 34]: Jo comes out of Tom-all -- Alone 's , meeting the tardy morning which is always late in getting down there , and munches his dirty bit of bread as he comes along .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 51]: His way lying through many streets , and the houses not yet being open , he sits down to breakfast on the door-step of the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts and gives it a brush when he has finished as an acknowledgment of the accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 15]: He admires the size of the edifice and wonders what it 's all about .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 35]: He has no idea , poor wretch , of the spiritual destitution of a coral reef in the Pacific or what it costs to look up the precious souls among the coco-nuts and bread-fruit .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 15]: He goes to his crossing and begins to lay it out for the day .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 35]: The town awakes ; the great tee-totum is set up for its daily spin and whirl ; all that unaccountable reading and writing , which has been suspended for a few hours , recommences .
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 16]: Jo and the other lower animals get on in the unintelligible mess as they can .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 4]: It is market-day .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 42]: The blinded oxen , over-goaded , over-driven , never guided , run into wrong places and are beaten out , and plunge red-eyed and foaming at stone walls , and often sorely hurt the innocent , and often sorely hurt themselves .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 12]: Very like Jo and his order ; very , very like !
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 8]: A band of music comes and plays .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 5]: Jo listens to it .
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 41]: So does a dog -- a drover 's dog , waiting for his master outside a butcher 's shop , and evidently thinking about those sheep he has had upon his mind for some hours and is happily rid of .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 41]: He seems perplexed respecting three or four , ca n't remember where he left them , looks up and down the street as half expecting to see them astray , suddenly pricks up his ears and remembers all about it .
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 56]: A thoroughly vagabond dog , accustomed to low company and public-houses ; a terrific dog to sheep , ready at a whistle to scamper over their backs and tear out mouthfuls of their wool ; but an educated , improved , developed dog who has been taught his duties and knows how to discharge them .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 46]: He and Jo listen to the music , probably with much the same amount of animal satisfaction ; likewise as to awakened association , aspiration , or regret , melancholy or joyful reference to things beyond the senses , they are probably upon a par .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 14]: But , otherwise , how far above the human listener is the brute !
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 33]: Turn that dog 's descendants wild , like Jo , and in a very few years they will so degenerate that they will lose even their bark -- but not their bite .
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 14]: The day changes as it wears itself away and becomes dark and drizzly .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 39]: Jo fights it out at his crossing among the mud and wheels , the horses , whips , and umbrellas , and gets but a scanty sum to pay for the unsavoury shelter of Tom-all -- Alone 's .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 28]: Twilight comes on ; gas begins to start up in the shops ; the lamplighter , with his ladder , runs along the margin of the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 9]: A wretched evening is beginning to close in .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 19]: In his chambers Mr. Tulkinghorn sits meditating an application to the nearest magistrate to-morrow morning for a warrant .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 15]: Gridley , a disappointed suitor , has been here to-day and has been alarming .
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 21]: We are not to be put in bodily fear , and that ill-conditioned fellow shall be held to bail again .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 38]: From the ceiling , foreshortened Allegory , in the person of one impossible Roman upside down , points with the arm of Samson -LRB- out of joint , and an odd one -RRB- obtrusively toward the window .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 15]: Why should Mr. Tulkinghorn , for such no reason , look out of window ?
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 8]: Is the hand not always pointing there ?
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 9]: So he does not look out of window .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 16]: And if he did , what would it be to see a woman going by ?
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 42]: There are women enough in the world , Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks -- too many ; they are at the bottom of all that goes wrong in it , though , for the matter of that , they create business for lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 18]: What would it be to see a woman going by , even though she were going secretly ?
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 5]: They are all secret .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 7]: Mr. Tulkinghorn knows that very well .
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 31]: But they are not all like the woman who now leaves him and his house behind , between whose plain dress and her refined manner there is something exceedingly inconsistent .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 48]: She should be an upper servant by her attire , yet in her air and step , though both are hurried and assumed -- as far as she can assume in the muddy streets , which she treads with an unaccustomed foot -- she is a lady .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 25]: Her face is veiled , and still she sufficiently betrays herself to make more than one of those who pass her look round sharply .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 6]: She never turns her head .
Parsing [sent. 5053 len. 15]: Lady or servant , she has a purpose in her and can follow it .
Parsing [sent. 5054 len. 18]: She never turns her head until she comes to the crossing where Jo plies with his broom .
Parsing [sent. 5055 len. 7]: He crosses with her and begs .
Parsing [sent. 5056 len. 17]: Still , she does not turn her head until she has landed on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 5057 len. 14]: Then she slightly beckons to him and says , `` Come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5058 len. 12]: Jo follows her a pace or two into a quiet court .
Parsing [sent. 5059 len. 14]: `` Are you the boy I 've read of in the papers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5060 len. 6]: she asked behind her veil .
Parsing [sent. 5061 len. 22]: `` I do n't know , '' says Jo , staring moodily at the veil , `` nothink about no papers .
Parsing [sent. 5062 len. 11]: I do n't know nothink about nothink at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5063 len. 9]: `` Were you examined at an inquest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5064 len. 22]: `` I do n't know nothink about no -- where I was took by the beadle , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5065 len. 3]: says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 5066 len. 12]: `` Was the boy 's name at the inkwhich Jo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5067 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5068 len. 6]: `` That 's me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5069 len. 3]: says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 5070 len. 6]: `` Come farther up . ''
Parsing [sent. 5071 len. 8]: `` You mean about the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5072 len. 5]: says Jo , following .
Parsing [sent. 5073 len. 7]: `` Him as wos dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5074 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 5075 len. 5]: Speak in a whisper !
Parsing [sent. 5076 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 5077 len. 16]: Did he look , when he was living , so very ill and poor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5078 len. 6]: `` Oh , jist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5079 len. 3]: says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 5080 len. 11]: `` Did he look like -- not like YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5081 len. 6]: says the woman with abhorrence .
Parsing [sent. 5082 len. 13]: `` Oh , not so bad as me , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 5083 len. 11]: `` I 'm a reg ` lar one I am !
Parsing [sent. 5084 len. 10]: You did n't know him , did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5085 len. 12]: `` How dare you ask me if I knew him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5086 len. 28]: `` No offence , my lady , '' says Jo with much humility , for even he has got at the suspicion of her being a lady .
Parsing [sent. 5087 len. 7]: `` I am not a lady .
Parsing [sent. 5088 len. 6]: I am a servant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5089 len. 8]: `` You are a jolly servant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5090 len. 18]: says Jo without the least idea of saying anything offensive , merely as a tribute of admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5091 len. 6]: `` Listen and be silent .
Parsing [sent. 5092 len. 12]: Do n't talk to me , and stand farther from me !
Parsing [sent. 5093 len. 17]: Can you show me all those places that were spoken of in the account I read ?
Parsing [sent. 5094 len. 28]: The place he wrote for , the place he died at , the place where you were taken to , and the place where he was buried ?
Parsing [sent. 5095 len. 11]: Do you know the place where he was buried ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5096 len. 16]: Jo answers with a nod , having also nodded as each other place was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 5097 len. 12]: `` Go before me and show me all those dreadful places .
Parsing [sent. 5098 len. 17]: Stop opposite to each , and do n't speak to me unless I speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 5099 len. 5]: Do n't look back .
Parsing [sent. 5100 len. 13]: Do what I want , and I will pay you well . ''
Parsing [sent. 5101 len. 38]: Jo attends closely while the words are being spoken ; tells them off on his broom-handle , finding them rather hard ; pauses to consider their meaning ; considers it satisfactory ; and nods his ragged head .
Parsing [sent. 5102 len. 9]: `` I 'm fly , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 5103 len. 8]: `` But fen larks , you know .
Parsing [sent. 5104 len. 5]: Stow hooking it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5105 len. 9]: `` What does the horrible creature mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5106 len. 8]: exclaims the servant , recoiling from him .
Parsing [sent. 5107 len. 9]: `` Stow cutting away , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5108 len. 3]: says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 5109 len. 7]: `` I do n't understand you .
Parsing [sent. 5110 len. 4]: Go on before !
Parsing [sent. 5111 len. 15]: I will give you more money than you ever had in your life . ''
Parsing [sent. 5112 len. 45]: Jo screws up his mouth into a whistle , gives his ragged head a rub , takes his broom under his arm , and leads the way , passing deftly with his bare feet over the hard stones and through the mud and mire .
Parsing [sent. 5113 len. 4]: Cook 's Court .
Parsing [sent. 5114 len. 3]: Jo stops .
Parsing [sent. 5115 len. 3]: A pause .
Parsing [sent. 5116 len. 6]: `` Who lives here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5117 len. 26]: `` Him wot give him his writing and give me half a bull , '' says Jo in a whisper without looking over his shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5118 len. 8]: `` Go on to the next . ''
Parsing [sent. 5119 len. 4]: Krook 's house .
Parsing [sent. 5120 len. 4]: Jo stops again .
Parsing [sent. 5121 len. 4]: A longer pause .
Parsing [sent. 5122 len. 6]: `` Who lives here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5123 len. 11]: `` HE lived here , '' Jo answers as before .
Parsing [sent. 5124 len. 13]: After a silence he is asked , `` In which room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5125 len. 8]: `` In the back room up there .
Parsing [sent. 5126 len. 9]: You can see the winder from this corner .
Parsing [sent. 5127 len. 3]: Up there !
Parsing [sent. 5128 len. 9]: That 's where I see him stritched out .
Parsing [sent. 5129 len. 11]: This is the public-ouse where I was took to . ''
Parsing [sent. 5130 len. 8]: `` Go on to the next ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5131 len. 31]: It is a longer walk to the next , but Jo , relieved of his first suspicions , sticks to the forms imposed upon him and does not look round .
Parsing [sent. 5132 len. 37]: By many devious ways , reeking with offence of many kinds , they come to the little tunnel of a court , and to the gas-lamp -LRB- lighted now -RRB- , and to the iron gate .
Parsing [sent. 5133 len. 18]: `` He was put there , '' says Jo , holding to the bars and looking in .
Parsing [sent. 5134 len. 3]: `` Where ?
Parsing [sent. 5135 len. 9]: Oh , what a scene of horror ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5136 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5137 len. 5]: says Jo , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 5138 len. 4]: `` Over yinder .
Parsing [sent. 5139 len. 14]: Arnong them piles of bones , and close to that there kitchin winder !
Parsing [sent. 5140 len. 8]: They put him wery nigh the top .
Parsing [sent. 5141 len. 12]: They was obliged to stamp upon it to git it in .
Parsing [sent. 5142 len. 15]: I could unkiver it for you with my broom if the gate was open .
Parsing [sent. 5143 len. 18]: That 's why they locks it , I s ` pose , '' giving it a shake .
Parsing [sent. 5144 len. 6]: `` It 's always locked .
Parsing [sent. 5145 len. 6]: Look at the rat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5146 len. 5]: cries Jo , excited .
Parsing [sent. 5147 len. 3]: `` Hi !
Parsing [sent. 5148 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 5149 len. 4]: There he goes !
Parsing [sent. 5150 len. 2]: Ho !
Parsing [sent. 5151 len. 5]: Into the ground ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5152 len. 52]: The servant shrinks into a corner , into a corner of that hideous archway , with its deadly stains contaminating her dress ; and putting out her two hands and passionately telling him to keep away from her , for he is loathsome to her , so remains for some moments .
Parsing [sent. 5153 len. 12]: Jo stands staring and is still staring when she recovers herself .
Parsing [sent. 5154 len. 10]: `` Is this place of abomination consecrated ground ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5155 len. 17]: `` I do n't know nothink of consequential ground , '' says Jo , still staring .
Parsing [sent. 5156 len. 6]: `` Is it blessed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5157 len. 4]: `` Which ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5158 len. 9]: says Jo , in the last degree amazed .
Parsing [sent. 5159 len. 6]: `` Is it blessed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5160 len. 27]: `` I 'm blest if I know , '' says Jo , staring more than ever ; `` but I should n't think it war n't .
Parsing [sent. 5161 len. 3]: Blest ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5162 len. 9]: repeats Jo , something troubled in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 5163 len. 12]: `` It a n't done it much good if it is .
Parsing [sent. 5164 len. 2]: Blest ?
Parsing [sent. 5165 len. 10]: I should think it was t ` othered myself .
Parsing [sent. 5166 len. 8]: But I do n't know nothink ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5167 len. 22]: The servant takes as little heed of what he says as she seems to take of what she has said herself .
Parsing [sent. 5168 len. 13]: She draws off her glove to get some money from her purse .
Parsing [sent. 5169 len. 24]: Jo silently notices how white and small her hand is and what a jolly servant she must be to wear such sparkling rings .
Parsing [sent. 5170 len. 20]: She drops a piece of money in his hand without touching it , and shuddering as their hands approach .
Parsing [sent. 5171 len. 15]: `` Now , '' she adds , `` show me the spot again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5172 len. 26]: Jo thrusts the handle of his broom between the bars of the gate , and with his utmost power of elaboration , points it out .
Parsing [sent. 5173 len. 21]: At length , looking aside to see if he has made himself intelligible , he finds that he is alone .
Parsing [sent. 5174 len. 26]: His first proceeding is to hold the piece of money to the gas-light and to be overpowered at finding that it is yellow -- gold .
Parsing [sent. 5175 len. 19]: His next is to give it a one-sided bite at the edge as a test of its quality .
Parsing [sent. 5176 len. 22]: His next , to put it in his mouth for safety and to sweep the step and passage with great care .
Parsing [sent. 5177 len. 40]: His job done , he sets off for Tom-all -- Alone 's , stopping in the light of innumerable gas-lamps to produce the piece of gold and give it another one-sided bite as a reassurance of its being genuine .
Parsing [sent. 5178 len. 26]: The Mercury in powder is in no want of society to-night , for my Lady goes to a grand dinner and three or four balls .
Parsing [sent. 5179 len. 50]: Sir Leicester is fidgety down at Chesney Wold , with no better company than the goat ; he complains to Mrs. Rouncewell that the rain makes such a monotonous pattering on the terrace that he ca n't read the paper even by the fireside in his own snug dressing-room .
Parsing [sent. 5180 len. 26]: `` Sir Leicester would have done better to try the other side of the house , my dear , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell to Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 5181 len. 10]: `` His dressing-room is on my Lady 's side .
Parsing [sent. 5182 len. 23]: And in all these years I never heard the step upon the Ghost 's Walk more distinct than it is to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5183 len. 51]: Chapter XVII -- Esther 's Narrative Richard very often came to see us while we remained in London -LRB- though he soon failed in his letter-writing -RRB- , and with his quick abilities , his good spirits , his good temper , his gaiety and freshness , was always delightful .
Parsing [sent. 5184 len. 40]: But though I liked him more and more the better I knew him , I still felt more and more how much it was to be regretted that he had been educated in no habits of application and concentration .
Parsing [sent. 5185 len. 74]: The system which had addressed him in exactly the same manner as it had addressed hundreds of other boys , all varying in character and capacity , had enabled him to dash through his tasks , always with fair credit and often with distinction , but in a fitful , dazzling way that had confirmed his reliance on those very qualities in himself which it had been most desirable to direct and train .
Parsing [sent. 5186 len. 31]: They were good qualities , without which no high place can be meritoriously won , but like fire and water , though excellent servants , they were very bad masters .
Parsing [sent. 5187 len. 28]: If they had been under Richard 's direction , they would have been his friends ; but Richard being under their direction , they became his enemies .
Parsing [sent. 5188 len. 43]: I write down these opinions not because I believe that this or any other thing was so because I thought so , but only because I did think so and I want to be quite candid about all I thought and did .
Parsing [sent. 5189 len. 7]: These were my thoughts about Richard .
Parsing [sent. 5190 len. 52]: I thought I often observed besides how right my guardian was in what he had said , and that the uncertainties and delays of the Chancery suit had imparted to his nature something of the careless spirit of a gamester who felt that he was part of a great gaming system .
Parsing [sent. 5191 len. 27]: Mr. and Mrs. Bayham Badger coming one afternoon when my guardian was not at home , in the course of conversation I naturally inquired after Richard .
Parsing [sent. 5192 len. 29]: `` Why , Mr. Carstone , '' said Mrs. Badger , `` is very well and is , I assure you , a great acquisition to our society .
Parsing [sent. 5193 len. 39]: Captain Swosser used to say of me that I was always better than land a-head and a breeze a-starn to the midshipmen 's mess when the purser 's junk had become as tough as the fore-topsel weather earings .
Parsing [sent. 5194 len. 17]: It was his naval way of mentioning generally that I was an acquisition to any society .
Parsing [sent. 5195 len. 15]: I may render the same tribute , I am sure , to Mr. Carstone .
Parsing [sent. 5196 len. 15]: But I -- you wo n't think me premature if I mention it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5197 len. 17]: I said no , as Mrs. Badger 's insinuating tone seemed to require such an answer .
Parsing [sent. 5198 len. 6]: `` Nor Miss Clare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5199 len. 6]: said Mrs. Bayham Badger sweetly .
Parsing [sent. 5200 len. 10]: Ada said no , too , and looked uneasy .
Parsing [sent. 5201 len. 26]: `` Why , you see , my dears , '' said Mrs. Badger , '' -- you 'll excuse me calling you my dears ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5202 len. 9]: We entreated Mrs. Badger not to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 5203 len. 26]: `` Because you really are , if I may take the liberty of saying so , '' pursued Mrs. Badger , `` so perfectly charming .
Parsing [sent. 5204 len. 43]: You see , my dears , that although I am still young -- or Mr. Bayham Badger pays me the compliment of saying so -- '' `` No , '' Mr. Badger called out like some one contradicting at a public meeting .
Parsing [sent. 5205 len. 6]: `` Not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5206 len. 17]: `` Very well , '' smiled Mrs. Badger , `` we will say still young . ''
Parsing [sent. 5207 len. 8]: `` Undoubtedly , '' said Mr. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 5208 len. 18]: `` My dears , though still young , I have had many opportunities of observing young men .
Parsing [sent. 5209 len. 15]: There were many such on board the dear old Crippler , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 5210 len. 29]: After that , when I was with Captain Swosser in the Mediterranean , I embraced every opportunity of knowing and befriending the midshipmen under Captain Swosser 's command .
Parsing [sent. 5211 len. 51]: YOU never heard them called the young gentlemen , my dears , and probably wonld not understand allusions to their pipe-claying their weekly accounts , but it is otherwise with me , for blue water has been a second home to me , and I have been quite a sailor .
Parsing [sent. 5212 len. 7]: Again , with Professor Dingo . ''
Parsing [sent. 5213 len. 12]: `` A man of European reputation , '' murmured Mr. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 5214 len. 44]: `` When I lost my dear first and became the wife of my dear second , '' said Mrs. Badger , speaking of her former husbands as if they were parts of a charade , `` I still enjoyed opportunities of observing youth .
Parsing [sent. 5215 len. 53]: The class attendant on Professor Dingo 's lectures was a large one , and it became my pride , as the wife of an eminent scientific man seeking herself in science the utmost consolation it could impart , to throw our house open to the students as a kind of Scientific Exchange .
Parsing [sent. 5216 len. 20]: Every Tuesday evening there was lemonade and a mixed biscuit for all who chose to partake of those refreshments .
Parsing [sent. 5217 len. 10]: And there was science to an unlimited extent . ''
Parsing [sent. 5218 len. 14]: `` Remarkable assemblies those , Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Badger reverentially .
Parsing [sent. 5219 len. 20]: `` There must have been great intellectual friction going on there under the auspices of such a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5220 len. 54]: `` And now , '' pursued Mrs. Badger , `` now that I am the wife of my dear third , Mr. Badger , I still pursue those habits of observation which were formed during the lifetime of Captain Swosser and adapted to new and unexpected purposes during the lifetime of Professor Dingo .
Parsing [sent. 5221 len. 15]: I therefore have not come to the consideration of Mr. Carstone as a neophyte .
Parsing [sent. 5222 len. 23]: And yet I am very much of the opinion , my dears , that he has not chosen his profession advisedly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5223 len. 18]: Ada looked so very anxious now that I asked Mrs. Badger on what she founded her supposition .
Parsing [sent. 5224 len. 19]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , '' she replied , `` on Mr. Carstone 's character and conduct .
Parsing [sent. 5225 len. 31]: He is of such a very easy disposition that probably he would never think it worthwhile to mention how he really feels , but he feels languid about the profession .
Parsing [sent. 5226 len. 14]: He has not that positive interest in it which makes it his vocation .
Parsing [sent. 5227 len. 23]: If he has any decided impression in reference to it , I should say it was that it is a tiresome pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5228 len. 7]: Now , this is not promising .
Parsing [sent. 5229 len. 45]: Young men like Mr. Allan Woodcourt who take it from a strong interest in all that it can do will find some reward in it through a great deal of work for a very little money and through years of considerable endurance and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 5230 len. 17]: But I am quite convinced that this would never be the case with Mr. Carstone . ''
Parsing [sent. 5231 len. 9]: `` Does Mr. Badger think so too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5232 len. 4]: asked Ada timidly .
Parsing [sent. 5233 len. 33]: `` Why , '' said Mr. Badger , `` to tell the truth , Miss Clare , this view of the matter had not occurred to me until Mrs. Badger mentioned it .
Parsing [sent. 5234 len. 65]: But when Mrs. Badger put it in that light , I naturally gave great consideration to it , knowing that Mrs. Badger 's mind , in addition to its natural advantages , has had the rare advantage of being formed by two such very distinguished -LRB- I will even say illustrious -RRB- public men as Captain Swosser of the Royal Navy and Professor Dingo .
Parsing [sent. 5235 len. 19]: The conclusion at which I have arrived is -- in short , is Mrs. Badger 's conclusion . ''
Parsing [sent. 5236 len. 61]: `` It was a maxim of Captain Swosser 's , '' said Mrs. Badger , `` speaking in his figurative naval manner , that when you make pitch hot , you can not make it too hot ; and that if you only have to swab a plank , you should swab it as if Davy Jones were after you .
Parsing [sent. 5237 len. 20]: It appears to me that this maxim is applicable to the medical as well as to the nautical profession .
Parsing [sent. 5238 len. 10]: `` To all professions , '' observed Mr. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 5239 len. 9]: `` It was admirably said by Captain Swosser .
Parsing [sent. 5240 len. 4]: Beautifully said . ''
Parsing [sent. 5241 len. 48]: `` People objected to Professor Dingo when we were staying in the north of Devon after our marriage , '' said Mrs. Badger , `` that he disfigured some of the houses and other buildings by chipping off fragments of those edifices with his little geological hammer .
Parsing [sent. 5242 len. 16]: But the professor replied that he knew of no building save the Temple of Science .
Parsing [sent. 5243 len. 10]: The principle is the same , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5244 len. 10]: `` Precisely the same , '' said Mr. Badger .
Parsing [sent. 5245 len. 4]: `` Finely expressed !
Parsing [sent. 5246 len. 40]: The professor made the same remark , Miss Summerson , in his last illness , when -LRB- his mind wandering -RRB- he insisted on keeping his little hammer under the pillow and chipping at the countenances of the attendants .
Parsing [sent. 5247 len. 5]: The ruling passion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5248 len. 48]: Although we could have dispensed with the length at which Mr. and Mrs. Badger pursued the conversation , we both felt that it was disinterested in them to express the opinion they had communicated to us and that there was a great probability of its being sound .
Parsing [sent. 5249 len. 34]: We agreed to say nothing to Mr. Jarndyce until we had spoken to Richard ; and as he was coming next evening , we resolved to have a very serious talk with him .
Parsing [sent. 5250 len. 37]: So after he had been a little while with Ada , I went in and found my darling -LRB- as I knew she would be -RRB- prepared to consider him thoroughly right in whatever he said .
Parsing [sent. 5251 len. 11]: `` And how do you get on , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5252 len. 13]: said I. I always sat down on the other side of him .
Parsing [sent. 5253 len. 8]: He made quite a sister of me .
Parsing [sent. 5254 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5255 len. 4]: Well enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5256 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 5257 len. 15]: `` He ca n't say better than that , Esther , can he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5258 len. 5]: cried my pet triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 5259 len. 19]: I tried to look at my pet in the wisest manner , but of course I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 5260 len. 5]: `` Well enough ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5261 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 5262 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' said Richard , `` well enough .
Parsing [sent. 5263 len. 7]: It 's rather jog-trotty and humdrum .
Parsing [sent. 5264 len. 11]: But it 'll do as well as anything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5265 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5266 len. 5]: My dear Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5267 len. 3]: I remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 5268 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5269 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 5270 len. 9]: `` Do as well as anything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5271 len. 49]: `` I do n't think there 's any harm in that , Dame Durden , '' said Ada , looking so confidingly at me across him ; `` because if it will do as well as anything else , it will do very well , I hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 5272 len. 21]: `` Oh , yes , I hope so , '' returned Richard , carelessly tossing his hair from his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 5273 len. 21]: `` After all , it may be only a kind of probation till our suit is -- I forgot though .
Parsing [sent. 5274 len. 8]: I am not to mention the suit .
Parsing [sent. 5275 len. 3]: Forbidden ground !
Parsing [sent. 5276 len. 10]: Oh , yes , it 's all right enough .
Parsing [sent. 5277 len. 8]: Let us talk about something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 5278 len. 24]: Ada would have done so willingly , and with a full persuasion that we had brought the question to a most satisfactory state .
Parsing [sent. 5279 len. 16]: But I thought it would be useless to stop there , so I began again .
Parsing [sent. 5280 len. 16]: `` No , but Richard , '' said I , `` and my dear Ada !
Parsing [sent. 5281 len. 35]: Consider how important it is to you both , and what a point of honour it is towards your cousin , that you , Richard , should be quite in earnest without any reservation .
Parsing [sent. 5282 len. 13]: I think we had better talk about this , really , Ada .
Parsing [sent. 5283 len. 9]: It will be too late very soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5284 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 5285 len. 7]: We must talk about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5286 len. 3]: said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 5287 len. 9]: `` But I think Richard is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5288 len. 26]: What was the use of my trying to look wise when she was so pretty , and so engaging , and so fond of him !
Parsing [sent. 5289 len. 33]: `` Mr. and Mrs. Badger were here yesterday , Richard , '' said I , `` and they seemed disposed to think that you had no great liking for the profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 5290 len. 6]: `` Did they though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5291 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 5292 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 5293 len. 30]: Well , that rather alters the case , because I had no idea that they thought so , and I should not have liked to disappoint or inconvenience them .
Parsing [sent. 5294 len. 12]: The fact is , I do n't care much about it .
Parsing [sent. 5295 len. 9]: But , oh , it do n't matter !
Parsing [sent. 5296 len. 10]: It 'll do as well as anything else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5297 len. 8]: `` You hear him , Ada ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5298 len. 26]: said I. `` The fact is , '' Richard proceeded , half thoughtfully and half jocosely , `` it is not quite in my way .
Parsing [sent. 5299 len. 7]: I do n't take to it .
Parsing [sent. 5300 len. 15]: And I get too much of Mrs. Bayham Badger 's first and second . ''
Parsing [sent. 5301 len. 10]: `` I am sure THAT 'S very natural ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5302 len. 6]: cried Ada , quite delighted .
Parsing [sent. 5303 len. 12]: `` The very thing we both said yesterday , Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5304 len. 27]: `` Then , '' pursued Richard , `` it 's monotonous , and to-day is too like yesterday , and to-morrow is too like to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 5305 len. 33]: `` But I am afraid , '' said I , `` this is an objection to all kinds of application -- to life itself , except under some very uncommon circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 5306 len. 7]: `` Do you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5307 len. 6]: returned Richard , still considering .
Parsing [sent. 5308 len. 3]: `` Perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 5309 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 5310 len. 29]: Why , then , you know , '' he added , suddenly becoming gay again , `` we travel outside a circle to what I said just now .
Parsing [sent. 5311 len. 9]: It 'll do as well as anything else .
Parsing [sent. 5312 len. 8]: Oh , it 's all right enough !
Parsing [sent. 5313 len. 8]: Let us talk about something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 5314 len. 55]: But even Ada , with her loving face -- and if it had seemed innocent and trusting when I first saw it in that memorable November fog , how much more did it seem now when I knew her innocent and trusting heart -- even Ada shook her head at this and looked serious .
Parsing [sent. 5315 len. 62]: So I thought it a good opportunity to hint to Richard that if he were sometimes a little careless of himself , I was very sure he never meant to be careless of Ada , and that it was a part of his affectionate consideration for her not to slight the importance of a step that might influence both their lives .
Parsing [sent. 5316 len. 6]: This made him almost grave .
Parsing [sent. 5317 len. 17]: `` My dear Mother Hubbard , '' he said , `` that 's the very thing !
Parsing [sent. 5318 len. 31]: I have thought of that several times and have been quite angry with myself for meaning to be so much in earnest and -- somehow -- not exactly being so .
Parsing [sent. 5319 len. 19]: I do n't know how it is ; I seem to want something or other to stand by .
Parsing [sent. 5320 len. 24]: Even you have no idea how fond I am of Ada -LRB- my darling cousin , I love you , so much ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5321 len. 13]: , but I do n't settle down to constancy in other things .
Parsing [sent. 5322 len. 14]: It 's such uphill work , and it takes such a time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5323 len. 8]: said Richard with an air of vexation .
Parsing [sent. 5324 len. 21]: `` That may be , '' I suggested , `` because you do n't like what you have chosen . ''
Parsing [sent. 5325 len. 5]: `` Poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5326 len. 3]: said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 5327 len. 12]: `` I am sure I do n't wonder at it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5328 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5329 len. 13]: It was not of the least use my trying to look wise .
Parsing [sent. 5330 len. 48]: I tried again , but how could I do it , or how could it have any effect if I could , while Ada rested her clasped hands upon his shoulder and while he looked at her tender blue eyes , and while they looked at him !
Parsing [sent. 5331 len. 38]: `` You see , my precious girl , '' said Richard , passing her golden curls through and through his hand , `` I was a little hasty perhaps ; or I misunderstood my own inclinations perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 5332 len. 10]: They do n't seem to lie in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 5333 len. 8]: I could n't tell till I tried .
Parsing [sent. 5334 len. 16]: Now the question is whether it 's worth-while to undo all that has been done .
Parsing [sent. 5335 len. 12]: It seems like making a great disturbance about nothing particular . ''
Parsing [sent. 5336 len. 19]: `` My dear Richard , '' said I , `` how CAN you say about nothing particular ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5337 len. 12]: `` I do n't mean absolutely that , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5338 len. 17]: `` I mean that it MAY be nothing particular because I may never want it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5339 len. 30]: Both Ada and I urged , in reply , not only that it was decidedly worth-while to undo what had been done , but that it must be undone .
Parsing [sent. 5340 len. 14]: I then asked Richard whether he had thought of any more congenial pursuit .
Parsing [sent. 5341 len. 18]: `` There , my dear Mrs. Shipton , '' said Richard , `` you touch me home .
Parsing [sent. 5342 len. 5]: Yes , I have .
Parsing [sent. 5343 len. 14]: I have been thinking that the law is the boy for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5344 len. 5]: `` The law ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5345 len. 11]: repeated Ada as if she were afraid of the name .
Parsing [sent. 5346 len. 34]: `` If I went into Kenge 's office , '' said Richard , `` and if I were placed under articles to Kenge , I should have my eye on the -- hum !
Parsing [sent. 5347 len. 32]: -- the forbidden ground -- and should be able to study it , and master it , and to satisfy myself that it was not neglected and was being properly conducted .
Parsing [sent. 5348 len. 20]: I should be able to look after Ada 's interests and my own interests -LRB- the same thing ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 5349 len. 19]: ; and I should peg away at Blackstone and all those fellows with the most tremendous ardour . ''
Parsing [sent. 5350 len. 36]: I was not by any means so sure of that , and I saw how his hankering after the vague things yet to come of those long-deferred hopes cast a shade on Ada 's face .
Parsing [sent. 5351 len. 31]: But I thought it best to encourage him in any project of continuous exertion , and only advised him to be quite sure that his mind was made up now .
Parsing [sent. 5352 len. 18]: `` My dear Minerva , '' said Richard , `` I am as steady as you are .
Parsing [sent. 5353 len. 33]: I made a mistake ; we are all liable to mistakes ; I wo n't do so any more , and I 'll become such a lawyer as is not often seen .
Parsing [sent. 5354 len. 34]: That is , you know , '' said Richard , relapsing into doubt , `` if it really is worth-while , after all , to make such a disturbance about nothing particular ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5355 len. 31]: This led to our saying again , with a great deal of gravity , all that we had said already and to our coming to much the same conclusion afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5356 len. 49]: But we so strongly advised Richard to be frank and open with Mr. Jarndyce , without a moment 's delay , and his disposition was naturally so opposed to concealment that he sought him out at once -LRB- taking us with him -RRB- and made a full avowal .
Parsing [sent. 5357 len. 24]: `` Rick , '' said my guardian , after hearing him attentively , `` we can retreat with honour , and we will .
Parsing [sent. 5358 len. 28]: But we must he careful -- for our cousin s sake , Rick , for our cousin 's sake -- that we make no more such mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 5359 len. 19]: Therefore , in the matter of the law , we will have a good trial before we decide .
Parsing [sent. 5360 len. 16]: We will look before we leap , and take plenty of time about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5361 len. 42]: Richard 's energy was of such an impatient and fitful kind that he would have liked nothing better than to have gone to Mr. Kenge 's office in that hour and to have entered into articles with him on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 5362 len. 55]: Submitting , however , with a good grace to the caution that we had shown to be so necessary , he contented himself with sitting down among us in his lightest spirits and talking as if his one unvarying purpose in life from childhood had been that one which now held possession of him .
Parsing [sent. 5363 len. 51]: My guardian was very kind and cordial with him , but rather grave , enough so to cause Ada , when he had departed and we were going upstairs to bed , to say , `` Cousin John , I hope you do n't think the worse of Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5364 len. 10]: `` No , my love , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5365 len. 17]: `` Because it was very natural that Richard should be mistaken in such a difficult case .
Parsing [sent. 5366 len. 6]: It is not uncommon . ''
Parsing [sent. 5367 len. 12]: `` No , no , my love , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5368 len. 7]: `` Do n't look unhappy . ''
Parsing [sent. 5369 len. 12]: `` Oh , I am not unhappy , cousin John ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5370 len. 24]: said Ada , smiling cheerfully , with her hand upon his shoulder , where she had put it in bidding him good night .
Parsing [sent. 5371 len. 19]: `` But I should be a little so if you thought at all the worse of Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 5372 len. 30]: `` My dear , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` I should think the worse of him only if you were ever in the least unhappy through his means .
Parsing [sent. 5373 len. 23]: I should be more disposed to quarrel with myself even then , than with poor Rick , for I brought you together .
Parsing [sent. 5374 len. 9]: But , tut , all this is nothing !
Parsing [sent. 5375 len. 12]: He has time before him , and the race to run .
Parsing [sent. 5376 len. 7]: I think the worse of him ?
Parsing [sent. 5377 len. 7]: Not I , my loving cousin !
Parsing [sent. 5378 len. 8]: And not you , I swear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5379 len. 38]: `` No , indeed , cousin John , '' said Ada , `` I am sure I could not -- I am sure I would not -- think any ill of Richard if the whole world did .
Parsing [sent. 5380 len. 19]: I could , and I would , think better of him then than at any other time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5381 len. 32]: So quietly and honestly she said it , with her hands upon his shoulders -- both hands now -- and looking up into his face , like the picture of truth !
Parsing [sent. 5382 len. 44]: `` I think , '' said my guardian , thoughtfully regarding her , `` I think it must be somewhere written that the virtues of the mothers shall occasionally be visited on the children , as well as the sins of the father .
Parsing [sent. 5383 len. 6]: Good night , my rosebud .
Parsing [sent. 5384 len. 6]: Good night , little woman .
Parsing [sent. 5385 len. 3]: Pleasant slumbers !
Parsing [sent. 5386 len. 4]: Happy dreams ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5387 len. 24]: This was the first time I ever saw him follow Ada with his eyes with something of a shadow on their benevolent expression .
Parsing [sent. 5388 len. 84]: I well remembered the look with which he had contemplated her and Richard when she was singing in the firelight ; it was but a very little while since he had watched them passing down the room in which the sun was shining , and away into the shade ; but his glance was changed , and even the silent look of confidence in me which now followed it once more was not quite so hopeful and untroubled as it had originally been .
Parsing [sent. 5389 len. 16]: Ada praised Richard more to me that night than ever she had praised him yet .
Parsing [sent. 5390 len. 17]: She went to sleep with a little bracelet he had given her clasped upon her arm .
Parsing [sent. 5391 len. 27]: I fancied she was dreaming of him when I kissed her cheek after she had slept an hour and saw how tranquil and happy she looked .
Parsing [sent. 5392 len. 17]: For I was so little inclined to sleep myself that night that I sat up working .
Parsing [sent. 5393 len. 19]: It would not be worth mentioning for its own sake , but I was wakeful and rather low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 5394 len. 6]: I do n't know why .
Parsing [sent. 5395 len. 10]: At least I do n't think I know why .
Parsing [sent. 5396 len. 15]: At least , perhaps I do , but I do n't think it matters .
Parsing [sent. 5397 len. 28]: At any rate , I made up my mind to be so dreadfully industrious that I would leave myself not a moment 's leisure to be low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 5398 len. 8]: For I naturally said , `` Esther !
Parsing [sent. 5399 len. 5]: You to be low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 5400 len. 3]: YOU ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5401 len. 26]: And it really was time to say so , for I -- yes , I really did see myself in the glass , almost crying .
Parsing [sent. 5402 len. 24]: `` As if you had anything to make you unhappy , instead of everything to make you happy , you ungrateful heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5403 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 5404 len. 60]: If I could have made myself go to sleep , I would have done it directly , but not being able to do that , I took out of my basket some ornamental work for our house -LRB- I mean Bleak House -RRB- that I was busy with at that time and sat down to it with great determination .
Parsing [sent. 5405 len. 36]: It was necessary to count all the stitches in that work , and I resolved to go on with it until I could n't keep my eyes open , and then to go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 5406 len. 7]: I soon found myself very busy .
Parsing [sent. 5407 len. 38]: But I had left some silk downstairs in a work-table drawer in the temporary growlery , and coming to a stop for want of it , I took my candle and went softly down to get it .
Parsing [sent. 5408 len. 22]: To my great surprise , on going in I found my guardian still there , and sitting looking at the ashes .
Parsing [sent. 5409 len. 45]: He was lost in thought , his book lay unheeded by his side , his silvered iron-grey hair was scattered confusedly upon his forehead as though his hand had been wandering among it while his thoughts were elsewhere , and his face looked worn .
Parsing [sent. 5410 len. 40]: Almost frightened by coming upon him so unexpectedly , I stood still for a moment and should have retired without speaking had he not , in again passing his hand abstractedly through his hair , seen me and started .
Parsing [sent. 5411 len. 4]: `` Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5412 len. 9]: I told him what I had come for .
Parsing [sent. 5413 len. 10]: `` At work so late , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5414 len. 23]: `` I am working late to-night , '' said I , `` because I could n't sleep and wished to tire myself .
Parsing [sent. 5415 len. 14]: But , dear guardian , you are late too , and look weary .
Parsing [sent. 5416 len. 14]: You have no trouble , I hope , to keep you waking ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5417 len. 16]: `` None , little woman , that YOU would readily understand , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5418 len. 33]: He spoke in a regretful tone so new to me that I inwardly repeated , as if that would help me to his meaning , `` That I could readily understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5419 len. 19]: `` Remain a moment , Esther , '' said he , `` You were in my thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 5420 len. 12]: `` I hope I was not the trouble , guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5421 len. 12]: He slightly waved his hand and fell into his usual manner .
Parsing [sent. 5422 len. 35]: The change was so remarkable , and he appeared to make it by dint of so much self-command , that I found myself again inwardly repeating , `` None that I could understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5423 len. 41]: `` Little woman , '' said my guardian , `` I was thinking -- that is , I have been thinking since I have been sitting here -- that you ought to know of your own history all I know .
Parsing [sent. 5424 len. 5]: It is very little .
Parsing [sent. 5425 len. 5]: Next to nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5426 len. 63]: `` Dear guardian , '' I replied , `` when you spoke to me before on that subject -- '' `` But since then , '' he gravely interposed , anticipating what I meant to say , `` I have reflected that your having anything to ask me , and my having anything to tell you , are different considerations , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 5427 len. 15]: It is perhaps my duty to impart to you the little I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 5428 len. 13]: `` If you think so , guardian , it is right . ''
Parsing [sent. 5429 len. 18]: `` I think so , '' he returned very gently , and kindly , and very distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 5430 len. 9]: `` My dear , I think so now .
Parsing [sent. 5431 len. 47]: If any real disadvantage can attach to your position in the mind of any man or woman worth a thought , it is right that you at least of all the world should not magnify it to yourself by having vague impressions of its nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 5432 len. 48]: I sat down and said after a little effort to be as calm as I ought to be , `` One of my earliest remembrances , guardian , is of these words : ` Your mother , Esther , is your disgrace , and you were hers .
Parsing [sent. 5433 len. 32]: The time will come , and soon enough , when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5434 len. 56]: I had covered my face with my hands in repeating the words , but I took them away now with a better kind of shame , I hope , and told him that to him I owed the blessing that I had from my childhood to that hour never , never , never felt it .
Parsing [sent. 5435 len. 11]: He put up his hand as if to stop me .
Parsing [sent. 5436 len. 16]: I well knew that he was never to be thanked , and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 5437 len. 51]: `` Nine years , my dear , '' he said after thinking for a little while , `` have passed since I received a letter from a lady living in seclusion , written with a stern passion and power that rendered it unlike all other letters I have ever read .
Parsing [sent. 5438 len. 40]: It was written to me -LRB- as it told me in so many words -RRB- , perhaps because it was the writer 's idiosyncrasy to put that trust in me , perhaps because it was mine to justify it .
Parsing [sent. 5439 len. 28]: It told me of a child , an orphan girl then twelve years old , in some such cruel words as those which live in your remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 5440 len. 51]: It told me that the writer had bred her in secrecy from her birth , had blotted out all trace of her existence , and that if the writer were to die before the child became a woman , she would be left entirely friendless , nameless , and unknown .
Parsing [sent. 5441 len. 21]: It asked me to consider if I would , in that case , finish what the writer had begun . ''
Parsing [sent. 5442 len. 10]: I listened in silence and looked attentively at him .
Parsing [sent. 5443 len. 54]: `` Your early recollection , my dear , will supply the gloomy medium through which all this was seen and expressed by the writer , and the distorted religion which clouded her mind with impressions of the need there was for the child to expiate an offence of which she was quite innocent .
Parsing [sent. 5444 len. 20]: I felt concerned for the little creature , in her darkened life , and replied to the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 5445 len. 8]: I took his hand and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 5446 len. 42]: `` It laid the injunction on me that I should never propose to see the writer , who had long been estranged from all intercourse with the world , but who would see a confidential agent if I would appoint one .
Parsing [sent. 5447 len. 5]: I accredited Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 5448 len. 22]: The lady said , of her own accord and not of his seeking , that her name was an assumed one .
Parsing [sent. 5449 len. 21]: That she was , if there were any ties of blood in such a case , the child 's aunt .
Parsing [sent. 5450 len. 26]: That more than this she would never -LRB- and he was well persuaded of the steadfastness of her resolution -RRB- for any human consideration disclose .
Parsing [sent. 5451 len. 10]: My dear , I have told you all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5452 len. 11]: I held his hand for a little while in mine .
Parsing [sent. 5453 len. 35]: `` I saw my ward oftener than she saw me , '' he added , cheerily making light of it , `` and I always knew she was beloved , useful , and happy .
Parsing [sent. 5454 len. 18]: She repays me twenty-thousandfold , and twenty more to that , every hour in every day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5455 len. 23]: `` And oftener still , '' said I , ' `` she blesses the guardian who is a father to her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5456 len. 15]: At the word father , I saw his former trouble come into his face .
Parsing [sent. 5457 len. 40]: He subdued it as before , and it was gone in an instant ; but it had been there and it had come so swiftly upon my words that I felt as if they had given him a shock .
Parsing [sent. 5458 len. 14]: I again inwardly repeated , wondering , `` That I could readily understand .
Parsing [sent. 5459 len. 8]: None that I could readily understand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5460 len. 6]: No , it was true .
Parsing [sent. 5461 len. 6]: I did not understand it .
Parsing [sent. 5462 len. 8]: Not for many and many a day .
Parsing [sent. 5463 len. 26]: `` Take a fatherly good night , my dear , '' said he , kissing me on the forehead , `` and so to rest .
Parsing [sent. 5464 len. 9]: These are late hours for working and thinking .
Parsing [sent. 5465 len. 16]: You do that for all of us , all day long , little housekeeper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5466 len. 10]: I neither worked nor thought any more that night .
Parsing [sent. 5467 len. 24]: I opened my grateful heart to heaven in thankfulness for its providence to me and its care of me , and fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 5468 len. 7]: We had a visitor next day .
Parsing [sent. 5469 len. 5]: Mr. Allan Woodcourt came .
Parsing [sent. 5470 len. 16]: He came to take leave of us ; he had settled to do so beforehand .
Parsing [sent. 5471 len. 15]: He was going to China and to India as a surgeon on board ship .
Parsing [sent. 5472 len. 11]: He was to be away a long , long time .
Parsing [sent. 5473 len. 14]: I believe -- at least I know -- that he was not rich .
Parsing [sent. 5474 len. 16]: All his widowed mother could spare had been spent in qualifying him for his profession .
Parsing [sent. 5475 len. 52]: It was not lucrative to a young practitioner , with very little influence in London ; and although he was , night and day , at the service of numbers of poor people and did wonders of gentleness and skill for them , he gained very little by it in money .
Parsing [sent. 5476 len. 23]: He was seven years older than I. Not that I need mention it , for it hardly seems to belong to anything .
Parsing [sent. 5477 len. 48]: I think -- I mean , he told us -- that he had been in practice three or four years and that if he could have hoped to contend through three or four more , he would not have made the voyage on which he was bound .
Parsing [sent. 5478 len. 16]: But he had no fortune or private means , and so he was going away .
Parsing [sent. 5479 len. 10]: He had been to see us several times altogether .
Parsing [sent. 5480 len. 10]: We thought it a pity he should go away .
Parsing [sent. 5481 len. 30]: Because he was distinguished in his art among those who knew it best , and some of the greatest men belonging to it had a high opinion of him .
Parsing [sent. 5482 len. 19]: When he came to bid us good-bye , he brought his mother with him for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 5483 len. 17]: She was a pretty old lady , with bright black eyes , but she seemed proud .
Parsing [sent. 5484 len. 59]: She came from Wales and had had , a long time ago , an eminent person for an ancestor , of the name of Morgan ap -- Kerrig -- of some place that sounded like Gimlet -- who was the most illustrious person that ever was known and all of whose relations were a sort of royal family .
Parsing [sent. 5485 len. 46]: He appeared to have passed his life in always getting up into mountains and fighting somebody ; and a bard whose name sounded like Crumlinwallinwer had sung his praises in a piece which was called , as nearly as I could catch it , Mewlinnwillinwodd .
Parsing [sent. 5486 len. 40]: Mrs. Woodcourt , after expatiating to us on the fame of her great kinsman , said that no doubt wherever her son Allan went he would remember his pedigree and would on no account form an alliance below it .
Parsing [sent. 5487 len. 56]: She told him that there were many handsome English ladies in India who went out on speculation , and that there were some to be picked up with property , but that neither charms nor wealth would suffice for the descendant from such a line without birth , which must ever be the first consideration .
Parsing [sent. 5488 len. 35]: She talked so much about birth that for a moment I half fancied , and with pain -- But what an idle fancy to suppose that she could think or care what MINE was !
Parsing [sent. 5489 len. 59]: Mr. Woodcourt seemed a little distressed by her prolixity , but he was too considerate to let her see it and contrived delicately to bring the conversation round to making his acknowledgments to my guardian for his hospitality and for the very happy hours -- he called them the very happy hours -- he had passed with us .
Parsing [sent. 5490 len. 21]: The recollection of them , he said , would go with him wherever he went and would be always treasured .
Parsing [sent. 5491 len. 49]: And so we gave him our hands , one after another -- at least , they did -- and I did ; and so he put his lips to Ada 's hand -- and to mine ; and so he went away upon his long , long voyage !
Parsing [sent. 5492 len. 43]: I was very busy indeed all day and wrote directions home to the servants , and wrote notes for my guardian , and dusted his books and papers , and jingled my housekeeping keys a good deal , one way and another .
Parsing [sent. 5493 len. 31]: I was still busy between the lights , singing and working by the window , when who should come in but Caddy , whom I had no expectation of seeing !
Parsing [sent. 5494 len. 18]: `` Why , Caddy , my dear , '' said I , `` what beautiful flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5495 len. 11]: She had such an exquisite little nosegay in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 5496 len. 13]: `` Indeed , I think so , Esther , '' replied Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 5497 len. 10]: `` They are the loveliest I ever saw . ''
Parsing [sent. 5498 len. 7]: `` Prince , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5499 len. 6]: said I in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 5500 len. 18]: `` No , '' answered Caddy , shaking her head and holding them to me to smell .
Parsing [sent. 5501 len. 5]: `` Not Prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 5502 len. 10]: `` Well , to be sure , Caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5503 len. 10]: said I. `` You must have two lovers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5504 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 5505 len. 10]: Do they look like that sort of thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5506 len. 3]: said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 5507 len. 11]: `` Do they look like that sort of thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5508 len. 7]: I repeated , pinching her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 5509 len. 62]: Caddy only laughed in return , and telling me that she had come for half an hour , at the expiration of which time Prince would be waiting for her at the corner , sat chatting with me and Ada in the window , every now and then handing me the flowers again or trying how they looked against my hair .
Parsing [sent. 5510 len. 21]: At last , when she was going , she took me into my room and put them in my dress .
Parsing [sent. 5511 len. 5]: `` For me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5512 len. 5]: said I , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 5513 len. 11]: `` For you , '' said Caddy with a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 5514 len. 9]: `` They were left behind by somebody . ''
Parsing [sent. 5515 len. 5]: `` Left behind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5516 len. 11]: `` At poor Miss Flite 's , '' said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 5517 len. 25]: `` Somebody who has been very good to her was hurrying away an hour ago to join a ship and left these flowers behind .
Parsing [sent. 5518 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 5519 len. 6]: Do n't take them out .
Parsing [sent. 5520 len. 39]: Let the pretty little things lie here , '' said Caddy , adjusting them with a careful hand , `` because I was present myself , and I should n't wonder if somebody left them on purpose ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5521 len. 11]: `` Do they look like that sort of thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5522 len. 15]: said Ada , coming laughingly behind me and clasping me merrily round the waist .
Parsing [sent. 5523 len. 12]: `` Oh , yes , indeed they do , Dame Durden !
Parsing [sent. 5524 len. 11]: They look very , very like that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 5525 len. 11]: Oh , very like it indeed , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5526 len. 30]: Chapter XVIII -- Lady Dedlock It was not so easy as it had appeared at first to arrange for Richard 's making a trial of Mr. Kenge 's office .
Parsing [sent. 5527 len. 7]: Richard himself was the chief impediment .
Parsing [sent. 5528 len. 30]: As soon as he had it in his power to leave Mr. Badger at any moment , he began to doubt whether he wanted to leave him at all .
Parsing [sent. 5529 len. 10]: He did n't know , he said , really .
Parsing [sent. 5530 len. 36]: It was n't a bad profession ; he could n't assert that he disliked it ; perhaps he liked it as well as he liked any other -- suppose he gave it one more chance !
Parsing [sent. 5531 len. 30]: Upon that , he shut himself up for a few weeks with some books and some bones and seemed to acquire a considerable fund of information with great rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 5532 len. 26]: His fervour , after lasting about a month , began to cool , and when it was quite cooled , began to grow warm again .
Parsing [sent. 5533 len. 31]: His vacillations between law and medicine lasted so long that midsummer arrived before he finally separated from Mr. Badger and entered on an experimental course of Messrs. Kenge and Carboy .
Parsing [sent. 5534 len. 23]: For all his waywardness , he took great credit to himself as being determined to be in earnest `` this time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5535 len. 33]: And he was so good-natured throughout , and in such high spirits , and so fond of Ada , that it was very difficult indeed to be otherwise than pleased with him .
Parsing [sent. 5536 len. 54]: `` As to Mr. Jarndyce , '' who , I may mention , found the wind much given , during this period , to stick in the east ; `` As to Mr. Jarndyce , '' Richard would say to me , `` he is the finest fellow in the world , Esther !
Parsing [sent. 5537 len. 31]: I must be particularly careful , if it were only for his satisfaction , to take myself well to task and have a regular wind-up of this business now . ''
Parsing [sent. 5538 len. 34]: The idea of his taking himself well to task , with that laughing face and heedless manner and with a fancy that everything could catch and nothing could hold , was ludicrously anomalous .
Parsing [sent. 5539 len. 25]: However , he told us between-whiles that he was doing it to such an extent that he wondered his hair did n't turn grey .
Parsing [sent. 5540 len. 29]: His regular wind-up of the business was -LRB- as I have said -RRB- that he went to Mr. Kenge 's about midsummer to try how he liked it .
Parsing [sent. 5541 len. 38]: All this time he was , in money affairs , what I have described him in a former illustration -- generous , profuse , wildly careless , but fully persuaded that he was rather calculating and prudent .
Parsing [sent. 5542 len. 65]: I happened to say to Ada , in his presence , half jestingly , half seriously , about the time of his going to Mr. Kenge 's , that he needed to have Fortunatus ' purse , he made so light of money , which he answered in this way , `` My jewel of a dear cousin , you hear this old woman !
Parsing [sent. 5543 len. 6]: Why does she say that ?
Parsing [sent. 5544 len. 24]: Because I gave eight pounds odd -LRB- or whatever it was -RRB- for a certain neat waistcoat and buttons a few days ago .
Parsing [sent. 5545 len. 26]: Now , if I had stayed at Badger 's I should have been obliged to spend twelve pounds at a blow for some heart-breaking lecture-fees .
Parsing [sent. 5546 len. 15]: So I make four pounds -- in a lump -- by the transaction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5547 len. 57]: It was a question much discussed between him and my guardian what arrangements should be made for his living in London while he experimented on the law , for we had long since gone back to Bleak House , and it was too far off to admit of his coming there oftener than once a week .
Parsing [sent. 5548 len. 62]: My guardian told me that if Richard were to settle down at Mr. Kenge 's he would take some apartments or chambers where we too could occasionally stay for a few days at a time ; `` but , little woman , '' he added , rubbing his head very significantly , `` he has n't settled down there yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5549 len. 27]: The discussions ended in our hiring for him , by the month , a neat little furnished lodging in a quiet old house near Queen Square .
Parsing [sent. 5550 len. 73]: He immediately began to spend all the money he had in buying the oddest little ornaments and luxuries for this lodging ; and so often as Ada and I dissuaded him from making any purchase that he had in contemplation which was particularly unnecessary and expensive , he took credit for what it would have cost and made out that to spend anything less on something else was to save the difference .
Parsing [sent. 5551 len. 16]: While these affairs were in abeyance , our visit to Mr. Boythorn 's was postponed .
Parsing [sent. 5552 len. 19]: At length , Richard having taken possession of his lodging , there was nothing to prevent our departure .
Parsing [sent. 5553 len. 41]: He could have gone with us at that time of the year very well , but he was in the full novelty of his new position and was making most energetic attempts to unravel the mysteries of the fatal suit .
Parsing [sent. 5554 len. 19]: Consequently we went without him , and my darling was delighted to praise him for being so busy .
Parsing [sent. 5555 len. 20]: We made a pleasant journey down into Lincolnshire by the coach and had an entertaining companion in Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 5556 len. 38]: His furniture had been all cleared off , it appeared , by the person who took possession of it on his blue-eyed daughter 's birthday , but he seemed quite relieved to think that it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5557 len. 38]: Chairs and table , he said , were wearisome objects ; they were monotonous ideas , they had no variety of expression , they looked you out of countenance , and you looked them out of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 5558 len. 55]: How pleasant , then , to be bound to no particular chairs and tables , but to sport like a butterfly among all the furniture on hire , and to flit from rosewood to mahogany , and from mahogany to walnut , and from this shape to that , as the humour took one !
Parsing [sent. 5559 len. 44]: `` The oddity of the thing is , '' said Mr. Skimpole with a quickened sense of the ludicrous , `` that my chairs and tables were not paid for , and yet my landlord walks off with them as composedly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5560 len. 6]: Now , that seems droll !
Parsing [sent. 5561 len. 7]: There is something grotesque in it .
Parsing [sent. 5562 len. 14]: The chair and table merchant never engaged to pay my landlord my rent .
Parsing [sent. 5563 len. 8]: Why should my landlord quarrel with HIM ?
Parsing [sent. 5564 len. 42]: If I have a pimple on my nose which is disagreeable to my landlord 's peculiar ideas of beauty , my landlord has no business to scratch my chair and table merchant 's nose , which has no pimple on it .
Parsing [sent. 5565 len. 6]: His reasoning seems defective ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5566 len. 31]: `` Well , '' said my guardian good-humouredly , `` it 's pretty clear that whoever became security for those chairs and tables will have to pay for them . ''
Parsing [sent. 5567 len. 4]: `` Exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5568 len. 4]: returned Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 5569 len. 12]: `` That 's the crowning point of unreason in the business !
Parsing [sent. 5570 len. 37]: I said to my landlord , ` My good man , you are not aware that my excellent friend Jarndyce will have to pay for those things that you are sweeping off in that indelicate manner .
Parsing [sent. 5571 len. 9]: Have you no consideration for HIS property ? '
Parsing [sent. 5572 len. 7]: He had n't the least . ''
Parsing [sent. 5573 len. 11]: `` And refused all proposals , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5574 len. 10]: `` Refused all proposals , '' returned Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 5575 len. 7]: `` I made him business proposals .
Parsing [sent. 5576 len. 7]: I had him into my room .
Parsing [sent. 5577 len. 15]: I said , ` You are a man of business , I believe ? '
Parsing [sent. 5578 len. 23]: He replied , ' I am , ' ` Very well , ' said I , ` now let us be business-like .
Parsing [sent. 5579 len. 15]: Here is an inkstand , here are pens and paper , here are wafers .
Parsing [sent. 5580 len. 5]: What do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 5581 len. 31]: I have occupied your house for a considerable period , I believe to our mutual satisfaction until this unpleasant misunderstanding arose ; let us be at once friendly and business-like .
Parsing [sent. 5582 len. 6]: What do you want ? '
Parsing [sent. 5583 len. 31]: In reply to this , he made use of the figurative expression -- which has something Eastern about it -- that he had never seen the colour of my money .
Parsing [sent. 5584 len. 16]: ` My amiable friend , ' said I , ' I never have any money .
Parsing [sent. 5585 len. 8]: I never know anything about money . '
Parsing [sent. 5586 len. 21]: ` Well , sir , ' said he , ` what do you offer if I give you time ? '
Parsing [sent. 5587 len. 57]: ` My good fellow , ' said I , ' I have no idea of time ; but you say you are a man of business , and whatever you can suggest to be done in a business-like way with pen , and ink , and paper -- and wafers -- I am ready to do .
Parsing [sent. 5588 len. 20]: Do n't pay yourself at another man 's expense -LRB- which is foolish -RRB- , but be business-like ! '
Parsing [sent. 5589 len. 16]: However , he would n't be , and there was an end of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5590 len. 20]: If these were some of the inconveniences of Mr. Skimpole 's childhood , it assuredly possessed its advantages too .
Parsing [sent. 5591 len. 35]: On the journey he had a very good appetite for such refreshment as came in our way -LRB- including a basket of choice hothouse peaches -RRB- , but never thought of paying for anything .
Parsing [sent. 5592 len. 61]: So when the coachman came round for his fee , he pleasantly asked him what he considered a very good fee indeed , now -- a liberal one -- and on his replying half a crown for a single passenger , said it was little enough too , all things considered , and left Mr. Jarndyce to give it him .
Parsing [sent. 5593 len. 5]: It was delightful weather .
Parsing [sent. 5594 len. 51]: The green corn waved so beautifully , the larks sang so joyfully , the hedges were so full of wild flowers , the trees were so thickly out in leaf , the bean-fields , with a light wind blowing over them , filled the air with such a delicious fragrance !
Parsing [sent. 5595 len. 70]: Late in the afternoon we came to the market-town where we were to alight from the coach -- a dull little town with a church-spire , and a marketplace , and a market-cross , and one intensely sunny street , and a pond with an old horse cooling his legs in it , and a very few men sleepily lying and standing about in narrow little bits of shade .
Parsing [sent. 5596 len. 35]: After the rustling of the leaves and the waving of the corn all along the road , it looked as still , as hot , as motionless a little town as England could produce .
Parsing [sent. 5597 len. 29]: At the inn we found Mr. Boythorn on horseback , waiting with an open carriage to take us to his house , which was a few miles off .
Parsing [sent. 5598 len. 12]: He was over-joyed to see us and dismounted with great alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 5599 len. 5]: `` By heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5600 len. 9]: said he after giving us a courteous greeting .
Parsing [sent. 5601 len. 6]: This a most infamous coach .
Parsing [sent. 5602 len. 20]: It is the most flagrant example of an abominable public vehicle that ever encumbered the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5603 len. 10]: It is twenty-five minutes after its time this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 5604 len. 10]: The coachman ought to be put to death ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5605 len. 8]: `` IS he after his time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5606 len. 12]: said Mr. Skimpole , to whom he happened to address himself .
Parsing [sent. 5607 len. 7]: `` You know my infirmity . ''
Parsing [sent. 5608 len. 4]: `` Twenty-five minutes !
Parsing [sent. 5609 len. 4]: Twenty-six minutes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5610 len. 9]: replied Mr. Boythorn , referring to his watch .
Parsing [sent. 5611 len. 20]: `` With two ladies in the coach , this scoundrel has deliberately delayed his arrival six and twenty minutes .
Parsing [sent. 5612 len. 2]: Deliberately !
Parsing [sent. 5613 len. 9]: It is impossible that it can be accidental !
Parsing [sent. 5614 len. 21]: But his father -- and his uncle -- were the most profligate coachmen that ever sat upon a box . ''
Parsing [sent. 5615 len. 29]: While he said this in tones of the greatest indignation , he handed us into the little phaeton with the utmost gentleness and was all smiles and pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 5616 len. 37]: `` I am sorry , ladies , '' he said , standing bare-headed at the carriage-door when all was ready , `` that I am obliged to conduct you nearly two miles out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 5617 len. 51]: But our direct road lies through Sir Leicester Dedlock 's park , and in that fellow 's property I have sworn never to set foot of mine , or horse 's foot of mine , pending the present relations between us , while I breathe the breath of life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5618 len. 28]: And here , catching my guardian 's eye , he broke into one of his tremendous laughs , which seemed to shake even the motionless little market-town .
Parsing [sent. 5619 len. 10]: `` Are the Dedlocks down here , Lawrence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5620 len. 19]: said my guardian as we drove along and Mr. Boythorn trotted on the green turf by the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 5621 len. 12]: `` Sir Arrogant Numskull is here , '' replied Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 5622 len. 5]: `` Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5623 len. 20]: Sir Arrogant is here , and I am glad to say , has been laid by the heels here .
Parsing [sent. 5624 len. 35]: My Lady , '' in naming whom he always made a courtly gesture as if particularly to exclude her from any part in the quarrel , `` is expected , I believe , daily .
Parsing [sent. 5625 len. 17]: I am not in the least surprised that she postpones her appearance as long as possible .
Parsing [sent. 5626 len. 29]: Whatever can have induced that transcendent woman to marry that effigy and figure-head of a baronet is one of the most impenetrable mysteries that ever baffled human inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 5627 len. 6]: Ha ha ha ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5628 len. 23]: `` I suppose , said my guardian , laughing , `` WE may set foot in the park while we are here ?
Parsing [sent. 5629 len. 12]: The prohibition does not extend to us , does it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5630 len. 41]: `` I can lay no prohibition on my guests , '' he said , bending his head to Ada and me with the smiling politeness which sat so gracefully upon him , `` except in the matter of their departure .
Parsing [sent. 5631 len. 26]: I am only sorry that I can not have the happiness of being their escort about Chesney Wold , which is a very fine place !
Parsing [sent. 5632 len. 33]: But by the light of this summer day , Jarndyce , if you call upon the owner while you stay with me , you are likely to have but a cool reception .
Parsing [sent. 5633 len. 33]: He carries himself like an eight-day clock at all times , like one of a race of eight-day clocks in gorgeous cases that never go and never went -- Ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5634 len. 25]: -- but he will have some extra stiffness , I can promise you , for the friends of his friend and neighbour Boythorn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5635 len. 15]: `` I shall not put him to the proof , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5636 len. 26]: `` He is as indifferent to the honour of knowing me , I dare say , as I am to the honour of knowing him .
Parsing [sent. 5637 len. 26]: The air of the grounds and perhaps such a view of the house as any other sightseer might get are quite enough for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5638 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5639 len. 4]: said Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 5640 len. 10]: `` I am glad of it on the whole .
Parsing [sent. 5641 len. 6]: It 's in better keeping .
Parsing [sent. 5642 len. 14]: I am looked upon about here as a second Ajax defying the lightning .
Parsing [sent. 5643 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5644 len. 36]: When I go into our little church on a Sunday , a considerable part of the inconsiderable congregation expect to see me drop , scorched and withered , on the pavement under the Dedlock displeasure .
Parsing [sent. 5645 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5646 len. 12]: I have no doubt he is surprised that I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 5647 len. 25]: For he is , by heaven , the most self-satisfied , and the shallowest , and the most coxcombical and utterly brainless ass ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5648 len. 31]: Our coming to the ridge of a hill we had been ascending enabled our friend to point out Chesney Wold itself to us and diverted his attention from its master .
Parsing [sent. 5649 len. 13]: It was a picturesque old house in a fine park richly wooded .
Parsing [sent. 5650 len. 24]: Among the trees and not far from the residence he pointed out the spire of the little church of which he had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 5651 len. 58]: Oh , the solemn woods over which the light and shadow travelled swiftly , as if heavenly wings were sweeping on benignant errands through the summer air ; the smooth green slopes , the glittering water , the garden where the flowers were so symmetrically arranged in clusters of the richest colours , how beautiful they looked !
Parsing [sent. 5652 len. 65]: The house , with gable and chimney , and tower , and turret , and dark doorway , and broad terrace-walk , twining among the balustrades of which , and lying heaped upon the vases , there was one great flush of roses , seemed scarcely real in its light solidity and in the serene and peaceful hush that rested on all around it .
Parsing [sent. 5653 len. 14]: To Ada and to me , that above all appeared the pervading influence .
Parsing [sent. 5654 len. 55]: On everything , house , garden , terrace , green slopes , water , old oaks , fern , moss , woods again , and far away across the openings in the prospect to the distance lying wide before us with a purple bloom upon it , there seemed to be such undisturbed repose .
Parsing [sent. 5655 len. 49]: When we came into the little village and passed a small inn with the sign of the Dedlock Arms swinging over the road in front , Mr. Boythorn interchanged greetings with a young gentleman sitting on a bench outside the inn-door who had some fishing-tackle lying beside him .
Parsing [sent. 5656 len. 33]: `` That 's the housekeeper 's grandson , Mr. Rouncewell by name , '' said , he , `` and he is in love with a pretty girl up at the house .
Parsing [sent. 5657 len. 35]: Lady Dedlock has taken a fancy to the pretty girl and is going to keep her about her own fair person -- an honour which my young friend himself does not at all appreciate .
Parsing [sent. 5658 len. 27]: However , he ca n't marry just yet , even if his Rosebud were willing ; so he is fain to make the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 5659 len. 21]: In the meanwhile , he comes here pretty often for a day or two at a time to -- fish .
Parsing [sent. 5660 len. 6]: Ha ha ha ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5661 len. 13]: `` Are he and the pretty girl engaged , Mr. Boythorn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5662 len. 3]: asked Ada .
Parsing [sent. 5663 len. 50]: `` Why , my dear Miss Clare , '' he returned , `` I think they may perhaps understand each other ; but you will see them soon , I dare say , and I must learn from you on such a point -- not you from me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5664 len. 36]: Ada blushed , and Mr. Boythorn , trotting forward on his comely grey horse , dismounted at his own door and stood ready with extended arm and uncovered head to welcome us when we arrived .
Parsing [sent. 5665 len. 49]: He lived in a pretty house , formerly the parsonage house , with a lawn in front , a bright flower-garden at the side , and a well-stocked orchard and kitchen-garden in the rear , enclosed with a venerable wall that had of itself a ripened ruddy look .
Parsing [sent. 5666 len. 16]: But , indeed , everything about the place wore an aspect of maturity and abundance .
Parsing [sent. 5667 len. 57]: The old lime-tree walk was like green cloisters , the very shadows of the cherry-trees and apple-trees were heavy with fruit , the gooseberry-bushes were so laden that their branches arched and rested on the earth , the strawberries and raspberries grew in like profusion , and the peaches basked by the hundred on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 5668 len. 74]: Tumbled about among the spread nets and the glass frames sparkling and winking in the sun there were such heaps of drooping pods , and marrows , and cucumbers , that every foot of ground appeared a vegetable treasury , while the smell of sweet herbs and all kinds of wholesome growth -LRB- to say nothing of the neighbouring meadows where the hay was carrying -RRB- made the whole air a great nosegay .
Parsing [sent. 5669 len. 83]: Such stillness and composure reigned within the orderly precincts of the old red wall that even the feathers hung in garlands to scare the birds hardly stirred ; and the wall had such a ripening influence that where , here and there high up , a disused nail and scrap of list still clung to it , it was easy to fancy that they had mellowed with the changing seasons and that they had rusted and decayed according to the common fate .
Parsing [sent. 5670 len. 34]: The house , though a little disorderly in comparison with the garden , was a real old house with settles in the chimney of the brick-floored kitchen and great beams across the ceilings .
Parsing [sent. 5671 len. 74]: On one side of it was the terrible piece of ground in dispute , where Mr. Boythorn maintained a sentry in a smock-frock day and night , whose duty was supposed to be , in cases of aggression , immediately to ring a large bell hung up there for the purpose , to unchain a great bull-dog established in a kennel as his ally , and generally to deal destruction on the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 5672 len. 39]: Not content with these precautions , Mr. Boythorn had himself composed and posted there , on painted boards to which his name was attached in large letters , the following solemn warnings : `` Beware of the bull-dog .
Parsing [sent. 5673 len. 5]: He is most ferocious .
Parsing [sent. 5674 len. 4]: Lawrence Boythorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 5675 len. 8]: `` The blunderbus is loaded with slugs .
Parsing [sent. 5676 len. 4]: Lawrence Boythorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 5677 len. 16]: `` Man-traps and spring-guns are set here at all times of the day and night .
Parsing [sent. 5678 len. 4]: Lawrence Boythorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 5679 len. 4]: `` Take notice .
Parsing [sent. 5680 len. 32]: That any person or persons audaciously presuming to trespass on this property will be punished with the utmost severity of private chastisement and prosecuted with the utmost rigour of the law .
Parsing [sent. 5681 len. 4]: Lawrence Boythorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 5682 len. 28]: These he showed us from the drawing-room window , while his bird was hopping about his head , and he laughed , `` Ha ha ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 5683 len. 6]: Ha ha ha ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5684 len. 18]: to that extent as he pointed them out that I really thought he would have hurt himself .
Parsing [sent. 5685 len. 31]: `` But this is taking a good deal of trouble , '' said Mr. Skimpole in his light way , `` when you are not in earnest after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 5686 len. 6]: `` Not in earnest ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5687 len. 7]: returned Mr. Boythorn with unspeakable warmth .
Parsing [sent. 5688 len. 5]: `` Not in earnest !
Parsing [sent. 5689 len. 41]: If I could have hoped to train him , I would have bought a lion instead of that dog and would have turned him loose upon the first intolerable robber who should dare to make an encroachment on my rights .
Parsing [sent. 5690 len. 33]: Let Sir Leicester Dedlock consent to come out and decide this question by single combat , and I will meet him with any weapon known to mankind in any age or country .
Parsing [sent. 5691 len. 7]: I am that much in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 5692 len. 4]: Not more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5693 len. 9]: We arrived at his house on a Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 5694 len. 18]: On the Sunday morning we all set forth to walk to the little church in the park .
Parsing [sent. 5695 len. 33]: Entering the park , almost immediately by the disputed ground , we pursued a pleasant footpath winding among the verdant turf and the beautiful trees until it brought us to the church-porch .
Parsing [sent. 5696 len. 39]: The congregation was extremely small and quite a rustic one with the exception of a large muster of servants from the house , some of whom were already in their seats , while others were yet dropping in .
Parsing [sent. 5697 len. 41]: There were some stately footmen , and there was a perfect picture of an old coachman , who looked as if he were the official representative of all the pomps and vanities that had ever been put into his coach .
Parsing [sent. 5698 len. 29]: There was a very pretty show of young women , and above them , the handsome old face and fine responsible portly figure of the housekeeper towered pre-eminent .
Parsing [sent. 5699 len. 15]: The pretty girl of whom Mr. Boythorn had told us was close by her .
Parsing [sent. 5700 len. 40]: She was so very pretty that I might have known her by her beauty even if I had not seen how blushingly conscious she was of the eyes of the young fisherman , whom I discovered not far off .
Parsing [sent. 5701 len. 31]: One face , and not an agreeable one , though it was handsome , seemed maliciously watchful of this pretty girl , and indeed of every one and everything there .
Parsing [sent. 5702 len. 6]: It was a Frenchwoman 's .
Parsing [sent. 5703 len. 47]: As the bell was yet ringing and the great people were not yet come , I had leisure to glance over the church , which smelt as earthy as a grave , and to think what a shady , ancient , solemn little church it was .
Parsing [sent. 5704 len. 57]: The windows , heavily shaded by trees , admitted a subdued light that made the faces around me pale , and darkened the old brasses in the pavement and the time and damp-worn monuments , and rendered the sunshine in the little porch , where a monotonous ringer was working at the bell , inestimably bright .
Parsing [sent. 5705 len. 54]: But a stir in that direction , a gathering of reverential awe in the rustic faces , and a blandly ferocious assumption on the part of Mr. Boythorn of being resolutely unconscious of somebody 's existence forewarned me that the great people were come and that the service was going to begin . ''
Parsing [sent. 5706 len. 41]: ` Enter not into judgment with thy servant , O Lord , for in thy sight -- ' '' Shall I ever forget the rapid beating at my heart , occasioned by the look I met as I stood up !
Parsing [sent. 5707 len. 24]: Shall I ever forget the manner in which those handsome proud eyes seemed to spring out of their languor and to hold mine !
Parsing [sent. 5708 len. 39]: It was only a moment before I cast mine down -- released again , if I may say so -- on my book ; but I knew the beautiful face quite well in that short space of time .
Parsing [sent. 5709 len. 47]: And , very strangely , there was something quickened within me , associated with the lonely days at my godmother 's ; yes , away even to the days when I had stood on tiptoe to dress myself at my little glass after dressing my doll .
Parsing [sent. 5710 len. 28]: And this , although I had never seen this lady 's face before in all my life -- I was quite sure of it -- absolutely certain .
Parsing [sent. 5711 len. 36]: It was easy to know that the ceremonious , gouty , grey-haired gentleman , the only other occupant of the great pew , was Sir Leicester Dedlock , and that the lady was Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 5712 len. 55]: But why her face should be , in a confused way , like a broken glass to me , in which I saw scraps of old remembrances , and why I should be so fluttered and troubled -LRB- for I was still -RRB- by having casually met her eyes , I could not think .
Parsing [sent. 5713 len. 23]: I felt it to be an unmeaning weakness in me and tried to overcome it by attending to the words I heard .
Parsing [sent. 5714 len. 27]: Then , very strangely , I seemed to hear them , not in the reader 's voice , but in the well-remembered voice of my godmother .
Parsing [sent. 5715 len. 16]: This made me think , did Lady Dedlock 's face accidentally resemble my godmother 's ?
Parsing [sent. 5716 len. 56]: It might be that it did , a little ; but the expression was so different , and the stern decision which had worn into my godmother 's face , like weather into rocks , was so completely wanting in the face before me that it could not be that resemblance which had struck me .
Parsing [sent. 5717 len. 21]: Neither did I know the loftiness and haughtiness of Lady Dedlock 's face , at all , in any one .
Parsing [sent. 5718 len. 74]: And yet I -- I , little Esther Summerson , the child who lived a life apart and on whose birthday there was no rejoicing -- seemed to arise before my own eyes , evoked out of the past by some power in this fashionable lady , whom I not only entertained no fancy that I had ever seen , but whom I perfectly well knew I had never seen until that hour .
Parsing [sent. 5719 len. 54]: It made me tremble so to be thrown into this unaccountable agitation that I was conscious of being distressed even by the observation of the French maid , though I knew she had been looking watchfully here , and there , and everywhere , from the moment of her coming into the church .
Parsing [sent. 5720 len. 15]: By degrees , though very slowly , I at last overcame my strange emotion .
Parsing [sent. 5721 len. 12]: After a long time , I looked towards Lady Dedlock again .
Parsing [sent. 5722 len. 13]: It was while they were preparing to sing , before the sermon .
Parsing [sent. 5723 len. 16]: She took no heed of me , and the beating at my heart was gone .
Parsing [sent. 5724 len. 26]: Neither did it revive for more than a few moments when she once or twice afterwards glanced at Ada or at me through her glass .
Parsing [sent. 5725 len. 49]: The service being concluded , Sir Leicester gave his arm with much taste and gallantry to Lady Dedlock -- though he was obliged to walk by the help of a thick stick -- and escorted her out of church to the pony carriage in which they had come .
Parsing [sent. 5726 len. 40]: The servants then dispersed , and so did the congregation , whom Sir Leicester had contemplated all along -LRB- Mr. Skimpole said to Mr. Boythorn 's infinite delight -RRB- as if he were a considerable landed proprietor in heaven .
Parsing [sent. 5727 len. 7]: `` He believes he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5728 len. 4]: said Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 5729 len. 6]: `` He firmly believes it .
Parsing [sent. 5730 len. 14]: So did his father , and his grandfather , and his great-grandfather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5731 len. 30]: `` Do you know , '' pursued Mr. Skimpole very unexpectedly to Mr. Boythorn , `` it 's agreeable to me to see a man of that sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 5732 len. 5]: `` IS it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5733 len. 4]: said Mr. Boytborn .
Parsing [sent. 5734 len. 14]: `` Say that he wants to patronize me , '' pursued Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 5735 len. 4]: `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 5736 len. 6]: I do n't object . ''
Parsing [sent. 5737 len. 12]: `` I do , '' said Mr. Boythorn with great vigour .
Parsing [sent. 5738 len. 6]: `` Do you really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5739 len. 9]: returned Mr. Skimpole in his easy light vein .
Parsing [sent. 5740 len. 9]: `` But that 's taking trouble , surely .
Parsing [sent. 5741 len. 7]: And why should you take trouble ?
Parsing [sent. 5742 len. 20]: Here am I , content to receive things childishly as they fall out , and I never take trouble !
Parsing [sent. 5743 len. 17]: I come down here , for instance , and I find a mighty potentate exacting homage .
Parsing [sent. 5744 len. 3]: Very well !
Parsing [sent. 5745 len. 11]: I say ` Mighty potentate , here IS my homage !
Parsing [sent. 5746 len. 11]: It 's easier to give it than to withhold it .
Parsing [sent. 5747 len. 4]: Here it is .
Parsing [sent. 5748 len. 41]: If you have anything of an agreeable nature to show me , I shall be happy to see it ; if you have anything of an agreeable nature to give me , I shall be happy to accept it . '
Parsing [sent. 5749 len. 13]: Mighty potentate replies in effect , ` This is a sensible fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5750 len. 12]: I find him accord with my digestion and my bilious system .
Parsing [sent. 5751 len. 20]: He does n't impose upon me the necessity of rolling myself up like a hedgehog with my points outward .
Parsing [sent. 5752 len. 28]: I expand , I open , I turn my silver lining outward like Milton 's cloud , and it 's more agreeable to both of us . '
Parsing [sent. 5753 len. 14]: That 's my view of such things , speaking as a child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5754 len. 30]: `` But suppose you went down somewhere else to-morrow , '' said Mr. Boythorn , `` where there was the opposite of that fellow -- or of this fellow .
Parsing [sent. 5755 len. 4]: How then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5756 len. 5]: `` How then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5757 len. 13]: said Mr. Skimpole with an appearance of the utmost simplicity and candour .
Parsing [sent. 5758 len. 6]: `` Just the same then !
Parsing [sent. 5759 len. 32]: I should say , ` My esteemed Boythorn ' -- to make you the personification of our imaginary friend -- ` my esteemed Boythorn , you object to the mighty potentate ?
Parsing [sent. 5760 len. 3]: Very good .
Parsing [sent. 5761 len. 34]: So do I. I take it that my business in the social system is to be agreeable ; I take it that everybody 's business in the social system is to be agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 5762 len. 10]: It 's a system of harmony , in short .
Parsing [sent. 5763 len. 8]: Therefore if you object , I object .
Parsing [sent. 5764 len. 13]: Now , excellent Boythorn , let us go to dinner ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5765 len. 33]: `` But excellent Boythorn might say , '' returned our host , swelling and growing very red , `` I 'll be -- '' `` I understand , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 5766 len. 8]: `` Very likely he would . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 5767 len. 9]: -- if I WILL go to dinner ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5768 len. 17]: cried Mr. Boythorn in a violent burst and stopping to strike his stick upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 5769 len. 22]: `` And he would probably add , ` Is there such a thing as principle , Mr. Harold Skimpole ? ' ''
Parsing [sent. 5770 len. 37]: `` To which Harold Skimpole would reply , you know , '' he returned in his gayest manner and with his most ingenuous smile , '' ` Upon my life I have not the least idea !
Parsing [sent. 5771 len. 23]: I do n't know what it is you call by that name , or where it is , or who possesses it .
Parsing [sent. 5772 len. 18]: If you possess it and find it comfortable , I am quite delighted and congratulate you heartily .
Parsing [sent. 5773 len. 34]: But I know nothing about it , I assure you ; for I am a mere child , and I lay no claim to it , and I do n't want it ! '
Parsing [sent. 5774 len. 17]: So , you see , excellent Boythorn and I would go to dinner after all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5775 len. 39]: This was one of many little dialogues between them which I always expected to end , and which I dare say would have ended under other circumstances , in some violent explosion on the part of our host .
Parsing [sent. 5776 len. 50]: But he had so high a sense of his hospitable and responsible position as our entertainer , and my guardian laughed so sincerely at and with Mr. Skimpole , as a child who blew bubbles and broke them all day long , that matters never went beyond this point .
Parsing [sent. 5777 len. 86]: Mr. Skimpole , who always seemed quite unconscious of having been on delicate ground , then betook himself to beginning some sketch in the park which be never finished , or to playing fragments of airs on the piano , or to singing scraps of songs , or to lying down on his back under a tree and looking at the sky -- which he could n't help thinking , he said , was what he was meant for ; it suited him so exactly .
Parsing [sent. 5778 len. 22]: `` Enterprise and effort , '' he would say to us -LRB- on his back -RRB- , are delightful to me .
Parsing [sent. 5779 len. 7]: I believe I am truly cosmopolitan .
Parsing [sent. 5780 len. 8]: I have the deepest sympathy with them .
Parsing [sent. 5781 len. 30]: I lie in a shady place like this and think of adventurous spirits going to the North Pole or penetrating to the heart of the Torrid Zone with admiration .
Parsing [sent. 5782 len. 19]: Mercenary creatures ask , ` What is the use of a man 's going to the North Pole ?
Parsing [sent. 5783 len. 7]: What good does it do ? '
Parsing [sent. 5784 len. 36]: I ca n't say ; but , for anything I CAN say , he may go for the purpose -- though he do n't know it -- of employing my thoughts as I lie here .
Parsing [sent. 5785 len. 5]: Take an extreme case .
Parsing [sent. 5786 len. 10]: Take the case of the slaves on American plantations .
Parsing [sent. 5787 len. 18]: I dare say they are worked hard , I dare say they do n't altogether like it .
Parsing [sent. 5788 len. 41]: I dare say theirs is an unpleasant experience on the whole ; but they people the landscape for me , they give it a poetry for me , and perhaps that is one of the pleasanter objects of their existence .
Parsing [sent. 5789 len. 21]: I am very sensible of it , if it be , and I should n't wonder if it were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5790 len. 31]: I always wondered on these occasions whether he ever thought of Mrs. Skimpole and the children , and in what point of view they presented themselves to his cosmopolitan mind .
Parsing [sent. 5791 len. 14]: So far as I could understand , they rarely presented themselves at all .
Parsing [sent. 5792 len. 81]: The week had gone round to the Saturday following that beating of my heart in the church ; and every day had been so bright and blue that to ramble in the woods , and to see the light striking down among the transparent leaves and sparkling in the beautiful interlacings of the shadows of the trees , while the birds poured out their songs and the air was drowsy with the hum of insects , had been most delightful .
Parsing [sent. 5793 len. 30]: We had one favourite spot , deep in moss and last year 's leaves , where there were some felled trees from which the bark was all stripped off .
Parsing [sent. 5794 len. 64]: Seated among these , we looked through a green vista supported by thousands of natural columns , the whitened stems of trees , upon a distant prospect made so radiant by its contrast with the shade in which we sat and made so precious by the arched perspective through which we saw it that it was like a glimpse of the better land .
Parsing [sent. 5795 len. 33]: Upon the Saturday we sat here , Mr. Jarndyce , Ada , and I , until we heard thunder muttering in the distance and felt the large raindrops rattle through the leaves .
Parsing [sent. 5796 len. 61]: The weather had been all the week extremely sultry , but the storm broke so suddenly -- upon us , at least , in that sheltered spot -- that before we reached the outskirts of the wood the thunder and lightning were frequent and the rain came plunging through the leaves as if every drop were a great leaden bead .
Parsing [sent. 5797 len. 51]: As it was not a time for standing among trees , we ran out of the wood , and up and down the moss-grown steps which crossed the plantation-fence like two broad-staved ladders placed back to back , and made for a keeper 's lodge which was close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 5798 len. 55]: We had often noticed the dark beauty of this lodge standing in a deep twilight of trees , and how the ivy clustered over it , and how there was a steep hollow near , where we had once seen the keeper 's dog dive down into the fern as if it were water .
Parsing [sent. 5799 len. 39]: The lodge was so dark within , now the sky was overcast , that we only clearly saw the man who came to the door when we took shelter there and put two chairs for Ada and me .
Parsing [sent. 5800 len. 18]: The lattice-windows were all thrown open , and we sat just within the doorway watching the storm .
Parsing [sent. 5801 len. 89]: It was grand to see how the wind awoke , and bent the trees , and drove the rain before it like a cloud of smoke ; and to hear the solemn thunder and to see the lightning ; and while thinking with awe of the tremendous powers by which our little lives are encompassed , to consider how beneficent they are and how upon the smallest flower and leaf there was already a freshness poured from all this seeming rage which seemed to make creation new again .
Parsing [sent. 5802 len. 14]: `` Is it not dangerous to sit in so exposed a place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5803 len. 9]: `` Oh , no , Esther dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5804 len. 4]: said Ada quietly .
Parsing [sent. 5805 len. 12]: Ada said it to me , but I had not spoken .
Parsing [sent. 5806 len. 9]: The beating of my heart came back again .
Parsing [sent. 5807 len. 25]: I had never heard the voice , as I had never seen the face , but it affected me in the same strange way .
Parsing [sent. 5808 len. 16]: Again , in a moment , there arose before my mind innumerable pictures of myself .
Parsing [sent. 5809 len. 21]: Lady Dedlock had taken shelter in the lodge before our arrival there and had come out of the gloom within .
Parsing [sent. 5810 len. 11]: She stood behind my chair with her hand upon it .
Parsing [sent. 5811 len. 16]: I saw her with her hand close to my shoulder when I turned my head .
Parsing [sent. 5812 len. 7]: `` I have frightened you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5813 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 5814 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5815 len. 5]: It was not fright .
Parsing [sent. 5816 len. 6]: Why should I be frightened !
Parsing [sent. 5817 len. 24]: `` I believe , '' said Lady Dedlock to my guardian , `` I have the pleasure of speaking to Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 5818 len. 21]: `` Your remembrance does me more honour than I had supposed it would , Lady Dedlock , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5819 len. 9]: `` I recognized you in church on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 5820 len. 41]: I am sorry that any local disputes of Sir Leicester 's -- they are not of his seeking , however , I believe -- should render it a matter of some absurd difficulty to show you any attention here . ''
Parsing [sent. 5821 len. 23]: `` I am aware of the circumstances , '' returned my guardian with a smile , `` and am sufficiently obliged . ''
Parsing [sent. 5822 len. 30]: She had given him her hand in an indifferent way that seemed habitual to her and spoke in a correspondingly indifferent manner , though in a very pleasant voice .
Parsing [sent. 5823 len. 38]: She was as graceful as she was beautiful , perfectly self-possessed , and had the air , I thought , of being able to attract and interest any one if she had thought it worth her while .
Parsing [sent. 5824 len. 20]: The keeper had brought her a chair on which she sat in the middle of the porch between us .
Parsing [sent. 5825 len. 35]: `` Is the young gentleman disposed of whom you wrote to Sir Leicester about and whose wishes Sir Leicester was sorry not to have it in his power to advance in any way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5826 len. 9]: she said over her shoulder to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5827 len. 9]: `` I hope so , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 5828 len. 13]: She seemed to respect him and even to wish to conciliate him .
Parsing [sent. 5829 len. 39]: There was something very winning in her haughty manner , and it became more familiar -- I was going to say more easy , but that could hardly be -- as she spoke to him over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 5830 len. 13]: `` I presume this is your other ward , Miss Clare ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5831 len. 7]: He presented Ada , in form .
Parsing [sent. 5832 len. 37]: `` You will lose the disinterested part of your Don Quixote character , '' said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce over her shoulder again , `` if you only redress the wrongs of beauty like this .
Parsing [sent. 5833 len. 20]: But present me , '' and she turned full upon me , `` to this young lady too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5834 len. 13]: `` Miss Summerson really is my ward , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 5835 len. 13]: `` I am responsible to no Lord Chancellor in her case . ''
Parsing [sent. 5836 len. 10]: `` Has Miss Summerson lost both her parents ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5837 len. 4]: said my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 5838 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 5839 len. 10]: `` She is very fortunate in her guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 5840 len. 17]: Lady Dedlock looked at me , and I looked at her and said I was indeed .
Parsing [sent. 5841 len. 28]: All at once she turned from me with a hasty air , almost expressive of displeasure or dislike , and spoke to him over her shoulder again .
Parsing [sent. 5842 len. 17]: `` Ages have passed since we were in the habit of meeting , Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 5843 len. 5]: `` A long time .
Parsing [sent. 5844 len. 21]: At least I thought it was a long time , until I saw you last Sunday , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5845 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 5846 len. 17]: Even you are a courtier , or think it necessary to become one to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5847 len. 6]: she said with some disdain .
Parsing [sent. 5848 len. 11]: `` I have achieved that reputation , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 5849 len. 27]: `` You have achieved so much , Lady Dedlock , '' said my guardian , `` that you pay some little penalty , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 5850 len. 6]: But none to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5851 len. 5]: `` So much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5852 len. 6]: she repeated , slightly laughing .
Parsing [sent. 5853 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5854 len. 31]: With her air of superiority , and power , and fascination , and I know not what , she seemed to regard Ada and me as little more than children .
Parsing [sent. 5855 len. 35]: So , as she slightly laughed and afterwards sat looking at the rain , she was as self-possessed and as free to occupy herself with her own thoughts as if she had been alone .
Parsing [sent. 5856 len. 19]: `` I think you knew my sister when we were abroad together better than you know me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5857 len. 8]: she said , looking at him again .
Parsing [sent. 5858 len. 13]: `` Yes , we happened to meet oftener , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 5859 len. 25]: `` We went our several ways , '' said Lady Dedlock , `` and had little in common even before we agreed to differ .
Parsing [sent. 5860 len. 17]: It is to be regretted , I suppose , but it could not be helped . ''
Parsing [sent. 5861 len. 9]: Lady Dedlock again sat looking at the rain .
Parsing [sent. 5862 len. 10]: The storm soon began to pass upon its way .
Parsing [sent. 5863 len. 32]: The shower greatly abated , the lightning ceased , the thunder rolled among the distant hills , and the sun began to glisten on the wet leaves and the falling rain .
Parsing [sent. 5864 len. 21]: As we sat there , silently , we saw a little pony phaeton coming towards us at a merry pace .
Parsing [sent. 5865 len. 21]: `` The messenger is coming back , my Lady , '' said the keeper , `` with the carriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 5866 len. 14]: As it drove up , we saw that there were two people inside .
Parsing [sent. 5867 len. 41]: There alighted from it , with some cloaks and wrappers , first the Frenchwoman whom I had seen in church , and secondly the pretty girl , the Frenchwoman with a defiant confidence , the pretty girl confused and hesitating .
Parsing [sent. 5868 len. 5]: `` What now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5869 len. 4]: said Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 5870 len. 4]: `` Two ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5871 len. 18]: `` I am your maid , my Lady , at the present , '' said the Frenchwoman .
Parsing [sent. 5872 len. 9]: `` The message was for the attendant . ''
Parsing [sent. 5873 len. 18]: `` I was afraid you might mean me , my Lady , '' said the pretty girl .
Parsing [sent. 5874 len. 14]: `` I did mean you , child , '' replied her mistress calmly .
Parsing [sent. 5875 len. 8]: `` Put that shawl on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 5876 len. 20]: She slightly stooped her shoulders to receive it , and the pretty girl lightly dropped it in its place .
Parsing [sent. 5877 len. 14]: The Frenchwoman stood unnoticed , looking on with her lips very tightly set .
Parsing [sent. 5878 len. 25]: `` I am sorry , '' said Lady Dedlock to Mr. Jarndyce , `` that we are not likely to renew our former acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 5879 len. 14]: You will allow me to send the carriage back for your two wards .
Parsing [sent. 5880 len. 7]: It shall be here directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 5881 len. 51]: But as he would on no account accept this offer , she took a graceful leave of Ada -- none of me -- and put her hand upon his proffered arm , and got into the carriage , which was a little , low , park carriage with a hood .
Parsing [sent. 5882 len. 20]: `` Come in , child , '' she said to the pretty girl ; `` I shall want you .
Parsing [sent. 5883 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5884 len. 27]: The carriage rolled away , and the Frenchwoman , with the wrappers she had brought hanging over her arm , remained standing where she had alighted .
Parsing [sent. 5885 len. 25]: I suppose there is nothing pride can so little bear with as pride itself , and that she was punished for her imperious manner .
Parsing [sent. 5886 len. 11]: Her retaliation was the most singular I could have imagined .
Parsing [sent. 5887 len. 49]: She remained perfectly still until the carriage had turned into the drive , and then , without the least discomposure of countenance , slipped off her shoes , left them on the ground , and walked deliberately in the same direction through the wettest of the wet grass .
Parsing [sent. 5888 len. 8]: `` Is that young woman mad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5889 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5890 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5891 len. 15]: said the keeper , who , with his wife , was looking after her .
Parsing [sent. 5892 len. 9]: `` Hortense is not one of that sort .
Parsing [sent. 5893 len. 10]: She has as good a head-piece as the best .
Parsing [sent. 5894 len. 37]: But she 's mortal high and passionate -- powerful high and passionate ; and what with having notice to leave , and having others put above her , she do n't take kindly to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5895 len. 13]: `` But why should she walk shoeless through all that water ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5896 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 5897 len. 16]: `` Why , indeed , sir , unless it is to cool her down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5898 len. 4]: said the man .
Parsing [sent. 5899 len. 14]: `` Or unless she fancies it 's blood , '' said the woman .
Parsing [sent. 5900 len. 22]: `` She 'd as soon walk through that as anything else , I think , when her own 's up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5901 len. 12]: We passed not far from the house a few minutes afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 5902 len. 64]: Peaceful as it had looked when we first saw it , it looked even more so now , with a diamond spray glittering all about it , a light wind blowing , the birds no longer hushed but singing strongly , everything refreshed by the late rain , and the little carriage shining at the doorway like a fairy carriage made of silver .
Parsing [sent. 5903 len. 29]: Still , very steadfastly and quietly walking towards it , a peaceful figure too in the landscape , went Mademoiselle Hortense , shoeless , through the wet grass .
Parsing [sent. 5904 len. 17]: Chapter XIX -- Moving On It is the long vacation in the regions of Chancery Lane .
Parsing [sent. 5905 len. 29]: The good ships Law and Equity , those teak-built , copper-bottomed , iron-fastened , brazen-faced , and not by any means fast-sailing clippers are laid up in ordinary .
Parsing [sent. 5906 len. 33]: The Flying Dutchman , with a crew of ghostly clients imploring all whom they may encounter to peruse their papers , has drifted , for the time being , heaven knows where .
Parsing [sent. 5907 len. 16]: The courts are all shut up ; the public offices lie in a hot sleep .
Parsing [sent. 5908 len. 26]: Westminster Hall itself is a shady solitude where nightingales might sing , and a tenderer class of suitors than is usually found there , walk .
Parsing [sent. 5909 len. 66]: The Temple , Chancery Lane , Serjeants ' Inn , and Lincoln 's Inn even unto the Fields are like tidal harbours at low water , where stranded proceedings , offices at anchor , idle clerks lounging on lop-sided stools that will not recover their perpendicular until the current of Term sets in , lie high and dry upon the ooze of the long vacation .
Parsing [sent. 5910 len. 27]: Outer doors of chambers are shut up by the score , messages and parcels are to be left at the Porter 's Lodge by the bushel .
Parsing [sent. 5911 len. 57]: A crop of grass would grow in the chinks of the stone pavement outside Lincoln 's Inn Hall , but that the ticket-porters , who have nothing to do beyond sitting in the shade there , with their white aprons over their heads to keep the flies off , grub it up and eat it thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 5912 len. 8]: There is only one judge in town .
Parsing [sent. 5913 len. 12]: Even he only comes twice a week to sit in chambers .
Parsing [sent. 5914 len. 16]: If the country folks of those assize towns on his circuit could see him now !
Parsing [sent. 5915 len. 18]: No full-bottomed wig , no red petticoats , no fur , no javelin-men , no white wands .
Parsing [sent. 5916 len. 50]: Merely a close-shaved gentleman in white trousers and a white hat , with sea-bronze on the judicial countenance , and a strip of bark peeled by the solar rays from the judicial nose , who calls in at the shell-fish shop as he comes along and drinks iced ginger-beer !
Parsing [sent. 5917 len. 13]: The bar of England is scattered over the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 5918 len. 47]: How England can get on through four long summer months without its bar -- which is its acknowledged refuge in adversity and its only legitimate triumph in prosperity -- is beside the question ; assuredly that shield and buckler of Britannia are not in present wear .
Parsing [sent. 5919 len. 43]: The learned gentleman who is always so tremendously indignant at the unprecedented outrage committed on the feelings of his client by the opposite party that he never seems likely to recover it is doing infinitely better than might be expected in Switzerland .
Parsing [sent. 5920 len. 28]: The learned gentleman who does the withering business and who blights all opponents with his gloomy sarcasm is as merry as a grig at a French watering-place .
Parsing [sent. 5921 len. 21]: The learned gentleman who weeps by the pint on the smallest provocation has not shed a tear these six weeks .
Parsing [sent. 5922 len. 70]: The very learned gentleman who has cooled the natural heat of his gingery complexion in pools and fountains of law until he has become great in knotty arguments for term-time , when he poses the drowsy bench with legal `` chaff , '' inexplicable to the uninitiated and to most of the initiated too , is roaming , with a characteristic delight in aridity and dust , about Constantinople .
Parsing [sent. 5923 len. 43]: Other dispersed fragments of the same great palladium are to be found on the canals of Venice , at the second cataract of the Nile , in the baths of Germany , and sprinkled on the sea-sand all over the English coast .
Parsing [sent. 5924 len. 14]: Scarcely one is to be encountered in the deserted region of Chancery Lane .
Parsing [sent. 5925 len. 42]: If such a lonely member of the bar do flit across the waste and come upon a prowling suitor who is unable to leave off haunting the scenes of his anxiety , they frighten one another and retreat into opposite shades .
Parsing [sent. 5926 len. 11]: It is the hottest long vacation known for many years .
Parsing [sent. 5927 len. 32]: All the young clerks are madly in love , and according to their various degrees , pine for bliss with the beloved object , at Margate , Ramsgate , or Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 5928 len. 10]: All the middle-aged clerks think their families too large .
Parsing [sent. 5929 len. 27]: All the unowned dogs who stray into the Inns of Court and pant about staircases and other dry places seeking water give short howls of aggravation .
Parsing [sent. 5930 len. 20]: All the blind men 's dogs in the streets draw their masters against pumps or trip them over buckets .
Parsing [sent. 5931 len. 27]: A shop with a sun-blind , and a watered pavement , and a bowl of gold and silver fish in the window , is a sanctuary .
Parsing [sent. 5932 len. 32]: Temple Bar gets so hot that it is , to the adjacent Strand and Fleet Street , what a heater is in an urn , and keeps them simmering all night .
Parsing [sent. 5933 len. 41]: There are offices about the Inns of Court in which a man might be cool , if any coolness were worth purchasing at such a price in dullness ; but the little thoroughfares immediately outside those retirements seem to blaze .
Parsing [sent. 5934 len. 50]: In Mr. Krook 's court , it is so hot that the people turn their houses inside out and sit in chairs upon the pavement -- Mr. Krook included , who there pursues his studies , with his cat -LRB- who never is too hot -RRB- by his side .
Parsing [sent. 5935 len. 61]: The Sol 's Arms has discontinued the Harmonic Meetings for the season , and Little Swills is engaged at the Pastoral Gardens down the river , where he comes out in quite an innocent manner and sings comic ditties of a juvenile complexion calculated -LRB- as the bill says -RRB- not to wound the feelings of the most fastidious mind .
Parsing [sent. 5936 len. 27]: Over all the legal neighbourhood there hangs , like some great veil of rust or gigantic cobweb , the idleness and pensiveness of the long vacation .
Parsing [sent. 5937 len. 39]: Mr. Snagsby , law-stationer of Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , is sensible of the influence not only in his mind as a sympathetic and contemplative man , but also in his business as a law-stationer aforesaid .
Parsing [sent. 5938 len. 59]: He has more leisure for musing in Staple Inn and in the Rolls Yard during the long vacation than at other seasons , and he says to the two ` prentices , what a thing it is in such hot weather to think that you live in an island with the sea a-rolling and a-bowling right round you .
Parsing [sent. 5939 len. 29]: Guster is busy in the little drawing-room on this present afternoon in the long vacation , when Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby have it in contemplation to receive company .
Parsing [sent. 5940 len. 18]: The expected guests are rather select than numerous , being Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and no more .
Parsing [sent. 5941 len. 49]: From Mr. Chadband 's being much given to describe himself , both verbally and in writing , as a vessel , he is occasionally mistaken by strangers for a gentleman connected with navigation , but he is , as he expresses it , `` in the ministry . ''
Parsing [sent. 5942 len. 59]: Mr. Chadband is attached to no particular denomination and is considered by his persecutors to have nothing so very remarkable to say on the greatest of subjects as to render his volunteering , on his own account , at all incumbent on his conscience ; but he has his followers , and Mrs. Snagsby is of the number .
Parsing [sent. 5943 len. 35]: Mrs. Snagsby has but recently taken a passage upward by the vessel , Chadband ; and her attention was attracted to that Bark A 1 when she was something flushed by the hot weather .
Parsing [sent. 5944 len. 29]: `` My little woman , '' says Mr. Snagsby to the sparrows in Staple Inn , `` likes to have her religion rather sharp , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5945 len. 43]: So Guster , much impressed by regarding herself for the time as the handmaid of Chadband , whom she knows to be endowed with the gift of holding forth for four hours at a stretch , prepares the little drawing-room for tea .
Parsing [sent. 5946 len. 89]: All the furniture is shaken and dusted , the portraits of Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are touched up with a wet cloth , the best tea-service is set forth , and there is excellent provision made of dainty new bread , crusty twists , cool fresh butter , thin slices of ham , tongue , and German sausage , and delicate little rows of anchovies nestling in parsley , not to mention new-laid eggs , to be brought up warm in a napkin , and hot buttered toast .
Parsing [sent. 5947 len. 31]: For Chadband is rather a consuming vessel -- the persecutors say a gorging vessel -- and can wield such weapons of the flesh as a knife and fork remarkably well .
Parsing [sent. 5948 len. 47]: Mr. Snagsby in his best coat , looking at all the preparations when they are completed and coughing his cough of deference behind his hand , says to Mrs. Snagsby , `` At what time did you expect Mr. and Mrs. Chadband , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5949 len. 9]: `` At six , '' says Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 5950 len. 17]: Mr. Snagsby observes in a mild and casual way that `` it 's gone that . ''
Parsing [sent. 5951 len. 18]: `` Perhaps you 'd like to begin without them , '' is Mrs. Snagsby 's reproachful remark .
Parsing [sent. 5952 len. 31]: Mr. Snagsby does look as if he would like it very much , but he says , with his cough of mildness , `` No , my dear , no .
Parsing [sent. 5953 len. 7]: I merely named the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 5954 len. 15]: `` What 's time , '' says Mrs. Snagsby , `` to eternity ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5955 len. 12]: `` Very true , my dear , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 5956 len. 25]: `` Only when a person lays in victuals for tea , a person does it with a view -- perhaps -- more to time .
Parsing [sent. 5957 len. 20]: And when a time is named for having tea , it 's better to come up to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 5958 len. 8]: `` To come up to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5959 len. 6]: Mrs. Snagsby repeats with severity .
Parsing [sent. 5960 len. 5]: `` Up to it !
Parsing [sent. 5961 len. 9]: As if Mr. Chadband was a fighter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5962 len. 13]: `` Not at all , my dear , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 5963 len. 46]: Here , Guster , who had been looking out of the bedroom window , comes rustling and scratching down the little staircase like a popular ghost , and falling flushed into the drawing-room , announces that Mr. and Mrs. Chadband have appeared in the court .
Parsing [sent. 5964 len. 38]: The bell at the inner door in the passage immediately thereafter tinkling , she is admonished by Mrs. Snagsby , on pain of instant reconsignment to her patron saint , not to omit the ceremony of announcement .
Parsing [sent. 5965 len. 43]: Much discomposed in her nerves -LRB- which were previously in the best order -RRB- by this threat , she so fearfully mutilates that point of state as to announce `` Mr. and Mrs. Cheeseming , least which , Imeantersay , whatsername ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5966 len. 7]: and retires conscience-stricken from the presence .
Parsing [sent. 5967 len. 27]: Mr. Chadband is a large yellow man with a fat smile and a general appearance of having a good deal of train oil in his system .
Parsing [sent. 5968 len. 11]: Mrs. Chadband is a stern , severe-looking , silent woman .
Parsing [sent. 5969 len. 19]: Mr. Chadband moves softly and cumbrously , not unlike a bear who has been taught to walk upright .
Parsing [sent. 5970 len. 58]: He is very much embarrassed about the arms , as if they were inconvenient to him and he wanted to grovel , is very much in a perspiration about the head , and never speaks without first putting up his great hand , as delivering a token to his hearers that he is going to edify them .
Parsing [sent. 5971 len. 16]: `` My friends , '' says Mr. Chadband , `` peace be on this house !
Parsing [sent. 5972 len. 21]: On the master thereof , on the mistress thereof , on the young maidens , and on the young men !
Parsing [sent. 5973 len. 10]: My friends , why do I wish for peace ?
Parsing [sent. 5974 len. 4]: What is peace ?
Parsing [sent. 5975 len. 4]: Is it war ?
Parsing [sent. 5976 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5977 len. 4]: Is it strife ?
Parsing [sent. 5978 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 5979 len. 19]: Is it lovely , and gentle , and beautiful , and pleasant , and serene , and joyful ?
Parsing [sent. 5980 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 5981 len. 17]: Therefore , my friends , I wish for peace , upon you and upon yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 5982 len. 26]: In consequence of Mrs. Snagsby looking deeply edified , Mr. Snagsby thinks it expedient on the whole to say amen , which is well received .
Parsing [sent. 5983 len. 24]: `` Now , my friends , '' proceeds Mr. Chadband , `` since I am upon this theme -- '' Guster presents herself .
Parsing [sent. 5984 len. 26]: Mrs. Snagsby , in a spectral bass voice and without removing her eyes from Chadband , says with dreadful distinctness , `` Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5985 len. 42]: `` Now , my friends , '' says Chadband , `` since I am upon this theme , and in my lowly path improving it -- '' Guster is heard unaccountably to murmur `` one thousing seven hundred and eighty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 5986 len. 12]: The spectral voice repeats more solemnly , `` Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5987 len. 34]: `` Now , my friends , '' says Mr. Chadband , `` we will inquire in a spirit of love -- '' Still Guster reiterates `` one thousing seven hundred and eighty-two . ''
Parsing [sent. 5988 len. 34]: Mr. Chadband , pausing with the resignation of a man accustomed to be persecuted and languidly folding up his chin into his fat smile , says , `` Let us hear the maiden !
Parsing [sent. 5989 len. 5]: Speak , maiden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5990 len. 14]: `` One thousing seven hundred and eighty-two , if you please , sir .
Parsing [sent. 5991 len. 17]: Which he wish to know what the shilling ware for , '' says Guster , breathless .
Parsing [sent. 5992 len. 4]: `` For ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5993 len. 4]: returns Mrs. Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 5994 len. 6]: `` For his fare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5995 len. 17]: Guster replied that `` he insistes on one and eightpence or on summonsizzing the party . ''
Parsing [sent. 5996 len. 24]: Mrs. Snagsby and Mrs. Chadband are proceeding to grow shrill in indignation when Mr. Chadband quiets the tumult by lifting up his hand .
Parsing [sent. 5997 len. 16]: `` My friends , '' says he , `` I remember a duty unfulfilled yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 5998 len. 12]: It is right that I should be chastened in some penalty .
Parsing [sent. 5999 len. 6]: I ought not to murmur .
Parsing [sent. 6000 len. 7]: Rachael , pay the eightpence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6001 len. 26]: While Mrs. Snagsby , drawing her breath , looks hard at Mr. Snagsby , as who should say , `` You hear this apostle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6002 len. 17]: and while Mr. Chadband glows with humility and train oil , Mrs. Chadband pays the money .
Parsing [sent. 6003 len. 42]: It is Mr. Chadband 's habit -- it is the head and front of his pretensions indeed -- to keep this sort of debtor and creditor account in the smallest items and to post it publicly on the most trivial occasions .
Parsing [sent. 6004 len. 32]: `` My friends , '' says Chadband , `` eightpence is not much ; it might justly have been one and fourpence ; it might justly have been half a crown .
Parsing [sent. 6005 len. 8]: O let us be joyful , joyful !
Parsing [sent. 6006 len. 7]: O let us be joyful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6007 len. 35]: With which remark , which appears from its sound to be an extract in verse , Mr. Chadband stalks to the table , and before taking a chair , lifts up his admonitory hand .
Parsing [sent. 6008 len. 22]: `` My friends , '' says he , `` what is this which we now behold as being spread before us ?
Parsing [sent. 6009 len. 2]: Refreshment .
Parsing [sent. 6010 len. 9]: Do we need refreshment then , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 6011 len. 3]: We do .
Parsing [sent. 6012 len. 10]: And why do we need refreshment , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 6013 len. 28]: Because we are but mortal , because we are but sinful , because we are but of the earth , because we are not of the air .
Parsing [sent. 6014 len. 7]: Can we fly , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 6015 len. 4]: We can not .
Parsing [sent. 6016 len. 10]: Why can we not fly , my friends ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6017 len. 28]: Mr. Snagsby , presuming on the success of his last point , ventures to observe in a cheerful and rather knowing tone , `` No wings . ''
Parsing [sent. 6018 len. 9]: But is immediately frowned down by Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 6019 len. 28]: `` I say , my friends , '' pursues Mr. Chadband , utterly rejecting and obliterating Mr. Snagsby 's suggestion , `` why can we not fly ?
Parsing [sent. 6020 len. 9]: Is it because we are calculated to walk ?
Parsing [sent. 6021 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 6022 len. 10]: Could we walk , my friends , without strength ?
Parsing [sent. 6023 len. 4]: We could not .
Parsing [sent. 6024 len. 10]: What should we do without strength , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 6025 len. 28]: Our legs would refuse to bear us , our knees would double up , our ankles would turn over , and we should come to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6026 len. 26]: Then from whence , my friends , in a human point of view , do we derive the strength that is necessary to our limbs ?
Parsing [sent. 6027 len. 60]: Is it , '' says Chadband , glancing over the table , `` from bread in various forms , from butter which is churned from the milk which is yielded unto us by the cow , from the eggs which are laid by the fowl , from ham , from tongue , from sausage , and from such like ?
Parsing [sent. 6028 len. 3]: It is .
Parsing [sent. 6029 len. 15]: Then let us partake of the good things which are set before us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6030 len. 27]: The persecutors denied that there was any particular gift in Mr. Chadband 's piling verbose flights of stairs , one upon another , after this fashion .
Parsing [sent. 6031 len. 36]: But this can only be received as a proof of their determination to persecute , since it must be within everybody 's experience that the Chadband style of oratory is widely received and much admired .
Parsing [sent. 6032 len. 24]: Mr. Chadband , however , having concluded for the present , sits down at Mr. Snagsby 's table and lays about him prodigiously .
Parsing [sent. 6033 len. 64]: The conversion of nutriment of any sort into oil of the quality already mentioned appears to be a process so inseparable from the constitution of this exemplary vessel that in beginning to eat and drink , he may be described as always becoming a kind of considerable oil mills or other large factory for the production of that article on a wholesale scale .
Parsing [sent. 6034 len. 38]: On the present evening of the long vacation , in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , he does such a powerful stroke of business that the warehouse appears to be quite full when the works cease .
Parsing [sent. 6035 len. 78]: At this period of the entertainment , Guster , who has never recovered her first failure , but has neglected no possible or impossible means of bringing the establishment and herself into contempt -- among which may be briefly enumerated her unexpectedly performing clashing military music on Mr. Chadband 's head with plates , and afterwards crowning that gentleman with muffins -- at which period of the entertainment , Guster whispers Mr. Snagsby that he is wanted .
Parsing [sent. 6036 len. 42]: `` And being wanted in the -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- in the shop , '' says Mr. Snagsby , rising , `` perhaps this good company will excuse me for half a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 6037 len. 24]: Mr. Snagsby descends and finds the two ` prentices intently contemplating a police constable , who holds a ragged boy by the arm .
Parsing [sent. 6038 len. 19]: `` Why , bless my heart , '' says Mr. Snagsby , `` what 's the matter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6039 len. 45]: `` This boy , '' says the constable , `` although he 's repeatedly told to , wo n't move on -- '' `` I 'm always a-moving on , sar , cries the boy , wiping away his grimy tears with his arm .
Parsing [sent. 6040 len. 16]: `` I 've always been a-moving and a-moving on , ever since I was born .
Parsing [sent. 6041 len. 16]: Where can I possibly move to , sir , more nor I do move ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6042 len. 49]: `` He wo n't move on , '' says the constable calmly , with a slight professional hitch of his neck involving its better settlement in his stiff stock , `` although he has been repeatedly cautioned , and therefore I am obliged to take him into custody .
Parsing [sent. 6043 len. 11]: He 's as obstinate a young gonoph as I know .
Parsing [sent. 6044 len. 7]: He WO N'T move on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6045 len. 6]: `` Oh , my eye !
Parsing [sent. 6046 len. 7]: Where can I move to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6047 len. 24]: cries the boy , clutching quite desperately at his hair and beating his bare feet upon the floor of Mr. Snagsby 's passage .
Parsing [sent. 6048 len. 19]: `` Do n't you come none of that or I shall make blessed short work of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6049 len. 10]: says the constable , giving him a passionless shake .
Parsing [sent. 6050 len. 11]: `` My instructions are that you are to move on .
Parsing [sent. 6051 len. 10]: I have told you so five hundred times . ''
Parsing [sent. 6052 len. 5]: `` But where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6053 len. 4]: cries the boy .
Parsing [sent. 6054 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 6055 len. 35]: Really , constable , you know , '' says Mr. Snagsby wistfully , and coughing behind his hand his cough of great perplexity and doubt , `` really , that does seem a question .
Parsing [sent. 6056 len. 6]: Where , you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6057 len. 14]: `` My instructions do n't go to that , '' replies the constable .
Parsing [sent. 6058 len. 13]: `` My instructions are that this boy is to move on . ''
Parsing [sent. 6059 len. 6]: Do you hear , Jo ?
Parsing [sent. 6060 len. 36]: It is nothing to you or to any one else that the great lights of the parliamentary sky have failed for some few years in this business to set you the example of moving on .
Parsing [sent. 6061 len. 25]: The one grand recipe remains for you -- the profound philosophical prescription -- the be-all and the end-all of your strange existence upon earth .
Parsing [sent. 6062 len. 3]: Move on !
Parsing [sent. 6063 len. 23]: You are by no means to move off , Jo , for the great lights ca n't at all agree about that .
Parsing [sent. 6064 len. 3]: Move on !
Parsing [sent. 6065 len. 28]: Mr. Snagsby says nothing to this effect , says nothing at all indeed , but coughs his forlornest cough , expressive of no thoroughfare in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 6066 len. 21]: By this time Mr. and Mrs. Chadband and Mrs. Snagsby , hearing the altercation , have appeared upon the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6067 len. 16]: Guster having never left the end of the passage , the whole household are assembled .
Parsing [sent. 6068 len. 20]: `` The simple question is , sir , '' says the constable , `` whether you know this boy .
Parsing [sent. 6069 len. 6]: He says you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 6070 len. 18]: Mrs. Snagsby , from her elevation , instantly cries out , `` No he do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6071 len. 6]: `` My lit-tle woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6072 len. 9]: says Mr. Snagsby , looking up the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 6073 len. 7]: `` My love , permit me !
Parsing [sent. 6074 len. 10]: Pray have a moment 's patience , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 6075 len. 34]: I do know something of this lad , and in what I know of him , I ca n't say that there 's any harm ; perhaps on the contrary , constable . ''
Parsing [sent. 6076 len. 16]: To whom the law-stationer relates his Joful and woful experience , suppressing the half-crown fact .
Parsing [sent. 6077 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6078 len. 19]: says the constable , `` so far , it seems , he had grounds for what he said .
Parsing [sent. 6079 len. 16]: When I took him into custody up in Holborn , he said you knew him .
Parsing [sent. 6080 len. 39]: Upon that , a young man who was in the crowd said he was acquainted with you , and you were a respectable housekeeper , and if I 'd call and make the inquiry , he 'd appear .
Parsing [sent. 6081 len. 16]: The young man do n't seem inclined to keep his word , but -- Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6082 len. 7]: Here IS the young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6083 len. 25]: Enter Mr. Guppy , who nods to Mr. Snagsby and touches his hat with the chivalry of clerkship to the ladies on the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6084 len. 47]: `` I was strolling away from the office just now when I found this row going on , '' says Mr. Guppy to the law-stationer , `` and as your name was mentioned , I thought it was right the thing should be looked into . ''
Parsing [sent. 6085 len. 24]: `` It was very good-natured of you , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby , `` and I am obliged to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6086 len. 14]: And Mr. Snagsby again relates his experience , again suppressing the half-crown fact .
Parsing [sent. 6087 len. 19]: `` Now , I know where you live , '' says the constable , then , to Jo .
Parsing [sent. 6088 len. 10]: `` You live down in Tom-all -- Alone 's .
Parsing [sent. 6089 len. 15]: That 's a nice innocent place to live in , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6090 len. 18]: `` I ca n't go and live in no nicer place , sir , '' replies Jo .
Parsing [sent. 6091 len. 24]: `` They would n't have nothink to say to me if I wos to go to a nice innocent place fur to live .
Parsing [sent. 6092 len. 20]: Who ud go and let a nice innocent lodging to such a reg ` lar one as me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6093 len. 11]: `` You are very poor , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6094 len. 4]: says the constable .
Parsing [sent. 6095 len. 20]: `` Yes , I am indeed , sir , wery poor in gin ` ral , '' replies Jo .
Parsing [sent. 6096 len. 8]: `` I leave you to judge now !
Parsing [sent. 6097 len. 30]: I shook these two half-crowns out of him , '' says the constable , producing them to the company , `` in only putting my hand upon him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6098 len. 77]: `` They 're wot 's left , Mr. Snagsby , '' says Jo , `` out of a sov-ring as wos give me by a lady in a wale as sed she wos a servant and as come to my crossin one night and asked to be showd this ` ere ` ouse and the ` ouse wot him as you giv the writin to died at , and the berrin-ground wot he 's berrid in .
Parsing [sent. 6099 len. 16]: She ses to me she ses ` are you the boy at the inkwhich ? '
Parsing [sent. 6100 len. 3]: she ses .
Parsing [sent. 6101 len. 8]: I ses ` yes ' I ses .
Parsing [sent. 6102 len. 16]: She ses to me she ses ` can you show me all them places ? '
Parsing [sent. 6103 len. 10]: I ses ` yes I can ' I ses .
Parsing [sent. 6104 len. 25]: And she ses to me ` do it ' and I dun it and she giv me a sov ` ring and hooked it .
Parsing [sent. 6105 len. 82]: And I a n't had much of the sov ` ring neither , '' says Jo , with dirty tears , `` fur I had to pay five bob , down in Tom-all -- Alone 's , afore they 'd square it fur to give me change , and then a young man he thieved another five while I was asleep and another boy he thieved ninepence and the landlord he stood drains round with a lot more on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6106 len. 21]: `` You do n't expect anybody to believe this , about the lady and the sovereign , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6107 len. 11]: says the constable , eyeing him aside with ineffable disdain .
Parsing [sent. 6108 len. 15]: `` I do n't know as I do , sir , '' replies Jo .
Parsing [sent. 6109 len. 25]: `` I do n't expect nothink at all , sir , much , but that 's the true hist ` ry on it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6110 len. 8]: `` You see what he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6111 len. 7]: the constable observes to the audience .
Parsing [sent. 6112 len. 25]: `` Well , Mr. Snagsby , if I do n't lock him up this time , will you engage for his moving on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6113 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6114 len. 7]: cries Mrs. Snagsby from the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 6115 len. 6]: `` My little woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6116 len. 4]: pleads her husband .
Parsing [sent. 6117 len. 12]: `` Constable , I have no doubt he 'll move on .
Parsing [sent. 6118 len. 13]: You know you really must do it , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 6119 len. 14]: `` I 'm everyways agreeable , sir , '' says the hapless Jo .
Parsing [sent. 6120 len. 11]: `` Do it , then , '' observes the constable .
Parsing [sent. 6121 len. 10]: `` You know what you have got to do .
Parsing [sent. 6122 len. 3]: Do it !
Parsing [sent. 6123 len. 12]: And recollect you wo n't get off so easy next time .
Parsing [sent. 6124 len. 6]: Catch hold of your money .
Parsing [sent. 6125 len. 17]: Now , the sooner you 're five mile off , the better for all parties . ''
Parsing [sent. 6126 len. 61]: With this farewell hint and pointing generally to the setting sun as a likely place to move on to , the constable bids his auditors good afternoon and makes the echoes of Cook 's Court perform slow music for him as he walks away on the shady side , carrying his iron-bound hat in his hand for a little ventilation .
Parsing [sent. 6127 len. 24]: Now , Jo 's improbable story concerning the lady and the sovereign has awakened more or less the curiosity of all the company .
Parsing [sent. 6128 len. 84]: Mr. Guppy , who has an inquiring mind in matters of evidence and who has been suffering severely from the lassitude of the long vacation , takes that interest in the case that he enters on a regular cross-examination of the witness , which is found so interesting by the ladies that Mrs. Snagsby politely invites him to step upstairs and drink a cup of tea , if he will excuse the disarranged state of the tea-table , consequent on their previous exertions .
Parsing [sent. 6129 len. 61]: Mr. Guppy yielding his assent to this proposal , Jo is requested to follow into the drawing-room doorway , where Mr. Guppy takes him in hand as a witness , patting him into this shape , that shape , and the other shape like a butterman dealing with so much butter , and worrying him according to the best models .
Parsing [sent. 6130 len. 59]: Nor is the examination unlike many such model displays , both in respect of its eliciting nothing and of its being lengthy , for Mr. Guppy is sensible of his talent , and Mrs. Snagsby feels not only that it gratifies her inquisitive disposition , but that it lifts her husband 's establishment higher up in the law .
Parsing [sent. 6131 len. 29]: During the progress of this keen encounter , the vessel Chadband , being merely engaged in the oil trade , gets aground and waits to be floated off .
Parsing [sent. 6132 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6133 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6134 len. 37]: `` Either this boy sticks to it like cobbler 's - wax or there is something out of the common here that beats anything that ever came into my way at Kenge and Carboy 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 6135 len. 17]: Mrs. Chadband whispers Mrs. Snagsby , who exclaims , `` You do n't say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6136 len. 5]: `` For years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6137 len. 4]: replied Mrs. Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 6138 len. 20]: `` Has known Kenge and Carboy 's office for years , '' Mrs. Snagsby triumphantly explains to Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6139 len. 14]: `` Mrs. Chadband -- this gentleman 's wife -- Reverend Mr. Chadband . ''
Parsing [sent. 6140 len. 6]: `` Oh , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6141 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6142 len. 13]: `` Before I married my present husband , '' says Mrs. Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 6143 len. 11]: `` Was you a party in anything , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6144 len. 8]: says Mr. Guppy , transferring his cross-examination .
Parsing [sent. 6145 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6146 len. 10]: `` NOT a party in anything , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6147 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6148 len. 6]: Mrs. Chadband shakes her head .
Parsing [sent. 6149 len. 17]: `` Perhaps you were acquainted with somebody who was a party in something , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6150 len. 17]: says Mr. Guppy , who likes nothing better than to model his conversation on forensic principles .
Parsing [sent. 6151 len. 20]: `` Not exactly that , either , '' replies Mrs. Chadband , humouring the joke with a hard-favoured smile .
Parsing [sent. 6152 len. 8]: `` Not exactly that , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6153 len. 4]: repeats Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6154 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 6155 len. 41]: Pray , ma'am , was it a lady of your acquaintance who had some transactions -LRB- we will not at present say what transactions -RRB- with Kenge and Carboy 's office , or was it a gentleman of your acquaintance ?
Parsing [sent. 6156 len. 5]: Take time , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 6157 len. 7]: We shall come to it presently .
Parsing [sent. 6158 len. 7]: Man or woman , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6159 len. 10]: `` Neither , '' says Mrs. Chadband as before .
Parsing [sent. 6160 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6161 len. 4]: A child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6162 len. 22]: says Mr. Guppy , throwing on the admiring Mrs. Snagsby the regular acute professional eye which is thrown on British jurymen .
Parsing [sent. 6163 len. 18]: `` Now , ma'am , perhaps you 'll have the kindness to tell us WHAT child . ''
Parsing [sent. 6164 len. 19]: `` You have got it at last , sir , '' says Mrs. Chadband with another hard-favoured smile .
Parsing [sent. 6165 len. 19]: `` Well , sir , it was before your time , most likely , judging from your appearance .
Parsing [sent. 6166 len. 25]: I was left in charge of a child named Esther Summerson , who was put out in life by Messrs. Kenge and Carboy . ''
Parsing [sent. 6167 len. 7]: `` Miss Summerson , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6168 len. 6]: cries Mr. Guppy , excited .
Parsing [sent. 6169 len. 14]: `` I call her Esther Summerson , '' says Mrs. Chadband with austerity .
Parsing [sent. 6170 len. 12]: `` There was no Miss-ing of the girl in my time .
Parsing [sent. 6171 len. 4]: It was Esther .
Parsing [sent. 6172 len. 6]: ` Esther , do this !
Parsing [sent. 6173 len. 6]: Esther , do that ! '
Parsing [sent. 6174 len. 9]: and she was made to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6175 len. 44]: `` My dear ma'am , '' returns Mr. Guppy , moving across the small apartment , `` the humble individual who now addresses you received that young lady in London when she first came here from the establishment to which you have alluded .
Parsing [sent. 6176 len. 14]: Allow me to have the pleasure of taking you by the hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 6177 len. 27]: Mr. Chadband , at last seeing his opportunity , makes his accustomed signal and rises with a smoking head , which he dabs with his pocket-handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 6178 len. 7]: Mrs. Snagsby whispers `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6179 len. 40]: `` My friends , '' says Chadband , `` we have partaken in moderation '' -LRB- which was certainly not the case so far as he was concerned -RRB- `` of the comforts which have been provided for us .
Parsing [sent. 6180 len. 44]: May this house live upon the fatness of the land ; may corn and wine be plentiful therein ; may it grow , may it thrive , may it prosper , may it advance , may it proceed , may it press forward !
Parsing [sent. 6181 len. 12]: But , my friends , have we partaken of any-hing else ?
Parsing [sent. 6182 len. 3]: We have .
Parsing [sent. 6183 len. 10]: My friends , of what else have we partaken ?
Parsing [sent. 6184 len. 4]: Of spiritual profit ?
Parsing [sent. 6185 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 6186 len. 9]: From whence have we derived that spiritual profit ?
Parsing [sent. 6187 len. 8]: My young friend , stand forth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6188 len. 34]: Jo , thus apostrophized , gives a slouch backward , and another slouch forward , and another slouch to each side , and confronts the eloquent Chadband with evident doubts of his intentions .
Parsing [sent. 6189 len. 38]: `` My young friend , '' says Chadband , `` you are to us a pearl , you are to us a diamond , you are to us a gem , you are to us a jewel .
Parsing [sent. 6190 len. 8]: And why , my young friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6191 len. 10]: `` I do n't know , '' replies Jo .
Parsing [sent. 6192 len. 8]: `` I do n't know nothink . ''
Parsing [sent. 6193 len. 26]: `` My young friend , '' says Chadband , `` it is because you know nothing that you are to us a gem and jewel .
Parsing [sent. 6194 len. 9]: For what are you , my young friend ?
Parsing [sent. 6195 len. 8]: Are you a beast of the field ?
Parsing [sent. 6196 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6197 len. 6]: A bird of the air ?
Parsing [sent. 6198 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6199 len. 8]: A fish of the sea or river ?
Parsing [sent. 6200 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6201 len. 10]: You are a human boy , my young friend .
Parsing [sent. 6202 len. 4]: A human boy .
Parsing [sent. 6203 len. 8]: O glorious to be a human boy !
Parsing [sent. 6204 len. 8]: And why glorious , my young friend ?
Parsing [sent. 6205 len. 55]: Because you are capable of receiving the lessons of wisdom , because you are capable of profiting by this discourse which I now deliver for your good , because you are not a stick , or a staff , or a stock , or a stone , or a post , or a pillar .
Parsing [sent. 6206 len. 13]: O running stream of sparkling joy To be a soaring human boy !
Parsing [sent. 6207 len. 14]: And do you cool yourself in that stream now , my young friend ?
Parsing [sent. 6208 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 6209 len. 11]: Why do you not cool yourself in that stream now ?
Parsing [sent. 6210 len. 36]: Because you are in a state of darkness , because you are in a state of obscurity , because you are in a state of sinfulness , because you are in a state of bondage .
Parsing [sent. 6211 len. 8]: My young friend , what is bondage ?
Parsing [sent. 6212 len. 12]: Let us , in a spirit of love , inquire . ''
Parsing [sent. 6213 len. 35]: At this threatening stage of the discourse , Jo , who seems to have been gradually going out of his mind , smears his right arm over his face and gives a terrible yawn .
Parsing [sent. 6214 len. 15]: Mrs. Snagsby indignantly expresses her belief that he is a limb of the arch-fiend .
Parsing [sent. 6215 len. 61]: `` My friends , '' says Mr. Chadband with his persecuted chin folding itself into its fat smile again as he looks round , `` it is right that I should be humbled , it is right that I should be tried , it is right that I should be mortified , it is right that I should be corrected .
Parsing [sent. 6216 len. 19]: I stumbled , on Sabbath last , when I thought with pride of my three hours ' improving .
Parsing [sent. 6217 len. 14]: The account is now favourably balanced : my creditor has accepted a composition .
Parsing [sent. 6218 len. 8]: O let us be joyful , joyful !
Parsing [sent. 6219 len. 7]: O let us be joyful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6220 len. 9]: Great sensation on the part of Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 6221 len. 25]: `` My friends , '' says Chadband , looking round him in conclusion , `` I will not proceed with my young friend now .
Parsing [sent. 6222 len. 66]: Will you come to-morrow , my young friend , and inquire of this good lady where I am to be found to deliver a discourse unto you , and will you come like the thirsty swallow upon the next day , and upon the day after that , and upon the day after that , and upon many pleasant days , to hear discourses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6223 len. 8]: -LRB- This with a cow-like lightness . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6224 len. 20]: Jo , whose immediate object seems to be to get away on any terms , gives a shuffling nod .
Parsing [sent. 6225 len. 23]: Mr. Guppy then throws him a penny , and Mrs. Snagsby calls to Guster to see him safely out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 6226 len. 28]: But before he goes downstairs , Mr. Snagsby loads him with some broken meats from the table , which he carries away , hugging in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 6227 len. 65]: So , Mr. Chadband -- of whom the persecutors say that it is no wonder he should go on for any length of time uttering such abominable nonsense , but that the wonder rather is that he should ever leave off , having once the audacity to begin -- retires into private life until he invests a little capital of supper in the oil-trade .
Parsing [sent. 6228 len. 28]: Jo moves on , through the long vacation , down to Blackfriars Bridge , where he finds a baking stony corner wherein to settle to his repast .
Parsing [sent. 6229 len. 33]: And there he sits , munching and gnawing , and looking up at the great cross on the summit of St. Paul 's Cathedral , glittering above a red-and-violet-tinted cloud of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 6230 len. 42]: From the boy 's face one might suppose that sacred emblem to be , in his eyes , the crowning confusion of the great , confused city -- so golden , so high up , so far out of his reach .
Parsing [sent. 6231 len. 48]: There he sits , the sun going down , the river running fast , the crowd flowing by him in two streams -- everything moving on to some purpose and to one end -- until he is stirred up and told to `` move on '' too .
Parsing [sent. 6232 len. 28]: Chapter XX -- A New Lodger The long vacation saunters on towards term-time like an idle river very leisurely strolling down a flat country to the sea .
Parsing [sent. 6233 len. 8]: Mr. Guppy saunters along with it congenially .
Parsing [sent. 6234 len. 24]: He has blunted the blade of his penknife and broken the point off by sticking that instrument into his desk in every direction .
Parsing [sent. 6235 len. 41]: Not that he bears the desk any ill will , but he must do something , and it must be something of an unexciting nature , which will lay neither his physical nor his intellectual energies under too heavy contribution .
Parsing [sent. 6236 len. 29]: He finds that nothing agrees with him so well as to make little gyrations on one leg of his stool , and stab his desk , and gape .
Parsing [sent. 6237 len. 37]: Kenge and Carboy are out of town , and the articled clerk has taken out a shooting license and gone down to his father 's , and Mr. Guppy 's two fellow-stipendiaries are away on leave .
Parsing [sent. 6238 len. 13]: Mr. Guppy and Mr. Richard Carstone divide the dignity of the office .
Parsing [sent. 6239 len. 19]: But Mr. Carstone is for the time being established in Kenge 's room , whereat Mr. Guppy chafes .
Parsing [sent. 6240 len. 63]: So exceedingly that he with biting sarcasm informs his mother , in the confidential moments when he sups with her off a lobster and lettuce in the Old Street Road , that he is afraid the office is hardly good enough for swells , and that if he had known there was a swell coming , he would have got it painted .
Parsing [sent. 6241 len. 32]: Mr. Guppy suspects everybody who enters on the occupation of a stool in Kenge and Carboy 's office of entertaining , as a matter of course , sinister designs upon him .
Parsing [sent. 6242 len. 12]: He is clear that every such person wants to depose him .
Parsing [sent. 6243 len. 24]: If he be ever asked how , why , when , or wherefore , he shuts up one eye and shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 6244 len. 36]: On the strength of these profound views , he in the most ingenious manner takes infinite pains to counterplot when there is no plot , and plays the deepest games of chess without any adversary .
Parsing [sent. 6245 len. 42]: It is a source of much gratification to Mr. Guppy , therefore , to find the new-comer constantly poring over the papers in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , for he well knows that nothing but confusion and failure can come of that .
Parsing [sent. 6246 len. 25]: His satisfaction communicates itself to a third saunterer through the long vacation in Kenge and Carboy 's office , to wit , Young Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6247 len. 33]: Whether Young Smallweed -LRB- metaphorically called Small and eke Chick Weed , as it were jocularly to express a fledgling -RRB- was ever a boy is much doubted in Lincoln 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 6248 len. 14]: He is now something under fifteen and an old limb of the law .
Parsing [sent. 6249 len. 43]: He is facetiously understood to entertain a passion for a lady at a cigar-shop in the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane and for her sake to have broken off a contract with another lady , to whom he had been engaged some years .
Parsing [sent. 6250 len. 29]: He is a town-made article , of small stature and weazen features , but may be perceived from a considerable distance by means of his very tall hat .
Parsing [sent. 6251 len. 11]: To become a Guppy is the object of his ambition .
Parsing [sent. 6252 len. 27]: He dresses at that gentleman -LRB- by whom he is patronized -RRB- , talks at him , walks at him , founds himself entirely on him .
Parsing [sent. 6253 len. 29]: He is honoured with Mr. Guppy 's particular confidence and occasionally advises him , from the deep wells of his experience , on difficult points in private life .
Parsing [sent. 6254 len. 43]: Mr. Guppy has been lolling out of window all the morning after trying all the stools in succession and finding none of them easy , and after several times putting his head into the iron safe with a notion of cooling it .
Parsing [sent. 6255 len. 28]: Mr. Smallweed has been twice dispatched for effervescent drinks , and has twice mixed them in the two official tumblers and stirred them up with the ruler .
Parsing [sent. 6256 len. 33]: Mr. Guppy propounds for Mr. Smallweed 's consideration the paradox that the more you drink the thirstier you are and reclines his head upon the window-sill in a state of hopeless languor .
Parsing [sent. 6257 len. 47]: While thus looking out into the shade of Old Square , Lincoln 's Inn , surveying the intolerable bricks and mortar , Mr. Guppy becomes conscious of a manly whisker emerging from the cloistered walk below and turning itself up in the direction of his face .
Parsing [sent. 6258 len. 22]: At the same time , a low whistle is wafted through the Inn and a suppressed voice cries , `` Hip !
Parsing [sent. 6259 len. 3]: Gup-py ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6260 len. 10]: `` Why , you do n't mean it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6261 len. 6]: says Mr. Guppy , aroused .
Parsing [sent. 6262 len. 3]: `` Small !
Parsing [sent. 6263 len. 5]: Here 's Jobling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6264 len. 13]: Small 's head looks out of window too and nods to Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6265 len. 9]: `` Where have you sprung up from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6266 len. 4]: inquires Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6267 len. 8]: `` From the market-gardens down by Deptford .
Parsing [sent. 6268 len. 8]: I ca n't stand it any longer .
Parsing [sent. 6269 len. 4]: I must enlist .
Parsing [sent. 6270 len. 3]: I say !
Parsing [sent. 6271 len. 10]: I wish you 'd lend me half a crown .
Parsing [sent. 6272 len. 9]: Upon my soul , I 'm hungry . ''
Parsing [sent. 6273 len. 20]: Jobling looks hungry and also has the appearance of having run to seed in the market-gardens down by Deptford .
Parsing [sent. 6274 len. 4]: `` I say !
Parsing [sent. 6275 len. 14]: Just throw out half a crown if you have got one to spare .
Parsing [sent. 6276 len. 8]: I want to get some dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 6277 len. 10]: `` Will you come and dine with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6278 len. 15]: says Mr. Guppy , throwing out the coin , which Mr. Jobling catches neatly .
Parsing [sent. 6279 len. 11]: `` How long should I have to hold out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6280 len. 3]: says Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6281 len. 6]: `` Not half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 6282 len. 20]: I am only waiting here till the enemy goes , returns Mr. Guppy , butting inward with his head .
Parsing [sent. 6283 len. 5]: `` What enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6284 len. 5]: `` A new one .
Parsing [sent. 6285 len. 5]: Going to be articled .
Parsing [sent. 6286 len. 5]: Will you wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6287 len. 14]: `` Can you give a fellow anything to read in the meantime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6288 len. 4]: says Mr Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6289 len. 6]: Smallweed suggests the law list .
Parsing [sent. 6290 len. 16]: But Mr. Jobling declares with much earnestness that he `` ca n't stand it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6291 len. 12]: `` You shall have the paper , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6292 len. 7]: `` He shall bring it down .
Parsing [sent. 6293 len. 10]: But you had better not be seen about here .
Parsing [sent. 6294 len. 7]: Sit on our staircase and read .
Parsing [sent. 6295 len. 7]: It 's a quiet place . ''
Parsing [sent. 6296 len. 6]: Jobling nods intelligence and acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 6297 len. 33]: The sagacious Smallweed supplies him with the newspaper and occasionally drops his eye upon him from the landing as a precaution against his becoming disgusted with waiting and making an untimely departure .
Parsing [sent. 6298 len. 14]: At last the enemy retreats , and then Smallweed fetches Mr. Jobling up .
Parsing [sent. 6299 len. 9]: `` Well , and how are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6300 len. 9]: says Mr. Guppy , shaking hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 6301 len. 5]: `` So , so .
Parsing [sent. 6302 len. 5]: How are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6303 len. 25]: Mr. Guppy replying that he is not much to boast of , Mr. Jobling ventures on the question , `` How is SHE ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6304 len. 26]: This Mr. Guppy resents as a liberty , retorting , `` Jobling , there ARE chords in the human mind -- '' Jobling begs pardon .
Parsing [sent. 6305 len. 7]: `` Any subject but that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6306 len. 11]: says Mr. Guppy with a gloomy enjoyment of his injury .
Parsing [sent. 6307 len. 15]: `` For there ARE chords , Jobling -- '' Mr. Jobling begs pardon again .
Parsing [sent. 6308 len. 32]: During this short colloquy , the active Smallweed , who is of the dinner party , has written in legal characters on a slip of paper , `` Return immediately . ''
Parsing [sent. 6309 len. 45]: This notification to all whom it may concern , he inserts in the letter-box , and then putting on the tall hat at the angle of inclination at which Mr. Guppy wears his , informs his patron that they may now make themselves scarce .
Parsing [sent. 6310 len. 62]: Accordingly they betake themselves to a neighbouring dining-house , of the class known among its frequenters by the denomination slap-bang , where the waitress , a bouncing young female of forty , is supposed to have made some impression on the susceptible Smallweed , of whom it may be remarked that he is a weird changeling to whom years are nothing .
Parsing [sent. 6311 len. 10]: He stands precociously possessed of centuries of owlish wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 6312 len. 21]: If he ever lay in a cradle , it seems as if he must have lain there in a tail-coat .
Parsing [sent. 6313 len. 50]: He has an old , old eye , has Smallweed ; and he drinks and smokes in a monkeyish way ; and his neck is stiff in his collar ; and he is never to be taken in ; and he knows all about it , whatever it is .
Parsing [sent. 6314 len. 69]: In short , in his bringing up he has been so nursed by Law and Equity that he has become a kind of fossil imp , to account for whose terrestrial existence it is reported at the public offices that his father was John Doe and his mother the only female member of the Roe family , also that his first long-clothes were made from a blue bag .
Parsing [sent. 6315 len. 41]: Into the dining-house , unaffected by the seductive show in the window of artificially whitened cauliflowers and poultry , verdant baskets of peas , coolly blooming cucumbers , and joints ready for the spit , Mr. Smallweed leads the way .
Parsing [sent. 6316 len. 9]: They know him there and defer to him .
Parsing [sent. 6317 len. 28]: He has his favourite box , he bespeaks all the papers , he is down upon bald patriarchs , who keep them more than ten minutes afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6318 len. 33]: It is of no use trying him with anything less than a full-sized `` bread '' or proposing to him any joint in cut unless it is in the very best cut .
Parsing [sent. 6319 len. 9]: In the matter of gravy he is adamant .
Parsing [sent. 6320 len. 50]: Conscious of his elfin power and submitting to his dread experience , Mr. Guppy consults him in the choice of that day 's banquet , turning an appealing look towards him as the waitress repeats the catalogue of viands and saying `` What do YOU take , Chick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6321 len. 50]: Chick , out of the profundity of his artfulness , preferring `` veal and ham and French beans -- and do n't you forget the stuffing , Polly '' -LRB- with an unearthly cock of his venerable eye -RRB- , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling give the like order .
Parsing [sent. 6322 len. 8]: Three pint pots of half-and-half are superadded .
Parsing [sent. 6323 len. 28]: Quickly the waitress returns bearing what is apparently a model of the Tower of Babel but what is really a pile of plates and flat tin dish-covers .
Parsing [sent. 6324 len. 23]: Mr. Smallweed , approving of what is set before him , conveys intelligent benignity into his ancient eye and winks upon her .
Parsing [sent. 6325 len. 115]: Then , amid a constant coming in , and going out , and running about , and a clatter of crockery , and a rumbling up and down of the machine which brings the nice cuts from the kitchen , and a shrill crying for more nice cuts down the speaking-pipe , and a shrill reckoning of the cost of nice cuts that have been disposed of , and a general flush and steam of hot joints , cut and uncut , and a considerably heated atmosphere in which the soiled knives and tablecloths seem to break out spontaneously into eruptions of grease and blotches of beer , the legal triumvirate appease their appetites .
Parsing [sent. 6326 len. 12]: Mr. Jobling is buttoned up closer than mere adornment might require .
Parsing [sent. 6327 len. 23]: His hat presents at the rims a peculiar appearance of a glistening nature , as if it had been a favourite snail-promenade .
Parsing [sent. 6328 len. 18]: The same phenomenon is visible on some parts of his coat , and particularly at the seams .
Parsing [sent. 6329 len. 24]: He has the faded appearance of a gentleman in embarrassed circumstances ; even his light whiskers droop with something of a shabby air .
Parsing [sent. 6330 len. 16]: His appetite is so vigorous that it suggests spare living for some little time back .
Parsing [sent. 6331 len. 34]: He makes such a speedy end of his plate of veal and ham , bringing it to a close while his companions are yet midway in theirs , that Mr. Guppy proposes another .
Parsing [sent. 6332 len. 25]: `` Thank you , Guppy , '' says Mr. Jobling , `` I really do n't know but what I WILL take another . ''
Parsing [sent. 6333 len. 11]: Another being brought , he falls to with great goodwill .
Parsing [sent. 6334 len. 45]: Mr. Guppy takes silent notice of him at intervals until he is half way through this second plate and stops to take an enjoying pull at his pint pot of half-and-half -LRB- also renewed -RRB- and stretches out his legs and rubs his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6335 len. 22]: Beholding him in which glow of contentment , Mr. Guppy says , `` You are a man again , Tony ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6336 len. 12]: `` Well , not quite yet , '' says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6337 len. 7]: `` Say , just born . ''
Parsing [sent. 6338 len. 8]: `` Will you take any other vegetables ?
Parsing [sent. 6339 len. 2]: Grass ?
Parsing [sent. 6340 len. 2]: Peas ?
Parsing [sent. 6341 len. 4]: Summer cabbage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6342 len. 11]: `` Thank you , Guppy , '' says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6343 len. 15]: `` I really do n't know but what I WILL take summer cabbage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6344 len. 20]: Order given ; with the sarcastic addition -LRB- from Mr. Smallweed -RRB- of `` Without slugs , Polly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6345 len. 4]: And cabbage produced .
Parsing [sent. 6346 len. 23]: `` I am growing up , Guppy , '' says Mr. Jobling , plying his knife and fork with a relishing steadiness .
Parsing [sent. 6347 len. 7]: `` Glad to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6348 len. 17]: `` In fact , I have just turned into my teens , '' says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6349 len. 45]: He says no more until he has performed his task , which he achieves as Messrs. Guppy and Smallweed finish theirs , thus getting over the ground in excellent style and beating those two gentlemen easily by a veal and ham and a cabbage .
Parsing [sent. 6350 len. 19]: `` Now , Small , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` what would you recommend about pastry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6351 len. 10]: `` Marrow puddings , '' says Mr. Smallweed instantly .
Parsing [sent. 6352 len. 6]: `` Aye , aye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6353 len. 8]: cries Mr. Jobling with an arch look .
Parsing [sent. 6354 len. 8]: `` You 're there , are you ?
Parsing [sent. 6355 len. 20]: Thank you , Mr. Guppy , I do n't know but what I WILL take a marrow pudding . ''
Parsing [sent. 6356 len. 21]: Three marrow puddings being produced , Mr. Jobling adds in a pleasant humour that he is coming of age fast .
Parsing [sent. 6357 len. 24]: To these succeed , by command of Mr. Smallweed , `` three Cheshires , '' and to those `` three small rums . ''
Parsing [sent. 6358 len. 47]: This apex of the entertainment happily reached , Mr. Jobling puts up his legs on the carpeted seat -LRB- having his own side of the box to himself -RRB- , leans against the wall , and says , `` I am grown up now , Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6359 len. 7]: I have arrived at maturity . ''
Parsing [sent. 6360 len. 23]: `` What do you think , now , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` about -- you do n't mind Smallweed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6361 len. 8]: `` Not the least in the worid .
Parsing [sent. 6362 len. 11]: I have the pleasure of drinking his good health . ''
Parsing [sent. 6363 len. 7]: `` Sir , to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6364 len. 4]: says Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6365 len. 21]: `` I was saying , what do you think NOW , '' pursues Mr. Guppy , `` of enlisting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6366 len. 35]: `` Why , what I may think after dinner , '' returns Mr. Jobling , `` is one thing , my dear Guppy , and what I may think before dinner is another thing .
Parsing [sent. 6367 len. 18]: Still , even after dinner , I ask myself the question , What am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6368 len. 6]: How am I to live ?
Parsing [sent. 6369 len. 27]: Ill fo manger , you know , '' says Mr. Jobling , pronouncing that word as if he meant a necessary fixture in an English stable .
Parsing [sent. 6370 len. 5]: `` Ill fo manger .
Parsing [sent. 6371 len. 20]: That 's the French saying , and mangering is as necessary to me as it is to a Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 6372 len. 5]: Or more so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6373 len. 12]: Mr. Smallweed is decidedly of opinion `` much more so . ''
Parsing [sent. 6374 len. 50]: `` If any man had told me , '' pursues Jobling , `` even so lately as when you and I had the frisk down in Lincolnshire , Guppy , and drove over to see that house at Castle Wold -- '' Mr. Smallweed corrects him -- Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 6375 len. 4]: `` Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 6376 len. 11]: -LRB- I thank my honourable friend for that cheer . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6377 len. 64]: If any man had told me then that I should be as hard up at the present time as I literally find myself , I should have -- well , I should have pitched into him , '' says Mr. Jobling , taking a little rum-and-water with an air of desperate resignation ; `` I should have let fly at his head . ''
Parsing [sent. 6378 len. 21]: `` Still , Tony , you were on the wrong side of the post then , '' remonstrates Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6379 len. 12]: `` You were talking about nothing else in the gig . ''
Parsing [sent. 6380 len. 15]: `` Guppy , '' says Mr. Jobling , `` I will not deny it .
Parsing [sent. 6381 len. 10]: I was on the wrong side of the post .
Parsing [sent. 6382 len. 9]: But I trusted to things coming round . ''
Parsing [sent. 6383 len. 10]: That very popular trust in flat things coming round !
Parsing [sent. 6384 len. 19]: Not in their being beaten round , or worked round , but in their `` coming '' round !
Parsing [sent. 6385 len. 15]: As though a lunatic should trust in the world 's `` coming '' triangular !
Parsing [sent. 6386 len. 30]: `` I had confident expectations that things would come round and be all square , '' says Mr. Jobling with some vagueness of expression and perhaps of meaning too .
Parsing [sent. 6387 len. 6]: `` But I was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 6388 len. 4]: They never did .
Parsing [sent. 6389 len. 37]: And when it came to creditors making rows at the office and to people that the office dealt with making complaints about dirty trifles of borrowed money , why there was an end of that connexion .
Parsing [sent. 6390 len. 28]: And of any new professional connexion too , for if I was to give a reference to-morrow , it would be mentioned and would sew me up .
Parsing [sent. 6391 len. 8]: Then what 's a fellow to do ?
Parsing [sent. 6392 len. 31]: I have been keeping out of the way and living cheap down about the market-gardens , but what 's the use of living cheap when you have got no money ?
Parsing [sent. 6393 len. 8]: You might as well live dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6394 len. 8]: `` Better , '' Mr. Smallweed thinks .
Parsing [sent. 6395 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 6396 len. 29]: It 's the fashionable way ; and fashion and whiskers have been my weaknesses , and I do n't care who knows it , '' says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6397 len. 14]: `` They are great weaknesses -- Damme , sir , they are great .
Parsing [sent. 6398 len. 31]: Well , '' proceeds Mr. Jobling after a defiant visit to his rum-and -- water , `` what can a fellow do , I ask you , BUT enlist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6399 len. 21]: Mr. Guppy comes more fully into the conversation to state what , in his opinion , a fellow can do .
Parsing [sent. 6400 len. 33]: His manner is the gravely impressive manner of a man who has not committed himself in life otherwise than as he has become the victim of a tender sorrow of the heart .
Parsing [sent. 6401 len. 27]: `` Jobling , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` myself and our mutual friend Smallweed -- '' Mr. Smallweed modestly observes , `` Gentlemen both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6402 len. 4]: and drinks . ''
Parsing [sent. 6403 len. 24]: -- Have had a little conversation on this matter more than once since you -- '' `` Say , got the sack ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6404 len. 5]: cries Mr. Jobling bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 6405 len. 6]: `` Say it , Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6406 len. 5]: You mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6407 len. 3]: `` No-o-o !
Parsing [sent. 6408 len. 10]: Left the Inn , '' Mr. Smallweed delicately suggests .
Parsing [sent. 6409 len. 33]: `` Since you left the Inn , Jobling , '' says Mr. Guppy ; `` and I have mentioned to our mutual friend Smallweed a plan I have lately thought of proposing .
Parsing [sent. 6410 len. 7]: You know Snagsby the stationer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6411 len. 14]: `` I know there is such a stationer , '' returns Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6412 len. 15]: `` He was not ours , and I am not acquainted with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 6413 len. 19]: `` He IS ours , Jobling , and I AM acquainted with him , '' Mr. Guppy retorts .
Parsing [sent. 6414 len. 5]: `` Well , sir !
Parsing [sent. 6415 len. 24]: I have lately become better acquainted with him through some accidental circumstances that have made me a visitor of his in private life .
Parsing [sent. 6416 len. 11]: Those circumstances it is not necessary to offer in argument .
Parsing [sent. 6417 len. 30]: They may -- or they may not -- have some reference to a subject which may -- or may not -- have cast its shadow on my existence . ''
Parsing [sent. 6418 len. 56]: As it is Mr. Guppy 's perplexing way with boastful misery to tempt his particular friends into this subject , and the moment they touch it , to turn on them with that trenchant severity about the chords in the human mind , both Mr. Jobling and Mr. Smallweed decline the pitfall by remaining silent .
Parsing [sent. 6419 len. 18]: `` Such things may be , '' repeats Mr. Guppy , `` or they may not be .
Parsing [sent. 6420 len. 8]: They are no part of the case .
Parsing [sent. 6421 len. 36]: It is enough to mention that both Mr. and Mrs. Snagsby are very willing to oblige me and that Snagsby has , in busy times , a good deal of copying work to give out .
Parsing [sent. 6422 len. 12]: He has all Tulkinghorn 's , and an excellent business besides .
Parsing [sent. 6423 len. 19]: I believe if our mutual friend Smallweed were put into the box , he could prove this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6424 len. 10]: Mr. Smallweed nods and appears greedy to be sworn .
Parsing [sent. 6425 len. 34]: `` Now , gentlemen of the jury , '' says Mr. Guppy , '' -- I mean , now , Jobling -- you may say this is a poor prospect of a living .
Parsing [sent. 6426 len. 2]: Granted .
Parsing [sent. 6427 len. 12]: But it 's better than nothing , and better than enlistment .
Parsing [sent. 6428 len. 4]: You want time .
Parsing [sent. 6429 len. 12]: There must be time for these late affairs to blow over .
Parsing [sent. 6430 len. 16]: You might live through it on much worse terms than by writing for Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 6431 len. 23]: Mr. Jobling is about to interrupt when the sagacious Smallweed checks him with a dry cough and the words , `` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 6432 len. 3]: Shakspeare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6433 len. 16]: `` There are two branches to this subject , Jobling , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6434 len. 6]: `` That is the first .
Parsing [sent. 6435 len. 6]: I come to the second .
Parsing [sent. 6436 len. 11]: You know Krook , the Chancellor , across the lane .
Parsing [sent. 6437 len. 28]: Come , Jobling , '' says Mr. Guppy in his encouraging cross-examination-tone , `` I think you know Krook , the Chancellor , across the lane ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6438 len. 12]: `` I know him by sight , '' says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6439 len. 7]: `` You know him by sight .
Parsing [sent. 6440 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 6441 len. 7]: And you know little Flite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6442 len. 10]: `` Everybody knows her , '' says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6443 len. 5]: `` Everybody knows her .
Parsing [sent. 6444 len. 3]: VERY well .
Parsing [sent. 6445 len. 50]: Now it has been one of my duties of late to pay Flite a certain weekly allowance , deducting from it the amount of her weekly rent , which I have paid -LRB- in consequence of instructions I have received -RRB- to Krook himself , regularly in her presence .
Parsing [sent. 6446 len. 19]: This has brought me into communication with Krook and into a knowledge of his house and his habits .
Parsing [sent. 6447 len. 9]: I know he has a room to let .
Parsing [sent. 6448 len. 26]: You may live there at a very low charge under any name you like , as quietly as if you were a hundred miles off .
Parsing [sent. 6449 len. 27]: He 'll ask no questions and would accept you as a tenant at a word from me -- before the clock strikes , if you chose .
Parsing [sent. 6450 len. 63]: And I tell you another thing , Jobling , '' says Mr. Guppy , who has suddenly lowered his voice and become familiar again , `` he 's an extraordinary old chap -- always rummaging among a litter of papers and grubbing away at teaching himself to read and write , without getting on a bit , as it seems to me .
Parsing [sent. 6451 len. 10]: He is a most extraordinary old chap , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6452 len. 22]: I do n't know but what it might be worth a fellow 's while to look him up a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 6453 len. 11]: `` You do n't mean -- '' Mr. Jobling begins .
Parsing [sent. 6454 len. 25]: `` I mean , '' returns Mr. Guppy , shrugging his shoulders with becoming modesty , `` that I ca n't make him out .
Parsing [sent. 6455 len. 25]: I appeal to our mutual friend Smallweed whether he has or has not heard me remark that I ca n't make him out . ''
Parsing [sent. 6456 len. 12]: Mr. Smallweed bears the concise testimony , `` A few ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6457 len. 37]: `` I have seen something of the profession and something of life , Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` and it 's seldom I ca n't make a man out , more or less .
Parsing [sent. 6458 len. 33]: But such an old card as this , so deep , so sly , and secret -LRB- though I do n't believe he is ever sober -RRB- , I never came across .
Parsing [sent. 6459 len. 74]: Now , he must be precious old , you know , and he has not a soul about him , and he is reported to be immensely rich ; and whether he is a smuggler , or a receiver , or an unlicensed pawnbroker , or a money-lender -- all of which I have thought likely at different times -- it might pay you to knock up a sort of knowledge of him .
Parsing [sent. 6460 len. 19]: I do n't see why you should n't go in for it , when everything else suits . ''
Parsing [sent. 6461 len. 29]: Mr. Jobling , Mr. Guppy , and Mr. Smallweed all lean their elbows on the table and their chins upon their hands , and look at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 6462 len. 25]: After a time , they all drink , slowly lean back , put their hands in their pockets , and look at one another .
Parsing [sent. 6463 len. 13]: `` If I had the energy I once possessed , Tony ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6464 len. 7]: says Mr. Guppy with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 6465 len. 67]: `` But there are chords in the human mind -- '' Expressing the remainder of the desolate sentiment in rum-and-water , Mr. Guppy concludes by resigning the adventure to Tony Jobling and informing him that during the vacation and while things are slack , his purse , `` as far as three or four or even five pound goes , '' will be at his disposal .
Parsing [sent. 6466 len. 27]: `` For never shall it be said , '' Mr. Guppy adds with emphasis , `` that William Guppy turned his back upon his friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6467 len. 29]: The latter part of the proposal is so directly to the purpose that Mr. Jobling says with emotion , `` Guppy , my trump , your fist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6468 len. 18]: Mr. Guppy presents it , saying , `` Jobling , my boy , there it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6469 len. 17]: Mr. Jobling returns , `` Guppy , we have been pals now for some years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6470 len. 11]: Mr. Guppy replies , `` Jobling , we have . ''
Parsing [sent. 6471 len. 37]: They then shake hands , and Mr. Jobling adds in a feeling manner , `` Thank you , Guppy , I do n't know but what I WILL take another glass for old acquaintance sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 6472 len. 17]: `` Krook 's last lodger died there , '' observes Mr. Guppy in an incidental way .
Parsing [sent. 6473 len. 6]: `` Did he though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6474 len. 4]: says Mr. Jobling .
Parsing [sent. 6475 len. 6]: `` There was a verdict .
Parsing [sent. 6476 len. 3]: Accidental death .
Parsing [sent. 6477 len. 7]: You do n't mind that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6478 len. 25]: `` No , '' says Mr. Jobling , `` I do n't mind it ; but he might as well have died somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 6479 len. 15]: It 's devilish odd that he need go and die at MY place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6480 len. 31]: Mr. Jobling quite resents this liberty , several times returning to it with such remarks as , `` There are places enough to die in , I should think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6481 len. 19]: or , `` He would n't have liked my dying at HIS place , I dare say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6482 len. 37]: However , the compact being virtually made , Mr. Guppy proposes to dispatch the trusty Smallweed to ascertain if Mr. Krook is at home , as in that case they may complete the negotiation without delay .
Parsing [sent. 6483 len. 23]: Mr. Jobling approving , Smallweed puts himself under the tall hat and conveys it out of the dining-rooms in the Guppy manner .
Parsing [sent. 6484 len. 35]: He soon returns with the intelligence that Mr. Krook is at home and that he has seen him through the shop-door , sitting in the back premises , sleeping `` like one o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 6485 len. 20]: `` Then I 'll pay , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` and we 'll go and see him .
Parsing [sent. 6486 len. 8]: Small , what will it be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6487 len. 95]: Mr. Smallweed , compelling the attendance of the waitress with one hitch of his eyelash , instantly replies as follows : `` Four veals and hams is three , and four potatoes is three and four , and one summer cabbage is three and six , and three marrows is four and six , and six breads is five , and three Cheshires is five and three , and four half-pints of half-and-half is six and three , and four small rums is eight and three , and three Pollys is eight and six .
Parsing [sent. 6488 len. 15]: Eight and six in half a sovereign , Polly , and eighteenpence out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6489 len. 87]: Not at all excited by these stupendous calculations , Smallweed dismisses his friends with a cool nod and remains behind to take a little admiring notice of Polly , as opportunity may serve , and to read the daily papers , which are so very large in proportion to himself , shorn of his hat , that when he holds up the Times to run his eye over the columns , he seems to have retired for the night and to have disappeared under the bedclothes .
Parsing [sent. 6490 len. 49]: Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling repair to the rag and bottle shop , where they find Krook still sleeping like one o'clock , that is to say , breathing stertorously with his chin upon his breast and quite insensible to any external sounds or even to gentle shaking .
Parsing [sent. 6491 len. 19]: On the table beside him , among the usual lumber , stand an empty gin-bottle and a glass .
Parsing [sent. 6492 len. 35]: The unwholesome air is so stained with this liquor that even the green eyes of the cat upon her shelf , as they open and shut and glimmer on the visitors , look drunk .
Parsing [sent. 6493 len. 6]: `` Hold up here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6494 len. 15]: says Mr. Guppy , giving the relaxed figure of the old man another shake .
Parsing [sent. 6495 len. 4]: `` Mr. Krook !
Parsing [sent. 6496 len. 5]: Halloa , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6497 len. 21]: But it would seem as easy to wake a bundle of old clothes with a spirituous heat smouldering in it .
Parsing [sent. 6498 len. 19]: `` Did you ever see such a stupor as he falls into , between drink and sleep ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6499 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6500 len. 32]: `` If this is his regular sleep , '' returns Jobling , rather alarmed , `` it 'll last a long time one of these days , I am thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 6501 len. 21]: `` It 's always more like a fit than a nap , '' says Mr. Guppy , shaking him again .
Parsing [sent. 6502 len. 6]: `` Halloa , your lordship !
Parsing [sent. 6503 len. 10]: Why , he might be robbed fifty times over !
Parsing [sent. 6504 len. 5]: Open your eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6505 len. 20]: After much ado , he opens them , but without appearing to see his visitors or any other objects .
Parsing [sent. 6506 len. 35]: Though he crosses one leg on another , and folds his hands , and several times closes and opens his parched lips , he seems to all intents and purposes as insensible as before .
Parsing [sent. 6507 len. 14]: `` He is alive , at any rate , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6508 len. 9]: `` How are you , my Lord Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 6509 len. 18]: I have brought a friend of mine , sir , on a little matter of business . ''
Parsing [sent. 6510 len. 16]: The old man still sits , often smacking his dry lips without the least consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 6511 len. 10]: After some minutes he makes an attempt to rise .
Parsing [sent. 6512 len. 16]: They help him up , and he staggers against the wall and stares at them .
Parsing [sent. 6513 len. 10]: `` How do you do , Mr. Krook ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6514 len. 7]: says Mr. Guppy in some discomfiture .
Parsing [sent. 6515 len. 8]: `` How do you do , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 6516 len. 8]: You are looking charming , Mr. Krook .
Parsing [sent. 6517 len. 8]: I hope you are pretty well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6518 len. 30]: The old man , in aiming a purposeless blow at Mr. Guppy , or at nothing , feebly swings himself round and comes with his face against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 6519 len. 25]: So he remains for a minute or two , heaped up against it , and then staggers down the shop to the front door .
Parsing [sent. 6520 len. 23]: The air , the movement in the court , the lapse of time , or the combination of these things recovers him .
Parsing [sent. 6521 len. 19]: He comes back pretty steadily , adjusting his fur cap on his head and looking keenly at them .
Parsing [sent. 6522 len. 11]: `` Your servant , gentlemen ; I 've been dozing .
Parsing [sent. 6523 len. 2]: Hi !
Parsing [sent. 6524 len. 10]: I am hard to wake , odd times . ''
Parsing [sent. 6525 len. 13]: `` Rather so , indeed , sir , '' responds Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6526 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 6527 len. 12]: You 've been a-trying to do it , have you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6528 len. 5]: says the suspicious Krook .
Parsing [sent. 6529 len. 10]: `` Only a little , '' Mr. Guppy explains .
Parsing [sent. 6530 len. 26]: The old man 's eye resting on the empty bottle , he takes it up , examines it , and slowly tilts it upside down .
Parsing [sent. 6531 len. 5]: `` I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6532 len. 9]: he cries like the hobgoblin in the story .
Parsing [sent. 6533 len. 9]: `` Somebody 's been making free here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6534 len. 14]: `` I assure you we found it so , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6535 len. 13]: `` Would you allow me to get it filled for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6536 len. 8]: `` Yes , certainly I would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6537 len. 6]: cries Krook in high glee .
Parsing [sent. 6538 len. 5]: `` Certainly I would !
Parsing [sent. 6539 len. 5]: Do n't mention it !
Parsing [sent. 6540 len. 16]: Get it filled next door -- Sol 's Arms -- the Lord Chancellor 's fourteenpenny .
Parsing [sent. 6541 len. 8]: Bless you , they know ME ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6542 len. 35]: He so presses the empty bottle upon Mr. Guppy that that gentleman , with a nod to his friend , accepts the trust and hurries out and hurries in again with the bottle filled .
Parsing [sent. 6543 len. 17]: The old man receives it in his arms like a beloved grandchild and pats it tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 6544 len. 30]: `` But , I say , '' he whispers , with his eyes screwed up , after tasting it , `` this ai n't the Lord Chancellor 's fourteenpenny .
Parsing [sent. 6545 len. 5]: This is eighteenpenny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6546 len. 14]: `` I thought you might like that better , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6547 len. 28]: `` You 're a nobleman , sir , '' returns Krook with another taste , and his hot breath seems to come towards them like a flame .
Parsing [sent. 6548 len. 10]: `` You 're a baron of the land . ''
Parsing [sent. 6549 len. 27]: Taking advantage of this auspicious moment , Mr. Guppy presents his friend under the impromptu name of Mr. Weevle and states the object of their visit .
Parsing [sent. 6550 len. 37]: Krook , with his bottle under his arm -LRB- he never gets beyond a certain point of either drunkenness or sobriety -RRB- , takes time to survey his proposed lodger and seems to approve of him .
Parsing [sent. 6551 len. 13]: `` You 'd like to see the room , young man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6552 len. 3]: he says .
Parsing [sent. 6553 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 6554 len. 6]: It 's a good room !
Parsing [sent. 6555 len. 3]: Been whitewashed .
Parsing [sent. 6556 len. 9]: Been cleaned down with soft soap and soda .
Parsing [sent. 6557 len. 2]: Hi !
Parsing [sent. 6558 len. 26]: It 's worth twice the rent , letting alone my company when you want it and such a cat to keep the mice away . ''
Parsing [sent. 6559 len. 44]: Commending the room after this manner , the old man takes them upstairs , where indeed they do find it cleaner than it used to be and also containing some old articles of furniture which he has dug up from his inexhaustible stores .
Parsing [sent. 6560 len. 54]: The terms are easily concluded -- for the Lord Chancellor can not be hard on Mr. Guppy , associated as he is with Kenge and Carboy , Jarndyce and Jarndyce , and other famous claims on his professional consideration -- and it is agreed that Mr. Weevle shall take possession on the morrow .
Parsing [sent. 6561 len. 42]: Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy then repair to Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , where the personal introduction of the former to Mr. Snagsby is effected and -LRB- more important -RRB- the vote and interest of Mrs. Snagsby are secured .
Parsing [sent. 6562 len. 57]: They then report progress to the eminent Smallweed , waiting at the office in his tall hat for that purpose , and separate , Mr. Guppy explaining that he would terminate his little entertainment by standing treat at the play but that there are chords in the human mind which would render it a hollow mockery .
Parsing [sent. 6563 len. 55]: On the morrow , in the dusk of evening , Mr. Weevle modestly appears at Krook 's , by no means incommoded with luggage , and establishes himself in his new lodging , where the two eyes in the shutters stare at him in his sleep , as if they were full of wonder .
Parsing [sent. 6564 len. 76]: On the following day Mr. Weevle , who is a handy good-for-nothing kind of young fellow , borrows a needle and thread of Miss Flite and a hammer of his landlord and goes to work devising apologies for window-curtains , and knocking up apologies for shelves , and hanging up his two teacups , milkpot , and crockery sundries on a pennyworth of little hooks , like a shipwrecked sailor making the best of it .
Parsing [sent. 6565 len. 82]: But what Mr. Weevle prizes most of all his few possessions -LRB- next after his light whiskers , for which he has an attachment that only whiskers can awaken in the breast of man -RRB- is a choice collection of copper-plate impressions from that truly national work The Divinities of Albion , or Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , representing ladies of title and fashion in every variety of smirk that art , combined with capital , is capable of producing .
Parsing [sent. 6566 len. 74]: With these magnificent portraits , unworthily confined in a band-box during his seclusion among the market-gardens , he decorates his apartment ; and as the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty wears every variety of fancy dress , plays every variety of musical instrument , fondles every variety of dog , ogles every variety of prospect , and is backed up by every variety of flower-pot and balustrade , the result is very imposing .
Parsing [sent. 6567 len. 16]: But fashion is Mr. Weevle 's , as it was Tony Jobling 's , weakness .
Parsing [sent. 6568 len. 37]: To borrow yesterday 's paper from the Sol 's Arms of an evening and read about the brilliant and distinguished meteors that are shooting across the fashionable sky in every direction is unspeakable consolation to him .
Parsing [sent. 6569 len. 40]: To know what member of what brilliant and distinguished circle accomplished the brilliant and distinguished feat of joining it yesterday or contemplates the no less brilliant and distinguished feat of leaving it to-morrow gives him a thrill of joy .
Parsing [sent. 6570 len. 48]: To be informed what the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty is about , and means to be about , and what Galaxy marriages are on the tapis , and what Galaxy rumours are in circulation , is to become acquainted with the most glorious destinies of mankind .
Parsing [sent. 6571 len. 26]: Mr. Weevle reverts from this intelligence to the Galaxy portraits implicated , and seems to know the originals , and to be known of them .
Parsing [sent. 6572 len. 47]: For the rest he is a quiet lodger , full of handy shifts and devices as before mentioned , able to cook and clean for himself as well as to carpenter , and developing social inclinations after the shades of evening have fallen on the court .
Parsing [sent. 6573 len. 78]: At those times , when he is not visited by Mr. Guppy or by a small light in his likeness quenched in a dark hat , he comes out of his dull room -- where he has inherited the deal wilderness of desk bespattered with a rain of ink -- and talks to Krook or is `` very free , '' as they call it in the court , commendingly , with any one disposed for conversation .
Parsing [sent. 6574 len. 83]: Wherefore , Mrs. Piper , who leads the court , is impelled to offer two remarks to Mrs. Perkins : firstly , that if her Johnny was to have whiskers , she could wish 'em to be identically like that young man 's ; and secondly , `` Mark my words , Mrs. Perkins , ma'am , and do n't you be surprised , Lord bless you , if that young man comes in at last for old Krook 's money ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6575 len. 60]: Chapter XXI -- The Smallweed Family In a rather ill-favoured and ill-savoured neighbourhood , though one of its rising grounds bears the name of Mount Pleasant , the Elfin Smallweed , christened Bartholomew and known on the domestic hearth as Bart , passes that limited portion of his time on which the office and its contingencies have no claim .
Parsing [sent. 6576 len. 53]: He dwells in a little narrow street , always solitary , shady , and sad , closely bricked in on all sides like a tomb , but where there yet lingers the stump of an old forest tree whose flavour is about as fresh and natural as the Smallweed smack of youth .
Parsing [sent. 6577 len. 14]: There has been only one child in the Smallweed family for several generations .
Parsing [sent. 6578 len. 40]: Little old men and women there have been , but no child , until Mr. Smallweed 's grandmother , now living , became weak in her intellect and fell -LRB- for the first time -RRB- into a childish state .
Parsing [sent. 6579 len. 42]: With such infantine graces as a total want of observation , memory , understanding , and interest , and an eternal disposition to fall asleep over the fire and into it , Mr. Smallweed 's grandmother has undoubtedly brightened the family .
Parsing [sent. 6580 len. 10]: Mr. Smallweed 's grandfather is likewise of the party .
Parsing [sent. 6581 len. 27]: He is in a helpless condition as to his lower , and nearly so as to his upper , limbs , but his mind is unimpaired .
Parsing [sent. 6582 len. 26]: It holds , as well as it ever held , the first four rules of arithmetic and a certain small collection of the hardest facts .
Parsing [sent. 6583 len. 26]: In respect of ideality , reverence , wonder , and other such phrenological attributes , it is no worse off than it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 6584 len. 25]: Everything that Mr. Smallweed 's grandfather ever put away in his mind was a grub at first , and is a grub at last .
Parsing [sent. 6585 len. 12]: In all his life he has never bred a single butterfly .
Parsing [sent. 6586 len. 40]: The father of this pleasant grandfather , of the neighbourhood of Mount Pleasant , was a horny-skinned , two-legged , money-getting species of spider who spun webs to catch unwary flies and retired into holes until they were entrapped .
Parsing [sent. 6587 len. 12]: The name of this old pagan 's god was Compound Interest .
Parsing [sent. 6588 len. 12]: He lived for it , married it , died of it .
Parsing [sent. 6589 len. 52]: Meeting with a heavy loss in an honest little enterprise in which all the loss was intended to have been on the other side , he broke something -- something necessary to his existence , therefore it could n't have been his heart -- and made an end of his career .
Parsing [sent. 6590 len. 49]: As his character was not good , and he had been bred at a charity school in a complete course , according to question and answer , of those ancient people the Amorites and Hittites , he was frequently quoted as an example of the failure of education .
Parsing [sent. 6591 len. 38]: His spirit shone through his son , to whom he had always preached of `` going out '' early in life and whom he made a clerk in a sharp scrivener 's office at twelve years old .
Parsing [sent. 6592 len. 31]: There the young gentleman improved his mind , which was of a lean and anxious character , and developing the family gifts , gradually elevated himself into the discounting profession .
Parsing [sent. 6593 len. 51]: Going out early in life and marrying late , as his father had done before him , he too begat a lean and anxious-minded son , who in his turn , going out early in life and marrying late , became the father of Bartholomew and Judith Smallweed , twins .
Parsing [sent. 6594 len. 59]: During the whole time consumed in the slow growth of this family tree , the house of Smallweed , always early to go out and late to marry , has strengthened itself in its practical character , has discarded all amusements , discountenanced all story-books , fairy-tales , fictions , and fables , and banished all levities whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 6595 len. 42]: Hence the gratifying fact that it has had no child born to it and that the complete little men and women whom it has produced have been observed to bear a likeness to old monkeys with something depressing on their minds .
Parsing [sent. 6596 len. 88]: At the present time , in the dark little parlour certain feet below the level of the street -- a grim , hard , uncouth parlour , only ornamented with the coarsest of baize table-covers , and the hardest of sheet-iron tea-trays , and offering in its decorative character no bad allegorical representation of Grandfather Smallweed 's mind -- seated in two black horsehair porter 's chairs , one on each side of the fire-place , the superannuated Mr. and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours .
Parsing [sent. 6597 len. 50]: On the stove are a couple of trivets for the pots and kettles which it is Grandfather Smallweed 's usual occupation to watch , and projecting from the chimney-piece between them is a sort of brass gallows for roasting , which he also superintends when it is in action .
Parsing [sent. 6598 len. 29]: Under the venerable Mr. Smallweed 's seat and guarded by his spindle legs is a drawer in his chair , reported to contain property to a fabulous amount .
Parsing [sent. 6599 len. 46]: Beside him is a spare cushion with which he is always provided in order that he may have something to throw at the venerable partner of his respected age whenever she makes an allusion to money -- a subject on which he is particularly sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 6600 len. 7]: `` And where 's Bart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6601 len. 11]: Grandfather Smallweed inquires of Judy , Bart 's twin sister .
Parsing [sent. 6602 len. 12]: `` He a n't come in yet , '' says Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6603 len. 11]: `` It 's his tea-time , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6604 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 6605 len. 13]: `` How much do you mean to say it wants then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6606 len. 5]: `` Ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6607 len. 4]: `` Hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6608 len. 5]: `` Ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6609 len. 9]: -LRB- Loud on the part of Judy . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6610 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6611 len. 4]: says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6612 len. 5]: `` Ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 6613 len. 40]: Grandmother Smallweed , who has been mumbling and shaking her head at the trivets , hearing figures mentioned , connects them with money and screeches like a horrible old parrot without any plumage , `` Ten ten-pound notes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6614 len. 9]: Grandfather Smallweed immediately throws the cushion at her .
Parsing [sent. 6615 len. 8]: `` Drat you , be quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6616 len. 6]: says the good old man .
Parsing [sent. 6617 len. 10]: The effect of this act of jaculation is twofold .
Parsing [sent. 6618 len. 60]: It not only doubles up Mrs. Smallweed 's head against the side of her porter 's chair and causes her to present , when extricated by her granddaughter , a highly unbecoming state of cap , but the necessary exertion recoils on Mr. Smallweed himself , whom it throws back into HIS porter 's chair like a broken puppet .
Parsing [sent. 6619 len. 58]: The excellent old gentleman being at these times a mere clothes-bag with a black skull-cap on the top of it , does not present a very animated appearance until he has undergone the two operations at the hands of his granddaughter of being shaken up like a great bottle and poked and punched like a great bolster .
Parsing [sent. 6620 len. 50]: Some indication of a neck being developed in him by these means , he and the sharer of his life 's evening again fronting one another in their two porter 's chairs , like a couple of sentinels long forgotten on their post by the Black Serjeant , Death .
Parsing [sent. 6621 len. 10]: Judy the twin is worthy company for these associates .
Parsing [sent. 6622 len. 68]: She is so indubitably sister to Mr. Smallweed the younger that the two kneaded into one would hardly make a young person of average proportions , while she so happily exemplifies the before-mentioned family likeness to the monkey tribe that attired in a spangled robe and cap she might walk about the table-land on the top of a barrel-organ without exciting much remark as an unusual specimen .
Parsing [sent. 6623 len. 19]: Under existing circumstances , however , she is dressed in a plain , spare gown of brown stuff .
Parsing [sent. 6624 len. 17]: Judy never owned a doll , never heard of Cinderella , never played at any game .
Parsing [sent. 6625 len. 36]: She once or twice fell into children 's company when she was about ten years old , but the children could n't get on with Judy , and Judy could n't get on with them .
Parsing [sent. 6626 len. 18]: She seemed like an animal of another species , and there was instinctive repugnance on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 6627 len. 11]: It is very doubtful whether Judy knows how to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 6628 len. 17]: She has so rarely seen the thing done that the probabilities are strong the other way .
Parsing [sent. 6629 len. 14]: Of anything like a youthful laugh , she certainly can have no conception .
Parsing [sent. 6630 len. 40]: If she were to try one , she would find her teeth in her way , modelling that action of her face , as she has unconsciously modelled all its other expressions , on her pattern of sordid age .
Parsing [sent. 6631 len. 4]: Such is Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6632 len. 14]: And her twin brother could n't wind up a top for his life .
Parsing [sent. 6633 len. 24]: He knows no more of Jack the Giant Killer or of Sinbad the Sailor than he knows of the people in the stars .
Parsing [sent. 6634 len. 20]: He could as soon play at leap-frog or at cricket as change into a cricket or a frog himself .
Parsing [sent. 6635 len. 35]: But he is so much the better off than his sister that on his narrow world of fact an opening has dawned into such broader regions as lie within the ken of Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 6636 len. 11]: Hence his admiration and his emulation of that shining enchanter .
Parsing [sent. 6637 len. 24]: Judy , with a gong-like clash and clatter , sets one of the sheet-iron tea-trays on the table and arranges cups and saucers .
Parsing [sent. 6638 len. 26]: The bread she puts on in an iron basket , and the butter -LRB- and not much of it -RRB- in a small pewter plate .
Parsing [sent. 6639 len. 20]: Grandfather Smallweed looks hard after the tea as it is served out and asks Judy where the girl is .
Parsing [sent. 6640 len. 8]: `` Charley , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6641 len. 3]: says Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6642 len. 4]: `` Hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6643 len. 4]: from Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6644 len. 8]: `` Charley , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6645 len. 24]: This touches a spring in Grandmother Smallweed , who , chuckling as usual at the trivets , cries , `` Over the water !
Parsing [sent. 6646 len. 28]: Charley over the water , Charley over the water , over the water to Charley , Charley over the water , over the water to Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6647 len. 7]: and becomes quite energetic about it .
Parsing [sent. 6648 len. 14]: Grandfather looks at the cushion but has not sufficiently recovered his late exertion .
Parsing [sent. 6649 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6650 len. 7]: he says when there is silence .
Parsing [sent. 6651 len. 7]: `` If that 's her name .
Parsing [sent. 6652 len. 5]: She eats a deal .
Parsing [sent. 6653 len. 12]: It would be better to allow her for her keep . ''
Parsing [sent. 6654 len. 22]: Judy , with her brother 's wink , shakes her head and purses up her mouth into no without saying it .
Parsing [sent. 6655 len. 4]: `` No ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6656 len. 5]: returns the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6657 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6658 len. 20]: `` She 'd want sixpence a day , and we can do it for less , '' says Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6659 len. 4]: `` Sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6660 len. 40]: Judy answers with a nod of deepest meaning and calls , as she scrapes the butter on the loaf with every precaution against waste and cuts it into slices , `` You , Charley , where are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6661 len. 40]: Timidly obedient to the summons , a little girl in a rough apron and a large bonnet , with her hands covered with soap and water and a scrubbing brush in one of them , appears , and curtsys .
Parsing [sent. 6662 len. 9]: `` What work are you about now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6663 len. 16]: says Judy , making an ancient snap at her like a very sharp old beldame .
Parsing [sent. 6664 len. 15]: `` I 'm a-cleaning the upstairs back room , miss , '' replies Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6665 len. 12]: `` Mind you do it thoroughly , and do n't loiter .
Parsing [sent. 6666 len. 7]: Shirking wo n't do for me .
Parsing [sent. 6667 len. 3]: Make haste !
Parsing [sent. 6668 len. 4]: Go along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6669 len. 9]: cries Judy with a stamp upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 6670 len. 15]: `` You girls are more trouble than you 're worth , by half . ''
Parsing [sent. 6671 len. 33]: On this severe matron , as she returns to her task of scraping the butter and cutting the bread , falls the shadow of her brother , looking in at the window .
Parsing [sent. 6672 len. 14]: For whom , knife and loaf in hand , she opens the street-door .
Parsing [sent. 6673 len. 8]: `` Aye , aye , Bart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6674 len. 4]: says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6675 len. 8]: `` Here you are , hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6676 len. 9]: `` Here I am , '' says Bart .
Parsing [sent. 6677 len. 11]: `` Been along with your friend again , Bart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6678 len. 3]: Small nods .
Parsing [sent. 6679 len. 9]: `` Dining at his expense , Bart ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6680 len. 4]: Small nods again .
Parsing [sent. 6681 len. 5]: `` That 's right .
Parsing [sent. 6682 len. 18]: Live at his expense as much as you can , and take warning by his foolish example .
Parsing [sent. 6683 len. 9]: That 's the use of such a friend .
Parsing [sent. 6684 len. 15]: The only use you can put him to , '' says the venerable sage .
Parsing [sent. 6685 len. 38]: His grandson , without receiving this good counsel as dutifully as he might , honours it with all such acceptance as may lie in a slight wink and a nod and takes a chair at the tea-table .
Parsing [sent. 6686 len. 41]: The four old faces then hover over teacups like a company of ghastly cherubim , Mrs. Smallweed perpetually twitching her head and chattering at the trivets and Mr. Smallweed requiring to be repeatedly shaken up like a large black draught .
Parsing [sent. 6687 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , '' says the good old gentleman , reverting to his lesson of wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 6688 len. 15]: `` That 's such advice as your father would have given you , Bart .
Parsing [sent. 6689 len. 6]: You never saw your father .
Parsing [sent. 6690 len. 5]: More 's the pity .
Parsing [sent. 6691 len. 7]: He was my true son . ''
Parsing [sent. 6692 len. 24]: Whether it is intended to be conveyed that he was particularly pleasant to look at , on that account , does not appear .
Parsing [sent. 6693 len. 34]: `` He was my true son , '' repeats the old gentleman , folding his bread and butter on his knee , `` a good accountant , and died fifteen years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 6694 len. 16]: Mrs. Smallweed , following her usual instinct , breaks out with `` Fifteen hundred pound .
Parsing [sent. 6695 len. 23]: Fifteen hundred pound in a black box , fifteen hundred pound locked up , fifteen hundred pound put away and hid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6696 len. 36]: Her worthy husband , setting aside his bread and butter , immediately discharges the cushion at her , crushes her against the side of her chair , and falls back in his own , overpowered .
Parsing [sent. 6697 len. 81]: His appearance , after visiting Mrs. Smallweed with one of these admonitions , is particularly impressive and not wholly prepossessing , firstly because the exertion generally twists his black skull-cap over one eye and gives him an air of goblin rakishness , secondly because he mutters violent imprecations against Mrs. Smallweed , and thirdly because the contrast between those powerful expressions and his powerless figure is suggestive of a baleful old malignant who would be very wicked if he could .
Parsing [sent. 6698 len. 19]: All this , however , is so common in the Smallweed family circle that it produces no impression .
Parsing [sent. 6699 len. 55]: The old gentleman is merely shaken and has his internal feathers beaten up , the cushion is restored to its usual place beside him , and the old lady , perhaps with her cap adjusted and perhaps not , is planted in her chair again , ready to be bowled down like a ninepin .
Parsing [sent. 6700 len. 50]: Some time elapses in the present instance before the old gentleman is sufficiently cool to resume his discourse , and even then he mixes it up with several edifying expletives addressed to the unconscious partner of his bosom , who holds communication with nothing on earth but the trivets .
Parsing [sent. 6701 len. 28]: As thus : `` If your father , Bart , had lived longer , he might have been worth a deal of money -- you brimstone chatterer !
Parsing [sent. 6702 len. 42]: -- but just as he was beginning to build up the house that he had been making the foundations for , through many a year -- you jade of a magpie , jackdaw , and poll-parrot , what do you mean !
Parsing [sent. 6703 len. 53]: -- he took ill and died of a low fever , always being a sparing and a spare man , full of business care -- I should like to throw a cat at you instead of a cushion , and I will too if you make such a confounded fool of yourself !
Parsing [sent. 6704 len. 34]: -- and your mother , who was a prudent woman as dry as a chip , just dwindled away like touchwood after you and Judy were born -- you are an old pig .
Parsing [sent. 6705 len. 6]: You are a brimstone pig .
Parsing [sent. 6706 len. 8]: You 're a head of swine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6707 len. 45]: Judy , not interested in what she has often heard , begins to collect in a basin various tributary streams of tea , from the bottoms of cups and saucers and from the bottom of the teapot for the little charwoman 's evening meal .
Parsing [sent. 6708 len. 33]: In like manner she gets together , in the iron bread-basket , as many outside fragments and worn-down heels of loaves as the rigid economy of the house has left in existence .
Parsing [sent. 6709 len. 33]: `` But your father and me were partners , Bart , '' says the old gentleman , `` and when I am gone , you and Judy will have all there is .
Parsing [sent. 6710 len. 26]: It 's rare for you both that you went out early in life -- Judy to the flower business , and you to the law .
Parsing [sent. 6711 len. 8]: You wo n't want to spend it .
Parsing [sent. 6712 len. 14]: You 'll get your living without it , and put more to it .
Parsing [sent. 6713 len. 23]: When I am gone , Judy will go back to the flower business and you 'll still stick to the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 6714 len. 36]: One might infer from Judy 's appearance that her business rather lay with the thorns than the flowers , but she has in her time been apprenticed to the art and mystery of artificial flower-making .
Parsing [sent. 6715 len. 46]: A close observer might perhaps detect both in her eye and her brother 's , when their venerable grandsire anticipates his being gone , some little impatience to know when he may be going , and some resentful opinion that it is time he went .
Parsing [sent. 6716 len. 27]: `` Now , if everybody has done , '' says Judy , completing her preparations , `` I 'll have that girl in to her tea .
Parsing [sent. 6717 len. 16]: She would never leave off if she took it by herself in the kitchen . ''
Parsing [sent. 6718 len. 27]: Charley is accordingly introduced , and under a heavy fire of eyes , sits down to her basin and a Druidical ruin of bread and butter .
Parsing [sent. 6719 len. 26]: In the active superintendence of this young person , Judy Smallweed appears to attain a perfectly geological age and to date from the remotest periods .
Parsing [sent. 6720 len. 39]: Her systematic manner of flying at her and pouncing on her , with or without pretence , whether or no , is wonderful , evincing an accomplishment in the art of girl-driving seldom reached by the oldest practitioners .
Parsing [sent. 6721 len. 53]: `` Now , do n't stare about you all the afternoon , '' cries Judy , shaking her head and stamping her foot as she happens to catch the glance which has been previously sounding the basin of tea , `` but take your victuals and get back to your work . ''
Parsing [sent. 6722 len. 9]: `` Yes , miss , '' says Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6723 len. 20]: `` Do n't say yes , '' returns Miss Smallweed , `` for I know what you girls are .
Parsing [sent. 6724 len. 16]: Do it without saying it , and then I may begin to believe you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6725 len. 39]: Charley swallows a great gulp of tea in token of submission and so disperses the Druidical ruins that Miss Smallweed charges her not to gormandize , which `` in you girls , '' she observes , is disgusting .
Parsing [sent. 6726 len. 24]: Charley might find some more difficulty in meeting her views on the general subject of girls but for a knock at the door .
Parsing [sent. 6727 len. 16]: `` See who it is , and do n't chew when you open it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6728 len. 3]: cries Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6729 len. 52]: The object of her attentions withdrawing for the purpose , Miss Smallweed takes that opportunity of jumbling the remainder of the bread and butter together and launching two or three dirty tea-cups into the ebb-tide of the basin of tea as a hint that she considers the eating and drinking terminated .
Parsing [sent. 6730 len. 3]: `` Now !
Parsing [sent. 6731 len. 10]: Who is it , and what 's wanted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6732 len. 5]: says the snappish Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6733 len. 9]: It is one Mr. George , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 6734 len. 11]: Without other announcement or ceremony , Mr. George walks in .
Parsing [sent. 6735 len. 4]: `` Whew ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6736 len. 4]: says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 6737 len. 6]: `` You are hot here .
Parsing [sent. 6738 len. 6]: Always a fire , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 6739 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 6740 len. 11]: Perhaps you do right to get used to one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6741 len. 15]: Mr. George makes the latter remark to himself as he nods to Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6742 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 6743 len. 5]: It 's you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6744 len. 5]: cries the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 6745 len. 5]: `` How de do ?
Parsing [sent. 6746 len. 5]: How de do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6747 len. 12]: `` Middling , '' replies Mr. George , taking a chair .
Parsing [sent. 6748 len. 20]: `` Your granddaughter I have had the honour of seeing before ; my service to you , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 6749 len. 11]: `` This is my grandson , '' says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6750 len. 9]: `` You ha 'n' t seen him before .
Parsing [sent. 6751 len. 12]: He is in the law and not much at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 6752 len. 8]: `` My service to him , too !
Parsing [sent. 6753 len. 6]: He is like his sister .
Parsing [sent. 6754 len. 7]: He is very like his sister .
Parsing [sent. 6755 len. 25]: He is devilish like his sister , '' says Mr. George , laying a great and not altogether complimentary stress on his last adjective .
Parsing [sent. 6756 len. 13]: `` And how does the world use you , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6757 len. 9]: Grandfather Smallweed inquires , slowly rubbing his legs .
Parsing [sent. 6758 len. 6]: `` Pretty much as usual .
Parsing [sent. 6759 len. 5]: Like a football . ''
Parsing [sent. 6760 len. 29]: He is a swarthy brown man of fifty , well made , and good looking , with crisp dark hair , bright eyes , and a broad chest .
Parsing [sent. 6761 len. 22]: His sinewy and powerful hands , as sunburnt as his face , have evidently been used to a pretty rough life .
Parsing [sent. 6762 len. 36]: What is curious about him is that he sits forward on his chair as if he were , from long habit , allowing space for some dress or accoutrements that he has altogether laid aside .
Parsing [sent. 6763 len. 20]: His step too is measured and heavy and would go well with a weighty clash and jingle of spurs .
Parsing [sent. 6764 len. 47]: He is close-shaved now , but his mouth is set as if his upper lip had been for years familiar with a great moustache ; and his manner of occasionally laying the open palm of his broad brown hand upon it is to the same effect .
Parsing [sent. 6765 len. 16]: Altogether one might guess Mr. George to have been a trooper once upon a time .
Parsing [sent. 6766 len. 11]: A special contrast Mr. George makes to the Smallweed family .
Parsing [sent. 6767 len. 12]: Trooper was never yet billeted upon a household more unlike him .
Parsing [sent. 6768 len. 8]: It is a broadsword to an oyster-knife .
Parsing [sent. 6769 len. 41]: His developed figure and their stunted forms , his large manner filling any amount of room and their little narrow pinched ways , his sounding voice and their sharp spare tones , are in the strongest and the strangest opposition .
Parsing [sent. 6770 len. 58]: As he sits in the middle of the grim parlour , leaning a little forward , with his hands upon his thighs and his elbows squared , he looks as though , if he remained there long , he would absorb into himself the whole family and the whole four-roomed house , extra little back-kitchen and all .
Parsing [sent. 6771 len. 13]: `` Do you rub your legs to rub life into 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6772 len. 11]: he asks of Grandfather Smallweed after looking round the room .
Parsing [sent. 6773 len. 26]: `` Why , it 's partly a habit , Mr. George , and -- yes -- it partly helps the circulation , '' he replies .
Parsing [sent. 6774 len. 5]: `` The cir-cu-la-tion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6775 len. 18]: repeats Mr. George , folding his arms upon his chest and seeming to become two sizes larger .
Parsing [sent. 6776 len. 11]: `` Not much of that , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 6777 len. 14]: `` Truly I 'm old , Mr. George , '' says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6778 len. 8]: `` But I can carry my years .
Parsing [sent. 6779 len. 19]: I 'm older than HER , '' nodding at his wife , `` and see what she is ?
Parsing [sent. 6780 len. 7]: You 're a brimstone chatterer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6781 len. 9]: with a sudden revival of his late hostility .
Parsing [sent. 6782 len. 6]: `` Unlucky old soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6783 len. 11]: says Mr. George , turning his head in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 6784 len. 8]: `` Do n't scold the old lady .
Parsing [sent. 6785 len. 22]: Look at her here , with her poor cap half off her head and her poor hair all in a muddle .
Parsing [sent. 6786 len. 5]: Hold up , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 6787 len. 4]: That 's better .
Parsing [sent. 6788 len. 4]: There we are !
Parsing [sent. 6789 len. 31]: Think of your mother , Mr. Smallweed , '' says Mr. George , coming back to his seat from assisting her , `` if your wife a n't enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 6790 len. 13]: `` I suppose you were an excellent son , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6791 len. 8]: the old man hints with a leer .
Parsing [sent. 6792 len. 17]: The colour of Mr. George 's face rather deepens as he replies , `` Why no .
Parsing [sent. 6793 len. 5]: I was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 6794 len. 8]: `` I am astonished at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 6795 len. 23]: `` So am I. I ought to have been a good son , and I think I meant to have been one .
Parsing [sent. 6796 len. 5]: But I was n't .
Parsing [sent. 6797 len. 26]: I was a thundering bad son , that 's the long and the short of it , and never was a credit to anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 6798 len. 4]: `` Surprising ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6799 len. 5]: cries the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6800 len. 19]: `` However , '' Mr. George resumes , `` the less said about it , the better now .
Parsing [sent. 6801 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 6802 len. 5]: You know the agreement .
Parsing [sent. 6803 len. 11]: Always a pipe out of the two months ' interest !
Parsing [sent. 6804 len. 3]: -LRB- Bosh !
Parsing [sent. 6805 len. 5]: It 's all correct .
Parsing [sent. 6806 len. 10]: You need n't be afraid to order the pipe .
Parsing [sent. 6807 len. 33]: Here 's the new bill , and here 's the two months ' interest-money , and a devil-and-all of a scrape it is to get it together in my business . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 6808 len. 69]: Mr. George sits , with his arms folded , consuming the family and the parlour while Grandfather Smallweed is assisted by Judy to two black leathern cases out of a locked bureau , in one of which he secures the document he has just received , and from the other takes another similar document which he hands to Mr. George , who twists it up for a pipelight .
Parsing [sent. 6809 len. 73]: As the old man inspects , through his glasses , every up-stroke and down-stroke of both documents before he releases them from their leathern prison , and as he counts the money three times over and requires Judy to say every word she utters at least twice , and is as tremulously slow of speech and action as it is possible to be , this business is a long time in progress .
Parsing [sent. 6810 len. 36]: When it is quite concluded , and not before , he disengages his ravenous eyes and fingers from it and answers Mr. George 's last remark by saying , `` Afraid to order the pipe ?
Parsing [sent. 6811 len. 10]: We are not so mercenary as that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6812 len. 18]: Judy , see directly to the pipe and the glass of cold brandy-and-water for Mr. George . ''
Parsing [sent. 6813 len. 55]: The sportive twins , who have been looking straight before them all this time except when they have been engrossed by the black leathern cases , retire together , generally disdainful of the visitor , but leaving him to the old man as two young cubs might leave a traveller to the parental bear .
Parsing [sent. 6814 len. 17]: `` And there you sit , I suppose , all the day long , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6815 len. 7]: says Mr. George with folded arms .
Parsing [sent. 6816 len. 13]: `` Just so , just so , '' the old man nods .
Parsing [sent. 6817 len. 11]: `` And do n't you occupy yourself at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6818 len. 28]: `` I watch the fire -- and the boiling and the roasting -- '' `` When there is any , '' says Mr. George with great expression .
Parsing [sent. 6819 len. 4]: `` Just so .
Parsing [sent. 6820 len. 6]: When there is any . ''
Parsing [sent. 6821 len. 11]: `` Do n't you read or get read to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6822 len. 11]: The old man shakes his head with sharp sly triumph .
Parsing [sent. 6823 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 6824 len. 9]: We have never been readers in our family .
Parsing [sent. 6825 len. 5]: It do n't pay .
Parsing [sent. 6826 len. 2]: Stuff .
Parsing [sent. 6827 len. 2]: Idleness .
Parsing [sent. 6828 len. 2]: Folly .
Parsing [sent. 6829 len. 5]: No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6830 len. 41]: `` There 's not much to choose between your two states , '' says the visitor in a key too low for the old man 's dull hearing as he looks from him to the old woman and back again .
Parsing [sent. 6831 len. 5]: `` I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6832 len. 5]: in a louder voice .
Parsing [sent. 6833 len. 6]: `` I hear you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6834 len. 21]: `` You 'll sell me up at last , I suppose , when I am a day in arrear . ''
Parsing [sent. 6835 len. 6]: `` My dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6836 len. 12]: cries Grandfather Smallweed , stretching out both hands to embrace him .
Parsing [sent. 6837 len. 3]: `` Never !
Parsing [sent. 6838 len. 6]: Never , my dear friend !
Parsing [sent. 6839 len. 19]: But my friend in the city that I got to lend you the money -- HE might ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6840 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 6841 len. 8]: You ca n't answer for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6842 len. 21]: says Mr. George , finishing the inquiry in his lower key with the words `` You lying old rascal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6843 len. 13]: `` My dear friend , he is not to be depended on .
Parsing [sent. 6844 len. 6]: I would n't trust him .
Parsing [sent. 6845 len. 11]: He will have his bond , my dear friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 6846 len. 10]: `` Devil doubt him , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 6847 len. 33]: Charley appearing with a tray , on which are the pipe , a small paper of tobacco , and the brandy-and-water , he asks her , `` How do you come here !
Parsing [sent. 6848 len. 9]: You have n't got the family face . ''
Parsing [sent. 6849 len. 13]: `` I goes out to work , sir , '' returns Charley .
Parsing [sent. 6850 len. 33]: The trooper -LRB- if trooper he be or have been -RRB- takes her bonnet off , with a light touch for so strong a hand , and pats her on the head .
Parsing [sent. 6851 len. 10]: `` You give the house almost a wholesome look .
Parsing [sent. 6852 len. 15]: It wants a bit of youth as much as it wants fresh air . ''
Parsing [sent. 6853 len. 32]: Then he dismisses her , lights his pipe , and drinks to Mr. Smallweed 's friend in the city -- the one solitary flight of that esteemed old gentleman 's imagination .
Parsing [sent. 6854 len. 14]: `` So you think he might be hard upon me , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6855 len. 12]: `` I think he might -- I am afraid he would .
Parsing [sent. 6856 len. 18]: I have known him do it , '' says Grandfather Smallweed incautiously , `` twenty times . ''
Parsing [sent. 6857 len. 85]: Incautiously , because his stricken better-half , who has been dozing over the fire for some time , is instantly aroused and jabbers `` Twenty thousand pounds , twenty twenty-pound notes in a money-box , twenty guineas , twenty million twenty per cent , twenty -- '' and is then cut short by the flying cushion , which the visitor , to whom this singular experiment appears to be a novelty , snatches from her face as it crushes her in the usual manner .
Parsing [sent. 6858 len. 7]: `` You 're a brimstone idiot .
Parsing [sent. 6859 len. 9]: You 're a scorpion -- a brimstone scorpion !
Parsing [sent. 6860 len. 6]: You 're a sweltering toad .
Parsing [sent. 6861 len. 14]: You 're a chattering clattering broomstick witch that ought to be burnt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6862 len. 10]: gasps the old man , prostrate in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 6863 len. 14]: `` My dear friend , will you shake me up a little ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6864 len. 76]: Mr. George , who has been looking first at one of them and then at the other , as if he were demented , takes his venerable acquaintance by the throat on receiving this request , and dragging him upright in his chalr as easily as if he were a doll , appears in two minds whether or no to shake all future power of cushioning out of him and shake him into his grave .
Parsing [sent. 6865 len. 49]: Resisting the temptation , but agitating him violently enough to make his head roll like a harlequin 's , he puts him smartly down in his chair again and adjusts his skull-cap with such a rub that the old man winks with both eyes for a minute afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 6866 len. 5]: `` O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6867 len. 4]: gasps Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6868 len. 5]: `` That 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 6869 len. 11]: Thank you , my dear friend , that 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 6870 len. 11]: Oh , dear me , I 'm out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 6871 len. 4]: O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6872 len. 24]: And Mr. Smallweed says it not without evident apprehensions of his dear friend , who still stands over him looming larger than ever .
Parsing [sent. 6873 len. 52]: The alarming presence , however , gradually subsides into its chair and falls to smoking in long puffs , consoling itself with the philosophical reflection , `` The name of your friend in the city begins with a D , comrade , and you 're about right respecting the bond . ''
Parsing [sent. 6874 len. 9]: `` Did you speak , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6875 len. 5]: inquires the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6876 len. 49]: The trooper shakes his head , and leaning forward with his right elbow on his right knee and his pipe supported in that hand , while his other hand , resting on his left leg , squares his left elbow in a martial manner , continues to smoke .
Parsing [sent. 6877 len. 30]: Meanwhile he looks at Mr. Smallweed with grave attention and now and then fans the cloud of smoke away in order that he may see him the more clearly .
Parsing [sent. 6878 len. 63]: `` I take it , '' he says , making just as much and as little change in his position as will enable him to reach the glass to his lips with a round , full action , `` that I am the only man alive -LRB- or dead either -RRB- that gets the value of a pipe out of YOU ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6879 len. 30]: `` Well , '' returns the old man , `` it 's true that I do n't see company , Mr. George , and that I do n't treat .
Parsing [sent. 6880 len. 7]: I ca n't afford to it .
Parsing [sent. 6881 len. 34]: But as you , in your pleasant way , made your pipe a condition -- '' `` Why , it 's not for the value of it ; that 's no great thing .
Parsing [sent. 6882 len. 11]: It was a fancy to get it out of you .
Parsing [sent. 6883 len. 9]: To have something in for my money . ''
Parsing [sent. 6884 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 6885 len. 9]: You 're prudent , prudent , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6886 len. 8]: cries Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs .
Parsing [sent. 6887 len. 3]: `` Very .
Parsing [sent. 6888 len. 5]: I always was . ''
Parsing [sent. 6889 len. 2]: Puff .
Parsing [sent. 6890 len. 18]: `` It 's a sure sign of my prudence that I ever found the way here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6891 len. 2]: Puff .
Parsing [sent. 6892 len. 11]: `` Also , that I am what I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 6893 len. 2]: Puff .
Parsing [sent. 6894 len. 17]: `` I am well known to be prudent , '' says Mr. George , composedly smoking .
Parsing [sent. 6895 len. 9]: `` I rose in life that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 6896 len. 8]: `` Do n't he down-hearted , sir .
Parsing [sent. 6897 len. 6]: You may rise yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 6898 len. 6]: Mr. George laughs and drinks .
Parsing [sent. 6899 len. 56]: `` Ha 'n' t you no relations , now , '' asks Grandfather Smallweed with a twinkle in his eyes , `` who would pay off this little principal or who would lend you a good name or two that I could persuade my friend in the city to make you a further advance upon ?
Parsing [sent. 6900 len. 13]: Two good names would be sufficient for my friend in the city .
Parsing [sent. 6901 len. 12]: Ha 'n' t you no such relations , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6902 len. 20]: Mr. George , still composedly smoking , replies , `` If I had , I should n't trouble them .
Parsing [sent. 6903 len. 12]: I have been trouble enough to my belongings in my day .
Parsing [sent. 6904 len. 49]: It MAY be a very good sort of penitence in a vagabond , who has wasted the best time of his life , to go back then to decent people that he never was a credit to and live upon them , but it 's not my sort .
Parsing [sent. 6905 len. 20]: The best kind of amends then for having gone away is to keep away , in my opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 6906 len. 13]: `` But natural affection , Mr. George , '' hints Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 6907 len. 9]: `` For two good names , hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6908 len. 12]: says Mr. George , shaking his head and still composedly smoking .
Parsing [sent. 6909 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6910 len. 8]: That 's not my sort either . ''
Parsing [sent. 6911 len. 30]: Grandfather Smallweed has been gradually sliding down in his chair since his last adjustment and is now a bundle of clothes with a voice in it calling for Judy .
Parsing [sent. 6912 len. 24]: That houri , appearing , shakes him up in the usual manner and is charged by the old gentleman to remain near him .
Parsing [sent. 6913 len. 17]: For he seems chary of putting his visitor to the trouble of repeating his late attentions .
Parsing [sent. 6914 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6915 len. 9]: he observes when he is in trim again .
Parsing [sent. 6916 len. 22]: `` If you could have traced out the captain , Mr. George , it would have been the making of you .
Parsing [sent. 6917 len. 91]: If when you first came here , in consequence of our advertisement in the newspapers -- when I say ` our , ' I 'm alluding to the advertisements of my friend in the city , and one or two others who embark their capital in the same way , and are so friendly towards me as sometimes to give me a lift with my little pittance -- if at that time you could have helped us , Mr. George , it would have been the making of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 6918 len. 83]: `` I was willing enough to be ` made , ' as you call it , '' says Mr. George , smoking not quite so placidly as before , for since the entrance of Judy he has been in some measure disturbed by a fascination , not of the admiring kind , which obliges him to look at her as she stands by her grandfather 's chair , `` but on the whole , I am glad I was n't now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6919 len. 6]: `` Why , Mr. George ?
Parsing [sent. 6920 len. 11]: In the name of -- of brimstone , why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6921 len. 10]: says Grandfather Smallweed with a plain appearance of exasperation .
Parsing [sent. 6922 len. 16]: -LRB- Brimstone apparently suggested by his eye lighting on Mrs. Smallweed in her slumber . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 6923 len. 8]: `` For two reasons , comrade . ''
Parsing [sent. 6924 len. 9]: `` And what two reasons , Mr. George ?
Parsing [sent. 6925 len. 16]: In the name of the -- '' `` Of our friend in the city ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6926 len. 7]: suggests Mr. George , composedly drinking .
Parsing [sent. 6927 len. 7]: `` Aye , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 6928 len. 5]: What two reasons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6929 len. 44]: `` In the first place , '' returns Mr. George , but still looking at Judy as if she being so old and so like her grandfather it is indifferent which of the two he addresses , `` you gentlemen took me in .
Parsing [sent. 6930 len. 35]: You advertised that Mr. Hawdon -LRB- Captain Hawdon , if you hold to the saying ` Once a captain , always a captain ' -RRB- was to hear of something to his advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 6931 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6932 len. 8]: returns the old man shrilly and sharply .
Parsing [sent. 6933 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6934 len. 7]: says Mr. George , smoking on .
Parsing [sent. 6935 len. 27]: `` It would n't have been much to his advantage to have been clapped into prison by the whole bill and judgment trade of London . ''
Parsing [sent. 6936 len. 7]: `` How do you know that ?
Parsing [sent. 6937 len. 15]: Some of his rich relations might have paid his debts or compounded for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 6938 len. 8]: Besides , he had taken US in .
Parsing [sent. 6939 len. 8]: He owed us immense sums all round .
Parsing [sent. 6940 len. 11]: I would sooner have strangled him than had no return .
Parsing [sent. 6941 len. 30]: If I sit here thinking of him , '' snarls the old man , holding up his impotent ten fingers , `` I want to strangle him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 6942 len. 29]: And in a sudden access of fury , he throws the cushion at the unoffending Mrs. Smallweed , but it passes harmlessly on one side of her chair .
Parsing [sent. 6943 len. 54]: `` I do n't need to be told , '' returns the trooper , taking his pipe from his lips for a moment and carrying his eyes back from following the progress of the cushion to the pipe-bowl which is burning low , `` that he carried on heavily and went to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 6944 len. 18]: I have been at his right hand many a day when he was charging upon ruin full-gallop .
Parsing [sent. 6945 len. 15]: I was with him when he was sick and well , rich and poor .
Parsing [sent. 6946 len. 29]: I laid this hand upon him after he had run through everything and broken down everything beneath him -- when he held a pistol to his head . ''
Parsing [sent. 6947 len. 31]: `` I wish he had let it off , '' says the benevolent old man , `` and blown his head into as many pieces as he owed pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6948 len. 59]: `` That would have been a smash indeed , '' returns the trooper coolly ; `` any way , he had been young , hopeful , and handsome in the days gone by , and I am glad I never found him , when he was neither , to lead to a result so much to his advantage .
Parsing [sent. 6949 len. 7]: That 's reason number one . ''
Parsing [sent. 6950 len. 10]: `` I hope number two 's as good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6951 len. 5]: snarls the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6952 len. 5]: `` Why , no .
Parsing [sent. 6953 len. 8]: It 's more of a selfish reason .
Parsing [sent. 6954 len. 17]: If I had found him , I must have gone to the other world to look .
Parsing [sent. 6955 len. 5]: He was there . ''
Parsing [sent. 6956 len. 10]: `` How do you know he was there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6957 len. 7]: `` He was n't here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6958 len. 11]: `` How do you know he was n't here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6959 len. 26]: `` Do n't lose your temper as well as your money , '' says Mr. George , calmly knocking the ashes out of his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 6960 len. 7]: `` He was drowned long before .
Parsing [sent. 6961 len. 6]: I am convinced of it .
Parsing [sent. 6962 len. 8]: He went over a ship 's side .
Parsing [sent. 6963 len. 10]: Whether intentionally or accidentally , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 6964 len. 8]: Perhaps your friend in the city does .
Parsing [sent. 6965 len. 12]: Do you know what that tune is , Mr. Smallweed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6966 len. 18]: he adds after breaking off to whistle one , accompanied on the table with the empty pipe .
Parsing [sent. 6967 len. 4]: `` Tune ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6968 len. 5]: replied the old man .
Parsing [sent. 6969 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 6970 len. 7]: We never have tunes here . ''
Parsing [sent. 6971 len. 9]: `` That 's the Dead March in Saul .
Parsing [sent. 6972 len. 16]: They bury soldiers to it , so it 's the natural end of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 6973 len. 34]: Now , if your pretty granddaughter -- excuse me , miss -- will condescend to take care of this pipe for two months , we shall save the cost of one next time .
Parsing [sent. 6974 len. 7]: Good evening , Mr. Smallweed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6975 len. 6]: `` My dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6976 len. 9]: the old man gives him both his hands .
Parsing [sent. 6977 len. 22]: `` So you think your friend in the city will be hard upon me if I fall in a payment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 6978 len. 12]: says the trooper , looking down upon him like a giant .
Parsing [sent. 6979 len. 25]: `` My dear friend , I am afraid he will , '' returns the old man , looking up at him like a pygmy .
Parsing [sent. 6980 len. 37]: Mr. George laughs , and with a glance at Mr. Smallweed and a parting salutation to the scornful Judy , strides out of the parlour , clashing imaginary sabres and other metallic appurtenances as he goes .
Parsing [sent. 6981 len. 25]: `` You 're a damned rogue , '' says the old gentleman , making a hideous grimace at the door as he shuts it .
Parsing [sent. 6982 len. 16]: `` But I 'll lime you , you dog , I 'll lime you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6983 len. 47]: After this amiable remark , his spirit soars into those enchanting regions of reflection which its education and pursuits have opened to it , and again he and Mrs. Smallweed while away the rosy hours , two unrelieved sentinels forgotten as aforesaid by the Black Serjeant .
Parsing [sent. 6984 len. 26]: While the twain are faithful to their post , Mr. George strides through the streets with a massive kind of swagger and a grave-enough face .
Parsing [sent. 6985 len. 14]: It is eight o'clock now , and the day is fast drawing in .
Parsing [sent. 6986 len. 19]: He stops hard by Waterloo Bridge and reads a playbill , decides to go to Astley 's Theatre .
Parsing [sent. 6987 len. 43]: Being there , is much delighted with the horses and the feats of strength ; looks at the weapons with a critical eye ; disapproves of the combats as giving evidences of unskilful swordsmanship ; but is touched home by the sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 6988 len. 38]: In the last scene , when the Emperor of Tartary gets up into a cart and condescends to bless the united lovers by hovering over them with the Union Jack , his eyelashes are moistened with emotion .
Parsing [sent. 6989 len. 67]: The theatre over , Mr. George comes across the water again and makes his way to that curious region lying about the Haymarket and Leicester Square which is a centre of attraction to indifferent foreign hotels and indifferent foreigners , racket-courts , fighting-men , swordsmen , footguards , old china , gaming-houses , exhibitions , and a large medley of shabbiness and shrinking out of sight .
Parsing [sent. 6990 len. 110]: Penetrating to the heart of this region , he arrives by a court and a long whitewashed passage at a great brick building composed of bare walls , floors , roof-rafters , and skylights , on the front of which , if it can be said to have any front , is painted GEORGE 'S SHOOTING GALLERY , & c. Into George 's Shooting Gallery , & c. , he goes ; and in it there are gaslights -LRB- partly turned off now -RRB- , and two whitened targets for rifle-shooting , and archery accommodation , and fencing appliances , and all necessaries for the British art of boxing .
Parsing [sent. 6991 len. 42]: None of these sports or exercises being pursued in George 's Shooting Gallery to-night , which is so devoid of company that a little grotesque man with a large head has it all to himself and lies asleep upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 6992 len. 34]: The little man is dressed something like a gunsmith , in a green-baize apron and cap ; and his face and hands are dirty with gunpowder and begrimed with the loading of guns .
Parsing [sent. 6993 len. 19]: As he lies in the light before a glaring white target , the black upon him shines again .
Parsing [sent. 6994 len. 23]: Not far off is the strong , rough , primitive table with a vice upon it at which he has been working .
Parsing [sent. 6995 len. 48]: He is a little man with a face all crushed together , who appears , from a certain blue and speckled appearance that one of his cheeks presents , to have been blown up , in the way of business , at some odd time or times .
Parsing [sent. 6996 len. 4]: `` Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6997 len. 8]: says the trooper in a quiet voice .
Parsing [sent. 6998 len. 5]: `` All right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 6999 len. 8]: cries Phil , scrambling to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 7000 len. 6]: `` Anything been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7001 len. 12]: `` Flat as ever so much swipes , '' says Phil .
Parsing [sent. 7002 len. 9]: `` Five dozen rifle and a dozen pistol .
Parsing [sent. 7003 len. 5]: As to aim ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7004 len. 8]: Phil gives a howl at the recollection .
Parsing [sent. 7005 len. 8]: `` Shut up shop , Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7006 len. 23]: As Phil moves about to execute this order , it appears that he is lame , though able to move very quickly .
Parsing [sent. 7007 len. 38]: On the speckled side of his face he has no eyebrow , and on the other side he has a bushy black one , which want of uniformity gives him a very singular and rather sinister appearance .
Parsing [sent. 7008 len. 35]: Everything seems to have happened to his hands that could possibly take place consistently with the retention of all the fingers , for they are notched , and seamed , and crumpled all over .
Parsing [sent. 7009 len. 21]: He appears to be very strong and lifts heavy benches about as if he had no idea what weight was .
Parsing [sent. 7010 len. 53]: He has a curious way of limping round the gallery with his shoulder against the wall and tacking off at objects he wants to lay hold of instead of going straight to them , which has left a smear all round the four walls , conventionally called `` Phil 's mark . ''
Parsing [sent. 7011 len. 51]: This custodian of George 's Gallery in George 's absence concludes his proceedings , when he has locked the great doors and turned out all the lights but one , which he leaves to glimmer , by dragging out from a wooden cabin in a corner two mattresses and bedding .
Parsing [sent. 7012 len. 21]: These being drawn to opposite ends of the gallery , the trooper makes his own bed and Phil makes his .
Parsing [sent. 7013 len. 4]: `` Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7014 len. 23]: says the master , walking towards him without his coat and waistcoat , and looking more soldierly than ever in his braces .
Parsing [sent. 7015 len. 13]: `` You were found in a doorway , were n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7016 len. 7]: `` Gutter , '' says Phil .
Parsing [sent. 7017 len. 7]: `` Watchman tumbled over me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7018 len. 12]: `` Then vagabondizing came natural to YOU from the beginning . ''
Parsing [sent. 7019 len. 12]: `` As nat ` ral as possible , '' says Phil .
Parsing [sent. 7020 len. 5]: `` Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7021 len. 9]: `` Good night , guv ` ner . ''
Parsing [sent. 7022 len. 29]: Phil can not even go straight to bed , but finds it necessary to shoulder round two sides of the gallery and then tack off at his mattress .
Parsing [sent. 7023 len. 39]: The trooper , after taking a turn or two in the rifle-distance and looking up at the moon now shining through the skylights , strides to his own mattress by a shorter route and goes to bed too .
Parsing [sent. 7024 len. 42]: Chapter XXII -- Mr. Bucket Allegory looks pretty cool in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , though the evening is hot , for both Mr. Tulkinghorn 's windows are wide open , and the room is lofty , gusty , and gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 7025 len. 32]: These may not be desirable characteristics when November comes with fog and sleet or January with ice and snow , but they have their merits in the sultry long vacation weather .
Parsing [sent. 7026 len. 38]: They enable Allegory , though it has cheeks like peaches , and knees like bunches of blossoms , and rosy swellings for calves to its legs and muscles to its arms , to look tolerably cool to-night .
Parsing [sent. 7027 len. 22]: Plenty of dust comes in at Mr. Tulkinghorn 's windows , and plenty more has generated among his furniture and papers .
Parsing [sent. 7028 len. 5]: It lies thick everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 7029 len. 58]: When a breeze from the country that has lost its way takes fright and makes a blind hurry to rush out again , it flings as much dust in the eyes of Allegory as the law-or Mr. Tulkinghorn , one of its trustiest representatives -- may scatter , on occasion , in the eyes of the laity .
Parsing [sent. 7030 len. 51]: In his lowering magazine of dust , the universal article into which his papers and himself , and all his clients , and all things of earth , animate and inanimate , are resolving , Mr. Tulkinghorn sits at one of the open windows enjoying a bottle of old port .
Parsing [sent. 7031 len. 21]: Though a hard-grained man , close , dry , and silent , he can enjoy old wine with the best .
Parsing [sent. 7032 len. 23]: He has a priceless bin of port in some artful cellar under the Fields , which is one of his many secrets .
Parsing [sent. 7033 len. 103]: When he dines alone in chambers , as he has dined to-day , and has his bit of fish and his steak or chicken brought in from the coffee-house , he descends with a candle to the echoing regions below the deserted mansion , and heralded by a remote reverberation of thundering doors , comes gravely back encircled by an earthy atmosphere and carrying a bottle from which he pours a radiant nectar , two score and ten years old , that blushes in the glass to find itself so famous and fills the whole room with the fragrance of southern grapes .
Parsing [sent. 7034 len. 16]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , sitting in the twilight by the open window , enjoys his wine .
Parsing [sent. 7035 len. 22]: As if it whispered to him of its fifty years of silence and seclusion , it shuts him up the closer .
Parsing [sent. 7036 len. 149]: More impenetrable than ever , he sits , and drinks , and mellows as it were in secrecy , pondering at that twilight hour on all the mysteries he knows , associated with darkening woods in the country , and vast blank shut-up houses in town , and perhaps sparing a thought or two for himself , and his family history , and his money , and his will -- all a mystery to every one -- and that one bachelor friend of his , a man of the same mould and a lawyer too , who lived the same kind of life until he was seventy-five years old , and then suddenly conceiving -LRB- as it is supposed -RRB- an impression that it was too monotonous , gave his gold watch to his hair-dresser one summer evening and walked leisurely home to the Temple and hanged himself .
Parsing [sent. 7037 len. 14]: But Mr. Tulkinghorn is not alone to-night to ponder at his usual length .
Parsing [sent. 7038 len. 43]: Seated at the same table , though with his chair modestly and uncomfortably drawn a little way from it , sits a bald , mild , shining man who coughs respectfully behind his hand when the lawyer bids him fill his glass .
Parsing [sent. 7039 len. 20]: `` Now , Snagsby , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` to go over this odd story again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7040 len. 8]: `` If you please , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7041 len. 91]: `` You told me when you were so good as to step round here last night -- '' `` For which I must ask you to excuse me if it was a liberty , sir ; but I remember that you had taken a sort of an interest in that person , and I thought it possible that you might -- just -- wish -- to -- '' Mr. Tulkinghorn is not the man to help him to any conclusion or to admit anything as to any possibility concerning himself .
Parsing [sent. 7042 len. 30]: So Mr. Snagsby trails off into saying , with an awkward cough , `` I must ask you to excuse the liberty , sir , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 7043 len. 10]: `` Not at all , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 7044 len. 24]: `` You told me , Snagsby , that you put on your hat and came round without mentioning your intention to your wife .
Parsing [sent. 7045 len. 23]: That was prudent I think , because it 's not a matter of such importance that it requires to be mentioned . ''
Parsing [sent. 7046 len. 31]: `` Well , sir , '' returns Mr. Snagsby , `` you see , my little woman is -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 7047 len. 4]: She 's inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 7048 len. 22]: Poor little thing , she 's liable to spasms , and it 's good for her to have her mind employed .
Parsing [sent. 7049 len. 31]: In consequence of which she employs it -- I should say upon every individual thing she can lay hold of , whether it concerns her or not -- especially not .
Parsing [sent. 7050 len. 12]: My little woman has a very active mind , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7051 len. 23]: Mr. Snagsby drinks and murmurs with an admiring cough behind his hand , `` Dear me , very fine wine indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7052 len. 12]: `` Therefore you kept your visit to yourself last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7053 len. 4]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 7054 len. 6]: `` And to-night too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7055 len. 10]: `` Yes , sir , and to-night , too .
Parsing [sent. 7056 len. 54]: My little woman is at present in -- not to put too fine a point on it -- in a pious state , or in what she considers such , and attends the Evening Exertions -LRB- which is the name they go by -RRB- of a reverend party of the name of Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 7057 len. 24]: He has a great deal of eloquence at his command , undoubtedly , but I am not quite favourable to his style myself .
Parsing [sent. 7058 len. 7]: That 's neither here nor there .
Parsing [sent. 7059 len. 22]: My little woman being engaged in that way made it easier for me to step round in a quiet manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 7060 len. 4]: Mr. Tulkinghorn assents .
Parsing [sent. 7061 len. 8]: `` Fill your glass , Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 7062 len. 20]: `` Thank you , sir , I am sure , '' returns the stationer with his cough of deference .
Parsing [sent. 7063 len. 10]: `` This is wonderfully fine wine , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7064 len. 13]: `` It is a rare wine now , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 7065 len. 8]: `` It is fifty years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 7066 len. 7]: `` Is it indeed , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 7067 len. 13]: But I am not surprised to hear it , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 7068 len. 9]: It might be -- any age almost . ''
Parsing [sent. 7069 len. 26]: After rendering this general tribute to the port , Mr. Snagsby in his modesty coughs an apology behind his hand for drinking anything so precious .
Parsing [sent. 7070 len. 15]: `` Will you run over , once again , what the boy said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7071 len. 22]: asks Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting his hands into the pockets of his rusty smallclothes and leaning quietly back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 7072 len. 7]: `` With pleasure , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7073 len. 25]: Then , with fidelity , though with some prolixity , the law-stationer repeats Jo 's statement made to the assembled guests at his house .
Parsing [sent. 7074 len. 37]: On coming to the end of his narrative , he gives a great start and breaks off with , `` Dear me , sir , I was n't aware there was any other gentleman present ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7075 len. 59]: Mr. Snagsby is dismayed to see , standing with an attentive face between himself and the lawyer at a little distance from the table , a person with a hat and stick in his hand who was not there when he himself came in and has not since entered by the door or by either of the windows .
Parsing [sent. 7076 len. 25]: There is a press in the room , but its hinges have not creaked , nor has a step been audible upon the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7077 len. 32]: Yet this third person stands there with his attentive face , and his hat and stick in his hands , and his hands behind him , a composed and quiet listener .
Parsing [sent. 7078 len. 18]: He is a stoutly built , steady-looking , sharp-eyed man in black , of about the middle-age .
Parsing [sent. 7079 len. 33]: Except that he looks at Mr. Snagsby as if he were going to take his portrait , there is nothing remarkable about him at first sight but his ghostly manner of appearing .
Parsing [sent. 7080 len. 16]: `` Do n't mind this gentleman , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his quiet way .
Parsing [sent. 7081 len. 8]: `` This is only Mr. Bucket . ''
Parsing [sent. 7082 len. 8]: `` Oh , indeed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7083 len. 23]: returns the stationer , expressing by a cough that he is quite in the dark as to who Mr. Bucket may be .
Parsing [sent. 7084 len. 41]: `` I wanted him to hear this story , '' says the lawyer , `` because I have half a mind -LRB- for a reason -RRB- to know more of it , and he is very intelligent in such things .
Parsing [sent. 7085 len. 10]: What do you say to this , Bucket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7086 len. 8]: `` It 's very plain , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7087 len. 57]: Since our people have moved this boy on , and he 's not to be found on his old lay , if Mr. Snagsby do n't object to go down with me to Tom-all -- Alone 's and point him out , we can have him here in less than a couple of hours ' time .
Parsing [sent. 7088 len. 19]: I can do it without Mr. Snagsby , of course , but this is the shortest way . ''
Parsing [sent. 7089 len. 17]: `` Mr. Bucket is a detective officer , Snagsby , '' says the lawyer in explanation .
Parsing [sent. 7090 len. 8]: `` Is he indeed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7091 len. 17]: says Mr. Snagsby with a strong tendency in his clump of hair to stand on end .
Parsing [sent. 7092 len. 37]: `` And if you have no real objection to accompany Mr. Bucket to the place in question , '' pursues the lawyer , `` I shall feel obliged to you if you will do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 7093 len. 22]: In a moment 's hesitation on the part of Mr. Snagsby , Bucket dips down to the bottom of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 7094 len. 15]: `` Do n't you be afraid of hurting the boy , '' he says .
Parsing [sent. 7095 len. 7]: `` You wo n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 7096 len. 12]: It 's all right as far as the boy 's concerned .
Parsing [sent. 7097 len. 33]: We shall only bring him here to ask him a question or so I want to put to him , and he 'll be paid for his trouble and sent away again .
Parsing [sent. 7098 len. 9]: It 'll be a good job for him .
Parsing [sent. 7099 len. 19]: I promise you , as a man , that you shall see the boy sent away all right .
Parsing [sent. 7100 len. 18]: Do n't you be afraid of hurting him ; you a n't going to do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7101 len. 8]: `` Very well , Mr. Tulkinghorn ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7102 len. 5]: cries Mr. Snagsby cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 7103 len. 14]: And reassured , `` Since that 's the case -- '' `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 7104 len. 32]: And lookee here , Mr. Snagsby , '' resumes Bucket , taking him aside by the arm , tapping him familiarly on the breast , and speaking in a confidential tone .
Parsing [sent. 7105 len. 24]: `` You 're a man of the world , you know , and a man of business , and a man of sense .
Parsing [sent. 7106 len. 7]: That 's what YOU are . ''
Parsing [sent. 7107 len. 43]: `` I am sure I am much obliged to you for your good opinion , '' returns the stationer with his cough of modesty , `` but -- '' `` That 's what YOU are , you know , '' says Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7108 len. 84]: `` Now , it a n't necessary to say to a man like you , engaged in your business , which is a business of trust and requires a person to be wide awake and have his senses about him and his head screwed on tight -LRB- I had an uncle in your business once -RRB- -- it a n't necessary to say to a man like you that it 's the best and wisest way to keep little matters like this quiet .
Parsing [sent. 7109 len. 5]: Do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 7110 len. 3]: Quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7111 len. 10]: `` Certainly , certainly , '' returns the other .
Parsing [sent. 7112 len. 67]: `` I do n't mind telling YOU , '' says Bucket with an engaging appearance of frankness , `` that as far as I can understand it , there seems to be a doubt whether this dead person was n't entitled to a little property , and whether this female has n't been up to some games respecting that property , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7113 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7114 len. 12]: says Mr. Snagsby , but not appearing to see quite distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 7115 len. 38]: `` Now , what YOU want , '' pursues Bucket , again tapping Mr. Snagsby on the breast in a comfortable and soothing manner , `` is that every person should have their rights according to justice .
Parsing [sent. 7116 len. 7]: That 's what YOU want . ''
Parsing [sent. 7117 len. 13]: `` To be sure , '' returns Mr. Snagsby with a nod .
Parsing [sent. 7118 len. 28]: `` On account of which , and at the same time to oblige a -- do you call it , in your business , customer or client ?
Parsing [sent. 7119 len. 11]: I forget how my uncle used to call it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7120 len. 14]: `` Why , I generally say customer myself , '' replies Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 7121 len. 6]: `` You 're right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7122 len. 12]: returns Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him quite affectionately . ''
Parsing [sent. 7123 len. 51]: -- On account of which , and at the same time to oblige a real good customer , you mean to go down with me , in confidence , to Tom-all -- Alone 's and to keep the whole thing quiet ever afterwards and never mention it to any one .
Parsing [sent. 7124 len. 12]: That 's about your intentions , if I understand you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7125 len. 7]: `` You are right , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7126 len. 9]: You are right , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 7127 len. 36]: `` Then here 's your hat , '' returns his new friend , quite as intimate with it as if he had made it ; `` and if you 're ready , I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 7128 len. 28]: They leave Mr. Tulkinghorn , without a ruffle on the surface of his unfathomable depths , drinking his old wine , and go down into the streets .
Parsing [sent. 7129 len. 23]: `` You do n't happen to know a very good sort of person of the name of Gridley , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7130 len. 11]: says Bucket in friendly converse as they descend the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 7131 len. 20]: `` No , '' says Mr. Snagsby , considering , `` I do n't know anybody of that name .
Parsing [sent. 7132 len. 3]: Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7133 len. 60]: `` Nothing particular , '' says Bucket ; `` only having allowed his temper to get a little the better of him and having been threatening some respectable people , he is keeping out of the way of a warrant I have got against him -- which it 's a pity that a man of sense should do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7134 len. 76]: As they walk along , Mr. Snagsby observes , as a novelty , that however quick their pace may be , his companion still seems in some undefinable manner to lurk and lounge ; also , that whenever he is going to turn to the right or left , he pretends to have a fixed purpose in his mind of going straight ahead , and wheels off , sharply , at the very last moment .
Parsing [sent. 7135 len. 49]: Now and then , when they pass a police-constable on his beat , Mr. Snagsby notices that both the constable and his guide fall into a deep abstraction as they come towards each other , and appear entirely to overlook each other , and to gaze into space .
Parsing [sent. 7136 len. 59]: In a few instances , Mr. Bucket , coming behind some under-sized young man with a shining hat on , and his sleek hair twisted into one flat curl on each side of his head , almost without glancing at him touches him with his stick , upon which the young man , looking round , instantly evaporates .
Parsing [sent. 7137 len. 48]: For the most part Mr. Bucket notices things in general , with a face as unchanging as the great mourning ring on his little finger or the brooch , composed of not much diamond and a good deal of setting , which he wears in his shirt .
Parsing [sent. 7138 len. 51]: When they come at last to Tom-all -- Alone 's , Mr. Bucket stops for a moment at the corner and takes a lighted bull 's - eye from the constable on duty there , who then accompanies him with his own particular bull 's - eye at his waist .
Parsing [sent. 7139 len. 60]: Between his two conductors , Mr. Snagsby passes along the middle of a villainous street , undrained , unventilated , deep in black mud and corrupt water -- though the roads are dry elsewhere -- and reeking with such smells and sights that he , who has lived in London all his life , can scarce believe his senses .
Parsing [sent. 7140 len. 40]: Branching from this street and its heaps of ruins are other streets and courts so infamous that Mr. Snagsby sickens in body and mind and feels as if he were going every moment deeper down into the infernal gulf .
Parsing [sent. 7141 len. 30]: `` Draw off a bit here , Mr. Snagsby , '' says Bucket as a kind of shabby palanquin is borne towards them , surrounded by a noisy crowd .
Parsing [sent. 7142 len. 11]: `` Here 's the fever coming up the street ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7143 len. 59]: As the unseen wretch goes by , the crowd , leaving that object of attraction , hovers round the three visitors like a dream of horrible faces and fades away up alleys and into ruins and behind walls , and with occasional cries and shrill whistles of warning , thenceforth flits about them until they leave the place .
Parsing [sent. 7144 len. 9]: `` Are those the fever-houses , Darby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7145 len. 19]: Mr. Bucket coolly asks as he turns his bull 's - eye on a line of stinking ruins .
Parsing [sent. 7146 len. 45]: Darby replies that `` all them are , '' and further that in all , for months and months , the people `` have been down by dozens '' and have been carried out dead and dying `` like sheep with the rot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7147 len. 33]: Bucket observing to Mr. Snagsby as they go on again that he looks a little poorly , Mr. Snagsby answers that he feels as if he could n't breathe the dreadful air .
Parsing [sent. 7148 len. 13]: There is inquiry made at various houses for a boy named Jo .
Parsing [sent. 7149 len. 49]: As few people are known in Tom-all -- Alone 's by any Christian sign , there is much reference to Mr. Snagsby whether he means Carrots , or the Colonel , or Gallows , or Young Chisel , or Terrier Tip , or Lanky , or the Brick .
Parsing [sent. 7150 len. 8]: Mr. Snagsby describes over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 7151 len. 11]: There are conflicting opinions respecting the original of his picture .
Parsing [sent. 7152 len. 12]: Some think it must be Carrots , some say the Brick .
Parsing [sent. 7153 len. 14]: The Colonel is produced , but is not at all near the thing .
Parsing [sent. 7154 len. 27]: Whenever Mr. Snagsby and his conductors are stationary , the crowd flows round , and from its squalid depths obsequious advice heaves up to Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7155 len. 37]: Whenever they move , and the angry bull 's - eyes glare , it fades away and flits about them up the alleys , and in the ruins , and behind the walls , as before .
Parsing [sent. 7156 len. 34]: At last there is a lair found out where Toughy , or the Tough Subject , lays him down at night ; and it is thought that the Tough Subject may be Jo .
Parsing [sent. 7157 len. 51]: Comparison of notes between Mr. Snagsby and the proprietress of the house -- a drunken face tied up in a black bundle , and flaring out of a heap of rags on the floor of a dog-hutch which is her private apartment -- leads to the establishment of this conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 7158 len. 23]: Toughy has gone to the doctor 's to get a bottle of stuff for a sick woman but will be here anon .
Parsing [sent. 7159 len. 10]: `` And who have we got here to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7160 len. 17]: says Mr. Bucket , opening another door and glaring in with his bull 's - eye .
Parsing [sent. 7161 len. 7]: `` Two drunken men , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7162 len. 4]: And two women ?
Parsing [sent. 7163 len. 21]: The men are sound enough , '' turning back each sleeper 's arm from his face to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 7164 len. 11]: `` Are these your good men , my dears ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7165 len. 12]: `` Yes , sir , '' returns one of the women .
Parsing [sent. 7166 len. 7]: `` They are our husbands . ''
Parsing [sent. 7167 len. 6]: `` Brickmakers , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7168 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7169 len. 7]: `` What are you doing here ?
Parsing [sent. 7170 len. 8]: You do n't belong to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 7171 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7172 len. 6]: We belong to Hertfordshire . ''
Parsing [sent. 7173 len. 6]: `` Whereabouts in Hertfordshire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7174 len. 5]: `` Saint Albans . ''
Parsing [sent. 7175 len. 8]: `` Come up on the tramp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7176 len. 6]: `` We walked up yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 7177 len. 29]: There 's no work down with us at present , but we have done no good by coming here , and shall do none , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 7178 len. 30]: `` That 's not the way to do much good , '' says Mr. Bucket , turning his head in the direction of the unconscious figures on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7179 len. 14]: `` It a n't indeed , '' replies the woman with a sigh .
Parsing [sent. 7180 len. 10]: `` Jenny and me knows it full well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7181 len. 35]: The room , though two or three feet higher than the door , is so low that the head of the tallest of the visitors would touch the blackened ceiling if he stood upright .
Parsing [sent. 7182 len. 20]: It is offensive to every sense ; even the gross candle burns pale and sickly in the polluted air .
Parsing [sent. 7183 len. 15]: There are a couple of benches and a higher bench by way of table .
Parsing [sent. 7184 len. 17]: The men lie asleep where they stumbled down , but the women sit by the candle .
Parsing [sent. 7185 len. 16]: Lying in the arms of the woman who has spoken is a very young child .
Parsing [sent. 7186 len. 13]: `` Why , what age do you call that little creature ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7187 len. 3]: says Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7188 len. 11]: `` It looks as if it was born yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 7189 len. 40]: He is not at all rough about it ; and as he turns his light gently on the infant , Mr. Snagsby is strangely reminded of another infant , encircled with light , that he has seen in pictures .
Parsing [sent. 7190 len. 16]: `` He is not three weeks old yet , sir , '' says the woman .
Parsing [sent. 7191 len. 7]: `` Is he your child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7192 len. 4]: `` Mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 7193 len. 25]: The other woman , who was bending over it when they came in , stoops down again and kisses it as it lies asleep .
Parsing [sent. 7194 len. 20]: `` You seem as fond of it as if you were the mother yourself , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7195 len. 17]: `` I was the mother of one like it , master , and it died . ''
Parsing [sent. 7196 len. 8]: `` Ah , Jenny , Jenny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7197 len. 7]: says the other woman to her .
Parsing [sent. 7198 len. 4]: `` Better so .
Parsing [sent. 7199 len. 11]: Much better to think of dead than alive , Jenny !
Parsing [sent. 7200 len. 4]: Much better ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7201 len. 29]: `` Why , you a n't such an unnatural woman , I hope , '' returns Bucket sternly , `` as to wish your own child dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7202 len. 13]: `` God knows you are right , master , '' she returns .
Parsing [sent. 7203 len. 5]: `` I am not .
Parsing [sent. 7204 len. 23]: I 'd stand between it and death with my own life if I could , as true as any pretty lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 7205 len. 18]: `` Then do n't talk in that wrong manner , '' says Mr. Bucket , mollified again .
Parsing [sent. 7206 len. 8]: `` Why do you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7207 len. 32]: `` It 's brought into my head , master , '' returns the woman , her eyes filling with tears , `` when I look down at the child lying so .
Parsing [sent. 7208 len. 21]: If it was never to wake no more , you 'd think me mad , I should take on so .
Parsing [sent. 7209 len. 6]: I know that very well .
Parsing [sent. 7210 len. 15]: I was with Jenny when she lost hers -- war n't I , Jenny ?
Parsing [sent. 7211 len. 8]: -- and I know how she grieved .
Parsing [sent. 7212 len. 8]: But look around you at this place .
Parsing [sent. 7213 len. 13]: Look at them , '' glancing at the sleepers on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7214 len. 21]: `` Look at the boy you 're waiting for , who 's gone out to do me a good turn .
Parsing [sent. 7215 len. 21]: Think of the children that your business lays with often and often , and that YOU see grow up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7216 len. 38]: `` Well , well , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` you train him respectable , and he 'll be a comfort to you , and look after you in your old age , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7217 len. 15]: `` I mean to try hard , '' she answers , wiping her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 7218 len. 29]: `` But I have been a-thinking , being over-tired to-night and not well with the ague , of all the many things that 'll come in his way .
Parsing [sent. 7219 len. 31]: My master will be against it , and he 'll be beat , and see me beat , and made to fear his home , and perhaps to stray wild .
Parsing [sent. 7220 len. 85]: If I work for him ever so much , and ever so hard , there 's no one to help me ; and if he should be turned bad ` spite of all I could do , and the time should come when I should sit by him in his sleep , made hard and changed , a n't it likely I should think of him as he lies in my lap now and wish he had died as Jenny 's child died ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7221 len. 6]: `` There , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7222 len. 3]: says Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 7223 len. 9]: `` Liz , you 're tired and ill .
Parsing [sent. 7224 len. 6]: Let me take him . ''
Parsing [sent. 7225 len. 28]: In doing so , she displaces the mother 's dress , but quickly readjusts it over the wounded and bruised bosom where the baby has been lying .
Parsing [sent. 7226 len. 57]: `` It 's my dead child , '' says Jenny , walking up and down as she nurses , `` that makes me love this child so dear , and it 's my dead child that makes her love it so dear too , as even to think of its being taken away from her now .
Parsing [sent. 7227 len. 18]: While she thinks that , I think what fortune would I give to have my darling back .
Parsing [sent. 7228 len. 25]: But we mean the same thing , if we knew how to say it , us two mothers does in our poor hearts ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7229 len. 19]: As Mr. Snagsby blows his nose and coughs his cough of sympathy , a step is heard without .
Parsing [sent. 7230 len. 24]: Mr. Bucket throws his light into the doorway and says to Mr. Snagsby , `` Now , what do you say to Toughy ?
Parsing [sent. 7231 len. 5]: Will HE do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7232 len. 10]: `` That 's Jo , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 7233 len. 35]: Jo stands amazed in the disk of light , like a ragged figure in a magic-lantern , trembling to think that he has offended against the law in not having moved on far enough .
Parsing [sent. 7234 len. 53]: Mr. Snagsby , however , giving him the consolatory assurance , `` It 's only a job you will be paid for , Jo , '' he recovers ; and on being taken outside by Mr. Bucket for a little private confabulation , tells his tale satisfactorily , though out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 7235 len. 23]: `` I have squared it with the lad , '' says Mr. Bucket , returning , `` and it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 7236 len. 12]: Now , Mr. Snagsby , we 're ready for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7237 len. 41]: First , Jo has to complete his errand of good nature by handing over the physic he has been to get , which he delivers with the laconic verbal direction that `` it 's to be all took d'rectly . ''
Parsing [sent. 7238 len. 24]: Secondly , Mr. Snagsby has to lay upon the table half a crown , his usual panacea for an immense variety of afflictions .
Parsing [sent. 7239 len. 44]: Thirdly , Mr. Bucket has to take Jo by the arm a little above the elbow and walk him on before him , without which observance neither the Tough Subject nor any other Subject could be professionally conducted to Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 7240 len. 24]: These arrangements completed , they give the women good night and come out once more into black and foul Tom-all -- Alone 's .
Parsing [sent. 7241 len. 49]: By the noisome ways through which they descended into that pit , they gradually emerge from it , the crowd flitting , and whistling , and skulking about them until they come to the verge , where restoration of the bull 's - eyes is made to Darby .
Parsing [sent. 7242 len. 22]: Here the crowd , like a concourse of imprisoned demons , turns back , yelling , and is seen no more .
Parsing [sent. 7243 len. 33]: Through the clearer and fresher streets , never so clear and fresh to Mr. Snagsby 's mind as now , they walk and ride until they come to Mr. Tulkinghorn 's gate .
Parsing [sent. 7244 len. 42]: As they ascend the dim stairs -LRB- Mr. Tulkinghorn 's chambers being on the first floor -RRB- , Mr. Bucket mentions that he has the key of the outer door in his pocket and that there is no need to ring .
Parsing [sent. 7245 len. 25]: For a man so expert in most things of that kind , Bucket takes time to open the door and makes some noise too .
Parsing [sent. 7246 len. 11]: It may be that he sounds a note of preparation .
Parsing [sent. 7247 len. 35]: Howbeit , they come at last into the hall , where a lamp is burning , and so into Mr. Tulkinghorn 's usual room -- the room where he drank his old wine to-night .
Parsing [sent. 7248 len. 19]: He is not there , but his two old-fashioned candlesticks are , and the room is tolerably light .
Parsing [sent. 7249 len. 37]: Mr. Bucket , still having his professional hold of Jo and appearing to Mr. Snagsby to possess an unlimited number of eyes , makes a little way into this room , when Jo starts and stops .
Parsing [sent. 7250 len. 7]: `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7251 len. 6]: says Bucket in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 7252 len. 6]: `` There she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7253 len. 3]: cries Jo .
Parsing [sent. 7254 len. 4]: `` Who ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7255 len. 5]: `` The lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7256 len. 22]: A female figure , closely veiled , stands in the middle of the room , where the light falls upon it .
Parsing [sent. 7257 len. 7]: It is quite still and silent .
Parsing [sent. 7258 len. 23]: The front of the figure is towards them , but it takes no notice of their entrance and remains like a statue .
Parsing [sent. 7259 len. 22]: `` Now , tell me , '' says Bucket aloud , `` how you know that to be the lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 7260 len. 22]: `` I know the wale , '' replies Jo , staring , `` and the bonnet , and the gownd . ''
Parsing [sent. 7261 len. 20]: `` Be quite sure of what you say , Tough , '' returns Bucket , narrowly observant of him .
Parsing [sent. 7262 len. 5]: `` Look again . ''
Parsing [sent. 7263 len. 35]: `` I am a-looking as hard as ever I can look , '' says Jo with starting eyes , `` and that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd . ''
Parsing [sent. 7264 len. 11]: `` What about those rings you told me of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7265 len. 3]: asks Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7266 len. 31]: `` A-sparkling all over here , '' says Jo , rubbing the fingers of his left hand on the knuckles of his right without taking his eyes from the figure .
Parsing [sent. 7267 len. 11]: The figure removes the right-hand glove and shows the hand .
Parsing [sent. 7268 len. 11]: `` Now , what do you say to that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7269 len. 3]: asks Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7270 len. 5]: Jo shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 7271 len. 8]: `` Not rings a bit like them .
Parsing [sent. 7272 len. 7]: Not a hand like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7273 len. 8]: `` What are you talking of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7274 len. 12]: says Bucket , evidently pleased though , and well pleased too .
Parsing [sent. 7275 len. 20]: `` Hand was a deal whiter , a deal delicater , and a deal smaller , '' returns Jo .
Parsing [sent. 7276 len. 19]: `` Why , you 'll tell me I 'm my own mother next , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7277 len. 10]: `` Do you recollect the lady 's voice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7278 len. 10]: `` I think I does , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 7279 len. 4]: The figure speaks .
Parsing [sent. 7280 len. 8]: `` Was it at all like this ?
Parsing [sent. 7281 len. 14]: I will speak as long as you like if you are not sure .
Parsing [sent. 7282 len. 13]: Was it this voice , or at all like this voice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7283 len. 7]: Jo looks aghast at Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 7284 len. 6]: `` Not a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7285 len. 26]: `` Then , what , '' retorts that worthy , pointing to the figure , `` did you say it was the lady for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7286 len. 35]: `` Cos , '' says Jo with a perplexed stare but without being at all shaken in his certainty , `` cos that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd .
Parsing [sent. 7287 len. 9]: It is her and it a n't her .
Parsing [sent. 7288 len. 16]: It a n't her hand , nor yet her rings , nor yet her woice .
Parsing [sent. 7289 len. 48]: But that there 's the wale , the bonnet , and the gownd , and they 're wore the same way wot she wore 'em , and it 's her height wot she wos , and she giv me a sov ` ring and hooked it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7290 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7291 len. 16]: says Mr. Bucket slightly , `` we have n't got much good out of YOU .
Parsing [sent. 7292 len. 11]: But , however , here 's five shillings for you .
Parsing [sent. 7293 len. 16]: Take care how you spend it , and do n't get yourself into trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 7294 len. 76]: Bucket stealthily tells the coins from one hand into the other like counters -- which is a way he has , his principal use of them being in these games of skill -- and then puts them , in a little pile , into the boy 's hand and takes him out to the door , leaving Mr. Snagsby , not by any means comfortable under these mysterious circumstances , alone with the veiled figure .
Parsing [sent. 7295 len. 31]: But on Mr. Tulkinghorn 's coming into the room , the veil is raised and a sufficiently good-looking Frenchwoman is revealed , though her expression is something of the intensest .
Parsing [sent. 7296 len. 16]: `` Thank you , Mademoiselle Hortense , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual equanimity .
Parsing [sent. 7297 len. 14]: `` I will give you no further trouble about this little wager . ''
Parsing [sent. 7298 len. 21]: `` You will do me the kindness to remember , sir , that I am not at present placed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7299 len. 3]: says mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 7300 len. 6]: `` Certainly , certainly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7301 len. 14]: `` And to confer upon me the favour of your distinguished recommendation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7302 len. 9]: `` By all means , Mademoiselle Hortense . ''
Parsing [sent. 7303 len. 11]: `` A word from Mr. Tulkinghorn is so powerful . ''
Parsing [sent. 7304 len. 10]: `` It shall not be wanting , mademoiselle . ''
Parsing [sent. 7305 len. 13]: `` Receive the assurance of my devoted gratitude , dear sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7306 len. 5]: `` Good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 7307 len. 47]: Mademoiselle goes out with an air of native gentility ; and Mr. Bucket , to whom it is , on an emergency , as natural to be groom of the ceremonies as it is to be anything else , shows her downstairs , not without gallantry .
Parsing [sent. 7308 len. 6]: `` Well , Bucket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7309 len. 7]: quoth Mr. Tulkinghorn on his return .
Parsing [sent. 7310 len. 17]: `` It 's all squared , you see , as I squared it myself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7311 len. 18]: There a n't a doubt that it was the other one with this one 's dress on .
Parsing [sent. 7312 len. 9]: The boy was exact respecting colours and everything .
Parsing [sent. 7313 len. 18]: Mr. Snagsby , I promised you as a man that he should be sent away all right .
Parsing [sent. 7314 len. 9]: Do n't say it was n't done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7315 len. 56]: `` You have kept your word , sir , '' returns the stationer ; `` and if I can be of no further use , Mr. Tulkinghorn , I think , as my little woman will be getting anxious -- '' `` Thank you , Snagsby , no further use , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 7316 len. 16]: `` I am quite indebted to you for the trouble you have taken already . ''
Parsing [sent. 7317 len. 7]: `` Not at all , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7318 len. 7]: I wish you good night . ''
Parsing [sent. 7319 len. 52]: `` You see , Mr. Snagsby , '' says Mr. Bucket , accompanying him to the door and shaking hands with him over and over again , `` what I like in you is that you 're a man it 's of no use pumping ; that 's what YOU are .
Parsing [sent. 7320 len. 31]: When you know you have done a right thing , you put it away , and it 's done with and gone , and there 's an end of it .
Parsing [sent. 7321 len. 7]: That 's what YOU do . ''
Parsing [sent. 7322 len. 17]: `` That is certainly what I endeavour to do , sir , '' returns Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 7323 len. 10]: `` No , you do n't do yourself justice .
Parsing [sent. 7324 len. 33]: It a n't what you endeavour to do , '' says Mr. Bucket , shaking hands with him and blessing him in the tenderest manner , `` it 's what you DO .
Parsing [sent. 7325 len. 15]: That 's what I estimate in a man in your way of business . ''
Parsing [sent. 7326 len. 52]: Mr. Snagsby makes a suitable response and goes homeward so confused by the events of the evening that he is doubtful of his being awake and out -- doubtful of the reality of the streets through which he goes -- doubtful of the reality of the moon that shines above him .
Parsing [sent. 7327 len. 67]: He is presently reassured on these subjects by the unchallengeable reality of Mrs. Snagsby , sitting up with her head in a perfect beehive of curl-papers and night-cap , who has dispatched Guster to the police-station with official intelligence of her husband 's being made away with , and who within the last two hours has passed through every stage of swooning with the greatest decorum .
Parsing [sent. 7328 len. 15]: But as the little woman feelingly says , many thanks she gets for it !
Parsing [sent. 7329 len. 18]: Chapter XXIII -- Esther 's Narrative We came home from Mr. Boythorn 's after six pleasant weeks .
Parsing [sent. 7330 len. 46]: We were often in the park and in the woods and seldom passed the lodge where we had taken shelter without looking in to speak to the keeper 's wife ; but we saw no more of Lady Dedlock , except at church on Sundays .
Parsing [sent. 7331 len. 27]: There was company at Chesney Wold ; and although several beautiful faces surrounded her , her face retained the same influence on me as at first .
Parsing [sent. 7332 len. 27]: I do not quite know even now whether it was painful or pleasurable , whether it drew me towards her or made me shrink from her .
Parsing [sent. 7333 len. 39]: I think I admired her with a kind of fear , and I know that in her presence my thoughts always wandered back , as they had done at first , to that old time of my life .
Parsing [sent. 7334 len. 46]: I had a fancy , on more than one of these Sundays , that what this lady so curiously was to me , I was to her -- I mean that I disturbed her thoughts as she influenced mine , though in some different way .
Parsing [sent. 7335 len. 27]: But when I stole a glance at her and saw her so composed and distant and unapproachable , I felt this to be a foolish weakness .
Parsing [sent. 7336 len. 33]: Indeed , I felt the whole state of my mind in reference to her to be weak and unreasonable , and I remonstrated with myself about it as much as I could .
Parsing [sent. 7337 len. 20]: One incident that occurred before we quitted Mr. Boythorn 's house , I had better mention in this place .
Parsing [sent. 7338 len. 21]: I was walking in the garden with Ada and when I was told that some one wished to see me .
Parsing [sent. 7339 len. 39]: Going into the breakfast-room where this person was waiting , I found it to be the French maid who had cast off her shoes and walked through the wet grass on the day when it thundered and lightened .
Parsing [sent. 7340 len. 56]: `` Mademoiselle , '' she began , looking fixedly at me with her too-eager eyes , though otherwise presenting an agreeable appearance and speaking neither with boldness nor servility , `` I have taken a great liberty in coming here , but you know how to excuse it , being so amiable , mademoiselle . ''
Parsing [sent. 7341 len. 20]: `` No excuse is necessary , '' I returned , `` if you wish to speak to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7342 len. 8]: `` That is my desire , mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 7343 len. 7]: A thousand thanks for the permission .
Parsing [sent. 7344 len. 7]: I have your leave to speak .
Parsing [sent. 7345 len. 5]: Is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7346 len. 9]: she said in a quick , natural way .
Parsing [sent. 7347 len. 14]: `` Certainly , '' said I. `` Mademoiselle , you are so amiable !
Parsing [sent. 7348 len. 7]: Listen then , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 7349 len. 6]: I have left my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 7350 len. 5]: We could not agree .
Parsing [sent. 7351 len. 10]: My Lady is so high , so very high .
Parsing [sent. 7352 len. 2]: Pardon !
Parsing [sent. 7353 len. 7]: Mademoiselle , you are right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7354 len. 16]: Her quickness anticipated what I might have said presently but as yet had only thought .
Parsing [sent. 7355 len. 15]: `` It is not for me to come here to complain of my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 7356 len. 12]: But I say she is so high , so very high .
Parsing [sent. 7357 len. 8]: I will not say a word more .
Parsing [sent. 7358 len. 7]: All the world knows that . ''
Parsing [sent. 7359 len. 23]: `` Go on , if you please , '' said I. `` Assuredly ; mademoiselle , I am thankful for your politeness .
Parsing [sent. 7360 len. 22]: Mademoiselle , I have an inexpressible desire to find service with a young lady who is good , accomplished , beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 7361 len. 12]: You are good , accomplished , and beautiful as an angel .
Parsing [sent. 7362 len. 13]: Ah , could I have the honour of being your domestic ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7363 len. 9]: `` I am sorry -- '' I began .
Parsing [sent. 7364 len. 11]: `` Do not dismiss me so soon , mademoiselle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7365 len. 12]: she said with an involuntary contraction of her fine black eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 7366 len. 7]: `` Let me hope a moment !
Parsing [sent. 7367 len. 17]: Mademoiselle , I know this service would be more retired than that which I have quitted .
Parsing [sent. 7368 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 7369 len. 4]: I wish that .
Parsing [sent. 7370 len. 15]: I know this service would be less distinguished than that which I have quitted .
Parsing [sent. 7371 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 7372 len. 17]: I wish that , I know that I should win less , as to wages here .
Parsing [sent. 7373 len. 2]: Good .
Parsing [sent. 7374 len. 5]: I am content . ''
Parsing [sent. 7375 len. 38]: `` I assure you , '' said I , quite embarrassed by the mere idea of having such an attendant , `` that I keep no maid -- '' `` Ah , mademoiselle , but why not ?
Parsing [sent. 7376 len. 13]: Why not , when you can have one so devoted to you !
Parsing [sent. 7377 len. 23]: Who would be enchanted to serve you ; who would be so true , so zealous , and so faithful every day !
Parsing [sent. 7378 len. 12]: Mademoiselle , I wish with all my heart to serve you .
Parsing [sent. 7379 len. 8]: Do not speak of money at present .
Parsing [sent. 7380 len. 6]: Take me as I am .
Parsing [sent. 7381 len. 4]: For nothing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7382 len. 15]: She was so singularly earnest that I drew back , almost afraid of her .
Parsing [sent. 7383 len. 32]: Without appearing to notice it , in her ardour she still pressed herself upon me , speaking in a rapid subdued voice , though always with a certain grace and propriety .
Parsing [sent. 7384 len. 22]: `` Mademoiselle , I come from the South country where we are quick and where we like and dislike very strong .
Parsing [sent. 7385 len. 15]: My Lady was too high for me ; I was too high for her .
Parsing [sent. 7386 len. 8]: It is done -- past -- finlshed !
Parsing [sent. 7387 len. 13]: Receive me as your domestic , and I will serve you well .
Parsing [sent. 7388 len. 13]: I will do more for you than you figure to yourself now .
Parsing [sent. 7389 len. 2]: Chut !
Parsing [sent. 7390 len. 18]: Mademoiselle , I will -- no matter , I will do my utmost possible in all things .
Parsing [sent. 7391 len. 12]: If you accept my service , you will not repent it .
Parsing [sent. 7392 len. 15]: Mademoiselle , you will not repent it , and I will serve you well .
Parsing [sent. 7393 len. 8]: You do n't know how well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7394 len. 60]: There was a lowering energy in her face as she stood looking at me while I explained the impossibility of my engagmg her -LRB- without thinking it necessary to say how very little I desired to do so -RRB- , which seemed to bring visibly before me some woman from the streets of Paris in the reign of terror .
Parsing [sent. 7395 len. 30]: She heard me out without interruption and then said with her pretty accent and in her mildest voice , `` Hey , mademoiselle , I have received my answer !
Parsing [sent. 7396 len. 6]: I am sorry of it .
Parsing [sent. 7397 len. 14]: But I must go elsewhere and seek what I have not found here .
Parsing [sent. 7398 len. 10]: Will you graciously let me kiss your hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7399 len. 28]: She looked at me more intently as she took it , and seemed to take note , with her momentary touch , of every vein in it .
Parsing [sent. 7400 len. 17]: `` I fear I surprised you , mademoiselle , on the day of the storm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7401 len. 7]: she said with a parting curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 7402 len. 9]: I confessed that she had surprised us all .
Parsing [sent. 7403 len. 32]: `` I took an oath , mademoiselle , '' she said , smiling , `` and I wanted to stamp it on my mind so that I might keep it faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 7404 len. 4]: And I will !
Parsing [sent. 7405 len. 5]: Adieu , mademoiselle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7406 len. 16]: So ended our conference , which I was very glad to bring to a close .
Parsing [sent. 7407 len. 43]: I supposed she went away from the village , for I saw her no more ; and nothing else occurred to disturb our tranquil summer pleasures until six weeks were out and we returned home as I began just now by saying .
Parsing [sent. 7408 len. 21]: At that time , and for a good many weeks after that time , Richard was constant in his visits .
Parsing [sent. 7409 len. 35]: Besides coming every Saturday or Sunday and remaining with us until Monday morning , he sometimes rode out on horseback unexpectedly and passed the evening with us and rode back again early next day .
Parsing [sent. 7410 len. 25]: He was as vivacious as ever and told us he was very industrious , but I was not easy in my mind about him .
Parsing [sent. 7411 len. 11]: It appeared to me that his industry was all misdirected .
Parsing [sent. 7412 len. 31]: I could not find that it led to anything but the formation of delusive hopes in connexion with the suit already the pernicious cause of so much sorrow and ruin .
Parsing [sent. 7413 len. 83]: He had got at the core of that mystery now , he told us , and nothing could be plainer than that the will under which he and Ada were to take I do n't know how many thousands of pounds must be finally established if there were any sense or justice in the Court of Chancery -- but oh , what a great IF that sounded in my ears -- and that this happy conclusion could not be much longer delayed .
Parsing [sent. 7414 len. 29]: He proved this to himself by all the weary arguments on that side he had read , and every one of them sunk him deeper in the infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 7415 len. 9]: He had even begun to haunt the court .
Parsing [sent. 7416 len. 40]: He told us how he saw Miss Flite there daily , how they talked together , and how he did her little kindnesses , and how , while he laughed at her , he pitied her from his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7417 len. 64]: But he never thought -- never , my poor , dear , sanguine Richard , capable of so much happiness then , and with such better things before him -- what a fatal link was riveting between his fresh youth and her faded age , between his free hopes and her caged birds , and her hungry garret , and her wandering mind .
Parsing [sent. 7418 len. 45]: Ada loved him too well to mistrust him much in anything he said or did , and my guardian , though he frequently complained of the east wind and read more than usual in the growlery , preserved a strict silence on the subject .
Parsing [sent. 7419 len. 42]: So I thought one day when I went to London to meet Caddy Jellyby , at her solicitation , I would ask Richard to be in waiting for me at the coach-office , that we might have a little talk together .
Parsing [sent. 7420 len. 16]: I found him there when I arrived , and we walked away arm in arm .
Parsing [sent. 7421 len. 31]: `` Well , Richard , '' said I as soon as I could begin to be grave with him , `` are you beginning to feel more settled now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7422 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7423 len. 3]: returned Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7424 len. 8]: `` I 'm all right enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 7425 len. 5]: `` But settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7426 len. 11]: said I. `` How do you mean , settled ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7427 len. 7]: returned Richard with his gay laugh .
Parsing [sent. 7428 len. 26]: `` Settled in the law , '' said I. `` Oh , aye , '' replied Richard , `` I 'm all right enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 7429 len. 11]: `` You said that before , my dear Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 7430 len. 13]: `` And you do n't think it 's an answer , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 7431 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 7432 len. 5]: Perhaps it 's not .
Parsing [sent. 7433 len. 2]: Settled ?
Parsing [sent. 7434 len. 14]: You mean , do I feel as if I were settling down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7435 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 7436 len. 48]: `` Why , no , I ca n't say I am settling down , '' said Richard , strongly emphasizing `` down , '' as if that expressed the difficulty , `` because one ca n't settle down while this business remains in such an unsettled state .
Parsing [sent. 7437 len. 16]: When I say this business , of course I mean the -- forbidden subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 7438 len. 14]: `` Do you think it will ever be in a settled state ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7439 len. 14]: said I. `` Not the least doubt of it , '' answered Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7440 len. 46]: We walked a little way without speaking , and presently Richard addressed me in his frankest and most feeling manner , thus : `` My dear Esther , I understand you , and I wish to heaven I were a more constant sort of fellow .
Parsing [sent. 7441 len. 25]: I do n't mean constant to Ada , for I love her dearly -- better and better every day -- but constant to myself .
Parsing [sent. 7442 len. 22]: -LRB- Somehow , I mean something that I ca n't very well express , but you 'll make it out . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 7443 len. 59]: If I were a more constant sort of fellow , I should have held on either to Badger or to Kenge and Carboy like grim death , and should have begun to be steady and systematic by this time , and should n't be in debt , and -- '' `` ARE you in debt , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7444 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' said Richard , `` I am a little so , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7445 len. 16]: Also , I have taken rather too much to billiards and that sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 7446 len. 17]: Now the murder 's out ; you despise me , Esther , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7447 len. 27]: `` You know I do n't , '' said I. `` You are kinder to me than I often am to myself , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 7448 len. 25]: `` My dear Esther , I am a very unfortunate dog not to be more settled , but how CAN I be more settled ?
Parsing [sent. 7449 len. 46]: If you lived in an unfinished house , you could n't settle down in it ; if you were condemned to leave everything you undertook unfinished , you would find it hard to apply yourself to anything ; and yet that 's my unhappy case .
Parsing [sent. 7450 len. 70]: I was born into this unfinished contention with all its chances and changes , and it began to unsettle me before I quite knew the difference between a suit at law and a suit of clothes ; and it has gone on unsettling me ever since ; and here I am now , conscious sometimes that I am but a worthless fellow to love my confiding cousin Ada . ''
Parsing [sent. 7451 len. 23]: We were in a solitary place , and he put his hands before his eyes and sobbed as he said the words .
Parsing [sent. 7452 len. 6]: `` Oh , Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7453 len. 9]: said I. `` Do not be so moved .
Parsing [sent. 7454 len. 18]: You have a noble nature , and Ada 's love may make you worthier every day . ''
Parsing [sent. 7455 len. 21]: `` I know , my dear , '' he replied , pressing my arm , `` I know all that .
Parsing [sent. 7456 len. 43]: You must n't mind my being a little soft now , for I have had all this upon my mind for a long time , and have often meant to speak to you , and have sometimes wanted opportunity and sometimes courage .
Parsing [sent. 7457 len. 20]: I know what the thought of Ada ought to do for me , but it does n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 7458 len. 8]: I am too unsettled even for that .
Parsing [sent. 7459 len. 23]: I love her most devotedly , and yet I do her wrong , in doing myself wrong , every day and hour .
Parsing [sent. 7460 len. 8]: But it ca n't last for ever .
Parsing [sent. 7461 len. 29]: We shall come on for a final hearing and get judgment in our favour , and then you and Ada shall see what I can really be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7462 len. 39]: It had given me a pang to hear him sob and see the tears start out between his fingers , but that was infinitely less affecting to me than the hopeful animation with which he said these words .
Parsing [sent. 7463 len. 11]: `` I have looked well into the papers , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 7464 len. 34]: I have been deep in them for months , '' he continued , recovering his cheerfulness in a moment , `` and you may rely upon it that we shall come out triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 7465 len. 17]: As to years of delay , there has been no want of them , heaven knows !
Parsing [sent. 7466 len. 26]: And there is the greater probability of our bringing the matter to a speedy close ; in fact , it 's on the paper now .
Parsing [sent. 7467 len. 15]: It will be all right at last , and then you shall see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7468 len. 33]: Recalling how he had just now placed Messrs. Kenge and Carboy in the same category with Mr. Badger , I asked him when he intended to be articled in Lincoln 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 7469 len. 4]: `` There again !
Parsing [sent. 7470 len. 15]: I think not at all , Esther , '' he returned with an effort .
Parsing [sent. 7471 len. 10]: `` I fancy I have had enough of it .
Parsing [sent. 7472 len. 29]: Having worked at Jarndyce and Jarndyce like a galley slave , I have slaked my thirst for the law and satisfied myself that I should n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 7473 len. 20]: Besides , I find it unsettles me more and more to be so constantly upon the scene of action .
Parsing [sent. 7474 len. 23]: So what , '' continued Richard , confident again by this time , `` do I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7475 len. 39]: `` I ca n't imagine , '' said I. `` Do n't look so serious , '' returned Richard , `` because it 's the best thing I can do , my dear Esther , I am certain .
Parsing [sent. 7476 len. 12]: It 's not as if I wanted a profession for life .
Parsing [sent. 7477 len. 15]: These proceedings will come to a termination , and then I am provided for .
Parsing [sent. 7478 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 7479 len. 32]: I look upon it as a pursuit which is in its nature more or less unsettled , and therefore suited to my temporary condition -- I may say , precisely suited .
Parsing [sent. 7480 len. 12]: What is it that I naturally turn my thoughts to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7481 len. 9]: I looked at him and shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 7482 len. 20]: `` What , '' said Richard , in a tone of perfect conviction , `` but the army ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7483 len. 5]: `` The army ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7484 len. 9]: said I. `` The army , of course .
Parsing [sent. 7485 len. 21]: What I have to do is to get a commission ; and -- there I am , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7486 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7487 len. 90]: And then he showed me , proved by elaborate calculations in his pocket-book , that supposing he had contracted , say , two hundred pounds of debt in six months out of the army ; and that he contracted no debt at all within a corresponding period in the army -- as to which he had quite made up his mind ; this step must involve a saving of four hundred pounds in a year , or two thousand pounds in five years , which was a considerable sum .
Parsing [sent. 7488 len. 82]: And then he spoke so ingenuously and sincerely of the sacrifice he made in withdrawing himself for a time from Ada , and of the earnestness with which he aspired -- as in thought he always did , I know full well -- to repay her love , and to ensure her happiness , and to conquer what was amiss in himself , and to acquire the very soul of decision , that he made my heart ache keenly , sorely .
Parsing [sent. 7489 len. 38]: For , I thought , how would this end , how could this end , when so soon and so surely all his manly qualities were touched by the fatal blight that ruined everything it rested on !
Parsing [sent. 7490 len. 37]: I spoke to Richard with all the earnestness I felt , and all the hope I could not quite feel then , and implored him for Ada 's sake not to put any trust in Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 7491 len. 47]: To all I said , Richard readily assented , riding over the court and everything else in his easy way and drawing the brightest pictures of the character he was to settle into -- alas , when the grievous suit should loose its hold upon him !
Parsing [sent. 7492 len. 17]: We had a long talk , but it always came back to that , in substance .
Parsing [sent. 7493 len. 29]: At last we came to Soho Square , where Caddy Jellyby had appointed to wait for me , as a quiet place in the neighbourhood of Newman Street .
Parsing [sent. 7494 len. 17]: Caddy was in the garden in the centre and hurried out as soon as I appeared .
Parsing [sent. 7495 len. 11]: After a few cheerful words , Richard left us together .
Parsing [sent. 7496 len. 23]: `` Prince has a pupil over the way , Esther , '' said Caddy , `` and got the key for us .
Parsing [sent. 7497 len. 35]: So if you will walk round and round here with me , we can lock ourselves in and I can tell you comfortably what I wanted to see your dear good face about . ''
Parsing [sent. 7498 len. 17]: `` Very well , my dear , '' said I. `` Nothing could be better . ''
Parsing [sent. 7499 len. 35]: So Caddy , after affectionately squeezing the dear good face as she called it , locked the gate , and took my arm , and we began to walk round the garden very cosily .
Parsing [sent. 7500 len. 73]: `` You see , Esther , '' said Caddy , who thoroughly enjoyed a little confidence , `` after you spoke to me about its being wrong to marry without Ma 's knowledge , or even to keep Ma long in the dark respecting our engagement -- though I do n't believe Ma cares much for me , I must say -- I thought it right to mention your opinions to Prince .
Parsing [sent. 7501 len. 29]: In the first place because I want to profit by everything you tell me , and in the second place because I have no secrets from Prince . ''
Parsing [sent. 7502 len. 9]: `` I hope he approved , Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7503 len. 6]: `` Oh , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 7504 len. 12]: I assure you he would approve of anything you could say .
Parsing [sent. 7505 len. 13]: You have no idea what an opimon he has of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7506 len. 4]: `` Indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7507 len. 64]: `` Esther , it 's enough to make anybody but me jealous , '' said Caddy , laughing and shaking her head ; `` but it only makes me joyful , for you are the first friend I ever had , and the best friend I ever can have , and nobody can respect and love you too much to please me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7508 len. 26]: `` Upon my word , Caddy , '' said I , `` you are in the general conspiracy to keep me in a good humour .
Parsing [sent. 7509 len. 6]: Well , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7510 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7511 len. 19]: I am going to tell you , '' replied Caddy , crossing her hands confidentially upon my arm .
Parsing [sent. 7512 len. 38]: `` So we talked a good deal about it , and so I said to Prince , ` Prince , as Miss Summerson -- '' `` I hope you did n't say ` Miss Summerson ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7513 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 7514 len. 5]: I did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7515 len. 12]: cried Caddy , greatly pleased and with the brightest of faces .
Parsing [sent. 7516 len. 8]: `` I said , ` Esther . '
Parsing [sent. 7517 len. 60]: I said to Prince , ` As Esther is decidedly of that opinion , Prince , and has expressed it to me , and always hints it when she writes those kind notes , which you are so fond of hearing me read to you , I am prepared to disclose the truth to Ma whenever you think proper .
Parsing [sent. 7518 len. 41]: And I think , Prince , ' said I , ` that Esther thinks that I should be in a better , and truer , and more honourable position altogether if you did the same to your papa . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 7519 len. 17]: `` Yes , my dear , '' said I. `` Esther certainly does think so . ''
Parsing [sent. 7520 len. 10]: `` So I was right , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7521 len. 3]: exclaimed Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 7522 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7523 len. 67]: This troubled Prince a good deal , not because he had the least doubt about it , but because he is so considerate of the feelings of old Mr. Turveydrop ; and he had his apprehensions that old Mr. Turveydrop might break his heart , or faint away , or be very much overcome in some affecting manner or other if he made such an announcement .
Parsing [sent. 7524 len. 17]: He feared old Mr. Turveydrop might consider it undutiful and might receive too great a shock .
Parsing [sent. 7525 len. 28]: For old Mr. Turveydrop 's deportment is very beautiful , you know , Esther , '' said Caddy , `` and his feelings are extremely sensitive . ''
Parsing [sent. 7526 len. 8]: `` Are they , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7527 len. 6]: `` Oh , extremely sensitive .
Parsing [sent. 7528 len. 4]: Prince says so .
Parsing [sent. 7529 len. 43]: Now , this has caused my darling child -- I did n't mean to use the expression to you , Esther , '' Caddy apologized , her face suffused with blushes , `` but I generally call Prince my darling child . ''
Parsing [sent. 7530 len. 30]: I laughed ; and Caddy laughed and blushed , and went on ' `` This has caused him , Esther -- '' `` Caused whom , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7531 len. 8]: `` Oh , you tiresome thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7532 len. 12]: said Caddy , laughing , with her pretty face on fire .
Parsing [sent. 7533 len. 11]: `` My darling child , if you insist upon it !
Parsing [sent. 7534 len. 24]: This has caused him weeks of uneasiness and has made him delay , from day to day , in a very anxious manner .
Parsing [sent. 7535 len. 44]: At last he said to me , ` Caddy , if Miss Summerson , who is a great favourite with my father , could be prevailed upon to be present when I broke the subject , I think I could do it . '
Parsing [sent. 7536 len. 8]: So I promised I would ask you .
Parsing [sent. 7537 len. 38]: And I made up my mind , besides , '' said Caddy , looking at me hopefully but timidly , `` that if you consented , I would ask you afterwards to come with me to Ma .
Parsing [sent. 7538 len. 26]: This is what I meant when I said in my note that I had a great favour and a great assistance to beg of you .
Parsing [sent. 7539 len. 19]: And if you thought you could grant it , Esther , we should both be very grateful . ''
Parsing [sent. 7540 len. 15]: `` Let me see , Caddy , '' said I , pretending to consider .
Parsing [sent. 7541 len. 19]: `` Really , I think I could do a greater thing than that if the need were pressing .
Parsing [sent. 7542 len. 19]: I am at your service and the darling child 's , my dear , whenever you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7543 len. 82]: Caddy was quite transported by this reply of mine , being , I believe , as susceptible to the least kindness or encouragement as any tender heart that ever beat in this world ; and after another turn or two round the garden , during which she put on an entirely new pair of gloves and made herself as resplendent as possible that she might do no avoidable discredit to the Master of Deportment , we went to Newman Street direct .
Parsing [sent. 7544 len. 7]: Prince was teaching , of course .
Parsing [sent. 7545 len. 49]: We found him engaged with a not very hopeful pupil -- a stubborn little girl with a sulky forehead , a deep voice , and an inanimate , dissatisfied mama -- whose case was certainly not rendered more hopeful by the confusion into which we threw her preceptor .
Parsing [sent. 7546 len. 40]: The lesson at last came to an end , after proceeding as discordantly as possible ; and when the little girl had changed her shoes and had had her white muslin extinguished in shawls , she was taken away .
Parsing [sent. 7547 len. 49]: After a few words of preparation , we then went in search of Mr. Turveydrop , whom we found , grouped with his hat and gloves , as a model of deportment , on the sofa in his private apartment -- the only comfortable room in the house .
Parsing [sent. 7548 len. 36]: He appeared to have dressed at his leisure in the intervals of a light collation , and his dressing-case , brushes , and so forth , all of quite an elegant kind , lay about .
Parsing [sent. 7549 len. 10]: `` Father , Miss Summerson ; Miss Jellyby . ''
Parsing [sent. 7550 len. 3]: `` Charmed !
Parsing [sent. 7551 len. 3]: Enchanted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7552 len. 10]: said Mr. Turveydrop , rising with his high-shouldered bow .
Parsing [sent. 7553 len. 5]: `` Permit me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7554 len. 3]: Handing chairs .
Parsing [sent. 7555 len. 5]: `` Be seated ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7556 len. 8]: Kissing the tips of his left fingers .
Parsing [sent. 7557 len. 4]: `` Overjoyed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7558 len. 6]: Shutting his eyes and rolling .
Parsing [sent. 7559 len. 10]: `` My little retreat is made a paradise . ''
Parsing [sent. 7560 len. 12]: Recomposing himself on the sofa like the second gentleman in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 7561 len. 23]: `` Again you find us , Miss Summerson , '' said he , `` using our little arts to polish , polish !
Parsing [sent. 7562 len. 16]: Again the sex stimulates us and rewards us by the condescension of its lovely presence .
Parsing [sent. 7563 len. 52]: It is much in these times -LRB- and we have made an awfully degenerating business of it since the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent -- my patron , if I may presume to say so -RRB- to experience that deportment is not wholly trodden under foot by mechanics .
Parsing [sent. 7564 len. 16]: That it can yet bask in the smile of beauty , my dear madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 7565 len. 19]: I said nothing , which I thought a suitable reply ; and he took a pinch of snuff .
Parsing [sent. 7566 len. 18]: `` My dear son , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` you have four schools this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 7567 len. 8]: I would recommend a hasty sandwich . ''
Parsing [sent. 7568 len. 19]: `` Thank you , father , '' returned Prince , `` I will be sure to be punctual .
Parsing [sent. 7569 len. 21]: My dear father , may I beg you to prepare your mind for what I am going to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7570 len. 5]: `` Good heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7571 len. 21]: exclaimed the model , pale and aghast as Prince and Caddy , hand in hand , bent down before him .
Parsing [sent. 7572 len. 5]: `` What is this ?
Parsing [sent. 7573 len. 4]: Is this lunacy !
Parsing [sent. 7574 len. 6]: Or what is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7575 len. 23]: `` Father , '' returned Prince with great submission , `` I love this young lady , and we are engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 7576 len. 4]: `` Engaged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7577 len. 17]: cried Mr. Turveydrop , reclining on the sofa and shutting out the sight with his hand .
Parsing [sent. 7578 len. 13]: `` An arrow launched at my brain by my own child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7579 len. 46]: `` We have been engaged for some time , father , '' faltered Prince , `` and Miss Summerson , hearing of it , advised that we should declare the fact to you and was so very kind as to attend on the present occasion .
Parsing [sent. 7580 len. 14]: Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , father . ''
Parsing [sent. 7581 len. 6]: Mr. Turveydrop uttered a groan .
Parsing [sent. 7582 len. 7]: `` No , pray do n't !
Parsing [sent. 7583 len. 11]: Pray do n't , father , '' urged his son .
Parsing [sent. 7584 len. 23]: `` Miss Jellyby is a young lady who deeply respects you , and our first desire is to consider your comfort . ''
Parsing [sent. 7585 len. 4]: Mr. Turveydrop sobbed .
Parsing [sent. 7586 len. 10]: `` No , pray do n't , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7587 len. 4]: cried his son .
Parsing [sent. 7588 len. 21]: `` Boy , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` it is well that your sainted mother is spared this pang .
Parsing [sent. 7589 len. 7]: Strike deep , and spare not .
Parsing [sent. 7590 len. 9]: Strike home , sir , strike home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7591 len. 16]: `` Pray do n't say so , father , '' implored Prince , in tears .
Parsing [sent. 7592 len. 7]: `` It goes to my heart .
Parsing [sent. 7593 len. 19]: I do assure you , father , that our first wish and intention is to consider your comfort .
Parsing [sent. 7594 len. 44]: Caroline and I do not forget our duty -- what is my duty is Caroline 's , as we have often said together -- and with your approval and consent , father , we will devote ourselves to making your life agreeable . ''
Parsing [sent. 7595 len. 9]: `` Strike home , '' murmured Mr. Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 7596 len. 5]: `` Strike home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7597 len. 11]: But he seemed to listen , I thought , too .
Parsing [sent. 7598 len. 42]: `` My dear father , '' returned Prince , `` we well know what little comforts you are accustomed to and have a right to , and it will always be our study and our pride to provide those before anything .
Parsing [sent. 7599 len. 47]: If you will bless us with your approval and consent , father , we shall not think of being married until it is quite agreeable to you ; and when we ARE married , we shall always make you -- of course -- our first consideration .
Parsing [sent. 7600 len. 45]: You must ever be the head and master here , father ; and we feel how truly unnatural it would be in us if we failed to know it or if we failed to exert ourselves in every possible way to please you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7601 len. 30]: Mr. Turveydrop underwent a severe internal struggle and came upright on the sofa again with his cheeks puffing over his stiff cravat , a perfect model of parental deportment .
Parsing [sent. 7602 len. 5]: `` My son ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7603 len. 4]: said Mr. Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 7604 len. 4]: `` My children !
Parsing [sent. 7605 len. 7]: I can not resist your prayer .
Parsing [sent. 7606 len. 4]: Be happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7607 len. 35]: His benignity as he raised his future daughter-in-law and stretched out his hand to his son -LRB- who kissed it with affectionate respect and gratitude -RRB- was the most confusing sight I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 7608 len. 32]: `` My children , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , paternally encircling Caddy with his left arm as she sat beside him , and putting his right hand gracefully on his hip .
Parsing [sent. 7609 len. 13]: `` My son and daughter , your happiness shall be my care .
Parsing [sent. 7610 len. 6]: I will watch over you .
Parsing [sent. 7611 len. 36]: You shall always live with me '' -- meaning , of course , I will always live with you -- `` this house is henceforth as much yours as mine ; consider it your home .
Parsing [sent. 7612 len. 11]: May you long live to share it with me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7613 len. 42]: The power of his deportment was such that they really were as much overcome with thankfulness as if , instead of quartering himself upon them for the rest of his life , he were making some munificent sacrifice in their favour .
Parsing [sent. 7614 len. 47]: `` For myself , my children , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` I am falling into the sear and yellow leaf , and it is impossible to say how long the last feeble traces of gentlemanly deportment may linger in this weaving and spinning age .
Parsing [sent. 7615 len. 23]: But , so long , I will do my duty to society and will show myself , as usual , about town .
Parsing [sent. 7616 len. 7]: My wants are few and simple .
Parsing [sent. 7617 len. 24]: My little apartment here , my few essentials for the toilet , my frugal morning meal , and my little dinner will suffice .
Parsing [sent. 7618 len. 22]: I charge your dutiful affection with the supply of these requirements , and I charge myself with all the rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 7619 len. 9]: They were overpowered afresh by his uncommon generosity .
Parsing [sent. 7620 len. 51]: `` My son , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` for those little points in which you are deficient -- points of deportment , which are born with a man , which may be improved by cultivation , but can never be originated -- you may still rely on me .
Parsing [sent. 7621 len. 26]: I have been faithful to my post since the days of his Royal Highness the Prince Regent , and I will not desert it now .
Parsing [sent. 7622 len. 5]: No , my son .
Parsing [sent. 7623 len. 29]: If you have ever contemplated your father 's poor position with a feeling of pride , you may rest assured that he will do nothing to tarnish it .
Parsing [sent. 7624 len. 44]: For yourself , Prince , whose character is different -LRB- we can not be all alike , nor is it advisable that we should -RRB- , work , be industrious , earn money , and extend the connexion as much as possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 7625 len. 21]: `` That you may depend I will do , dear father , with all my heart , '' replied Prince .
Parsing [sent. 7626 len. 13]: `` I have no doubt of it , '' said Mr. Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 7627 len. 18]: `` Your qualities are not shining , my dear child , but they are steady and useful .
Parsing [sent. 7628 len. 58]: And to both of you , my children , I would merely observe , in the spirit of a sainted wooman on whose path I had the happiness of casting , I believe , SOME ray of light , take care of the establishment , take care of my simple wants , and bless you both ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7629 len. 38]: Old Mr. Turveydrop then became so very gallant , in honour of the occasion , that I told Caddy we must really go to Thavies Inn at once if we were to go at all that day .
Parsing [sent. 7630 len. 48]: So we took our departure after a very loving farewell between Caddy and her betrothed , and during our walk she was so happy and so full of old Mr. Turveydrop 's praises that I would not have said a word in his disparagement for any consideration .
Parsing [sent. 7631 len. 28]: The house in Thavies Inn had bills in the windows annoucing that it was to let , and it looked dirtier and gloomier and ghastlier than ever .
Parsing [sent. 7632 len. 53]: The name of poor Mr. Jellyby had appeared in the list of bankrupts but a day or two before , and he was shut up in the dining-room with two gentlemen and a heap of blue bags , account-books , and papers , making the most desperate endeavours to understand his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7633 len. 61]: They appeared to me to be quite beyond his comprehension , for when Caddy took me into the dining-room by mistake and we came upon Mr. Jellyby in his spectacles , forlornly fenced into a corner by the great dining-table and the two gentlemen , he seemed to have given up the whole thing and to be speechless and insensible .
Parsing [sent. 7634 len. 58]: Going upstairs to Mrs. Jellyby 's room -LRB- the children were all screaming in the kitchen , and there was no servant to be seen -RRB- , we found that lady in the midst of a voluminous correspondence , opening , reading , and sorting letters , with a great accumulation of torn covers on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 7635 len. 30]: She was so preoccupied that at first she did not know me , though she sat looking at me with that curious , bright-eyed , far-off look of hers .
Parsing [sent. 7636 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 7637 len. 4]: Miss Summerson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7638 len. 5]: she said at last .
Parsing [sent. 7639 len. 9]: `` I was thinking of something so different !
Parsing [sent. 7640 len. 6]: I hope you are well .
Parsing [sent. 7641 len. 7]: I am happy to see you .
Parsing [sent. 7642 len. 9]: Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Clare quite well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7643 len. 11]: I hoped in return that Mr. Jellyby was quite well .
Parsing [sent. 7644 len. 18]: `` Why , not quite , my dear , '' said Mrs. Jellyby in the calmest manner .
Parsing [sent. 7645 len. 16]: `` He has been unfortunate in his affairs and is a little out of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 7646 len. 19]: Happily for me , I am so much engaged that I have no time to think about it .
Parsing [sent. 7647 len. 36]: We have , at the present moment , one hundred and seventy families , Miss Summerson , averaging five persons in each , either gone or going to the left bank of the Niger . ''
Parsing [sent. 7648 len. 32]: I thought of the one family so near us who were neither gone nor going to the left bank of the Niger , and wondered how she could be so placid .
Parsing [sent. 7649 len. 21]: `` You have brought Caddy back , I see , '' observed Mrs. Jellyby with a glance at her daughter .
Parsing [sent. 7650 len. 12]: `` It has become quite a novelty to see her here .
Parsing [sent. 7651 len. 18]: She has almost deserted her old employment and in fact obliges me to employ a boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 7652 len. 11]: `` I am sure , Ma -- '' began Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 7653 len. 28]: `` Now you know , Caddy , '' her mother mildly interposed , `` that I DO employ a boy , who is now at his dinner .
Parsing [sent. 7654 len. 9]: What is the use of your contradicting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7655 len. 14]: `` I was not going to contradict , Ma , '' returned Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 7656 len. 23]: `` I was only going to say that surely you would n't have me be a mere drudge all my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 7657 len. 45]: `` I believe , my dear , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , still opening her letters , casting her bright eyes smilingly over them , and sorting them as she spoke , `` that you have a business example before you in your mother .
Parsing [sent. 7658 len. 2]: Besides .
Parsing [sent. 7659 len. 4]: A mere drudge ?
Parsing [sent. 7660 len. 23]: If you had any sympathy with the destinies of the human race , it would raise you high above any such idea .
Parsing [sent. 7661 len. 5]: But you have none .
Parsing [sent. 7662 len. 15]: I have often told you , Caddy , you have no such sympathy . ''
Parsing [sent. 7663 len. 14]: `` Not if it 's Africa , Ma , I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 7664 len. 7]: `` Of course you have not .
Parsing [sent. 7665 len. 49]: Now , if I were not happily so much engaged , Miss Summerson , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , sweetly casting her eyes for a moment on me and considering where to put the particular letter she had just opened , `` this would distress and disappoint me .
Parsing [sent. 7666 len. 34]: But I have so much to think of , in connexion with Borrioboola -- Gha and it is so necessary I should concentrate myself that there is my remedy , you see . ''
Parsing [sent. 7667 len. 48]: As Caddy gave me a glance of entreaty , and as Mrs. Jellyby was looking far away into Africa straight through my bonnet and head , I thought it a good opportunity to come to the subject of my visit and to attract Mrs. Jellyby 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 7668 len. 21]: `` Perhaps , '' I began , `` you will wonder what has brought me here to interrupt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7669 len. 23]: `` I am always delighted to see Miss Summerson , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , pursuing her employment with a placid smile .
Parsing [sent. 7670 len. 23]: `` Though I wish , '' and she shook her head , `` she was more interested in the Borrioboolan project . ''
Parsing [sent. 7671 len. 50]: `` I have come with Caddy , '' said I , `` because Caddy justly thinks she ought not to have a secret from her mother and fancies I shall encourage and aid her -LRB- though I am sure I do n't know how -RRB- in imparting one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7672 len. 36]: `` Caddy , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , pausing for a moment in her occupation and then serenely pursuing it after shaking her head , `` you are going to tell me some nonsense . ''
Parsing [sent. 7673 len. 38]: Caddy untied the strings of her bonnet , took her bonnet off , and letting it dangle on the floor by the strings , and crying heartily , said , `` Ma , I am engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 7674 len. 8]: `` Oh , you ridiculous child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7675 len. 24]: observed Mrs. Jellyby with an abstracted air as she looked over the dispatch last opened ; `` what a goose you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7676 len. 61]: `` I am engaged , Ma , '' sobbed Caddy , `` to young Mr. Turveydrop , at the academy ; and old Mr. Turveydrop -LRB- who is a very gentlemanly man indeed -RRB- has given his consent , and I beg and pray you 'll give us yours , Ma , because I never could be happy without it .
Parsing [sent. 7677 len. 7]: I never , never could ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7678 len. 17]: sobbed Caddy , quite forgetful of her general complainings and of everything but her natural affection .
Parsing [sent. 7679 len. 39]: `` You see again , Miss Summerson , '' observed Mrs. Jellyby serenely , `` what a happiness it is to be so much occupied as I am and to have this necessity for self-concentration that I have .
Parsing [sent. 7680 len. 31]: Here is Caddy engaged to a dancing-master 's son -- mixed up with people who have no more sympathy with the destinies of the human race than she has herself !
Parsing [sent. 7681 len. 33]: This , too , when Mr. Quale , one of the first philanthropists of our time , has mentioned to me that he was really disposed to be interested in her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7682 len. 12]: `` Ma , I always hated and detested Mr. Quale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7683 len. 3]: sobbed Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 7684 len. 6]: `` Caddy , Caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7685 len. 12]: returned Mrs. Jellyby , opening another letter with the greatest complacency .
Parsing [sent. 7686 len. 8]: `` I have no doubt you did .
Parsing [sent. 7687 len. 17]: How could you do otherwise , being totally destitute of the sympathies with which he overflows !
Parsing [sent. 7688 len. 39]: Now , if my public duties were not a favourite child to me , if I were not occupied with large measures on a vast scale , these petty details might grieve me very much , Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 7689 len. 33]: But can I permit the film of a silly proceeding on the part of Caddy -LRB- from whom I expect nothing else -RRB- to interpose between me and the great African continent ?
Parsing [sent. 7690 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 7691 len. 27]: No , '' repeated Mrs. Jellyby in a calm clear voice , and with an agreeable smile , as she opened more letters and sorted them .
Parsing [sent. 7692 len. 6]: `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7693 len. 28]: I was so unprepared for the perfect coolness of this reception , though I might have expected it , that I did not know what to say .
Parsing [sent. 7694 len. 7]: Caddy seemed equally at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 7695 len. 33]: Mrs. Jellyby continued to open and sort letters and to repeat occasionally in quite a charming tone of voice and with a smile of perfect composure , `` No , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 7696 len. 20]: `` I hope , Ma , '' sobbed poor Caddy at last , `` you are not angry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7697 len. 35]: `` Oh , Caddy , you really are an absurd girl , '' returned Mrs. Jellyby , `` to ask such questions after what I have said of the preoccupation of my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 7698 len. 18]: `` And I hope , Ma , you give us your consent and wish us well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7699 len. 3]: said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 7700 len. 37]: `` You are a nonsensical child to have done anything of this kind , '' said Mrs. Jellyby ; `` and a degenerate child , when you might have devoted yourself to the great public measure .
Parsing [sent. 7701 len. 22]: But the step is taken , and I have engaged a boy , and there is no more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 7702 len. 44]: Now , pray , Caddy , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , for Caddy was kissing her , `` do n't delay me in my work , but let me clear off this heavy batch of papers before the afternoon post comes in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7703 len. 39]: I thought I could not do better than take my leave ; I was detained for a moment by Caddy 's saying , `` You wo n't object to my bringing him to see you , Ma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7704 len. 27]: `` Oh , dear me , Caddy , '' cried Mrs. Jellyby , who had relapsed into that distant contemplation , `` have you begun again ?
Parsing [sent. 7705 len. 4]: Bring whom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7706 len. 6]: `` Him , Ma . ''
Parsing [sent. 7707 len. 6]: `` Caddy , Caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7708 len. 11]: said Mrs. Jellyby , quite weary of such little matters .
Parsing [sent. 7709 len. 26]: `` Then you must bring him some evening which is not a Parent Society night , or a Branch night , or a Ramification night .
Parsing [sent. 7710 len. 12]: You must accommodate the visit to the demands upon my time .
Parsing [sent. 7711 len. 21]: My dear Miss Summerson , it was very kind of you to come here to help out this silly chit .
Parsing [sent. 7712 len. 2]: Good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 7713 len. 38]: When I tell you that I have fifty-eight new letters from manufacturing families anxious to understand the details of the native and coffee-cultivation question this morning , I need not apologize for having very little leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 7714 len. 69]: I was not surprised by Caddy 's being in low spirits when we went downstairs , or by her sobbing afresh on my neck , or by her saying she would far rather have been scolded than treated with such indifference , or by her confiding to me that she was so poor in clothes that how she was ever to be married creditably she did n't know .
Parsing [sent. 7715 len. 86]: I gradually cheered her up by dwelling on the many things she would do for her unfortunate father and for Peepy when she had a home of her own ; and finally we went downstairs into the damp dark kitchen , where Peepy and his little brothers and sisters were grovelling on the stone floor and where we had such a game of play with them that to prevent myself from being quite torn to pieces I was obliged to fall back on my fairy-tales .
Parsing [sent. 7716 len. 23]: From time to time I heard loud voices in the parlour overhead , and occasionally a violent tumbling about of the furniture .
Parsing [sent. 7717 len. 44]: The last effect I am afraid was caused by poor Mr. Jellyby 's breaking away from the dining-table and making rushes at the window with the intention of throwing himself into the area whenever he made any new attempt to understand his affairs .
Parsing [sent. 7718 len. 48]: As I rode quietly home at night after the day 's bustle , I thought a good deal of Caddy 's engagement and felt confirmed in my hopes -LRB- in spite of the elder Mr. Turveydrop -RRB- that she would be the happier and better for it .
Parsing [sent. 7719 len. 44]: And if there seemed to be but a slender chance of her and her husband ever finding out what the model of deportment really was , why that was all for the best too , and who would wish them to be wiser ?
Parsing [sent. 7720 len. 22]: I did not wish them to be any wiser and indeed was half ashamed of not entirely believing in him myself .
Parsing [sent. 7721 len. 43]: And I looked up at the stars , and thought about travellers in distant countries and the stars THEY saw , and hoped I might always be so blest and happy as to be useful to some one in my small way .
Parsing [sent. 7722 len. 39]: They were so glad to see me when I got home , as they always were , that I could have sat down and cried for joy if that had not been a method of making myself disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 7723 len. 51]: Everybody in the house , from the lowest to the highest , showed me such a bright face of welcome , and spoke so cheerily , and was so happy to do anything for me , that I suppose there never was such a fortunate little creature in the world .
Parsing [sent. 7724 len. 40]: We got into such a chatty state that night , through Ada and my guardian drawing me out to tell them all about Caddy , that I went on prose , prose , prosing for a length of time .
Parsing [sent. 7725 len. 32]: At last I got up to my own room , quite red to think how I had been holding forth , and then I heard a soft tap at my door .
Parsing [sent. 7726 len. 9]: So I said , `` Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7727 len. 19]: and there came in a pretty little girl , neatly dressed in mourning , who dropped a curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 7728 len. 23]: `` If you please , miss , '' said the little girl in a soft voice , `` I am Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 7729 len. 21]: `` Why , so you are , '' said I , stooping down in astonishment and giving her a kiss .
Parsing [sent. 7730 len. 12]: `` How glad am I to see you , Charley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7731 len. 23]: `` If you please , miss , '' pursued Charley in the same soft voice , `` I 'm your maid . ''
Parsing [sent. 7732 len. 4]: `` Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7733 len. 21]: `` If you please , miss , I 'm a present to you , with Mr. Jarndyce 's love . ''
Parsing [sent. 7734 len. 15]: I sat down with my hand on Charley 's neck and looked at Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7735 len. 38]: `` And oh , miss , '' says Charley , clapping her hands , with the tears starting down her dimpled cheeks , `` Tom 's at school , if you please , and learning so good !
Parsing [sent. 7736 len. 18]: And little Emma , she 's with Mrs. Blinder , miss , a-being took such care of !
Parsing [sent. 7737 len. 63]: And Tom , he would have been at school -- and Emma , she would have been left with Mrs. Blinder -- and me , I should have been here -- all a deal sooner , miss ; only Mr. Jarndyce thought that Tom and Emma and me had better get a little used to parting first , we was so small .
Parsing [sent. 7738 len. 11]: Do n't cry , if you please , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7739 len. 10]: `` I ca n't help it , Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 7740 len. 16]: `` No , miss , nor I ca n't help it , '' says Charley .
Parsing [sent. 7741 len. 26]: `` And if you please , miss , Mr. Jarndyce 's love , and he thinks you 'll like to teach me now and then .
Parsing [sent. 7742 len. 19]: And if you please , Tom and Emma and me is to see each other once a month .
Parsing [sent. 7743 len. 32]: And I 'm so happy and so thankful , miss , '' cried Charley with a heaving heart , `` and I 'll try to be such a good maid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7744 len. 14]: `` Oh , Charley dear , never forget who did all this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7745 len. 9]: `` No , miss , I never will .
Parsing [sent. 7746 len. 5]: Nor Tom wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 7747 len. 4]: Nor yet Emma .
Parsing [sent. 7748 len. 8]: It was all you , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 7749 len. 8]: `` I have known nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 7750 len. 8]: It was Mr. Jarndyce , Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 7751 len. 23]: `` Yes , miss , but it was all done for the love of you and that you might be my mistress .
Parsing [sent. 7752 len. 26]: If you please , miss , I am a little present with his love , and it was all done for the love of you .
Parsing [sent. 7753 len. 12]: Me and Tom was to be sure to remember it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7754 len. 32]: Charley dried her eyes and entered on her functions , going in her matronly little way about and about the room and folding up everything she could lay her hands upon .
Parsing [sent. 7755 len. 25]: Presently Charley came creeping back to my side and said , `` Oh , do n't cry , if you please , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 7756 len. 15]: And I said again , `` I ca n't help it , Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 7757 len. 18]: And Charley said again , `` No , miss , nor I ca n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7758 len. 18]: And so , after all , I did cry for joy indeed , and so did she .
Parsing [sent. 7759 len. 35]: Chapter XXIV -- An Appeal Case As soon as Richard and I had held the conversation of which I have given an account , Richard communicated the state of his mind to Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 7760 len. 25]: I doubt if my guardian were altogether taken by surprise when he received the representation , though it caused him much uneasiness and disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 7761 len. 41]: He and Richard were often closeted together , late at night and early in the morning , and passed whole days in London , and had innumerable appointments with Mr. Kenge , and laboured through a quantity of disagreeable business .
Parsing [sent. 7762 len. 62]: While they were thus employed , my guardian , though he underwent considerable inconvenience from the state of the wind and rubbed his head so constantly that not a single hair upon it ever rested in its right place , was as genial with Ada and me as at any other time , but maintained a steady reserve on these matters .
Parsing [sent. 7763 len. 38]: And as our utmost endeavours could only elicit from Richard himself sweeping assurances that everything was going on capitally and that it really was all right at last , our anxiety was not much relieved by him .
Parsing [sent. 7764 len. 120]: We learnt , however , as the time went on , that a new application was made to the Lord Chancellor on Richard 's behalf as an infant and a ward , and I do n't know what , and that there was a quantity of talking , and that the Lord Chancellor described him in open court as a vexatious and capricious infant , and that the matter was adjourned and readjourned , and referred , and reported on , and petitioned about until Richard began to doubt -LRB- as he told us -RRB- whether , if he entered the army at all , it would not be as a veteran of seventy or eighty years of age .
Parsing [sent. 7765 len. 57]: At last an appointment was made for him to see the Lord Chancellor again in his private room , and there the Lord Chancellor very seriously reproved him for trifling with time and not knowing his mind -- `` a pretty good joke , I think , '' said Richard , `` from that quarter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7766 len. 14]: -- and at last it was settled that his application should be granted .
Parsing [sent. 7767 len. 57]: His name was entered at the Horse Guards as an applicant for an ensign 's commission ; the purchase-money was deposited at an agent 's ; and Richard , in his usual characteristic way , plunged into a violent course of military study and got up at five o'clock every morning to practise the broadsword exercise .
Parsing [sent. 7768 len. 11]: Thus , vacation succeeded term , and term succeeded vacation .
Parsing [sent. 7769 len. 43]: We sometimes heard of Jarndyce and Jarndyce as being in the paper or out of the paper , or as being to be mentioned , or as being to be spoken to ; and it came on , and it went off .
Parsing [sent. 7770 len. 54]: Richard , who was now in a professor 's house in London , was able to be with us less frequently than before ; my guardian still maintained the same reserve ; and so time passed until the commission was obtained and Richard received directions with it to join a regiment in Ireland .
Parsing [sent. 7771 len. 18]: He arrived post-haste with the intelligence one evening , and had a long conference with my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 7772 len. 31]: Upwards of an hour elapsed before my guardian put his head into the room where Ada and I were sitting and said , `` Come in , my dears ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7773 len. 25]: We went in and found Richard , whom we had last seen in high spirits , leaning on the chimney-piece looking mortified and angry .
Parsing [sent. 7774 len. 20]: `` Rick and I , Ada , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` are not quite of one mind .
Parsing [sent. 7775 len. 14]: Come , come , Rick , put a brighter face upon it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7776 len. 14]: `` You are very hard with me , sir , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7777 len. 26]: `` The harder because you have been so considerate to me in all other respects and have done me kindnesses that I can never acknowledge .
Parsing [sent. 7778 len. 13]: I never could have been set right without you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7779 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7780 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 7781 len. 10]: `` I want to set you more right yet .
Parsing [sent. 7782 len. 11]: I want to set you more right with yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7783 len. 36]: `` I hope you will excuse my saying , sir , '' returned Richard in a fiery way , but yet respectfully , `` that I think I am the best judge about myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 7784 len. 45]: `` I hope you will excuse my saying , my dear Rick , '' observed Mr. Jarndyce with the sweetest cheerfulness and good humour , `` that 's it 's quite natural in you to think so , but I do n't think so .
Parsing [sent. 7785 len. 34]: I must do my duty , Rick , or you could never care for me in cool blood ; and I hope you will always care for me , cool and hot . ''
Parsing [sent. 7786 len. 19]: Ada had turned so pale that he made her sit down in his reading-chair and sat beside her .
Parsing [sent. 7787 len. 17]: `` It 's nothing , my dear , '' he said , `` it 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7788 len. 23]: Rick and I have only had a friendly difference , which we must state to you , for you are the theme .
Parsing [sent. 7789 len. 10]: Now you are afraid of what 's coming . ''
Parsing [sent. 7790 len. 26]: `` I am not indeed , cousin John , '' replied Ada with a smile , `` if it is to come from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 7791 len. 7]: `` Thank you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 7792 len. 15]: Do you give me a minute 's calm attention , without looking at Rick .
Parsing [sent. 7793 len. 9]: And , little woman , do you likewise .
Parsing [sent. 7794 len. 43]: My dear girl , '' putting his hand on hers as it lay on the side of the easy-chair , `` you recollect the talk we had , we four when the little woman told me of a little love affair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7795 len. 22]: `` It is not likely that either Richard or I can ever forget your kindness that day , cousin John . ''
Parsing [sent. 7796 len. 11]: `` I can never forget it , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7797 len. 12]: `` And I can never forget it , '' said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 7798 len. 38]: `` So much the easier what I have to say , and so much the easier for us to agree , '' returned my guardian , his face irradiated by the gentleness and honour of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 7799 len. 21]: `` Ada , my bird , you should know that Rick has now chosen his profession for the last time .
Parsing [sent. 7800 len. 15]: All that he has of certainty will be expended when he is fully equipped .
Parsing [sent. 7801 len. 17]: He has exhausted his resources and is bound henceforward to the tree he has planted . ''
Parsing [sent. 7802 len. 20]: `` Quite true that I have exhausted my present resources , and I am quite content to know it .
Parsing [sent. 7803 len. 21]: But what I have of certainty , sir , '' said Richard , `` is not all I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 7804 len. 6]: `` Rick , Rick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7805 len. 31]: cried my guardian with a sudden terror in his manner , and in an altered voice , and putting up his hands as if he would have stopped his ears .
Parsing [sent. 7806 len. 19]: `` For the love of God , do n't found a hope or expectation on the family curse !
Parsing [sent. 7807 len. 26]: Whatever you do on this side the grave , never give one lingering glance towards the horrible phantom that has haunted us so many years .
Parsing [sent. 7808 len. 13]: Better to borrow , better to beg , better to die ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7809 len. 11]: We were all startled by the fervour of this warning .
Parsing [sent. 7810 len. 31]: Richard bit his lip and held his breath , and glanced at me as if he felt , and knew that I felt too , how much he needed it .
Parsing [sent. 7811 len. 36]: `` Ada , my dear , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , recovering his cheerfulness , `` these are strong words of advice , but I live in Bleak House and have seen a sight here .
Parsing [sent. 7812 len. 4]: Enough of that .
Parsing [sent. 7813 len. 14]: All Richard had to start him in the race of life is ventured .
Parsing [sent. 7814 len. 33]: I recommend to him and you , for his sake and your own , that he should depart from us with the understanding that there is no sort of contract between you .
Parsing [sent. 7815 len. 5]: I must go further .
Parsing [sent. 7816 len. 8]: 1 will be plain with you both .
Parsing [sent. 7817 len. 16]: You were to confide freely in me , and I will confide freely in you .
Parsing [sent. 7818 len. 18]: I ask you wholly to relinquish , for the present , any tie but your relationship . ''
Parsing [sent. 7819 len. 32]: `` Better to say at once , sir , '' returned Richard , `` that you renounce all confidence in me and that you advise Ada to do the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 7820 len. 19]: `` Better to say nothing of the sort , Rick , because I do n't mean it . ''
Parsing [sent. 7821 len. 14]: `` You think I have begun ill , sir , '' retorted Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7822 len. 8]: `` I HAVE , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 7823 len. 35]: `` How I hoped you would begin , and how go on , I told you when we spoke of these things last , '' said Mr. Jarndyce in a cordial and encouraging manner .
Parsing [sent. 7824 len. 34]: `` You have not made that beginning yet , but there is a time for all things , and yours is not gone by ; rather , it is just now fully come .
Parsing [sent. 7825 len. 6]: Make a clear beginning altogether .
Parsing [sent. 7826 len. 12]: You two -LRB- very young , my dears -RRB- are cousins .
Parsing [sent. 7827 len. 8]: As yet , you are nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 7828 len. 18]: What more may come must come of being worked out , Rick , and no sooner . ''
Parsing [sent. 7829 len. 14]: `` You are very hard with me , sir , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7830 len. 12]: `` Harder than I could have supposed you would be . ''
Parsing [sent. 7831 len. 25]: `` My dear boy , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` I am harder with myself when I do anything that gives you pain .
Parsing [sent. 7832 len. 9]: You have your remedy in your own hands .
Parsing [sent. 7833 len. 23]: Ada , it is better for him that he should be free and that there should be no youthful engagement between you .
Parsing [sent. 7834 len. 17]: Rick , it is better for her , much better ; you owe it to her .
Parsing [sent. 7835 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 7836 len. 21]: Each of you will do what is best for the other , if not what is best for yourselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 7837 len. 9]: `` Why is it best , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7838 len. 4]: returned Richard hastily .
Parsing [sent. 7839 len. 12]: `` It was not when we opened our hearts to you .
Parsing [sent. 7840 len. 8]: You did not say so then . ''
Parsing [sent. 7841 len. 7]: `` I have had experience since .
Parsing [sent. 7842 len. 16]: I do n't blame you , Rick , but I have had experience since . ''
Parsing [sent. 7843 len. 9]: `` You mean of me , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7844 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 7845 len. 13]: Yes , of both of you , '' said Mr. Jarndyce kindly .
Parsing [sent. 7846 len. 14]: `` The time is not come for your standing pledged to one another .
Parsing [sent. 7847 len. 12]: It is not right , and I must not recognize it .
Parsing [sent. 7848 len. 11]: Come , come , my young cousins , begin afresh !
Parsing [sent. 7849 len. 19]: Bygones shall be bygones , and a new page turned for you to write your lives in . ''
Parsing [sent. 7850 len. 11]: Richard gave an anxious glance at Ada but said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7851 len. 41]: `` I have avoided saying one word to either of you or to Esther , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` until now , in order that we might be open as the day , and all on equal terms .
Parsing [sent. 7852 len. 20]: I now affectionately advise , I now most earnestly entreat , you two to part as you came here .
Parsing [sent. 7853 len. 11]: Leave all else to time , truth , and steadfastness .
Parsing [sent. 7854 len. 25]: If you do otherwise , you will do wrong , and you will have made me do wrong in ever bringing you together . ''
Parsing [sent. 7855 len. 5]: A long silence succeeded .
Parsing [sent. 7856 len. 35]: `` Cousin Richard , '' said Ada then , raising her blue eyes tenderly to his face , `` after what our cousin John has said , I think no choice is left us .
Parsing [sent. 7857 len. 42]: Your mind may he quite at ease about me , for you will leave me here under his care and will be sure that I can have nothing to wish for -- quite sure if I guide myself by his advice .
Parsing [sent. 7858 len. 43]: I -- I do n't doubt , cousin Richard , '' said Ada , a little confused , `` that you are very fond of me , and I -- I do n't think you will fall in love with anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 7859 len. 25]: But I should like you to consider well about it too , as I should like you to be in all things very happy .
Parsing [sent. 7860 len. 9]: You may trust in me , cousin Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7861 len. 19]: I am not at all changeable ; but I am not unreasonable , and should never blame you .
Parsing [sent. 7862 len. 29]: Even cousins may be sorry to part ; and in truth I am very , very sorry , Richard , though I know it 's for your welfare .
Parsing [sent. 7863 len. 32]: I shall always think of you affectionately , and often talk of you with Esther , and -- and perhaps you will sometimes think a little of me , cousin Richard .
Parsing [sent. 7864 len. 48]: So now , '' said Ada , going up to him and giving him her trembling hand , `` we are only cousins again , Richard -- for the time perhaps -- and I pray for a blessing on my dear cousin , wherever he goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7865 len. 37]: It was strange to me that Richard should not be able to forgive my guardian for entertaining the very same opinion of him which he himself had expressed of himself in much stronger terms to me .
Parsing [sent. 7866 len. 7]: But it was certainly the case .
Parsing [sent. 7867 len. 25]: I observed with great regret that from this hour he never was as free and open with Mr. Jarndyce as he had been before .
Parsing [sent. 7868 len. 29]: He had every reason given him to be so , but he was not ; and solely on his side , an estrangement began to arise between them .
Parsing [sent. 7869 len. 41]: In the business of preparation and equipment he soon lost himself , and even his grief at parting from Ada , who remained in Hertfordshire while he , Mr. Jarndyce , and I went up to London for a week .
Parsing [sent. 7870 len. 26]: He remembered her by fits and starts , even with bursts of tears , and at such times would confide to me the heaviest self-reproaches .
Parsing [sent. 7871 len. 35]: But in a few minutes he would recklessly conjure up some undefinable means by which they were both to be made rich and happy for ever , and would become as gay as possible .
Parsing [sent. 7872 len. 28]: It was a busy time , and I trotted about with him all day long , buying a variety of things of which he stood in need .
Parsing [sent. 7873 len. 20]: Of the things he would have bought if he had been left to his own ways I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 7874 len. 46]: He was perfectly confidential with me , and often talked so sensibly and feelingly about his faults and his vigorous resolutions , and dwelt so much upon the encouragement he derived from these conversations that I could never have been tired if I had tried .
Parsing [sent. 7875 len. 51]: There used , in that week , to come backward and forward to our lodging to fence with Richard a person who had formerly been a cavalry soldier ; he was a fine bluff-looking man , of a frank free bearing , with whom Richard had practised for some months .
Parsing [sent. 7876 len. 36]: I heard so much about him , not only from Richard , but from my guardian too , that I was purposely in the room with my work one morning after breakfast when he came .
Parsing [sent. 7877 len. 20]: `` Good morning , Mr. George , '' said my guardian , who happened to be alone with me .
Parsing [sent. 7878 len. 8]: `` Mr. Carstone will be here directly .
Parsing [sent. 7879 len. 14]: Meanwhile , Miss Summerson is very happy to see you , I know .
Parsing [sent. 7880 len. 4]: Sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 7881 len. 32]: He sat down , a little disconcerted by my presence , I thought , and without looking at me , drew his heavy sunburnt hand across and across his upper lip .
Parsing [sent. 7882 len. 14]: `` You are as punctual as the sun , '' said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 7883 len. 10]: `` Military time , sir , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 7884 len. 5]: `` Force of habit .
Parsing [sent. 7885 len. 8]: A mere habit in me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7886 len. 8]: I am not at all business-like . ''
Parsing [sent. 7887 len. 15]: `` Yet you have a large establishment , too , I am told ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7888 len. 4]: said Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 7889 len. 9]: `` Not much of a one , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7890 len. 14]: I keep a shooting gallery , but not much of a one . ''
Parsing [sent. 7891 len. 21]: `` And what kind of a shot and what kind of a swordsman do you make of Mr. Carstone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7892 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 7893 len. 22]: `` Pretty good , sir , '' he replied , folding his arms upon his broad chest and looking very large .
Parsing [sent. 7894 len. 21]: `` If Mr. Carstone was to give his full mind to it , he would come out very good . ''
Parsing [sent. 7895 len. 10]: `` But he do n't , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7896 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 7897 len. 12]: `` He did at first , sir , but not afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 7898 len. 5]: Not his full mind .
Parsing [sent. 7899 len. 15]: Perhaps he has something else upon it -- some young lady , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 7900 len. 12]: His bright dark eyes glanced at me for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 7901 len. 31]: `` He has not me upon his mind , I assure you , Mr. George , '' said I , laughing , `` though you seem to suspect me . ''
Parsing [sent. 7902 len. 15]: He reddened a little through his brown and made me a trooper 's bow .
Parsing [sent. 7903 len. 9]: `` No offence , I hope , miss .
Parsing [sent. 7904 len. 8]: I am one of the roughs . ''
Parsing [sent. 7905 len. 17]: `` Not at all , '' said I. `` I take it as a compliment . ''
Parsing [sent. 7906 len. 22]: If he had not looked at me before , he looked at me now in three or four quick successive glances .
Parsing [sent. 7907 len. 42]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , '' he said to my guardian with a manly kind of diffidence , `` but you did me the honour to mention the young lady 's name -- '' `` Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 7908 len. 14]: `` Miss Summerson , '' he repeated , and looked at me again .
Parsing [sent. 7909 len. 8]: `` Do you know the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7910 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 7911 len. 5]: `` No , miss .
Parsing [sent. 7912 len. 8]: To my knowledge I never heard it .
Parsing [sent. 7913 len. 9]: I thought I had seen you somewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 7914 len. 39]: `` I think not , '' I returned , raising my head from my work to look at him ; and there was something so genuine in his speech and manner that I was glad of the opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 7915 len. 8]: `` I remember faces very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 7916 len. 8]: `` So do I , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7917 len. 17]: he returned , meeting my look with the fullness of his dark eyes and broad forehead .
Parsing [sent. 7918 len. 3]: `` Humph !
Parsing [sent. 7919 len. 11]: What set me off , now , upon that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7920 len. 24]: His once more reddening through his brown and being disconcerted by his efforts to remember the association brought my guardian to his relief .
Parsing [sent. 7921 len. 10]: `` Have you many pupils , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7922 len. 9]: `` They vary in their number , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7923 len. 12]: Mostly they 're but a small lot to live by . ''
Parsing [sent. 7924 len. 15]: `` And what classes of chance people come to practise at your gallery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7925 len. 6]: `` All sorts , sir .
Parsing [sent. 7926 len. 4]: Natives and foreigners .
Parsing [sent. 7927 len. 6]: From gentlemen to ` prentices .
Parsing [sent. 7928 len. 16]: I have had Frenchwomen come , before now , and show themselves dabs at pistol-shooting .
Parsing [sent. 7929 len. 20]: Mad people out of number , of course , but THEY go everywhere where the doors stand open . ''
Parsing [sent. 7930 len. 21]: `` People do n't come with grudges and schemes of finishing their practice with live targets , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7931 len. 6]: said my guardian , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 7932 len. 13]: `` Not much of that , sir , though that HAS happened .
Parsing [sent. 7933 len. 9]: Mostly they come for skill -- or idleness .
Parsing [sent. 7934 len. 10]: Six of one , and half-a-dozen of the other .
Parsing [sent. 7935 len. 38]: I beg your pardon , '' said Mr. George , sitting stiffly upright and squaring an elbow on each knee , `` but I believe you 're a Chancery suitor , if I have heard correct ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7936 len. 10]: `` I am sorry to say I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 7937 len. 15]: `` I have had one of YOUR compatriots in my time , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7938 len. 6]: `` A Chancery suitor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7939 len. 4]: returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 7940 len. 6]: `` How was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7941 len. 40]: `` Why , the man was so badgered and worried and tortured by being knocked about from post to pillar , and from pillar to post , '' said Mr. George , `` that he got out of sorts .
Parsing [sent. 7942 len. 42]: I do n't believe he had any idea of taking aim at anybody , but he was in that condition of resentment and violence that he would come and pay for fifty shots and fire away till he was red hot .
Parsing [sent. 7943 len. 66]: One day I said to him when there was nobody by and he had been talking to me angrily about his wrongs , ` If this practice is a safety-valve , comrade , well and good ; but I do n't altogether like your being so bent upon it in your present state of mind ; I 'd rather you took to something else . '
Parsing [sent. 7944 len. 27]: I was on my guard for a blow , he was that passionate ; but he received it in very good part and left off directly .
Parsing [sent. 7945 len. 12]: We shook hands and struck up a sort of friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 7946 len. 7]: `` What was that man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7947 len. 10]: asked my guardian in a new tone of interest .
Parsing [sent. 7948 len. 25]: `` Why , he began by being a small Shropshire farmer before they made a baited bull of him , '' said Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 7949 len. 7]: `` Was his name Gridley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7950 len. 7]: `` It was , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 7951 len. 39]: Mr. George directed another succession of quick bright glances at me as my guardian and I exchanged a word or two of surprise at the coincidence , and I therefore explained to him how we knew the name .
Parsing [sent. 7952 len. 17]: He made me another of his soldierly bows in acknowledgment of what he called my condescension .
Parsing [sent. 7953 len. 29]: `` I do n't know , '' he said as he looked at me , `` what it is that sets me off again -- but -- bosh !
Parsing [sent. 7954 len. 8]: What 's my head running against ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7955 len. 50]: He passed one of his heavy hands over his crisp dark hair as if to sweep the broken thoughts out of his mind and sat a little forward , with one arm akimbo and the other resting on his leg , looking in a brown study at the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7956 len. 31]: `` I am sorry to learn that the same state of mind has got this Gridley into new troubles and that he is in hiding , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 7957 len. 21]: `` So I am told , sir , '' returned Mr. George , still musing and looking on the ground .
Parsing [sent. 7958 len. 7]: `` So I am told . ''
Parsing [sent. 7959 len. 8]: `` You do n't know where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7960 len. 21]: `` No , sir , '' returned the trooper , lifting up his eyes and coming out of his reverie .
Parsing [sent. 7961 len. 9]: `` I ca n't say anything about him .
Parsing [sent. 7962 len. 10]: He will be worn out soon , I expect .
Parsing [sent. 7963 len. 27]: You may file a strong man 's heart away for a good many years , but it will tell all of a sudden at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 7964 len. 7]: Richard 's entrance stopped the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 7965 len. 27]: Mr. George rose , made me another of his soldierly bows , wished my guardian a good day , and strode heavily out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 7966 len. 13]: This was the morning of the day appointed for Richard 's departure .
Parsing [sent. 7967 len. 38]: We had no more purchases to make now ; I had completed all his packing early in the afternoon ; and our time was disengaged until night , when he was to go to Liverpool for Holyhead .
Parsing [sent. 7968 len. 29]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce being again expected to come on that day , Richard proposed to me that we should go down to the court and hear what passed .
Parsing [sent. 7969 len. 39]: As it was his last day , and he was eager to go , and I had never been there , I gave my consent and we walked down to Westminster , where the court was then sitting .
Parsing [sent. 7970 len. 34]: We beguiled the way with arrangements concerning the letters that Richard was to write to me and the letters that I was to write to him and with a great many hopeful projects .
Parsing [sent. 7971 len. 14]: My guardian knew where we were going and therefore was not with us .
Parsing [sent. 7972 len. 66]: When we came to the court , there was the Lord Chancellor -- the same whom I had seen in his private room in Lincoln 's Inn -- sitting in great state and gravity on the bench , with the mace and seals on a red table below him and an immense flat nosegay , like a little garden , which scented the whole court .
Parsing [sent. 7973 len. 58]: Below the table , again , was a long row of solicitors , with bundles of papers on the matting at their feet ; and then there were the gentlemen of the bar in wigs and gowns -- some awake and some asleep , and one talking , and nobody paying much attention to what he said .
Parsing [sent. 7974 len. 67]: The Lord Chancellor leaned back in his very easy chair with his elbow on the cushioned arm and his forehead resting on his hand ; some of those who were present dozed ; some read the newspapers ; some walked about or whispered in groups : all seemed perfectly at their ease , by no means in a hurry , very unconcerned , and extremely comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 7975 len. 192]: To see everything going on so smoothly and to think of the roughness of the suitors ' lives and deaths ; to see all that full dress and ceremony and to think of the waste , and want , and beggared misery it represented ; to consider that while the sickness of hope deferred was raging in so many hearts this polite show went calmly on from day to day , and year to year , in such good order and composure ; to behold the Lord Chancellor and the whole array of practitioners under him looking at one another and at the spectators as if nobody had ever heard that all over England the name in which they were assembled was a bitter jest , was held in universal horror , contempt , and indignation , was known for something so flagrant and bad that little short of a miracle could bring any good out of it to any one -- this was so curious and self-contradictory to me , who had no experience of it , that it was at first incredible , and I could not comprehend it .
Parsing [sent. 7976 len. 46]: I sat where Richard put me , and tried to listen , and looked about me ; but there seemed to be no reality in the whole scene except poor little Miss Flite , the madwoman , standing on a bench and nodding at it .
Parsing [sent. 7977 len. 12]: Miss Flite soon espied us and came to where we sat .
Parsing [sent. 7978 len. 22]: She gave me a gracious welcome to her domain and indicated , with much gratification and pride , its principal attractions .
Parsing [sent. 7979 len. 29]: Mr. Kenge also came to speak to us and did the honours of the place in much the same way , with the bland modesty of a proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 7980 len. 33]: It was not a very good day for a visit , he said ; he would have preferred the first day of term ; but it was imposing , it was imposing .
Parsing [sent. 7981 len. 53]: When we had been there half an hour or so , the case in progress -- if I may use a phrase so ridiculous in such a connexion -- seemed to die out of its own vapidity , without coming , or being by anybody expected to come , to any resuIt .
Parsing [sent. 7982 len. 29]: The Lord Chancellor then threw down a bundle of papers from his desk to the gentlemen below him , and somebody said , `` Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 7983 len. 38]: Upon this there was a buzz , and a laugh , and a general withdrawal of the bystanders , and a bringing in of great heaps , and piles , and bags and bags full of papers .
Parsing [sent. 7984 len. 29]: I think it came on `` for further directions '' -- about some bill of costs , to the best of my understanding , which was confused enough .
Parsing [sent. 7985 len. 29]: But I counted twenty-three gentlemen in wigs who said they were `` in it , '' and none of them appeared to understand it much better than I .
Parsing [sent. 7986 len. 78]: They chatted about it with the Lord Chancellor , and contradicted and explained among themselves , and some of them said it was this way , and some of them said it was that way , and some of them jocosely proposed to read huge volumes of affidavits , and there was more buzzing and laughing , and everybody concerned was in a state of idle entertainment , and nothing could be made of it by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 7987 len. 50]: After an hour or so of this , and a good many speeches being begun and cut short , it was `` referred back for the present , '' as Mr. Kenge said , and the papers were bundled up again before the clerks had finished bringing them in .
Parsing [sent. 7988 len. 25]: I glanced at Richard on the termination of these hopeless proceedings and was shocked to see the worn look of his handsome young face .
Parsing [sent. 7989 len. 11]: `` It ca n't last for ever , Dame Durden .
Parsing [sent. 7990 len. 6]: Better luck next time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 7991 len. 5]: was all he said .
Parsing [sent. 7992 len. 38]: I had seen Mr. Guppy bringing in papers and arranging them for Mr. Kenge ; and he had seen me and made me a forlorn bow , which rendered me desirous to get out of the court .
Parsing [sent. 7993 len. 17]: Richard had given me his arm and was taking me away when Mr. Guppy came up .
Parsing [sent. 7994 len. 49]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Carstone , '' said he in a whisper , `` and Miss Summerson 's also , but there 's a lady here , a friend of mine , who knows her and wishes to have the pleasure of shaking hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 7995 len. 29]: As he spoke , I saw before me , as if she had started into bodily shape from my remembrance , Mrs. Rachael of my godmother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 7996 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7997 len. 3]: said she .
Parsing [sent. 7998 len. 7]: `` Do you recollect me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 7999 len. 17]: I gave her my hand and told her yes and that she was very little altered .
Parsing [sent. 8000 len. 18]: `` I wonder you remember those times , Esther , '' she returned with her old asperity .
Parsing [sent. 8001 len. 6]: `` They are changed now .
Parsing [sent. 8002 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 8003 len. 19]: I am glad to see you , and glad you are not too proud to know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8004 len. 10]: But indeed she seemed disappointed that I was not .
Parsing [sent. 8005 len. 7]: `` Proud , Mrs. Rachael ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8006 len. 3]: I remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 8007 len. 21]: `` I am married , Esther , '' she returned , coldly correcting me , `` and am Mrs. Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 8008 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 8009 len. 15]: I wish you good day , and I hope you 'll do well . ''
Parsing [sent. 8010 len. 58]: Mr. Guppy , who had been attentive to this short dialogue , heaved a sigh in my ear and elbowed his own and Mrs. Rachael 's way through the confused little crowd of people coming in and going out , which we were in the midst of and which the change in the business had brought together .
Parsing [sent. 8011 len. 44]: Richard and I were making our way through it , and I was yet in the first chill of the late unexpected recognition when I saw , coming towards us , but not seeing us , no less a person than Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8012 len. 24]: He made nothing of the people about him as he tramped on , staring over their heads into the body of the court .
Parsing [sent. 8013 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8014 len. 10]: said Richard as I called his attention to him .
Parsing [sent. 8015 len. 12]: `` You are well met , sir , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 8016 len. 6]: `` And you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 8017 len. 12]: Could you point a person out for me , I want ?
Parsing [sent. 8018 len. 8]: I do n't understand these places . ''
Parsing [sent. 8019 len. 30]: Turning as he spoke and making an easy way for us , he stopped when we were out of the press in a corner behind a great red curtain .
Parsing [sent. 8020 len. 69]: `` There 's a little cracked old woman , '' he began , `` that -- '' I put up my finger , for Miss Flite was close by me , having kept beside me all the time and having called the attention of several of her legal acquaintance to me -LRB- as I had overheard to my confusion -RRB- by whispering in their ears , `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 8021 len. 7]: Fitz Jarndyce on my left ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8022 len. 4]: `` Hem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8023 len. 4]: said Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8024 len. 18]: `` You remember , miss , that we passed some conversation on a certain man this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 8025 len. 11]: Gridley , '' in a low whisper behind his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8026 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' said I. `` He is hiding at my place .
Parsing [sent. 8027 len. 6]: I could n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 8028 len. 5]: Had n't his authority .
Parsing [sent. 8029 len. 17]: He is on his last march , miss , and has a whim to see her .
Parsing [sent. 8030 len. 23]: He says they can feel for one another , and she has been almost as good as a friend to him here .
Parsing [sent. 8031 len. 29]: I came down to look for her , for when I sat by Gridley this afternoon , I seemed to hear the roll of the muffled drums . ''
Parsing [sent. 8032 len. 7]: `` Shall I tell her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8033 len. 10]: said I. `` Would you be so good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8034 len. 13]: he returned with a glance of something like apprehension at Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 8035 len. 27]: `` It 's a providence I met you , miss ; I doubt if I should have known how to get on with that lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 8036 len. 34]: And he put one hand in his breast and stood upright in a martial attitude as I informed little Miss Flite , in her ear , of the purport of his kind errand .
Parsing [sent. 8037 len. 7]: `` My angry friend from Shropshire !
Parsing [sent. 8038 len. 7]: Almost as celebrated as myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8039 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 8040 len. 4]: `` Now really !
Parsing [sent. 8041 len. 14]: My dear , I will wait upon him with the greatest pleasure . ''
Parsing [sent. 8042 len. 16]: `` He is living concealed at Mr. George 's , '' said I. `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 8043 len. 6]: This is Mr. George . ''
Parsing [sent. 8044 len. 6]: `` In -- deed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8045 len. 4]: returned Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 8046 len. 8]: `` Very proud to have the honour !
Parsing [sent. 8047 len. 7]: A military man , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 8048 len. 8]: You know , a perfect general ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8049 len. 5]: she whispered to me .
Parsing [sent. 8050 len. 43]: Poor Miss Flite deemed it necessary to be so courtly and polite , as a mark of her respect for the army , and to curtsy so very often that it was no easy matter to get her out of the court .
Parsing [sent. 8051 len. 92]: When this was at last done , and addressing Mr. George as `` General , '' she gave him her arm , to the great entertainment of some idlers who were looking on , he was so discomposed and begged me so respectfully `` not to desert him '' that I could not make up my mind to do it , especially as Miss Flite was always tractable with me and as she too said , `` Fitz Jarndyce , my dear , you will accompany us , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 8052 len. 26]: As Richard seemed quite willing , and even anxious , that we should see them safely to their destination , we agreed to do so .
Parsing [sent. 8053 len. 46]: And as Mr. George informed us that Gridley 's mind had run on Mr. Jarndyce all the afternoon after hearing of their interview in the morning , I wrote a hasty note in pencil to my guardian to say where we were gone and why .
Parsing [sent. 8054 len. 25]: Mr. George sealed it at a coffee-house , that it might lead to no discovery , and we sent it off by a ticket-porter .
Parsing [sent. 8055 len. 15]: We then took a hackney-coach and drove away to the neighbourhood of Leicester Square .
Parsing [sent. 8056 len. 28]: We walked through some narrow courts , for which Mr. George apologized , and soon came to the shooting gallery , the door of which was closed .
Parsing [sent. 8057 len. 49]: As he pulled a bell-handle which hung by a chain to the door-post , a very respectable old gentleman with grey hair , wearing spectacles , and dressed in a black spencer and gaiters and a broad-brimmed hat , and carrying a large gold-beaded cane , addressed him .
Parsing [sent. 8058 len. 24]: `` I ask your pardon , my good friend , '' said he , `` but is this George 's Shooting Gallery ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8059 len. 28]: `` It is , sir , '' returned Mr. George , glancing up at the great letters in which that inscription was painted on the whitewashed wall .
Parsing [sent. 8060 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8061 len. 5]: To be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8062 len. 9]: said the old gentleman , following his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8063 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 8064 len. 7]: Have you rung the bell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8065 len. 16]: `` My name is George , sir , and I have rung the bell . ''
Parsing [sent. 8066 len. 6]: `` Oh , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8067 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8068 len. 6]: `` Your name is George ?
Parsing [sent. 8069 len. 12]: Then I am here as soon as you , you see .
Parsing [sent. 8070 len. 9]: You came for me , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8071 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8072 len. 8]: You have the advantage of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8073 len. 6]: `` Oh , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8074 len. 5]: said the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 8075 len. 12]: `` Then it was your young man who came for me .
Parsing [sent. 8076 len. 26]: I am a physician and was requested -- five minutes ago -- to come and visit a sick man at George 's Shooting Gallery . ''
Parsing [sent. 8077 len. 21]: `` The muffled drums , '' said Mr. George , turning to Richard and me and gravely shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 8078 len. 8]: `` It 's quite correct , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8079 len. 8]: Will you please to walk in . ''
Parsing [sent. 8080 len. 63]: The door being at that moment opened by a very singular-looking little man in a green-baize cap and apron , whose face and hands and dress were blackened all over , we passed along a dreary passage into a large building with bare brick walls where there were targets , and guns , and swords , and other things of that kind .
Parsing [sent. 8081 len. 35]: When we had all arrived here , the physician stopped , and taking off his hat , appeared to vanish by magic and to leave another and quite a different man in his place .
Parsing [sent. 8082 len. 28]: `` Now lookee here , George , '' said the man , turning quickly round upon him and tapping him on the breast with a large forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 8083 len. 10]: `` You know me , and I know you .
Parsing [sent. 8084 len. 17]: You 're a man of the world , and I 'm a man of the world .
Parsing [sent. 8085 len. 19]: My name 's Bucket , as you are aware , and I have got a peace-warrant against Gridley .
Parsing [sent. 8086 len. 27]: You have kept him out of the way a long time , and you have been artful in it , and it does you credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 8087 len. 16]: Mr. George , looking hard at him , bit his lip and shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 8088 len. 36]: `` Now , George , '' said the other , keeping close to him , `` you 're a sensible man and a well-conducted man ; that 's what YOU are , beyond a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 8089 len. 32]: And mind you , I do n't talk to you as a common character , because you have served your country and you know that when duty calls we must obey .
Parsing [sent. 8090 len. 11]: Consequently you 're very far from wanting to give trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8091 len. 17]: If I required assistance , you 'd assist me ; that 's what YOU 'D do .
Parsing [sent. 8092 len. 55]: Phil Squod , do n't you go a-sidling round the gallery like that '' -- the dirty little man was shuffling about with his shoulder against the wall , and his eyes on the intruder , in a manner that looked threatening -- `` because I know you and wo n't have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8093 len. 4]: `` Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8094 len. 4]: said Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8095 len. 8]: `` Yes , guv ` ner . ''
Parsing [sent. 8096 len. 5]: `` Be quiet . ''
Parsing [sent. 8097 len. 12]: The little man , with a low growl , stood still .
Parsing [sent. 8098 len. 42]: `` Ladies and gentlemen , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` you 'll excuse anything that may appear to be disagreeable in this , for my name 's Inspector Bucket of the Detective , and I have a duty to perform .
Parsing [sent. 8099 len. 29]: George , I know where my man is because I was on the roof last night and saw him through the skylight , and you along with him .
Parsing [sent. 8100 len. 22]: He is in there , you know , '' pointing ; `` that 's where HE is -- on a sofy .
Parsing [sent. 8101 len. 37]: Now I must see my man , and I must tell my man to consider himself in custody ; but you know me , and you know I do n't want to take any uncomfortable measures .
Parsing [sent. 8102 len. 45]: You give me your word , as from one man to another -LRB- and an old soldier , mind you , likewise -RRB- , that it 's honourable between us two , and I 'll accommodate you to the utmost of my power . ''
Parsing [sent. 8103 len. 11]: `` I give it , '' was the reply . '
Parsing [sent. 8104 len. 13]: `` But it was n't handsome in you , Mr. Bucket . ''
Parsing [sent. 8105 len. 5]: `` Gammon , George !
Parsing [sent. 8106 len. 4]: Not handsome ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8107 len. 17]: said Mr. Bucket , tapping him on his broad breast again and shaking hands with him .
Parsing [sent. 8108 len. 21]: `` I do n't say it was n't handsome in you to keep my man so close , do I ?
Parsing [sent. 8109 len. 9]: Be equally good-tempered to me , old boy !
Parsing [sent. 8110 len. 11]: Old William Tell , Old Shaw , the Life Guardsman !
Parsing [sent. 8111 len. 18]: Why , he 's a model of the whole British army in himself , ladies and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 8112 len. 17]: I 'd give a fifty-pun ' note to be such a figure of a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8113 len. 37]: The affair being brought to this head , Mr. George , after a little consideration , proposed to go in first to his comrade -LRB- as he called him -RRB- , taking Miss Flite with him .
Parsing [sent. 8114 len. 27]: Mr. Bucket agreeing , they went away to the further end of the gallery , leaving us sitting and standing by a table covered with guns .
Parsing [sent. 8115 len. 94]: Mr. Bucket took this opportunity of entering into a little light conversation , asking me if I were afraid of fire-arms , as most young ladies were ; asking Richard if he were a good shot ; asking Phil Squod which he considered the best of those rifles and what it might be worth first-hand , telling him in return that it was a pity he ever gave way to his temper , for he was naturally so amiable that he might have been a young woman , and making himself generally agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 8116 len. 29]: After a time he followed us to the further end of the gallery , and Richard and I were going quietly away when Mr. George came after us .
Parsing [sent. 8117 len. 23]: He said that if we had no objection to see his comrade , he would take a visit from us very kindly .
Parsing [sent. 8118 len. 49]: The words had hardly passed his lips when the bell was rung and my guardian appeared , `` on the chance , '' he slightly observed , `` of being able to do any little thing for a poor fellow involved in the same misfortune as himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 8119 len. 15]: We all four went back together and went into the place where Gridley was .
Parsing [sent. 8120 len. 15]: It was a bare room , partitioned off from the gallery with unpainted wood .
Parsing [sent. 8121 len. 43]: As the screening was not more than eight or ten feet high and only enclosed the sides , not the top , the rafters of the high gallery roof were overhead , and the skylight through which Mr. Bucket had looked down .
Parsing [sent. 8122 len. 22]: The sun was low -- near setting -- and its light came redly in above , without descending to the ground .
Parsing [sent. 8123 len. 39]: Upon a plain canvas-covered sofa lay the man from Shropshire , dressed much as we had seen him last , but so changed that at first I recognized no likeness in his colourless face to what I recollected .
Parsing [sent. 8124 len. 20]: He had been still writing in his hiding-place , and still dwelling on his grievances , hour after hour .
Parsing [sent. 8125 len. 21]: A table and some shelves were covered with manuscript papers and with worn pens and a medley of such tokens .
Parsing [sent. 8126 len. 24]: Touchingly and awfully drawn together , he and the little mad woman were side by side and , as it were , alone .
Parsing [sent. 8127 len. 18]: She sat on a chair holding his hand , and none of us went close to them .
Parsing [sent. 8128 len. 34]: His voice had faded , with the old expression of his face , with his strength , with his anger , with his resistance to the wrongs that had at last subdued him .
Parsing [sent. 8129 len. 32]: The faintest shadow of an object full of form and colour is such a picture of it as he was of the man from Shropshire whom we had spoken with before .
Parsing [sent. 8130 len. 14]: He inclined his head to Richard and me and spoke to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 8131 len. 16]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , it is very kind of you to come to see me .
Parsing [sent. 8132 len. 11]: I am not long to be seen , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8133 len. 11]: I am very glad to take your hand , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8134 len. 18]: You are a good man , superior to injustice , and God knows I honour you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8135 len. 16]: They shook hands earnestly , and my guardian said some words of comfort to him .
Parsing [sent. 8136 len. 34]: `` It may seem strange to you , sir , '' returned Gridley ; `` I should not have liked to see you if this had been the flrst time of our meeting .
Parsing [sent. 8137 len. 62]: But you know I made a fight for it , you know I stood up with my single hand against them all , you know I told them the truth to the last , and told them what they were , and what they had done to me ; so I do n't mind your seeing me , this wreck . ''
Parsing [sent. 8138 len. 18]: `` You have been courageous with them many and many a time , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 8139 len. 13]: `` Sir , I have been , '' with a faint smile .
Parsing [sent. 8140 len. 20]: `` I told you what would come of it when I ceased to be so , and see here !
Parsing [sent. 8141 len. 9]: Look at us -- look at us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8142 len. 18]: He drew the hand Miss Flite held through her arm and brought her something nearer to him .
Parsing [sent. 8143 len. 5]: `` This ends it .
Parsing [sent. 8144 len. 39]: Of all my old associations , of all my old pursuits and hopes , of all the living and the dead world , this one poor soul alone comes natural to me , and I am fit for .
Parsing [sent. 8145 len. 30]: There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken . ''
Parsing [sent. 8146 len. 14]: `` Accept my blessing , Gridley , '' said Miss Flite in tears .
Parsing [sent. 8147 len. 6]: `` Accept my blessing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8148 len. 17]: `` I thought , boastfully , that they never could break my heart , Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 8149 len. 8]: I was resolved that they should not .
Parsing [sent. 8150 len. 26]: I did believe that I could , and would , charge them with being the mockery they were until I died of some bodily disorder .
Parsing [sent. 8151 len. 6]: But I am worn out .
Parsing [sent. 8152 len. 22]: How long I have been wearing out , I do n't know ; I seemed to break down in an hour .
Parsing [sent. 8153 len. 11]: I hope they may never come to hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 8154 len. 28]: I hope everybody here will lead them to believe that I died defying them , consistently and perseveringly , as I did through so many years . ''
Parsing [sent. 8155 len. 23]: Here Mr. Bucket , who was sitting in a corner by the door , good-naturedly offered such consolation as he could administer .
Parsing [sent. 8156 len. 6]: `` Come , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8157 len. 6]: he said from his corner .
Parsing [sent. 8158 len. 12]: `` Do n't go on in that way , Mr. Gridley .
Parsing [sent. 8159 len. 7]: You are only a little low .
Parsing [sent. 8160 len. 10]: We are all of us a little low sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 8161 len. 3]: I am .
Parsing [sent. 8162 len. 6]: Hold up , hold up !
Parsing [sent. 8163 len. 34]: You 'll lose your temper with the whole round of 'em , again and again ; and I shall take you on a score of warrants yet , if I have luck . ''
Parsing [sent. 8164 len. 6]: He only shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 8165 len. 12]: `` Do n't shake your head , '' said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 8166 len. 14]: `` Nod it ; that 's what I want to see you do .
Parsing [sent. 8167 len. 14]: Why , Lord bless your soul , what times we have had together !
Parsing [sent. 8168 len. 15]: Have n't I seen you in the Fleet over and over again for contempt ?
Parsing [sent. 8169 len. 24]: Have n't I come into court , twenty afternoons for no other purpose than to see you pin the Chancellor like a bull-dog ?
Parsing [sent. 8170 len. 27]: Do n't you remember when you first began to threaten the lawyers , and the peace was sworn against you two or three times a week ?
Parsing [sent. 8171 len. 13]: Ask the little old lady there ; she has been always present .
Parsing [sent. 8172 len. 12]: Hold up , Mr. Gridley , hold up , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8173 len. 11]: `` What are you going to do about him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8174 len. 7]: asked George in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 8175 len. 15]: `` I do n't know yet , '' said Bucket in the same tone .
Parsing [sent. 8176 len. 16]: Then resuming his encouragement , he pursued aloud : `` Worn out , Mr. Gridley ?
Parsing [sent. 8177 len. 29]: After dodging me for all these weeks and forcing me to climb the roof here like a tom cat and to come to see you as a doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 8178 len. 8]: That ai n't like being worn out .
Parsing [sent. 8179 len. 5]: I should think not !
Parsing [sent. 8180 len. 8]: Now I tell you what you want .
Parsing [sent. 8181 len. 18]: You want excitement , you know , to keep YOU up ; that 's what YOU want .
Parsing [sent. 8182 len. 14]: You 're used to it , and you ca n't do without it .
Parsing [sent. 8183 len. 5]: I could n't myself .
Parsing [sent. 8184 len. 26]: Very well , then ; here 's this warrant got by Mr. Tulkinghorn of Lincoln 's Inn Fields , and backed into half-a-dozen counties since .
Parsing [sent. 8185 len. 24]: What do you say to coming along with me , upon this warrant , and having a good angry argument before the magistrates ?
Parsing [sent. 8186 len. 23]: It 'll do you good ; it 'll freshen you up and get you into training for another turn at the Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 8187 len. 3]: Give in ?
Parsing [sent. 8188 len. 17]: Why , I am surprised to hear a man of your energy talk of giving in .
Parsing [sent. 8189 len. 6]: You must n't do that .
Parsing [sent. 8190 len. 14]: You 're half the fun of the fair in the Court of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 8191 len. 25]: George , you lend Mr. Gridley a hand , and let 's see now whether he wo n't be better up than down . ''
Parsing [sent. 8192 len. 15]: `` He is very weak , '' said the trooper in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 8193 len. 5]: `` Is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8194 len. 4]: returned Bucket anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 8195 len. 8]: `` I only want to rouse him .
Parsing [sent. 8196 len. 14]: I do n't like to see an old acquaintance giving in like this .
Parsing [sent. 8197 len. 19]: It would cheer him up more than anything if I could make him a little waxy with me .
Parsing [sent. 8198 len. 16]: He 's welcome to drop into me , right and left , if he likes .
Parsing [sent. 8199 len. 9]: I shall never take advantage of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8200 len. 17]: The roof rang with a scream from Miss Flite , which still rings in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 8201 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , Gridley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8202 len. 13]: she cried as he fell heavily and calmly back from before her .
Parsing [sent. 8203 len. 6]: `` Not without my blessing .
Parsing [sent. 8204 len. 6]: After so many years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8205 len. 21]: The sun was down , the light had gradually stolen from the roof , and the shadow had crept upward .
Parsing [sent. 8206 len. 29]: But to me the shadow of that pair , one living and one dead , fell heavier on Richard 's departure than the darkness of the darkest night .
Parsing [sent. 8207 len. 51]: And through Richard 's farewell words I heard it echoed : `` Of all my old associations , of all my old pursuits and hopes , of all the living and the dead world , this one poor soul alone comes natural to me , and I am fit for .
Parsing [sent. 8208 len. 30]: There is a tie of many suffering years between us two , and it is the only tie I ever had on earth that Chancery has not broken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8209 len. 19]: Chapter XXV -- Mrs. Snagsby Sees It All There is disquietude in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street .
Parsing [sent. 8210 len. 8]: Black suspicion hides in that peaceful region .
Parsing [sent. 8211 len. 33]: The mass of Cook 's Courtiers are in their usual state of mind , no better and no worse ; but Mr. Snagsby is changed , and his little woman knows it .
Parsing [sent. 8212 len. 61]: For Tom-all -- Alone 's and Lincoln 's Inn Fields persist in harnessing themselves , a pair of ungovernable coursers , to the chariot of Mr. Snagsby 's imagination ; and Mr. Bucket drives ; and the passengers are Jo and Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and the complete equipage whirls though the law-stationery business at wild speed all round the clock .
Parsing [sent. 8213 len. 48]: Even in the little front kitchen where the family meals are taken , it rattles away at a smoking pace from the dinner-table , when Mr. Snagsby pauses in carving the first slice of the leg of mutton baked with potatoes and stares at the kitchen wall .
Parsing [sent. 8214 len. 17]: Mr. Snagsby can not make out what it is that he has had to do with .
Parsing [sent. 8215 len. 36]: Something is wrong somewhere , but what something , what may come of it , to whom , when , and from which unthought of and unheard of quarter is the puzzle of his life .
Parsing [sent. 8216 len. 101]: His remote impressions of the robes and coronets , the stars and garters , that sparkle through the surface-dust of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's chambers ; his veneration for the mysteries presided over by that best and closest of his customers , whom all the Inns of Court , all Chancery Lane , and all the legal neighbourhood agree to hold in awe ; his remembrance of Detective Mr. Bucket with his forefinger and his confidential manner , impossible to be evaded or declined , persuade him that he is a party to some dangerous secret without knowing what it is .
Parsing [sent. 8217 len. 67]: And it is the fearful peculiarity of this condition that , at any hour of his daily life , at any opening of the shop-door , at any pull of the bell , at any entrance of a messenger , or any delivery of a letter , the secret may take air and fire , explode , and blow up -- Mr. Bucket only knows whom .
Parsing [sent. 8218 len. 29]: For which reason , whenever a man unknown comes into the shop -LRB- as many men unknown do -RRB- and says , `` Is Mr. Snagsby in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8219 len. 18]: or words to that innocent effect , Mr. Snagsby 's heart knocks hard at his guilty breast .
Parsing [sent. 8220 len. 45]: He undergoes so much from such inquiries that when they are made by boys he revenges himself by flipping at their ears over the counter and asking the young dogs what they mean by it and why they ca n't speak out at once ?
Parsing [sent. 8221 len. 72]: More impracticable men and boys persist in walking into Mr. Snagsby 's sleep and terrifying him with unaccountable questions , so that often when the cock at the little dairy in Cursitor Street breaks out in his usual absurd way about the morning , Mr. Snagsby finds himself in a crisis of nightmare , with his little woman shaking him and saying `` What 's the matter with the man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8222 len. 13]: The little woman herself is not the least item in his difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 8223 len. 74]: To know that he is always keeping a secret from her , that he has under all circumstances to conceal and hold fast a tender double tooth , which her sharpness is ever ready to twist out of his head , gives Mr. Snagsby , in her dentistical presence , much of the air of a dog who has a reservation from his master and will look anywhere rather than meet his eye .
Parsing [sent. 8224 len. 18]: These various signs and tokens , marked by the little woman , are not lost upon her .
Parsing [sent. 8225 len. 15]: They impel her to say , `` Snagsby has something on his mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8226 len. 12]: And thus suspicion gets into Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street .
Parsing [sent. 8227 len. 23]: From suspicion to jealousy , Mrs. Snagsby finds the road as natural and short as from Cook 's Court to Chancery Lane .
Parsing [sent. 8228 len. 12]: And thus jealousy gets into Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street .
Parsing [sent. 8229 len. 84]: Once there -LRB- and it was always lurking thereabout -RRB- , it is very active and nimble in Mrs. Snagsby 's breast , prompting her to nocturnal examinations of Mr. Snagsby 's pockets ; to secret perusals of Mr. Snagsby 's letters ; to private researches in the day book and ledger , till , cash-box , and iron safe ; to watchings at windows , listenings behind doors , and a general putting of this and that together by the wrong end .
Parsing [sent. 8230 len. 20]: Mrs. Snagsby is so perpetually on the alert that the house becomes ghostly with creaking boards and rustling garments .
Parsing [sent. 8231 len. 14]: The ` prentices think somebody may have been murdered there in bygone times .
Parsing [sent. 8232 len. 60]: Guster holds certain loose atoms of an idea -LRB- picked up at Tooting , where they were found floating among the orphans -RRB- that there is buried money underneath the cellar , guarded by an old man with a white beard , who can not get out for seven thousand years because he said the Lord 's Prayer backwards .
Parsing [sent. 8233 len. 6]: `` Who was Nimrod ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8234 len. 7]: Mrs. Snagsby repeatedly inquires of herself .
Parsing [sent. 8235 len. 9]: `` Who was that lady -- that creature ?
Parsing [sent. 8236 len. 7]: And who is that boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8237 len. 40]: Now , Nimrod being as dead as the mighty hunter whose name Mrs. Snagsby has appropriated , and the lady being unproducible , she directs her mental eye , for the present , with redoubled vigilance to the boy .
Parsing [sent. 8238 len. 20]: `` And who , '' quoth Mrs. Snagsby for the thousand and first time , `` is that boy ?
Parsing [sent. 8239 len. 6]: Who is that -- ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8240 len. 10]: And there Mrs. Snagsby is seized with an inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 8241 len. 8]: He has no respect for Mr. Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 8242 len. 15]: No , to be sure , and he would n't have , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8243 len. 10]: Naturally he would n't , under those contagious circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8244 len. 21]: He was invited and appointed by Mr. Chadband -- why , Mrs. Snagsby heard it herself with her own ears !
Parsing [sent. 8245 len. 26]: -- to come back , and be told where he was to go , to be addressed by Mr. Chadband ; and he never came !
Parsing [sent. 8246 len. 6]: Why did he never come ?
Parsing [sent. 8247 len. 8]: Because he was told not to come .
Parsing [sent. 8248 len. 7]: Who told him not to come ?
Parsing [sent. 8249 len. 2]: Who ?
Parsing [sent. 8250 len. 4]: Ha , ha !
Parsing [sent. 8251 len. 6]: Mrs. Snagsby sees it all .
Parsing [sent. 8252 len. 177]: But happily -LRB- and Mrs. Snagsby tightly shakes her head and tightly smiles -RRB- that boy was met by Mr. Chadband yesterday in the streets ; and that boy , as affording a subject which Mr. Chadband desires to improve for the spiritual delight of a select congregation , was seized by Mr. Chadband and threatened with being delivered over to the police unless he showed the reverend gentleman where he lived and unless he entered into , and fulfilled , an undertaking to appear in Cook 's Court to-morrow night , '' ` to -- mor -- row -- night , '' Mrs. Snagsby repeats for mere emphasis with another tight smile and another tight shake of her head ; and to-morrow night that boy will be here , and to-morrow night Mrs. Snagsby will have her eye upon him and upon some one else ; and oh , you may walk a long while in your secret ways -LRB- says Mrs. Snagsby with haughtiness and scorn -RRB- , but you ca n't blind ME !
Parsing [sent. 8253 len. 21]: Mrs. Snagsby sounds no timbrel in anybody 's ears , but holds her purpose quietly , and keeps her counsel .
Parsing [sent. 8254 len. 16]: To-morrow comes , the savoury preparations for the Oil Trade come , the evening comes .
Parsing [sent. 8255 len. 109]: Comes Mr. Snagsby in his black coat ; come the Chadbands ; come -LRB- when the gorging vessel is replete -RRB- the ` prentices and Guster , to be edified ; comes at last , with his slouching head , and his shuflle backward , and his shuffle forward , and his shuffle to the right , and his shuffle to the left , and his bit of fur cap in his muddy hand , which he picks as if it were some mangy bird he had caught and was plucking before eating raw , Jo , the very , very tough subject Mr. Chadband is to improve .
Parsing [sent. 8256 len. 19]: Mrs. Snagsby screws a watchful glance on Jo as he is brought into the little drawing-room by Guster .
Parsing [sent. 8257 len. 11]: He looks at Mr. Snagsby the moment he comes in .
Parsing [sent. 8258 len. 2]: Aha !
Parsing [sent. 8259 len. 8]: Why does he look at Mr. Snagsby ?
Parsing [sent. 8260 len. 6]: Mr. Snagsby looks at him .
Parsing [sent. 8261 len. 14]: Why should he do that , but that Mrs. Snagsby sees it all ?
Parsing [sent. 8262 len. 25]: Why else should that look pass between them , why else should Mr. Snagsby be confused and cough a signal cough behind his hand ?
Parsing [sent. 8263 len. 16]: It is as clear as crystal that Mr. Snagsby is that boy 's father . '
Parsing [sent. 8264 len. 21]: `` Peace , my friends , '' says Chadband , rising and wiping the oily exudations from his reverend visage .
Parsing [sent. 8265 len. 6]: `` Peace be with us !
Parsing [sent. 8266 len. 7]: My friends , why with us ?
Parsing [sent. 8267 len. 53]: Because , '' with his fat smile , `` it can not be against us , because it must be for us ; because it is not hardening , because it is softening ; because it does not make war like the hawk , but comes home unto us like the dove .
Parsing [sent. 8268 len. 10]: Therefore , my friends , peace be with us !
Parsing [sent. 8269 len. 8]: My human boy , come forward ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8270 len. 22]: Stretching forth his flabby paw , Mr. Chadband lays the same on Jo 's arm and considers where to station him .
Parsing [sent. 8271 len. 37]: Jo , very doubtful of his reverend friend 's intentions and not at all clear but that something practical and painful is going to be done to him , mutters , `` You let me alone .
Parsing [sent. 8272 len. 7]: I never said nothink to you .
Parsing [sent. 8273 len. 6]: You let me alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 8274 len. 20]: `` No , my young friend , '' says Chadband smoothly , `` I will not let you alone .
Parsing [sent. 8275 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 8276 len. 33]: Because I am a harvest-labourer , because I am a toiler and a moiler , because you are delivered over unto me and are become as a precious instrument in my hands .
Parsing [sent. 8277 len. 33]: My friends , may I so employ this instrument as to use it to your advantage , to your profit , to your gain , to your welfare , to your enrichment !
Parsing [sent. 8278 len. 10]: My young friend , sit upon this stool . ''
Parsing [sent. 8279 len. 40]: Jo , apparently possessed by an impression that the reverend gentleman wants to cut his hair , shields his head with both arms and is got into the required position with great difficulty and every possible manifestation of reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 8280 len. 33]: When he is at last adjusted like a lay-figure , Mr. Chadband , retiring behind the table , holds up his bear 's - paw and says , `` My friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8281 len. 12]: This is the signal for a general settlement of the audience .
Parsing [sent. 8282 len. 10]: The ` prentices giggle internally and nudge each other .
Parsing [sent. 8283 len. 29]: Guster falls into a staring and vacant state , compounded of a stunned admiration of Mr. Chadband and pity for the friendless outcast whose condition touches her nearly .
Parsing [sent. 8284 len. 8]: Mrs. Snagsby silently lays trains of gunpowder .
Parsing [sent. 8285 len. 23]: Mrs. Chadband composes herself grimly by the fire and warms her knees , finding that sensation favourable to the reception of eloquence .
Parsing [sent. 8286 len. 103]: It happens that Mr. Chadband has a pulpit habit of fixing some member of his congregation with his eye and fatly arguing his points with that particular person , who is understood to be expected to be moved to an occasional grunt , groan , gasp , or other audible expression of inward working , which expression of inward working , being echoed by some elderly lady in the next pew and so communicated like a game of forfeits through a circle of the more fermentable sinners present , serves the purpose of parliamentary cheering and gets Mr. Chadband 's steam up .
Parsing [sent. 8287 len. 15]: From mere force of habit , Mr. Chadband in saying `` My friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8288 len. 26]: has rested his eye on Mr. Snagsby and proceeds to make that ill-starred stationer , already sufficiently confused , the immediate recipient of his discourse .
Parsing [sent. 8289 len. 41]: `` We have here among us , my friends , '' says Chadband , `` a Gentile and a heathen , a dweller in the tents of Tom-all -- Alone 's and a mover-on upon the surface of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 8290 len. 54]: We have here among us , my friends , '' and Mr. Chadband , untwisting the point with his dirty thumb-nail , bestows an oily smile on Mr. Snagsby , signifying that he will throw him an argumentative back-fall presently if he be not already down , `` a brother and a boy .
Parsing [sent. 8291 len. 24]: Devoid of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold and silver and of precious stones .
Parsing [sent. 8292 len. 16]: Now , my friends , why do I say he is devoid of these possessions ?
Parsing [sent. 8293 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 8294 len. 5]: Why is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8295 len. 31]: Mr. Chadband states the question as if he were propoundlng an entirely new riddle of much ingenuity and merit to Mr. Snagsby and entreating him not to give it up .
Parsing [sent. 8296 len. 49]: Mr. Snagsby , greatly perplexed by the mysterious look he received just now from his little woman -- at about the period when Mr. Chadband mentioned the word parents -- is tempted into modestly remarking , `` I do n't know , I 'm sure , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8297 len. 16]: On which interruption Mrs. Chadband glares and Mrs. Snagsby says , `` For shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8298 len. 21]: `` I hear a voice , '' says Chadband ; `` is it a still small voice , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 8299 len. 18]: I fear not , though I fain would hope so -- '' `` Ah -- h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8300 len. 4]: from Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 8301 len. 11]: `` Which says , ' I do n't know . '
Parsing [sent. 8302 len. 7]: Then I will tell you why .
Parsing [sent. 8303 len. 49]: I say this brother present here among us is devoid of parents , devoid of relations , devoid of flocks and herds , devoid of gold , of silver , and of precious stones because he is devoid of the light that shines in upon some of us .
Parsing [sent. 8304 len. 5]: What is that light ?
Parsing [sent. 8305 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 8306 len. 10]: I ask you , what is that light ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8307 len. 23]: Mr. Chadband draws back his head and pauses , but Mr. Snagsby is not to be lured on to his destruction again .
Parsing [sent. 8308 len. 26]: Mr. Chadband , leaning forward over the table , pierces what he has got to follow directly into Mr. Snagsby with the thumb-nail already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 8309 len. 29]: `` It is , '' says Chadband , `` the ray of rays , the sun of suns , the moon of moons , the star of stars .
Parsing [sent. 8310 len. 8]: It is the light of Terewth . ''
Parsing [sent. 8311 len. 26]: Mr. Chadband draws himself up again and looks triumphantly at Mr. Snagsby as if he would be glad to know how he feels after that .
Parsing [sent. 8312 len. 13]: `` Of Terewth , '' says Mr. Chadband , hitting him again .
Parsing [sent. 8313 len. 14]: `` Say not to me that it is NOT the lamp of lamps .
Parsing [sent. 8314 len. 7]: I say to you it is .
Parsing [sent. 8315 len. 14]: I say to you , a million of times over , it is .
Parsing [sent. 8316 len. 3]: It is !
Parsing [sent. 8317 len. 37]: I say to you that I will proclaim it to you , whether you like it or not ; nay , that the less you like it , the more I will proclaim it to you .
Parsing [sent. 8318 len. 4]: With a speaking-trumpet !
Parsing [sent. 8319 len. 37]: I say to you that if you rear yourself against it , you shall fall , you shall be bruised , you shall be battered , you shall be flawed , you shall be smashed . ''
Parsing [sent. 8320 len. 86]: The present effect of this flight of oratory -- much admired for its general power by Mr. Chadband 's followers -- being not only to make Mr. Chadband unpleasantly warm , but to represent the innocent Mr. Snagsby in the light of a determined enemy to virtue , with a forehead of brass and a heart of adamant , that unfortunate tradesman becomes yet more disconcerted and is in a very advanced state of low spirits and false position when Mr. Chadband accidentally finishes him .
Parsing [sent. 8321 len. 75]: `` My friends , '' he resumes after dabbing his fat head for some time -- and it smokes to such an extent that he seems to light his pocket-handkerchief at it , which smokes , too , after every dab -- `` to pursue the subject we are endeavouring with our lowly gifts to improve , let us in a spirit of love inquire what is that Terewth to which I have alluded .
Parsing [sent. 8322 len. 49]: For , my young friends , '' suddenly addressing the ` prentices and Guster , to their consternation , `` if I am told by the doctor that calomel or castor-oil is good for me , I may naturally ask what is calomel , and what is castor-oil .
Parsing [sent. 8323 len. 18]: I may wish to be informed of that before I dose myself with either or with both .
Parsing [sent. 8324 len. 12]: Now , my young friends , what is this Terewth then ?
Parsing [sent. 8325 len. 29]: Firstly -LRB- in a spirit of love -RRB- , what is the common sort of Terewth -- the working clothes -- the every-day wear , my young friends ?
Parsing [sent. 8326 len. 5]: Is it deception ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8327 len. 6]: `` Ah -- h ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8328 len. 4]: from Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 8329 len. 6]: `` Is it suppression ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8330 len. 9]: A shiver in the negative from Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 8331 len. 6]: `` Is it reservation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8332 len. 15]: A shake of the head from Mrs. Snagsby -- very long and very tight .
Parsing [sent. 8333 len. 12]: `` No , my friends , it is neither of these .
Parsing [sent. 8334 len. 8]: Neither of these names belongs to it .
Parsing [sent. 8335 len. 94]: When this young heathen now among us -- who is now , my friends , asleep , the seal of indifference and perdition being set upon his eyelids ; but do not wake him , for it is right that I should have to wrestle , and to combat and to struggle , and to conquer , for his sake -- when this young hardened heathen told us a story of a cock , and of a bull , and of a lady , and of a sovereign , was THAT the Terewth ?
Parsing [sent. 8336 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 8337 len. 12]: Or if it was partly , was it wholly and entirely ?
Parsing [sent. 8338 len. 8]: No , my friends , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8339 len. 38]: If Mr. Snagsby could withstand his little woman 's look as it enters at his eyes , the windows of his soul , and searches the whole tenement , he were other than the man he is .
Parsing [sent. 8340 len. 5]: He cowers and droops .
Parsing [sent. 8341 len. 96]: `` Or , my juvenile friends , '' says Chadband , descending to the level of their comprehension with a very obtrusive demonstration in his greasily meek smile of coming a long way downstairs for the purpose , `` if the master of this house was to go forth into the city and there see an eel , and was to come back , and was to call unto him the mistress of this house , and was to say , ` Sarah , rejoice with me , for I have seen an elephant ! '
Parsing [sent. 8342 len. 6]: would THAT be Terewth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8343 len. 5]: Mrs. Snagsby in tears .
Parsing [sent. 8344 len. 40]: `` Or put it , my juvenile friends , that he saw an elephant , and returning said ` Lo , the city is barren , I have seen but an eel , ' would THAT be Terewth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8345 len. 5]: Mrs. Snagsby sobbing loudly .
Parsing [sent. 8346 len. 105]: `` Or put it , my juvenile friends , '' said Chadband , stimulated by the sound , `` that the unnatural parents of this slumbering heathen -- for parents he had , my juvenile friends , beyond a doubt -- after casting him forth to the wolves and the vultures , and the wild dogs and the young gazelles , and the serpents , went back to their dwellings and had their pipes , and their pots , and their flutings and their dancings , and their malt liquors , and their butcher 's meat and poultry , would THAT be Terewth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8347 len. 34]: Mrs. Snagsby replies by delivering herself a prey to spasms , not an unresisting prey , but a crying and a tearing one , so that Cook 's Court re-echoes with her shrieks .
Parsing [sent. 8348 len. 19]: Finally , becoming cataleptic , she has to be carried up the narrow staircase like a grand piano .
Parsing [sent. 8349 len. 62]: After unspeakable suffering , productive of the utmost consternation , she is pronounced , by expresses from the bedroom , free from pain , though much exhausted , in which state of affairs Mr. Snagsby , trampled and crushed in the piano-forte removal , and extremely timid and feeble , ventures to come out from behind the door in the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 8350 len. 28]: All this time Jo has been standing on the spot where he woke up , ever picking his cap and putting bits of fur in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 8351 len. 43]: He spits them out with a remorseful air , for he feels that it is in his nature to be an unimprovable reprobate and that it 's no good HIS trying to keep awake , for HE wo n't never know nothink .
Parsing [sent. 8352 len. 91]: Though it may be , Jo , that there is a history so interesting and affecting even to minds as near the brutes as thine , recording deeds done on this earth for common men , that if the Chadbands , removing their own persons from the light , would but show it thee in simple reverence , would but leave it unimproved , would but regard it as being eloquent enough without their modest aid -- it might hold thee awake , and thou might learn from it yet !
Parsing [sent. 8353 len. 8]: Jo never heard of any such book .
Parsing [sent. 8354 len. 37]: Its compilers and the Reverend Chadband are all one to him , except that he knows the Reverend Chadband and would rather run away from him for an hour than hear him talk for five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 8355 len. 16]: `` It a n't no good my waiting here no longer , '' thinks Jo .
Parsing [sent. 8356 len. 14]: `` Mr. Snagsby a n't a-going to say nothink to me to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 8357 len. 5]: And downstairs he shuffles .
Parsing [sent. 8358 len. 36]: But downstairs is the charitable Guster , holding by the handrail of the kitchen stairs and warding off a fit , as yet doubtfully , the same having been induced by Mrs. Snagsby 's screaming .
Parsing [sent. 8359 len. 29]: She has her own supper of bread and cheese to hand to Jo , with whom she ventures to interchange a word or so for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 8360 len. 14]: `` Here 's something to eat , poor boy , '' says Guster .
Parsing [sent. 8361 len. 11]: `` Thank ` ee , mum , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 8362 len. 6]: `` Are you hungry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8363 len. 4]: `` Jist ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8364 len. 3]: says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 8365 len. 14]: `` What 's gone of your father and your mother , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8366 len. 12]: Jo stops in the middle of a bite and looks petrified .
Parsing [sent. 8367 len. 40]: For this orphan charge of the Christian saint whose shrine was at Tooting has patted him on the shoulder , and it is the first time in his life that any decent hand has been so laid upon him .
Parsing [sent. 8368 len. 13]: `` I never know 'd nothink about 'em , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 8369 len. 13]: `` No more did n't I of mine , '' cries Guster .
Parsing [sent. 8370 len. 22]: She is repressing symptoms favourable to the fit when she seems to take alarm at something and vanishes down the stairs .
Parsing [sent. 8371 len. 16]: `` Jo , '' whispers the law-stationer softly as the boy lingers on the step .
Parsing [sent. 8372 len. 9]: `` Here I am , Mr. Snagsby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8373 len. 16]: `` I did n't know you were gone -- there 's another half-crown , Jo .
Parsing [sent. 8374 len. 21]: It was quite right of you to say nothing about the lady the other night when we were out together .
Parsing [sent. 8375 len. 5]: It would breed trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8376 len. 10]: You ca n't be too quiet , Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 8377 len. 8]: `` I am fly , master ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8378 len. 6]: And so , good night .
Parsing [sent. 8379 len. 22]: A ghostly shade , frilled and night-capped , follows the law-stationer to the room he came from and glides higher up .
Parsing [sent. 8380 len. 34]: And henceforth he begins , go where he will , to be attended by another shadow than his own , hardly less constant than his own , hardly less quiet than his own .
Parsing [sent. 8381 len. 20]: And into whatsoever atmosphere of secrecy his own shadow may pass , let all concerned in the secrecy beware !
Parsing [sent. 8382 len. 24]: For the watchful Mrs. Snagsby is there too -- bone of his bone , flesh of his flesh , shadow of his shadow .
Parsing [sent. 8383 len. 31]: Chapter XXVI -- Sharpshooters Wintry morning , looking with dull eyes and sallow face upon the neighbourhood of Leicester Square , finds its inhabitants unwilling to get out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 8384 len. 38]: Many of them are not early risers at the brightest of times , being birds of night who roost when the sun is high and are wide awake and keen for prey when the stars shine out .
Parsing [sent. 8385 len. 43]: Behind dingy blind and curtain , in upper story and garret , skulking more or less under false names , false hair , false titles , false jewellery , and false histories , a colony of brigands lie in their first sleep .
Parsing [sent. 8386 len. 78]: Gentlemen of the green-baize road who could discourse from personal experience of foreign galleys and home treadmills ; spies of strong governments that eternally quake with weakness and miserable fear , broken traitors , cowards , bullies , gamesters , shufflers , swindlers , and false witnesses ; some not unmarked by the branding-iron beneath their dirty braid ; all with more cruelty in them than was in Nero , and more crime than is in Newgate .
Parsing [sent. 8387 len. 78]: For howsoever bad the devil can be in fustian or smock-frock -LRB- and he can be very bad in both -RRB- , he is a more designing , callous , and intolerable devil when he sticks a pin in his shirt-front , calls himself a gentleman , backs a card or colour , plays a game or so of billiards , and knows a little about bills and promissory notes than in any other form he wears .
Parsing [sent. 8388 len. 23]: And in such form Mr. Bucket shall find him , when he will , still pervading the tributary channels of Leicester Square .
Parsing [sent. 8389 len. 12]: But the wintry morning wants him not and wakes him not .
Parsing [sent. 8390 len. 12]: It wakes Mr. George of the shooting gallery and his familiar .
Parsing [sent. 8391 len. 11]: They arise , roll up and stow away their mattresses .
Parsing [sent. 8392 len. 47]: Mr. George , having shaved himself before a looking-glass of minute proportions , then marches out , bare-headed and bare-chested , to the pump in the little yard and anon comes back shining with yellow soap , friction , drifting rain , and exceedingly cold water .
Parsing [sent. 8393 len. 146]: As he rubs himself upon a large jack-towel , blowing like a military sort of diver just come up , his hair curling tighter and tighter on his sunburnt temples the more he rubs it so that it looks as if it never could be loosened by any less coercive instrument than an iron rake or a curry-comb -- as he rubs , and puffs , and polishes , and blows , turning his head from side to side the more conveniently to excoriate his throat , and standing with his body well bent forward to keep the wet from his martial legs , Phil , on his knees lighting a fire , looks round as if it were enough washing for him to see all that done , and sufficient renovation for one day to take in the superfluous health his master throws off .
Parsing [sent. 8394 len. 45]: When Mr. George is dry , he goes to work to brush his head with two hard brushes at once , to that unmerciful degree that Phil , shouldering his way round the gallery in the act of sweeping it , winks with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 8395 len. 16]: This chafing over , the ornamental part of Mr. George 's toilet is soon performed .
Parsing [sent. 8396 len. 36]: He fills his pipe , lights it , and marches up and down smoking , as his custom is , while Phil , raising a powerful odour of hot rolls and coffee , prepares breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8397 len. 9]: He smokes gravely and marches in slow time .
Parsing [sent. 8398 len. 16]: Perhaps this morning 's pipe is devoted to the memory of Gridley in his grave .
Parsing [sent. 8399 len. 30]: `` And so , Phil , '' says George of the shooting gallery after several turns in silence , `` you were dreaming of the country last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8400 len. 21]: Phil , by the by , said as much in a tone of surprise as he scrambled out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 8401 len. 8]: `` Yes , guv ` ner . ''
Parsing [sent. 8402 len. 7]: `` What was it like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8403 len. 19]: `` I hardly know what it was like , guv ` ner , '' said Phil , considering .
Parsing [sent. 8404 len. 11]: `` How did you know it was the country ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8405 len. 10]: `` On account of the grass , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8406 len. 13]: And the swans upon it , '' says Phil after further consideration .
Parsing [sent. 8407 len. 11]: `` What were the swans doing on the grass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8408 len. 14]: `` They was a-eating of it , I expect , '' says Phil .
Parsing [sent. 8409 len. 15]: The master resumes his march , and the man resumes his preparation of breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8410 len. 71]: It is not necessarily a lengthened preparation , being limited to the setting forth of very simple breakfast requisites for two and the broiling of a rasher of bacon at the fire in the rusty grate ; but as Phil has to sidle round a considerable part of the gallery for every object he wants , and never brings two objects at once , it takes time under the circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 8411 len. 7]: At length the breakfast is ready .
Parsing [sent. 8412 len. 33]: Phil announcing it , Mr. George knocks the ashes out of his pipe on the hob , stands his pipe itself in the chimney corner , and sits down to the meal .
Parsing [sent. 8413 len. 28]: When he has helped himself , Phil follows suit , sitting at the extreme end of the little oblong table and taking his plate on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 8414 len. 21]: Either in humility , or to hide his blackened hands , or because it is his natural manner of eating .
Parsing [sent. 8415 len. 32]: `` The country , '' says Mr. George , plying his knife and fork ; `` why , I suppose you never clapped your eyes on the country , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8416 len. 16]: `` I see the marshes once , '' says Phil , contentedly eating his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8417 len. 5]: `` What marshes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8418 len. 10]: `` THE marshes , commander , '' returns Phil .
Parsing [sent. 8419 len. 6]: `` Where are they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8420 len. 23]: `` I do n't know where they are , '' says Phil ; `` but I see 'em , guv ` ner .
Parsing [sent. 8421 len. 4]: They was flat .
Parsing [sent. 8422 len. 4]: And miste . ''
Parsing [sent. 8423 len. 24]: Governor and commander are interchangeable terms with Phil , expressive of the same respect and deference and applicable to nobody but Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8424 len. 11]: `` I was born in the country , Phil . ''
Parsing [sent. 8425 len. 8]: `` Was you indeed , commander ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8426 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8427 len. 5]: And bred there . ''
Parsing [sent. 8428 len. 29]: Phil elevates his one eyebrow , and after respectfully staring at his master to express interest , swallows a great gulp of coffee , still staring at him .
Parsing [sent. 8429 len. 19]: `` There 's not a bird 's note that I do n't know , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8430 len. 14]: `` Not many an English leaf or berry that I could n't name .
Parsing [sent. 8431 len. 17]: Not many a tree that I could n't climb yet if I was put to it .
Parsing [sent. 8432 len. 9]: I was a real country boy , once .
Parsing [sent. 8433 len. 9]: My good mother lived in the country . ''
Parsing [sent. 8434 len. 18]: `` She must have been a fine old lady , guv ` ner , '' Phil observes .
Parsing [sent. 8435 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 8436 len. 17]: And not so old either , five and thirty years ago , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8437 len. 26]: `` But I 'll wager that at ninety she would be near as upright as me , and near as broad across the shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 8438 len. 12]: `` Did she die at ninety , guv ` ner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8439 len. 3]: inquires Phil .
Parsing [sent. 8440 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8441 len. 2]: Bosh !
Parsing [sent. 8442 len. 11]: Let her rest in peace , God bless her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8443 len. 4]: says the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 8444 len. 15]: `` What set me on about country boys , and runaways , and good-for-nothings ?
Parsing [sent. 8445 len. 6]: You , to be sure !
Parsing [sent. 8446 len. 15]: So you never clapped your eyes upon the country -- marshes and dreams excepted .
Parsing [sent. 8447 len. 3]: Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8448 len. 5]: Phil shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 8449 len. 9]: `` Do you want to see it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8450 len. 17]: `` N-no , I do n't know as I do , particular , '' says Phil .
Parsing [sent. 8451 len. 11]: `` The town 's enough for you , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8452 len. 37]: `` Why , you see , commander , '' says Phil , `` I ai n't acquainted with anythink else , and I doubt if I ai n't a-getting too old to take to novelties . ''
Parsing [sent. 8453 len. 9]: `` How old ARE you , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8454 len. 15]: asks the trooper , pausing as he conveys his smoking saucer to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 8455 len. 14]: `` I 'm something with a eight in it , '' says Phil .
Parsing [sent. 8456 len. 7]: `` It ca n't be eighty .
Parsing [sent. 8457 len. 4]: Nor yet eighteen .
Parsing [sent. 8458 len. 8]: It 's betwixt 'em , somewheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 8459 len. 41]: Mr. George , slowly putting down his saucer without tasting its contents , is laughingly beginning , `` Why , what the deuce , Phil -- '' when he stops , seeing that Phil is counting on his dirty fingers .
Parsing [sent. 8460 len. 24]: `` I was just eight , '' says Phil , `` agreeable to the parish calculation , when I went with the tinker .
Parsing [sent. 8461 len. 43]: I was sent on a errand , and I see him a-sittin under a old buildin with a fire all to himself wery comfortable , and he says , ` Would you like to come along a me , my man ? '
Parsing [sent. 8462 len. 19]: I says ` Yes , ' and him and me and the fire goes home to Clerkenwell together .
Parsing [sent. 8463 len. 6]: That was April Fool Day .
Parsing [sent. 8464 len. 39]: I was able to count up to ten ; and when April Fool Day come round again , I says to myself , ` Now , old chap , you 're one and a eight in it . '
Parsing [sent. 8465 len. 25]: April Fool Day after that , I says , ` Now , old chap , you 're two and a eight in it . '
Parsing [sent. 8466 len. 23]: In course of time , I come to ten and a eight in it ; two tens and a eight in it .
Parsing [sent. 8467 len. 29]: When it got so high , it got the upper hand of me , but this is how I always know there 's a eight in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8468 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8469 len. 8]: says Mr. George , resuming his breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8470 len. 8]: `` And where 's the tinker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8471 len. 31]: `` Drink put him in the hospital , guv ` ner , and the hospital put him -- in a glass-case , I HAVE heerd , '' Phil replies mysteriously .
Parsing [sent. 8472 len. 8]: `` By that means you got promotion ?
Parsing [sent. 8473 len. 7]: Took the business , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8474 len. 10]: `` Yes , commander , I took the business .
Parsing [sent. 8475 len. 5]: Such as it was .
Parsing [sent. 8476 len. 37]: It was n't much of a beat -- round Saffron Hill , Hatton Garden , Clerkenwell , Smiffeld , and there -- poor neighbourhood , where they uses up the kettles till they 're past mending .
Parsing [sent. 8477 len. 25]: Most of the tramping tinkers used to come and lodge at our place ; that was the best part of my master 's earnings .
Parsing [sent. 8478 len. 8]: But they did n't come to me .
Parsing [sent. 8479 len. 6]: I war n't like him .
Parsing [sent. 8480 len. 8]: He could sing 'em a good song .
Parsing [sent. 8481 len. 4]: I could n't !
Parsing [sent. 8482 len. 23]: He could play 'em a tune on any sort of pot you please , so as it was iron or block tin .
Parsing [sent. 8483 len. 24]: I never could do nothing with a pot but mend it or bile it -- never had a note of music in me .
Parsing [sent. 8484 len. 15]: Besides , I was too ill-looking , and their wives complained of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8485 len. 6]: `` They were mighty particular .
Parsing [sent. 8486 len. 11]: You would pass muster in a crowd , Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8487 len. 8]: says the trooper with a pleasant smile .
Parsing [sent. 8488 len. 15]: `` No , guv ` ner , '' returns Phil , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 8489 len. 7]: `` No , I should n't .
Parsing [sent. 8490 len. 114]: I was passable enough when I went with the tinker , though nothing to boast of then ; but what with blowing the fire with my mouth when I was young , and spileing my complexion , and singeing my hair off , and swallering the smoke , and what with being nat ` rally unfort ` nate in the way of running against hot metal and marking myself by sich means , and what with having turn-ups with the tinker as I got older , almost whenever he was too far gone in drink -- which was almost always -- my beauty was queer , wery queer , even at that time .
Parsing [sent. 8491 len. 59]: As to since , what with a dozen years in a dark forge where the men was given to larking , and what with being scorched in a accident at a gas-works , and what with being blowed out of winder case-filling at the firework business , I am ugly enough to be made a show on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8492 len. 21]: Resigning himself to which condition with a perfectly satisfied manner , Phil begs the favour of another cup of coffee .
Parsing [sent. 8493 len. 22]: While drinking it , he says , `` It was after the case-filling blow-up when I first see you , commander .
Parsing [sent. 8494 len. 4]: You remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8495 len. 6]: `` I remember , Phil .
Parsing [sent. 8496 len. 9]: You were walking along in the sun . ''
Parsing [sent. 8497 len. 29]: `` Crawling , guv ` ner , again a wall -- '' `` True , Phil -- shouldering your way on -- '' `` In a night-cap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8498 len. 5]: exclaims Phil , excited .
Parsing [sent. 8499 len. 16]: `` In a night-cap -- '' `` And hobbling with a couple of sticks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8500 len. 7]: cries Phil , still more excited .
Parsing [sent. 8501 len. 7]: `` With a couple of sticks .
Parsing [sent. 8502 len. 41]: When -- '' `` When you stops , you know , '' cries Phil , putting down his cup and saucer and hastily removing his plate from his knees , `` and says to me , ` What , comrade !
Parsing [sent. 8503 len. 8]: You have been in the wars ! '
Parsing [sent. 8504 len. 45]: I did n't say much to you , commander , then , for I was took by surprise that a person so strong and healthy and bold as you was should stop to speak to such a limping bag of bones as I was .
Parsing [sent. 8505 len. 39]: But you says to me , says you , delivering it out of your chest as hearty as possible , so that it was like a glass of something hot , ` What accident have you met with ?
Parsing [sent. 8506 len. 6]: You have been badly hurt .
Parsing [sent. 8507 len. 7]: What 's amiss , old boy ?
Parsing [sent. 8508 len. 10]: Cheer up , and tell us about it ! '
Parsing [sent. 8509 len. 3]: Cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 8510 len. 5]: I was cheered already !
Parsing [sent. 8511 len. 32]: I says as much to you , you says more to me , I says more to you , you says more to me , and here I am , commander !
Parsing [sent. 8512 len. 7]: Here I am , commander ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8513 len. 16]: cries Phil , who has started from his chair and unaccountably begun to sidle away .
Parsing [sent. 8514 len. 23]: `` If a mark 's wanted , or if it will improve the business , let the customers take aim at me .
Parsing [sent. 8515 len. 7]: They ca n't spoil MY beauty .
Parsing [sent. 8516 len. 5]: I 'M all right .
Parsing [sent. 8517 len. 3]: Come on !
Parsing [sent. 8518 len. 15]: If they want a man to box at , let 'em box at me .
Parsing [sent. 8519 len. 9]: Let 'em knock me well about the head .
Parsing [sent. 8520 len. 5]: I do n't mind .
Parsing [sent. 8521 len. 23]: If they want a light-weight to be throwed for practice , Cornwall , Devonshire , or Lancashire , let 'em throw me .
Parsing [sent. 8522 len. 6]: They wo n't hurt ME .
Parsing [sent. 8523 len. 15]: I have been throwed , all sorts of styles , all my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8524 len. 56]: With this unexpected speech , energetically delivered and accompanied by action illustrative of the various exercises referred to , Phil Squod shoulders his way round three sides of the gallery , and abruptly tacking off at his commander , makes a butt at him with his head , intended to express devotion to his service .
Parsing [sent. 8525 len. 9]: He then begins to clear away the breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 8526 len. 27]: Mr. George , after laughing cheerfully and clapping him on the shoulder , assists in these arrangements and helps to get the gallery into business order .
Parsing [sent. 8527 len. 35]: That done , he takes a turn at the dumb-bells , and afterwards weighing himself and opining that he is getting `` too fleshy , '' engages with great gravity in solitary broadsword practice .
Parsing [sent. 8528 len. 53]: Meanwhile Phil has fallen to work at his usual table , where he screws and unscrews , and cleans , and files , and whistles into small apertures , and blackens himself more and more , and seems to do and undo everything that can be done and undone about a gun .
Parsing [sent. 8529 len. 27]: Master and man are at length disturbed by footsteps in the passage , where they make an unusual sound , denoting the arrival of unusual company .
Parsing [sent. 8530 len. 33]: These steps , advancing nearer and nearer to the gallery , bring into it a group at first sight scarcely reconcilable with any day in the year but the fifth of November .
Parsing [sent. 8531 len. 70]: It consists of a limp and ugly figure carried in a chair by two bearers and attended by a lean female with a face like a pinched mask , who might be expected immediately to recite the popular verses commemorative of the time when they did contrive to blow Old England up alive but for her keeping her lips tightly and defiantly closed as the chair is put down .
Parsing [sent. 8532 len. 13]: At which point the figure in it gasping , `` O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 8533 len. 5]: Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8534 len. 5]: I am shaken ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8535 len. 16]: adds , `` How de do , my dear friend , how de do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8536 len. 26]: Mr. George then descries , in the procession , the venerable Mr. Smallweed out for an airing , attended by his granddaughter Judy as body-guard .
Parsing [sent. 8537 len. 39]: `` Mr. George , my dear friend , '' says Grandfather Smallweed , removing his right arm from the neck of one of his bearers , whom he has nearly throttled coming along , `` how de do ?
Parsing [sent. 8538 len. 12]: You 're surprised to see me , my dear friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 8539 len. 22]: `` I should hardly have been more surprised to have seen your friend in the city , '' returns Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8540 len. 12]: `` I am very seldom out , '' pants Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 8541 len. 10]: `` I have n't been out for many months .
Parsing [sent. 8542 len. 9]: It 's inconvenient -- and it comes expensive .
Parsing [sent. 8543 len. 14]: But I longed so much to see you , my dear Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8544 len. 7]: How de do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8545 len. 11]: `` I am well enough , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8546 len. 9]: `` I hope you are the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 8547 len. 13]: `` You ca n't be too well , my dear friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 8548 len. 8]: Mr. Smallweed takes him by both hands .
Parsing [sent. 8549 len. 8]: `` I have brought my granddaughter Judy .
Parsing [sent. 8550 len. 7]: I could n't keep her away .
Parsing [sent. 8551 len. 9]: She longed so much to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8552 len. 3]: `` Hum !
Parsing [sent. 8553 len. 6]: She hears it calmly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8554 len. 4]: mutters Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8555 len. 47]: `` So we got a hackney-cab , and put a chair in it , and just round the corner they lifted me out of the cab and into the chair , and carried me here that I might see my dear friend in his own establishment !
Parsing [sent. 8556 len. 34]: This , '' says Grandfather Smallweed , alluding to the bearer , who has been in danger of strangulation and who withdraws adjusting his windpipe , `` is the driver of the cab .
Parsing [sent. 8557 len. 5]: He has nothing extra .
Parsing [sent. 8558 len. 9]: It is by agreement included in his fare .
Parsing [sent. 8559 len. 21]: This person , '' the other bearer , `` we engaged in the street outside for a pint of beer .
Parsing [sent. 8560 len. 4]: Which is twopence .
Parsing [sent. 8561 len. 7]: Judy , give the person twopence .
Parsing [sent. 8562 len. 27]: I was not sure you had a workman of your own here , my dear friend , or we need n't have employed this person . ''
Parsing [sent. 8563 len. 18]: Grandfather Smallweed refers to Phil with a glance of considerable terror and a half-subdued `` O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 8564 len. 6]: Oh , dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8565 len. 64]: Nor in his apprehension , on the surface of things , without some reason , for Phil , who has never beheld the apparition in the black-velvet cap before , has stopped short with a gun in his hand with much of the air of a dead shot intent on picking Mr. Smallweed off as an ugly old bird of the crow species .
Parsing [sent. 8566 len. 18]: `` Judy , my child , '' says Grandfather Smallweed , `` give the person his twopence .
Parsing [sent. 8567 len. 12]: It 's a great deal for what he has done . ''
Parsing [sent. 8568 len. 66]: The person , who is one of those extraordinary specimens of human fungus that spring up spontaneously in the western streets of London , ready dressed in an old red jacket , with a `` mission '' for holding horses and calling coaches , received his twopence with anything but transport , tosses the money into the air , catches it over-handed , and retires .
Parsing [sent. 8569 len. 26]: `` My dear Mr. George , '' says Grandfather Smallweed , `` would you be so kind as help to carry me to the fire ?
Parsing [sent. 8570 len. 19]: I am accustomed to a fire , and I am an old man , and I soon chill .
Parsing [sent. 8571 len. 6]: Oh , dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8572 len. 37]: His closing exclamation is jerked out of the venerable gentleman by the suddenness with which Mr. Squod , like a genie , catches him up , chair and all , and deposits him on the hearth-stone .
Parsing [sent. 8573 len. 5]: `` O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8574 len. 6]: says Mr. Smallweed , panting .
Parsing [sent. 8575 len. 6]: `` Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8576 len. 5]: Oh , my stars !
Parsing [sent. 8577 len. 14]: My dear friend , your workman is very strong -- and very prompt .
Parsing [sent. 8578 len. 8]: O Lord , he is very prompt !
Parsing [sent. 8579 len. 8]: Judy , draw me back a little .
Parsing [sent. 8580 len. 27]: I 'm being scorched in the legs , '' which indeed is testified to the noses of all present by the smell of his worsted stockings .
Parsing [sent. 8581 len. 45]: The gentle Judy , having backed her grandfather a little way from the fire , and having shaken him up as usual , and having released his overshadowed eye from its black-velvet extinguisher , Mr. Smallweed again says , `` Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8582 len. 4]: O Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8583 len. 16]: and looking about and meeting Mr. George 's glance , again stretches out both hands .
Parsing [sent. 8584 len. 5]: `` My dear friend !
Parsing [sent. 8585 len. 6]: So happy in this meeting !
Parsing [sent. 8586 len. 6]: And this is your establishment ?
Parsing [sent. 8587 len. 6]: It 's a delightful place .
Parsing [sent. 8588 len. 5]: It 's a picture !
Parsing [sent. 8589 len. 18]: You never find that anything goes off here accidentally , do you , my dear friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8590 len. 9]: adds Grandfather Smallweed , very ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 8591 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 8592 len. 6]: No fear of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8593 len. 5]: `` And your workman .
Parsing [sent. 8594 len. 7]: He -- Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8595 len. 18]: -- he never lets anything off without meaning it , does he , my dear friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8596 len. 16]: `` He has never hurt anybody but himself , '' says Mr. George , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 8597 len. 8]: `` But he might , you know .
Parsing [sent. 8598 len. 23]: He seems to have hurt himself a good deal , and he might hurt somebody else , '' the old gentleman returns .
Parsing [sent. 8599 len. 12]: `` He might n't mean it -- or he even might .
Parsing [sent. 8600 len. 18]: Mr. George , will you order him to leave his infernal firearms alone and go away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8601 len. 21]: Obedient to a nod from the trooper , Phil retires , empty-handed , to the other end of the gallery .
Parsing [sent. 8602 len. 11]: Mr. Smallweed , reassured , falls to rubbing his legs .
Parsing [sent. 8603 len. 11]: `` And you 're doing well , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8604 len. 19]: he says to the trooper , squarely standing faced about towards him with his broadsword in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 8605 len. 10]: `` You are prospering , please the Powers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8606 len. 14]: Mr. George answers with a cool nod , adding , `` Go on .
Parsing [sent. 8607 len. 12]: You have not come to say that , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 8608 len. 15]: `` You are so sprightly , Mr. George , '' returns the venerable grandfather .
Parsing [sent. 8609 len. 8]: `` You are such good company . ''
Parsing [sent. 8610 len. 4]: `` Ha ha !
Parsing [sent. 8611 len. 4]: Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8612 len. 4]: says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8613 len. 5]: `` My dear friend !
Parsing [sent. 8614 len. 9]: But that sword looks awful gleaming and sharp .
Parsing [sent. 8615 len. 8]: It might cut somebody , by accident .
Parsing [sent. 8616 len. 8]: It makes me shiver , Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8617 len. 4]: Curse him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8618 len. 22]: says the excellent old gentleman apart to Judy as the trooper takes a step or two away to lay it aside .
Parsing [sent. 8619 len. 19]: `` He owes me money , and might think of paying off old scores in this murdering place .
Parsing [sent. 8620 len. 17]: I wish your brimstone grandmother was here , and he 'd shave her head off . ''
Parsing [sent. 8621 len. 36]: Mr. George , returning , folds his arms , and looking down at the old man , sliding every moment lower and lower in his chair , says quietly , `` Now for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8622 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8623 len. 12]: cries Mr. Smallweed , rubbing his hands with an artful chuckle .
Parsing [sent. 8624 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 8625 len. 4]: Now for it .
Parsing [sent. 8626 len. 9]: Now for what , my dear friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8627 len. 40]: `` For a pipe , '' says Mr. George , who with great composure sets his chair in the chimney-corner , takes his pipe from the grate , fills it and lights it , and falls to smoking peacefully .
Parsing [sent. 8628 len. 52]: This tends to the discomfiture of Mr. Smallweed , who finds it so difficult to resume his object , whatever it may be , that he becomes exasperated and secretly claws the air with an impotent vindictiveness expressive of an intense desire to tear and rend the visage of Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8629 len. 132]: As the excellent old gentleman 's nails are long and leaden , and his hands lean and veinous , and his eyes green and watery ; and , over and above this , as he continues , while he claws , to slide down in his chair and to collapse into a shapeless bundle , he becomes such a ghastly spectacle , even in the accustomed eyes of Judy , that that young virgin pounces at him with something more than the ardour of affection and so shakes him up and pats and pokes him in divers parts of his body , but particularly in that part which the science of self-defence would call his wind , that in his grievous distress he utters enforced sounds like a paviour 's rammer .
Parsing [sent. 8630 len. 44]: When Judy has by these means set him up again in his chair , with a white face and a frosty nose -LRB- but still clawing -RRB- , she stretches out her weazen forefinger and gives Mr. George one poke in the back .
Parsing [sent. 8631 len. 28]: The trooper raising his head , she makes another poke at her esteemed grandfather , and having thus brought them together , stares rigidly at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8632 len. 5]: `` Aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 8633 len. 4]: Ho , ho !
Parsing [sent. 8634 len. 9]: U -- u -- u -- ugh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8635 len. 8]: chatters Grandfather Smallweed , swallowing his rage .
Parsing [sent. 8636 len. 6]: `` My dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8637 len. 5]: -LRB- still clawing -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 8638 len. 11]: `` I tell you what , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8639 len. 14]: `` If you want to converse with me , you must speak out .
Parsing [sent. 8640 len. 16]: I am one of the roughs , and I ca n't go about and about .
Parsing [sent. 8641 len. 9]: I have n't the art to do it .
Parsing [sent. 8642 len. 6]: I am not clever enough .
Parsing [sent. 8643 len. 6]: It do n't suit me .
Parsing [sent. 8644 len. 38]: When you go winding round and round me , '' says the trooper , putting his pipe between his lips again , `` damme , if I do n't feel as if I was being smothered ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8645 len. 22]: And he inflates his broad chest to its utmost extent as if to assure himself that he is not smothered yet .
Parsing [sent. 8646 len. 28]: `` If you have come to give me a friendly call , '' continues Mr. George , `` I am obliged to you ; how are you ?
Parsing [sent. 8647 len. 23]: If you have come to see whether there 's any property on the premises , look about you ; you are welcome .
Parsing [sent. 8648 len. 13]: If you want to out with something , out with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8649 len. 19]: The blooming Judy , without removing her gaze from the fire , gives her grandfather one ghostly poke .
Parsing [sent. 8650 len. 4]: `` You see !
Parsing [sent. 8651 len. 6]: It 's her opinion too .
Parsing [sent. 8652 len. 34]: And why the devil that young woman wo n't sit down like a Christian , '' says Mr. George with his eyes musingly fixed on Judy , `` I ca n't comprehend . ''
Parsing [sent. 8653 len. 18]: `` She keeps at my side to attend to me , sir , '' says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 8654 len. 18]: `` I am an old man , my dear Mr. George , and I need some attention .
Parsing [sent. 8655 len. 34]: I can carry my years ; I am not a brimstone poll-parrot '' -LRB- snarling and looking unconsciously for the cushion -RRB- , `` but I need attention , my dear friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 8656 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8657 len. 13]: returns the trooper , wheeling his chair to face the old man .
Parsing [sent. 8658 len. 5]: `` Now then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8659 len. 22]: `` My friend in the city , Mr. George , has done a little business with a pupil of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 8660 len. 5]: `` Has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8661 len. 4]: says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8662 len. 9]: `` I am sorry to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8663 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8664 len. 6]: Grandfather Smallweed rubs his legs .
Parsing [sent. 8665 len. 18]: `` He is a fine young soldier now , Mr. George , by the name of Carstone .
Parsing [sent. 8666 len. 12]: Friends came forward and paid it all up , honourable . ''
Parsing [sent. 8667 len. 5]: `` Did they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8668 len. 4]: returns Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8669 len. 17]: `` Do you think your friend in the city would like a piece of advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8670 len. 10]: `` I think he would , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 8671 len. 4]: From you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8672 len. 16]: `` I advise him , then , to do no more business in that quarter .
Parsing [sent. 8673 len. 10]: There 's no more to be got by it .
Parsing [sent. 8674 len. 16]: The young gentleman , to my knowledge , is brought to a dead halt . ''
Parsing [sent. 8675 len. 9]: `` No , no , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 8676 len. 7]: No , no , Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8677 len. 19]: No , no , no , sir , '' remonstrates Grandfather Smallweed , cunningly rubbing his spare legs .
Parsing [sent. 8678 len. 10]: `` Not quite a dead halt , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8679 len. 73]: He has good friends , and he is good for his pay , and he is good for the selling price of his commission , and he is good for his chance in a lawsuit , and he is good for his chance in a wife , and -- oh , do you know , Mr. George , I think my friend would consider the young gentleman good for something yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8680 len. 17]: says Grandfather Smallweed , turning up his velvet cap and scratching his ear like a monkey .
Parsing [sent. 8681 len. 43]: Mr. George , who has put aside his pipe and sits with an arm on his chair-back , beats a tattoo on the ground with his right foot as if he were not particularly pleased with the turn the conversation has taken .
Parsing [sent. 8682 len. 16]: `` But to pass from one subject to another , '' resumes Mr. Smallweed . ''
Parsing [sent. 8683 len. 12]: ` To promote the conversation , as a joker might say .
Parsing [sent. 8684 len. 14]: To pass , Mr. George , from the ensign to the captain . ''
Parsing [sent. 8685 len. 10]: `` What are you up to , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8686 len. 16]: asks Mr. George , pausing with a frown in stroking the recollection of his moustache .
Parsing [sent. 8687 len. 5]: `` What captain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8688 len. 4]: `` Our captain .
Parsing [sent. 8689 len. 6]: The captain we know of .
Parsing [sent. 8690 len. 4]: Captain Hawdon . ''
Parsing [sent. 8691 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 8692 len. 8]: That 's it , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8693 len. 19]: says Mr. George with a low whistle as he sees both grandfather and granddaughter looking hard at him .
Parsing [sent. 8694 len. 5]: `` You are there !
Parsing [sent. 8695 len. 2]: Well ?
Parsing [sent. 8696 len. 4]: What about it ?
Parsing [sent. 8697 len. 10]: Come , I wo n't be smothered any more .
Parsing [sent. 8698 len. 3]: Speak ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8699 len. 24]: `` My dear friend , '' returns the old man , `` I was applied -- Judy , shake me up a little !
Parsing [sent. 8700 len. 23]: -- I was applied to yesterday about the captain , and my opinion still is that the captain is not dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 8701 len. 4]: `` Bosh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8702 len. 4]: observes Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8703 len. 11]: `` What was your remark , my dear friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8704 len. 11]: inquires the old man with his hand to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 8705 len. 4]: `` Bosh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8706 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8707 len. 4]: says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 8708 len. 27]: `` Mr. George , of my opinion you can judge for yourself according to the questions asked of me and the reasons given for asking 'em .
Parsing [sent. 8709 len. 14]: Now , what do you think the lawyer making the inquiries wants ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8710 len. 9]: `` A job , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8711 len. 7]: `` Nothing of the kind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8712 len. 24]: `` Ca n't be a lawyer , then , '' says Mr. George , folding his arms with an air of confirmed resolution .
Parsing [sent. 8713 len. 15]: `` My dear friend , he is a lawyer , and a famous one .
Parsing [sent. 8714 len. 12]: He wants to see some fragment in Captain Hawdon 's writing .
Parsing [sent. 8715 len. 8]: He do n't want to keep it .
Parsing [sent. 8716 len. 17]: He only wants to see it and compare it with a writing in his possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 8717 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8718 len. 6]: `` Well , Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8719 len. 36]: Happening to remember the advertisement concerning Captain Hawdon and any information that could be given respecting him , he looked it up and came to me -- just as you did , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 8720 len. 5]: WILL you shake hands ?
Parsing [sent. 8721 len. 7]: So glad you came that day !
Parsing [sent. 8722 len. 15]: I should have missed forming such a friendship if you had n't come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8723 len. 7]: `` Well , Mr. Smallweed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8724 len. 13]: says Mr. George again after going through the ceremony with some stiffness .
Parsing [sent. 8725 len. 7]: `` I had no such thing .
Parsing [sent. 8726 len. 7]: I have nothing but his signature .
Parsing [sent. 8727 len. 56]: Plague pestilence and famine , battle murder and sudden death upon him , '' says the old man , making a curse out of one of his few remembrances of a prayer and squeezing up his velvet cap between his angry hands , `` I have half a million of his signatures , I think !
Parsing [sent. 8728 len. 44]: But you , '' breathlessly recovering his mildness of speech as Judy re-adjusts the cap on his skittle-ball of a head , `` you , my dear Mr. George , are likely to have some letter or paper that would suit the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 8729 len. 12]: Anything would suit the purpose , written in the hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 8730 len. 22]: `` Some writing in that hand , '' says the trooper , pondering ; `` may be , I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 8731 len. 6]: `` My dearest friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8732 len. 9]: `` May be , I have not . ''
Parsing [sent. 8733 len. 4]: `` Ho ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8734 len. 6]: says Grandfather Smallweed , crest-fallen .
Parsing [sent. 8735 len. 25]: `` But if I had bushels of it , I would not show as much as would make a cartridge without knowing why . ''
Parsing [sent. 8736 len. 9]: `` Sir , I have told you why .
Parsing [sent. 8737 len. 12]: My dear Mr. George , I have told you why . ''
Parsing [sent. 8738 len. 13]: `` Not enough , '' says the trooper , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 8739 len. 11]: `` I must know more , and approve it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8740 len. 10]: `` Then , will you come to the lawyer ?
Parsing [sent. 8741 len. 13]: My dear friend , will you come and see the gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8742 len. 20]: urges Grandfather Smallweed , pulling out a lean old silver watch with hands like the leg of a skeleton .
Parsing [sent. 8743 len. 27]: `` I told him it was probable I might call upon him between ten and eleven this forenoon , and it 's now half after ten .
Parsing [sent. 8744 len. 12]: Will you come and see the gentleman , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8745 len. 4]: `` Hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8746 len. 4]: says he gravely .
Parsing [sent. 8747 len. 7]: `` I do n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 8748 len. 15]: Though why this should concern you so much , I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 8749 len. 18]: `` Everything concerns me that has a chance in it of bringing anything to light about him .
Parsing [sent. 8750 len. 8]: Did n't he take us all in ?
Parsing [sent. 8751 len. 11]: Did n't he owe us immense sums , all round ?
Parsing [sent. 8752 len. 3]: Concern me ?
Parsing [sent. 8753 len. 10]: Who can anything about him concern more than me ?
Parsing [sent. 8754 len. 24]: Not , my dear friend , '' says Grandfather Smallweed , lowering his tone , `` that I want YOU to betray anything .
Parsing [sent. 8755 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 8756 len. 11]: Are you ready to come , my dear friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8757 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 8758 len. 7]: I 'll come in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8759 len. 8]: I promise nothing , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 8760 len. 11]: `` No , my dear Mr. George ; no . ''
Parsing [sent. 8761 len. 28]: `` And you mean to say you 're going to give me a lift to this place , wherever it is , without charging for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8762 len. 12]: Mr. George inquires , getting his hat and thick wash-leather gloves .
Parsing [sent. 8763 len. 18]: This pleasantry so tickles Mr. Smallweed that he laughs , long and low , before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8764 len. 66]: But ever while he laughs , he glances over his paralytic shoulder at Mr. George and eagerly watches him as he unlocks the padlock of a homely cupboard at the distant end of the gallery , looks here and there upon the higher shelves , and ultimately takes something out with a rustling of paper , folds it , and puts it in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 8765 len. 14]: Then Judy pokes Mr. Smallweed once , and Mr. Smallweed pokes Judy once .
Parsing [sent. 8766 len. 13]: `` I am ready , '' says the trooper , coming back .
Parsing [sent. 8767 len. 20]: `` Phil , you can carry this old gentleman to his coach , and make nothing of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 8768 len. 6]: `` Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 8769 len. 3]: O Lord !
Parsing [sent. 8770 len. 5]: Stop a moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8771 len. 4]: says Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 8772 len. 7]: `` He 's so very prompt !
Parsing [sent. 8773 len. 14]: Are you sure you can do it carefully , my worthy man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8774 len. 47]: Phil makes no reply , but seizing the chair and its load , sidles away , tightly bugged by the now speechless Mr. Smallweed , and bolts along the passage as if he had an acceptable commission to carry the old gentleman to the nearest volcano .
Parsing [sent. 8775 len. 44]: His shorter trust , however , terminating at the cab , he deposits him there ; and the fair Judy takes her place beside him , and the chair embellishes the roof , and Mr. George takes the vacant place upon the box .
Parsing [sent. 8776 len. 74]: Mr. George is quite confounded by the spectacle he beholds from time to time as he peeps into the cab through the window behind him , where the grim Judy is always motionless , and the old gentleman with his cap over one eye is always sliding off the seat into the straw and looking upward at him out of his other eye with a helpless expression of being jolted in the back .
Parsing [sent. 8777 len. 31]: Chapter XXVII -- More Old Soldiers Than One Mr. George has not far to ride with folded arms upon the box , for their destination is Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 8778 len. 33]: When the driver stops his horses , Mr. George alights , and looking in at the window , says , `` What , Mr. Tulkinghorn 's your man , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8779 len. 7]: `` Yes , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 8780 len. 9]: Do you know him , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8781 len. 16]: `` Why , I have heard of him -- seen him too , I think .
Parsing [sent. 8782 len. 15]: But I do n't know him , and he do n't know me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8783 len. 20]: There ensues the carrying of Mr. Smallweed upstairs , which is done to perfection with the trooper 's help .
Parsing [sent. 8784 len. 19]: He is borne into Mr. Tulkinghorn 's great room and deposited on the Turkey rug before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 8785 len. 15]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is not within at the present moment but will be back directly .
Parsing [sent. 8786 len. 25]: The occupant of the pew in the hall , having said thus much , stirs the fire and leaves the triumvirate to warm themselves .
Parsing [sent. 8787 len. 11]: Mr. George is mightily curious in respect of the room .
Parsing [sent. 8788 len. 32]: He looks up at the painted ceiling , looks round at the old law-books , contemplates the portraits of the great clients , reads aloud the names on the boxes . ''
Parsing [sent. 8789 len. 14]: ` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , ' '' Mr. George reads thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 8790 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 8791 len. 7]: ` Manor of Chesney Wold . '
Parsing [sent. 8792 len. 3]: Humph ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8793 len. 41]: Mr. George stands looking at these boxes a long while -- as if they were pictures -- and comes back to the fire repeating , `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and Manor of Chesney Wold , hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8794 len. 11]: `` Worth a mint of money , Mr. George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8795 len. 8]: whispers Grandfather Smallweed , rubbing his legs .
Parsing [sent. 8796 len. 5]: `` Powerfully rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8797 len. 6]: `` Who do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 8798 len. 9]: This old gentleman , or the Baronet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8799 len. 8]: `` This gentleman , this gentleman . ''
Parsing [sent. 8800 len. 19]: `` So I have heard ; and knows a thing or two , I 'll hold a wager .
Parsing [sent. 8801 len. 15]: Not bad quarters , either , '' says Mr. George , looking round again .
Parsing [sent. 8802 len. 7]: `` See the strong-box yonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8803 len. 11]: This reply is cut short by Mr. Tulkinghorn 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 8804 len. 10]: There is no change in him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 8805 len. 17]: Rustily drest , with his spectacles in his hand , and their very case worn threadbare .
Parsing [sent. 8806 len. 7]: In manner , close and dry .
Parsing [sent. 8807 len. 7]: In voice , husky and low .
Parsing [sent. 8808 len. 15]: In face , watchful behind a blind ; habitually not uncensorious and contemptuous perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 8809 len. 21]: The peerage may have warmer worshippers and faithfuller believers than Mr. Tulkinghorn , after all , if everything were known .
Parsing [sent. 8810 len. 11]: `` Good morning , Mr. Smallweed , good morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8811 len. 7]: he says as he comes in .
Parsing [sent. 8812 len. 10]: `` You have brought the sergeant , I see .
Parsing [sent. 8813 len. 6]: Sit down , sergeant . ''
Parsing [sent. 8814 len. 42]: As Mr. Tulkinghorn takes off his gloves and puts them in his hat , he looks with half-closed eyes across the room to where the trooper stands and says within himself perchance , `` You 'll do , my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8815 len. 31]: `` Sit down , sergeant , '' he repeats as he comes to his table , which is set on one side of the fire , and takes his easy-chair .
Parsing [sent. 8816 len. 12]: `` Cold and raw this morning , cold and raw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8817 len. 39]: Mr. Tulkinghorn warms before the bars , alternately , the palms and knuckles of his hands and looks -LRB- from behind that blind which is always down -RRB- at the trio sitting in a little semicircle before him .
Parsing [sent. 8818 len. 26]: `` Now , I can feel what I am about '' -LRB- as perhaps he can in two senses -RRB- , `` Mr. Smallweed . ''
Parsing [sent. 8819 len. 17]: The old gentleman is newly shaken up by Judy to bear his part in the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 8820 len. 14]: `` You have brought our good friend the sergeant , I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 8821 len. 20]: `` Yes , sir , '' returns Mr. Smallweed , very servile to the lawyer 's wealth and influence .
Parsing [sent. 8822 len. 12]: `` And what does the sergeant say about this business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8823 len. 26]: `` Mr. George , '' says Grandfather Smallweed with a tremulous wave of his shrivelled hand , `` this is the gentleman , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8824 len. 35]: Mr. George salutes the gentleman but otherwise sits bolt upright and profoundly silent -- very forward in his chair , as if the full complement of regulation appendages for a field-day hung about him .
Parsing [sent. 8825 len. 17]: Mr. Tulkinghorn proceeds , `` Well , George -- I believe your name is George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8826 len. 8]: `` It is so , Sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8827 len. 9]: `` What do you say , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8828 len. 25]: `` I ask your pardon , sir , '' returns the trooper , `` but I should wish to know what YOU say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8829 len. 10]: `` Do you mean in point of reward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8830 len. 11]: `` I mean in point of everything , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8831 len. 24]: This is so very trying to Mr. Smallweed 's temper that he suddenly breaks out with `` You 're a brimstone beast ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8832 len. 34]: and as suddenly asks pardon of Mr. Tulkinghorn , excusing himself for this slip of the tongue by saying to Judy , `` I was thinking of your grandmother , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 8833 len. 35]: `` I supposed , sergeant , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn resumes as he leans on one side of his chair and crosses his legs , `` that Mr. Smallweed might have sufficiently explained the matter .
Parsing [sent. 8834 len. 9]: It lies in the smallest compass , however .
Parsing [sent. 8835 len. 34]: You served under Captain Hawdon at one time , and were his attendant in illness , and rendered him many little services , and were rather in his confidence , I am told .
Parsing [sent. 8836 len. 9]: That is so , is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8837 len. 17]: `` Yes , sir , that is so , '' says Mr. George with military brevity .
Parsing [sent. 8838 len. 35]: `` Therefore you may happen to have in your possession something -- anything , no matter what ; accounts , instructions , orders , a letter , anything -- in Captain Hawdon 's writing .
Parsing [sent. 8839 len. 12]: I wish to compare his writing with some that I have .
Parsing [sent. 8840 len. 16]: If you can give me the opportunity , you shall be rewarded for your trouble .
Parsing [sent. 8841 len. 18]: Three , four , five , guineas , you would consider handsome , I dare say . ''
Parsing [sent. 8842 len. 8]: `` Noble , my dear friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8843 len. 9]: cries Grandfather Smallweed , screwing up his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 8844 len. 20]: `` If not , say how much more , in your conscience as a soldier , you can demand .
Parsing [sent. 8845 len. 25]: There is no need for you to part with the writing , against your inclination -- though I should prefer to have it . ''
Parsing [sent. 8846 len. 22]: Mr. George sits squared in exactly the same attitude , looks at the painted ceiling , and says never a word .
Parsing [sent. 8847 len. 8]: The irascible Mr. Smallweed scratches the air .
Parsing [sent. 8848 len. 32]: `` The question is , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn in his methodical , subdued , uninterested way , `` first , whether you have any of Captain Hawdon 's writing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8849 len. 20]: `` First , whether I have any of Captain Hawdon 's writing , sir , '' repeats Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8850 len. 15]: `` Secondly , what will satisfy you for the trouble of producing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8851 len. 21]: `` Secondly , what will satisfy me for the trouble of producing it , sir , '' repeats Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8852 len. 32]: `` Thirdly , you can judge for yourself whether it is at all like that , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , suddenly handing him some sheets of written paper tied together .
Parsing [sent. 8853 len. 11]: `` Whether it is at all like that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8854 len. 8]: Just so , '' repeats Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8855 len. 66]: All three repetitions Mr. George pronounces in a mechanical manner , looking straight at Mr. Tulkinghorn ; nor does he so much as glance at the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , that has been given to him for his inspection -LRB- though he still holds it in his hand -RRB- , but continues to look at the lawyer with an air of troubled meditation .
Parsing [sent. 8856 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8857 len. 4]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 8858 len. 7]: `` What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8859 len. 35]: `` Well , sir , '' replies Mr. George , rising erect and looking immense , `` I would rather , if you 'll excuse me , have nothing to do with this . ''
Parsing [sent. 8860 len. 14]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , outwardly quite undisturbed , demands , `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8861 len. 10]: `` Why , sir , '' returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 8862 len. 14]: `` Except on military compulsion , I am not a man of business .
Parsing [sent. 8863 len. 14]: Among civilians I am what they call in Scotland a ne'er - do-weel .
Parsing [sent. 8864 len. 9]: I have no head for papers , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8865 len. 13]: I can stand any fire better than a fire of cross questions .
Parsing [sent. 8866 len. 31]: I mentioned to Mr. Smallweed , only an hour or so ago , that when I come into things of this kind I feel as if I was being smothered .
Parsing [sent. 8867 len. 24]: And that is my sensation , '' says Mr. George , looking round upon the company , `` at the present moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 8868 len. 62]: With that , he takes three strides forward to replace the papers on the lawyer 's table and three strides backward to resume his former station , where he stands perfectly upright , now looking at the ground and now at the painted ceillhg , with his hands behind him as if to prevent himself from accepting any other document whatever .
Parsing [sent. 8869 len. 51]: Under this provocation , Mr. Smallweed 's favourite adjective of disparagement is so close to his tongue that he begins the words `` my dear friend '' with the monosyllable `` brim , '' thus converting the possessive pronoun into brimmy and appearing to have an impediment in his speech .
Parsing [sent. 8870 len. 51]: Once past this difficulty , however , he exhorts his dear friend in the tenderest manner not to be rash , but to do what so eminent a gentleman requires , and to do it with a good grace , confident that it must be unobjectionable as well as profitable .
Parsing [sent. 8871 len. 24]: Mr. Tulkinghorn merely utters an occasional sentence , as , `` You are the best judge of your own interest , sergeant . ''
Parsing [sent. 8872 len. 11]: `` Take care you do no harm by this . ''
Parsing [sent. 8873 len. 8]: `` Please yourself , please yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 8874 len. 14]: `` If you know what you mean , that 's quite enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 8875 len. 25]: These he utters with an appearance of perfect indifference as he looks over the papers on his table and prepares to write a letter .
Parsing [sent. 8876 len. 48]: Mr. George looks distrustfully from the painted ceiling to the ground , from the ground to Mr. Smallweed , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Tulkinghorn , and from Mr. Tulkinghorn to the painted ceiling again , often in his perplexity changing the leg on which he rests .
Parsing [sent. 8877 len. 37]: `` I do assure you , sir , '' says Mr. George , `` not to say it offensively , that between you and Mr. Smallweed here , I really am being smothered fifty times over .
Parsing [sent. 8878 len. 6]: I really am , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8879 len. 9]: I am not a match for you gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 8880 len. 29]: Will you allow me to ask why you want to see the captain 's hand , in the case that I could find any specimen of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8881 len. 7]: Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 8882 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 8883 len. 40]: If you were a man of business , sergeant , you would not need to be informed that there are confidential reasons , very harmless in themselves , for many such wants in the profession to which I belong .
Parsing [sent. 8884 len. 24]: But if you are afraid of doing any injury to Captain Hawdon , you may set your mind at rest about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 8885 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 8886 len. 7]: He is dead , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 8887 len. 5]: `` IS he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8888 len. 8]: Mr. Tulkinghorn quietly sits down to write .
Parsing [sent. 8889 len. 31]: `` Well , sir , '' says the trooper , looking into his hat after another disconcerted pause , `` I am sorry not to have given you more satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 8890 len. 58]: If it would be any satisfaction to any one that I should be confirmed in my judgment that I would rather have nothing to do with this by a friend of mine who has a better head for business than I have , and who is an old soldier , I am willing to consult with him .
Parsing [sent. 8891 len. 42]: I -- I really am so completely smothered myself at present , '' says Mr. George , passing his hand hopelessly across his brow , `` that I do n't know but what it might be a satisfaction to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 8892 len. 51]: Mr. Smallweed , hearing that this authority is an old soldier , so strongly inculcates the expediency of the trooper 's taking counsel with him , and particularly informing him of its being a question of five guineas or more , that Mr. George engages to go and see him .
Parsing [sent. 8893 len. 7]: Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing either way .
Parsing [sent. 8894 len. 42]: `` I 'll consult my friend , then , by your leave , sir , '' says the trooper , `` and I 'll take the liberty of looking in again with the final answer in the course of the day .
Parsing [sent. 8895 len. 25]: Mr. Smallweed , if you wish to be carried downstairs -- '' `` In a moment , my dear friend , in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 8896 len. 16]: Will you first let me speak half a word with this gentleman in private ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8897 len. 5]: `` Certainly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8898 len. 9]: Do n't hurry yourself on my account . ''
Parsing [sent. 8899 len. 23]: The trooper retires to a distant part of the room and resumes his curious inspection of the boxes , strong and otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 8900 len. 54]: `` If I was n't as weak as a brimstone baby , sir , '' whispers Grandfather Smallweed , drawing the lawyer down to his level by the lapel of his coat and flashing some half-quenched green fire out of his angry eyes , `` I 'd tear the writing away from him .
Parsing [sent. 8901 len. 9]: He 's got it buttoned in his breast .
Parsing [sent. 8902 len. 7]: I saw him put it there .
Parsing [sent. 8903 len. 7]: Judy saw him put it there .
Parsing [sent. 8904 len. 26]: Speak up , you crabbed image for the sign of a walking -- stick shop , and say you saw him put it there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8905 len. 49]: This vehement conjuration the old gentleman accompanies with such a thrust at his granddaughter that it is too much for his strength , and he slips away out of his chair , drawing Mr. Tulkinghorn with him , until he is arrested by Judy , and well shaken .
Parsing [sent. 8906 len. 18]: `` Violence will not do for me , my friend , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn then remarks coolly .
Parsing [sent. 8907 len. 13]: `` No , no , I know , I know , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8908 len. 51]: But it 's chafing and galling -- it 's -- it 's worse than your smattering chattering magpie of a grandmother , '' to the imperturbable Judy , who only looks at the fire , `` to know he has got what 's wanted and wo n't give it up .
Parsing [sent. 8909 len. 8]: He , not to give it up !
Parsing [sent. 8910 len. 2]: HE !
Parsing [sent. 8911 len. 3]: A vagabond !
Parsing [sent. 8912 len. 9]: But never mind , sir , never mind .
Parsing [sent. 8913 len. 15]: At the most , he has only his own way for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 8914 len. 8]: I have him periodically in a vice .
Parsing [sent. 8915 len. 7]: I 'll twist him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8916 len. 7]: I 'll screw him , sir .
Parsing [sent. 8917 len. 24]: If he wo n't do it with a good grace , I 'll make him do it with a bad one , sir !
Parsing [sent. 8918 len. 36]: Now , my dear Mr. George , '' says Grandfather Smallweed , winking at the lawyer hideously as he releases him , `` I am ready for your kind assistance , my excellent friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8919 len. 44]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , with some shadowy sign of amusement manifesting itself through his self-possession , stands on the hearth-rug with his back to the fire , watching the disappearance of Mr. Smallweed and acknowledging the trooper 's parting salute with one slight nod .
Parsing [sent. 8920 len. 89]: It is more difficult to get rid of the old gentleman , Mr. George finds , than to bear a hand in carrying him downstairs , for when he is replaced in his conveyance , he is so loquacious on the subject of the guineas and retains such an affectionate hold of his button -- having , in truth , a secret longing to rip his coat open and rob him -- that some degree of force is necessary on the trooper 's part to effect a separation .
Parsing [sent. 8921 len. 16]: It is accomplished at last , and he proceeds alone in quest of his adviser .
Parsing [sent. 8922 len. 107]: By the cloisterly Temple , and by Whitefriars -LRB- there , not without a glance at Hanging -- Sword Alley , which would seem to be something in his way -RRB- , and by Blackfriars Bridge , and Blackfriars Road , Mr. George sedately marches to a street of little shops lying somewhere in that ganglion of roads from Kent and Surrey , and of streets from the bridges of London , centring in the far-famed elephant who has lost his castle formed of a thousand four-horse coaches to a stronger iron monster than he , ready to chop him into mince-meat any day he dares .
Parsing [sent. 8923 len. 52]: To one of the little shops in this street , which is a musician 's shop , having a few fiddles in the window , and some Pan 's pipes and a tambourine , and a triangle , and certain elongated scraps of music , Mr. George directs his massive tread .
Parsing [sent. 8924 len. 62]: And halting at a few paces from it , as he sees a soldierly looking woman , with her outer skirts tucked up , come forth with a small wooden tub , and in that tub commence a-whisking and a-splashing on the margin of the pavement , Mr. George says to himself , `` She 's as usual , washing greens .
Parsing [sent. 8925 len. 18]: I never saw her , except upon a baggage-waggon , when she was n't washing greens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8926 len. 52]: The subject of this reflection is at all events so occupied in washing greens at present that she remains unsuspicious of Mr. George 's approach until , lifting up herself and her tub together when she has poured the water off into the gutter , she finds him standing near her .
Parsing [sent. 8927 len. 8]: Her reception of him is not flattering .
Parsing [sent. 8928 len. 18]: `` George , I never see you but I wish you was a hundred mile away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8929 len. 40]: The trooper , without remarking on this welcome , follows into the musical-instrument shop , where the lady places her tub of greens upon the counter , and having shaken hands with him , rests her arms upon it .
Parsing [sent. 8930 len. 23]: `` I never , '' she says , `` George , consider Matthew Bagnet safe a minute when you 're near him .
Parsing [sent. 8931 len. 12]: You are that resfless and that roving -- '' `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 8932 len. 8]: I know I am , Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 8933 len. 6]: I know I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 8934 len. 7]: `` You know you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8935 len. 4]: says Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 8936 len. 8]: `` What 's the use of that ?
Parsing [sent. 8937 len. 5]: WHY are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8938 len. 16]: `` The nature of the animal , I suppose , '' returns the trooper good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 8939 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8940 len. 7]: cries Mrs. Bagnet , something shrilly .
Parsing [sent. 8941 len. 33]: `` But what satisfaction will the nature of the animal be to me when the animal shall have tempted my Mat away from the musical business to New Zealand or Australey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8942 len. 10]: Mrs. Bagnet is not at all an ill-looking woman .
Parsing [sent. 8943 len. 34]: Rather large-boned , a little coarse in the grain , and freckled by the sun and wind which have tanned her hair upon the forehead , but healthy , wholesome , and bright-eyed .
Parsing [sent. 8944 len. 15]: A strong , busy , active , honest-faced woman of from forty-five to fifty .
Parsing [sent. 8945 len. 62]: Clean , hardy , and so economically dressed -LRB- though substantially -RRB- that the only article of ornament of which she stands possessed appear 's to be her wedding-ring , around which her finger has grown to be so large since it was put on that it will never come off again until it shall mingle with Mrs. Bagnet 's dust .
Parsing [sent. 8946 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Bagnet , '' says the trooper , `` I am on my parole with you .
Parsing [sent. 8947 len. 8]: Mat will get no harm from me .
Parsing [sent. 8948 len. 8]: You may trust me so far . ''
Parsing [sent. 8949 len. 8]: `` Well , I think I may .
Parsing [sent. 8950 len. 14]: But the very looks of you are unsettling , '' Mrs. Bagnet rejoins .
Parsing [sent. 8951 len. 7]: `` Ah , George , George !
Parsing [sent. 8952 len. 29]: If you had only settled down and married Joe Pouch 's widow when he died in North America , SHE 'D have combed your hair for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 8953 len. 33]: `` It was a chance for me , certainly , '' returns the trooper half laughingly , half seriously , `` but I shall never settle down into a respectable man now .
Parsing [sent. 8954 len. 32]: Joe Pouch 's widow might have done me good -- there was something in her , and something of her -- but I could n't make up my mind to it .
Parsing [sent. 8955 len. 17]: If I had had the luck to meet with such a wife as Mat found ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8956 len. 61]: Mrs. Bagnet , who seems in a virtuous way to be under little reserve with a good sort of fellow , but to be another good sort of fellow herself for that matter , receives this compliment by flicking Mr. George in the face with a head of greens and taking her tub into the little room behind the shop .
Parsing [sent. 8957 len. 21]: `` Why , Quebec , my poppet , '' says George , following , on invitation , into that department .
Parsing [sent. 8958 len. 7]: `` And little Malta , too !
Parsing [sent. 8959 len. 7]: Come and kiss your Bluffy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8960 len. 78]: These young ladies -- not supposed to have been actually christened by the names applied to them , though always so called in the family from the places of their birth in barracks -- are respectively employed on three-legged stools , the younger -LRB- some five or six years old -RRB- in learning her letters out of a penny primer , the elder -LRB- eight or nine perhaps -RRB- in teaching her and sewing with great assiduity .
Parsing [sent. 8961 len. 22]: Both hail Mr. George with acclamations as an old friend and after some kissing and romping plant their stools beside him .
Parsing [sent. 8962 len. 8]: `` And how 's young Woolwich ? ''
Parsing [sent. 8963 len. 4]: says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8964 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 8965 len. 4]: There now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8966 len. 24]: cries Mrs. Bagnet , turning about from her saucepans -LRB- for she is cooking dinner -RRB- with a bright flush on her face .
Parsing [sent. 8967 len. 6]: `` Would you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 8968 len. 21]: Got an engagement at the theayter , with his father , to play the fife in a military piece . ''
Parsing [sent. 8969 len. 8]: `` Well done , my godson ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8970 len. 8]: cries Mr. George , slapping his thigh .
Parsing [sent. 8971 len. 6]: `` I believe you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8972 len. 4]: says Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 8973 len. 6]: `` He 's a Briton .
Parsing [sent. 8974 len. 6]: That 's what Woolwich is .
Parsing [sent. 8975 len. 4]: A Briton ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8976 len. 23]: `` And Mat blows away at his bassoon , and you 're respectable civilians one and all , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 8977 len. 4]: `` Family people .
Parsing [sent. 8978 len. 4]: Children growing up .
Parsing [sent. 8979 len. 28]: Mat 's old mother in Scotland , and your old father somewhere else , corresponded with , and helped a little , and -- well , well !
Parsing [sent. 8980 len. 31]: To be sure , I do n't know why I should n't be wished a hundred mile away , for I have not much to do with all this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8981 len. 84]: Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting before the fire in the whitewashed room , which has a sanded floor and a barrack smell and contains nothing superfluous and has not a visible speck of dirt or dust in it , from the faces of Quebec and Malta to the bright tin pots and pannikins upon the dresser shelves -- Mr. George is becoming thoughtful , sitting here while Mrs. Bagnet is busy , when Mr. Bagnet and young Woolwich opportunely come home .
Parsing [sent. 8982 len. 34]: Mr. Bagnet is an ex-artilleryman , tall and upright , with shaggy eyebrows and whiskers like the fibres of a coco-nut , not a hair upon his head , and a torrid complexion .
Parsing [sent. 8983 len. 26]: His voice , short , deep , and resonant , is not at all unlike the tones of the instrument to which he is devoted .
Parsing [sent. 8984 len. 28]: Indeed there may be generally observed in him an unbending , unyielding , brass-bound air , as if he were himself the bassoon of the human orchestra .
Parsing [sent. 8985 len. 12]: Young Woolwich is the type and model of a young drummer .
Parsing [sent. 8986 len. 9]: Both father and son salute the trooper heartily .
Parsing [sent. 8987 len. 50]: He saying , in due season , that he has come to advise with Mr. Bagnet , Mr. Bagnet hospitably declares that he will hear of no business until after dinner and that his friend shall not partake of his counsel without first partaking of boiled pork and greens .
Parsing [sent. 8988 len. 49]: The trooper yielding to this invitation , he and Mr. Bagnet , not to embarrass the domestic preparations , go forth to take a turn up and down the little street , which they promenade with measured tread and folded arms , as if it were a rampart .
Parsing [sent. 8989 len. 8]: `` George , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 8990 len. 5]: `` You know me .
Parsing [sent. 8991 len. 8]: It 's my old girl that advises .
Parsing [sent. 8992 len. 5]: She has the head .
Parsing [sent. 8993 len. 9]: But I never own to it before her .
Parsing [sent. 8994 len. 5]: Discipline must be maintained .
Parsing [sent. 8995 len. 9]: Wait till the greens is off her mind .
Parsing [sent. 8996 len. 5]: Then we 'll consult .
Parsing [sent. 8997 len. 12]: Whatever the old girl says , do -- do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8998 len. 12]: `` I intend to , Mat , '' replies the other .
Parsing [sent. 8999 len. 14]: `` I would sooner take her opinion than that of a college . ''
Parsing [sent. 9000 len. 13]: `` College , '' returns Mr. Bagnet in short sentences , bassoon-like .
Parsing [sent. 9001 len. 32]: `` What college could you leave -- in another quarter of the world -- with nothing but a grey cloak and an umbrella -- to make its way home to Europe ?
Parsing [sent. 9002 len. 8]: The old girl would do it to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 9003 len. 5]: Did it once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9004 len. 10]: `` You are right , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 9005 len. 53]: `` What college , '' pursues Bagnet , `` could you set up in life -- with two penn ` orth of white lime -- a penn ` orth of fuller 's earth -- a ha ` porth of sand -- and the rest of the change out of sixpence in money ?
Parsing [sent. 9006 len. 9]: That 's what the old girl started on .
Parsing [sent. 9007 len. 6]: In the present business . ''
Parsing [sent. 9008 len. 13]: `` I am rejoiced to hear it 's thriving , Mat . ''
Parsing [sent. 9009 len. 15]: `` The old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet , acquiescing , `` saves .
Parsing [sent. 9010 len. 5]: Has a stocking somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9011 len. 5]: With money in it .
Parsing [sent. 9012 len. 5]: I never saw it .
Parsing [sent. 9013 len. 8]: But I know she 's got it .
Parsing [sent. 9014 len. 9]: Wait till the greens is off her mind .
Parsing [sent. 9015 len. 8]: Then she 'll set you up . ''
Parsing [sent. 9016 len. 7]: `` She is a treasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9017 len. 4]: exclaims Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 9018 len. 5]: `` She 's more .
Parsing [sent. 9019 len. 9]: But I never own to it before her .
Parsing [sent. 9020 len. 5]: Discipline must be maintained .
Parsing [sent. 9021 len. 12]: It was the old girl that brought out my musical abilities .
Parsing [sent. 9022 len. 14]: I should have been in the artillery now but for the old girl .
Parsing [sent. 9023 len. 8]: Six years I hammered at the fiddle .
Parsing [sent. 9024 len. 5]: Ten at the flute .
Parsing [sent. 9025 len. 21]: The old girl said it would n't do ; intention good , but want of flexibility ; try the bassoon .
Parsing [sent. 9026 len. 14]: The old girl borrowed a bassoon from the bandmaster of the Rifle Regiment .
Parsing [sent. 9027 len. 6]: I practised in the trenches .
Parsing [sent. 9028 len. 13]: Got on , got another , get a living by it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9029 len. 17]: George remarks that she looks as fresh as a rose and as sound as an apple .
Parsing [sent. 9030 len. 19]: `` The old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet in reply , `` is a thoroughly fine woman .
Parsing [sent. 9031 len. 9]: Consequently she is like a thoroughly fine day .
Parsing [sent. 9032 len. 7]: Gets finer as she gets on .
Parsing [sent. 9033 len. 9]: I never saw the old girl 's equal .
Parsing [sent. 9034 len. 9]: But I never own to it before her .
Parsing [sent. 9035 len. 6]: Discipline must be maintained ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9036 len. 51]: Proceeding to converse on indifferent matters , they walk up and down the little street , keeping step and time , until summoned by Quebec and Malta to do justice to the pork and greens , over which Mrs. Bagnet , like a military chaplain , says a short grace .
Parsing [sent. 9037 len. 54]: In the distribution of these comestibles , as in every other household duty , Mrs. Bagnet developes an exact system , sitting with every dish before her , allotting to every portion of pork its own portion of pot-liquor , greens , potatoes , and even mustard , and serving it out complete .
Parsing [sent. 9038 len. 35]: Having likewise served out the beer from a can and thus supplied the mess with all things necessary , Mrs. Bagnet proceeds to satisfy her own hunger , which is in a healthy state .
Parsing [sent. 9039 len. 35]: The kit of the mess , if the table furniture may be so denominated , is chiefly composed of utensils of horn and tin that have done duty in several parts of the world .
Parsing [sent. 9040 len. 49]: Young Woolwich 's knife , in particular , which is of the oyster kind , with the additional feature of a strong shutting-up movement which frequently balks the appetite of that young musician , is mentioned as having gone in various hands the complete round of foreign service .
Parsing [sent. 9041 len. 67]: The dinner done , Mrs. Bagnet , assisted by the younger branches -LRB- who polish their own cups and platters , knives and forks -RRB- , makes all the dinner garniture shine as brightly as before and puts it all away , first sweeping the hearth , to the end that Mr. Bagnet and the visitor may not be retarded in the smoking of their pipes .
Parsing [sent. 9042 len. 34]: These household cares involve much pattening and counter-pattening in the backyard and considerable use of a pail , which is finally so happy as to assist in the ablutions of Mrs. Bagnet herself .
Parsing [sent. 9043 len. 47]: That old girl reappearing by and by , quite fresh , and sitting down to her needlework , then and only then -- the greens being only then to be considered as entirely off her mind -- Mr. Bagnet requests the trooper to state his case .
Parsing [sent. 9044 len. 34]: This Mr. George does with great discretion , appearing to address himself to Mr. Bagnet , but having an eye solely on the old girl all the time , as Bagnet has himself .
Parsing [sent. 9045 len. 11]: She , equally discreet , busies herself with her needlework .
Parsing [sent. 9046 len. 18]: The case fully stated , Mr. Bagnet resorts to his standard artifice for the maintenance of discipline .
Parsing [sent. 9047 len. 14]: `` That 's the whole of it , is it , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9048 len. 3]: says he .
Parsing [sent. 9049 len. 9]: `` That 's the whole of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9050 len. 9]: `` You act according to my opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9051 len. 16]: `` I shall be guided , '' replies George , `` entirely by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9052 len. 15]: `` Old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet , `` give him my opinion .
Parsing [sent. 9053 len. 4]: You know it .
Parsing [sent. 9054 len. 7]: Tell him what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 9055 len. 70]: It is that he can not have too little to do with people who are too deep for him and can not be too careful of interference with matters he does not understand -- that the plain rule is to do nothing in the dark , to be a party to nothing underhanded or mysterious , and never to put his foot where he can not see the ground .
Parsing [sent. 9056 len. 69]: This , in effect , is Mr. Bagnet 's opinion , as delivered through the old girl , and it so relieves Mr. George 's mind by confirming his own opinion and banishing his doubts that he composes himself to smoke another pipe on that exceptional occasion and to have a talk over old times with the whole Bagnet family , according to their various ranges of experience .
Parsing [sent. 9057 len. 102]: Through these means it comes to pass that Mr. George does not again rise to his full height in that parlour until the time is drawing on when the bassoon and fife are expected by a British public at the theatre ; and as it takes time even then for Mr. George , in his domestic character of Bluffy , to take leave of Quebec and Malta and insinuate a sponsorial shilling into the pocket of his godson with felicitations on his success in life , it is dark when Mr. George again turns his face towards Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 9058 len. 27]: `` A family home , '' he ruminates as he marches along , `` however small it is , makes a man like me look lonely .
Parsing [sent. 9059 len. 12]: But it 's well I never made that evolution of matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 9060 len. 9]: I should n't have been fit for it .
Parsing [sent. 9061 len. 43]: I am such a vagabond still , even at my present time of life , that I could n't hold to the gallery a month together if it was a regular pursuit or if I did n't camp there , gipsy fashion .
Parsing [sent. 9062 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 9063 len. 11]: I disgrace nobody and cumber nobody ; that 's something .
Parsing [sent. 9064 len. 12]: I have not done that for many a long year ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9065 len. 9]: So he whistles it off and marches on .
Parsing [sent. 9066 len. 84]: Arrived in Lincoln 's Inn Fields and mounting Mr. Tulkinghorn 's stair , he finds the outer door closed and the chambers shut , but the trooper not knowing much about outer doors , and the staircase being dark besides , he is yet fumbling and groping about , hoping to discover a bell-handle or to open the door for himself , when Mr. Tulkinghorn comes up the stairs -LRB- quietly , of course -RRB- and angrily asks , `` Who is that ?
Parsing [sent. 9067 len. 7]: What are you doing there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9068 len. 8]: `` I ask your pardon , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9069 len. 4]: It 's George .
Parsing [sent. 9070 len. 4]: The sergeant . ''
Parsing [sent. 9071 len. 17]: `` And could n't George , the sergeant , see that my door was locked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9072 len. 11]: `` Why , no , sir , I could n't .
Parsing [sent. 9073 len. 16]: At any rate , I did n't , '' says the trooper , rather nettled .
Parsing [sent. 9074 len. 7]: `` Have you changed your mind ?
Parsing [sent. 9075 len. 9]: Or are you in the same mind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9076 len. 4]: Mr. Tulkinghorn demands .
Parsing [sent. 9077 len. 9]: But he knows well enough at a glance .
Parsing [sent. 9078 len. 9]: `` In the same mind , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 9079 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 9080 len. 4]: That 's sufficient .
Parsing [sent. 9081 len. 4]: You can go .
Parsing [sent. 9082 len. 28]: So you are the man , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , opening his door with the key , `` in whose hiding-place Mr. Gridley was found ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9083 len. 20]: `` Yes , I AM the man , '' says the trooper , stopping two or three stairs down .
Parsing [sent. 9084 len. 7]: `` What then , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9085 len. 4]: `` What then ?
Parsing [sent. 9086 len. 7]: I do n't like your associates .
Parsing [sent. 9087 len. 22]: You should not have seen the inside of my door this morning if I had thought of your being that man .
Parsing [sent. 9088 len. 2]: Gridley ?
Parsing [sent. 9089 len. 9]: A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 9090 len. 28]: With these words , spoken in an unusually high tone for him , the lawyer goes into his rooms and shuts the door with a thundering noise .
Parsing [sent. 9091 len. 32]: Mr. George takes his dismissal in great dudgeon , the greater because a clerk coming up the stairs has heard the last words of all and evidently applies them to him .
Parsing [sent. 9092 len. 20]: `` A pretty character to bear , '' the trooper growls with a hasty oath as he strides downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 9093 len. 10]: `` A threatening , murderous , dangerous fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9094 len. 21]: And looking up , he sees the clerk looking down at him and marking him as he passes a lamp .
Parsing [sent. 9095 len. 16]: This so intensifies his dudgeon that for five minutes he is in an ill humour .
Parsing [sent. 9096 len. 18]: But he whistles that off like the rest of it and marches home to the shooting gallery .
Parsing [sent. 9097 len. 44]: Chapter XXVIII -- The Ironmaster Sir Leicester Dedlock has got the better , for the time being , of the family gout and is once more , in a literal no less than in a figurative point of view , upon his legs .
Parsing [sent. 9098 len. 41]: He is at his place in Lincolnshire ; but the waters are out again on the low-lying grounds , and the cold and damp steal into Chesney Wold , though well defended , and eke into Sir Leicester 's bones .
Parsing [sent. 9099 len. 45]: The blazing fires of faggot and coal -- Dedlock timber and antediluvian forest -- that blaze upon the broad wide hearths and wink in the twilight on the frowning woods , sullen to see how trees are sacrificed , do not exclude the enemy .
Parsing [sent. 9100 len. 37]: The hot-water pipes that trail themselves all over the house , the cushioned doors and windows , and the screens and curtains fail to supply the fires ' deficiencies and to satisfy Sir Leicester 's need .
Parsing [sent. 9101 len. 26]: Hence the fashionable intelligence proclaims one morning to the listening earth that Lady Dedlock is expected shortly to return to town for a few weeks .
Parsing [sent. 9102 len. 14]: It is a melancholy truth that even great men have their poor relations .
Parsing [sent. 9103 len. 38]: Indeed great men have often more than their fair share of poor relations , inasmuch as very red blood of the superior quality , like inferior blood unlawfully shed , WILL cry aloud and WILL be heard .
Parsing [sent. 9104 len. 24]: Sir Leicester 's cousins , in the remotest degree , are so many murders in the respect that they `` will out . ''
Parsing [sent. 9105 len. 52]: Among whom there are cousins who are so poor that one might almost dare to think it would have been the happier for them never to have been plated links upon the Dedlock chain of gold , but to have been made of common iron at first and done base service .
Parsing [sent. 9106 len. 27]: Service , however -LRB- with a few limited reservations , genteel but not profitable -RRB- , they may not do , being of the Dedlock dignity .
Parsing [sent. 9107 len. 63]: So they visit their richer cousins , and get into debt when they can , and live but shabbily when they ca n't , and find -- the women no husbands , and the men no wives -- and ride in borrowed carriages , and sit at feasts that are never of their own making , and so go through high life .
Parsing [sent. 9108 len. 26]: The rich family sum has been divided by so many figures , and they are the something over that nobody knows what to do with .
Parsing [sent. 9109 len. 26]: Everybody on Sir Leicester Dedlock 's side of the question and of his way of thinking would appear to be his cousin more or less .
Parsing [sent. 9110 len. 29]: From my Lord Boodle , through the Duke of Foodle , down to Noodle , Sir Leicester , like a glorious spider , stretches his threads of relationship .
Parsing [sent. 9111 len. 64]: But while he is stately in the cousinship of the Everybodys , he is a kind and generous man , according to his dignified way , in the cousinship of the Nobodys ; and at the present time , in despite of the damp , he stays out the visit of several such cousins at Chesney Wold with the constancy of a martyr .
Parsing [sent. 9112 len. 45]: Of these , foremost in the front rank stands Volumnia Dedlock , a young lady -LRB- of sixty -RRB- who is doubly highly related , having the honour to be a poor relation , by the mother 's side , to another great family .
Parsing [sent. 9113 len. 55]: Miss Volumnia , displaying in early life a pretty talent for cutting ornaments out of coloured paper , and also for singing to the guitar in the Spanish tongue , and propounding French conundrums in country houses , passed the twenty years of her existence between twenty and forty in a sufficiently agreeable manner .
Parsing [sent. 9114 len. 50]: Lapsing then out of date and being considered to bore mankind by her vocal performances in the Spanish language , she retired to Bath , where she lives slenderly on an annual present from Sir Leicester and whence she makes occasional resurrections in the country houses of her cousins .
Parsing [sent. 9115 len. 28]: She has an extensive acquaintance at Bath among appalling old gentlemen with thin legs and nankeen trousers , and is of high standing in that dreary city .
Parsing [sent. 9116 len. 35]: But she is a little dreaded elsewhere in consequence of an indiscreet profusion in the article of rouge and persistency in an obsolete pearl necklace like a rosary of little bird 's - eggs .
Parsing [sent. 9117 len. 19]: In any country in a wholesome state , Volumnia would be a clear case for the pension list .
Parsing [sent. 9118 len. 36]: Efforts have been made to get her on it , and when William Buffy came in , it was fully expected that her name would be put down for a couple of hundred a year .
Parsing [sent. 9119 len. 45]: But William Buffy somehow discovered , contrary to all expectation , that these were not the times when it could be done , and this was the first clear indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 9120 len. 29]: There is likewise the Honourable Bob Stables , who can make warm mashes with the skill of a veterinary surgeon and is a better shot than most gamekeepers .
Parsing [sent. 9121 len. 26]: He has been for some time particularly desirous to serve his country in a post of good emoluments , unaccompanied by any trouble or responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 9122 len. 71]: In a well -- regulated body politic this natural desire on the part of a spirited young gentleman so highly connected would be speedily recognized , but somehow William Buffy found when he came in that these were not times in which he could manage that little matter either , and this was the second indication Sir Leicester Dedlock had conveyed to him that the country was going to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 9123 len. 86]: The rest of the cousins are ladies and gentlemen of various ages and capacities , the major part amiable and sensible and likely to have done well enough in life if they could have overcome their cousinship ; as it is , they are almost all a little worsted by it , and lounge in purposeless and listless paths , and seem to be quite as much at a loss how to dispose of themselves as anybody else can be how to dispose of them .
Parsing [sent. 9124 len. 14]: In this society , and where not , my Lady Dedlock reigns supreme .
Parsing [sent. 9125 len. 54]: Beautiful , elegant , accomplished , and powerful in her little world -LRB- for the world of fashion does not stretch ALL the way from pole to pole -RRB- , her influence in Sir Leicester 's house , however haughty and indifferent her manner , is greatly to improve it and refine it .
Parsing [sent. 9126 len. 52]: The cousins , even those older cousins who were paralysed when Sir Leicester married her , do her feudal homage ; and the Honourable Bob Stables daily repeats to some chosen person between breakfast and lunch his favourite original remark , that she is the best-groomed woman in the whole stud .
Parsing [sent. 9127 len. 41]: Such the guests in the long drawing-room at Chesney Wold this dismal night when the step on the Ghost 's Walk -LRB- inaudible here , however -RRB- might be the step of a deceased cousin shut out in the cold .
Parsing [sent. 9128 len. 5]: It is near bed-time .
Parsing [sent. 9129 len. 19]: Bedroom fires blaze brightly all over the house , raising ghosts of grim furniture on wall and ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 9130 len. 17]: Bedroom candlesticks bristle on the distant table by the door , and cousins yawn on ottomans .
Parsing [sent. 9131 len. 23]: Cousins at the piano , cousins at the soda-water tray , cousins rising from the card-table , cousins gathered round the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9132 len. 19]: Standing on one side of his own peculiar fire -LRB- for there are two -RRB- , Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 9133 len. 15]: On the opposite side of the broad hearth , my Lady at her table .
Parsing [sent. 9134 len. 17]: Volumnia , as one of the more privileged cousins , in a luxurious chair between them .
Parsing [sent. 9135 len. 16]: Sir Leicester glancing , with magnificent displeasure , at the rouge and the pearl necklace .
Parsing [sent. 9136 len. 52]: `` I occasionally meet on my staircase here , '' drawls Volumnia , whose thoughts perhaps are already hopping up it to bed , after a long evening of very desultory talk , `` one of the prettiest girls , I think , that I ever saw in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 9137 len. 13]: `` A PROTEGEE of my Lady 's , '' observes Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 9138 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 9139 len. 14]: I felt sure that some uncommon eye must have picked that girl out .
Parsing [sent. 9140 len. 6]: She really is a marvel .
Parsing [sent. 9141 len. 32]: A dolly sort of beauty perhaps , '' says Miss Volumnia , reserving her own sort , `` but in its way , perfect ; such bloom I never saw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9142 len. 19]: Sir Leicester , with his magnificent glance of displeasure at the rouge , appears to say so too .
Parsing [sent. 9143 len. 30]: `` Indeed , '' remarks my Lady languidly , `` if there is any uncommon eye in the case , it is Mrs. Rouncewell 's , and not mine .
Parsing [sent. 9144 len. 6]: Rosa is her discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 9145 len. 8]: `` Your maid , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9146 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 9147 len. 16]: My anything ; pet -- secretary -- messenger -- I do n't know what . ''
Parsing [sent. 9148 len. 47]: `` You like to have her about you , as you would like to have a flower , or a bird , or a picture , or a poodle -- no , not a poodle , though -- or anything else that was equally pretty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9149 len. 5]: says Volumnia , sympathizing .
Parsing [sent. 9150 len. 7]: `` Yes , how charming now !
Parsing [sent. 9151 len. 12]: And how well that delightful old soul Mrs. Rouncewell is looking .
Parsing [sent. 9152 len. 16]: She must be an immense age , and yet she is as active and handsome !
Parsing [sent. 9153 len. 11]: She is the dearest friend I have , positively ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9154 len. 21]: Sir Leicester feels it to be right and fitting that the housekeeper of Chesney Wold should be a remarkable person .
Parsing [sent. 9155 len. 19]: Apart from that , he has a real regard for Mrs. Rouncewell and likes to hear her praised .
Parsing [sent. 9156 len. 20]: So he says , `` You are right , Volumnia , '' which Volumnia is extremely glad to hear .
Parsing [sent. 9157 len. 13]: `` She has no daughter of her own , has she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9158 len. 4]: `` Mrs. Rouncewell ?
Parsing [sent. 9159 len. 4]: No , Volumnia .
Parsing [sent. 9160 len. 5]: She has a son .
Parsing [sent. 9161 len. 7]: Indeed , she had two . ''
Parsing [sent. 9162 len. 28]: My Lady , whose chronic malady of boredom has been sadly aggravated by Volumnia this evening , glances wearily towards the candlesticks and heaves a noiseless sigh .
Parsing [sent. 9163 len. 66]: `` And it is a remarkable example of the confusion into which the present age has fallen ; of the obliteration of landmarks , the opening of floodgates , and the uprooting of distinctions , '' says Sir Leicester with stately gloom , `` that I have been informed by Mr. Tulkinghorn that Mrs. Rouncewell 's son has been invited to go into Parliament . ''
Parsing [sent. 9164 len. 8]: Miss Volumnia utters a little sharp scream .
Parsing [sent. 9165 len. 10]: `` Yes , indeed , '' repeats Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 9166 len. 5]: `` Into Parliament . ''
Parsing [sent. 9167 len. 9]: `` I never heard of such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 9168 len. 9]: Good gracious , what is the man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9169 len. 3]: exclaims Volumnia .
Parsing [sent. 9170 len. 13]: `` He is called , I believe -- an -- ironmaster . ''
Parsing [sent. 9171 len. 42]: Sir Leicester says it slowly and with gravity and doubt , as not being sure but that he is called a lead-mistress or that the right word may be some other word expressive of some other relationship to some other metal .
Parsing [sent. 9172 len. 6]: Volumnia utters another little scream .
Parsing [sent. 9173 len. 24]: `` He has declined the proposal , if my information from Mr. Tulkinghorn be correct , as I have no doubt it is .
Parsing [sent. 9174 len. 43]: Mr. Tulkinghorn being always correct and exact ; still that does not , '' says Sir Leicester , `` that does not lessen the anomaly , which is fraught with strange considerations -- startling considerations , as it appears to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9175 len. 32]: Miss Volumnia rising with a look candlestick-wards , Sir Leicester politely performs the grand tour of the drawing-room , brings one , and lights it at my Lady 's shaded lamp .
Parsing [sent. 9176 len. 92]: `` I must beg you , my Lady , '' he says while doing so , `` to remain a few moments , for this individual of whom I speak arrived this evening shortly before dinner and requested in a very becoming note '' -- Sir Leicester , with his habitual regard to truth , dwells upon it -- `` I am bound to say , in a very becoming and well-expressed note , the favour of a short interview with yourself and MYself on the subject of this young girl .
Parsing [sent. 9177 len. 21]: As it appeared that he wished to depart to-night , I replied that we would see him before retiring . ''
Parsing [sent. 9178 len. 17]: Miss Volumnia with a third little scream takes flight , wishing her hosts -- O Lud !
Parsing [sent. 9179 len. 10]: -- well rid of the -- what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 9180 len. 3]: -- ironmaster !
Parsing [sent. 9181 len. 12]: The other cousins soon disperse , to the last cousin there .
Parsing [sent. 9182 len. 29]: Sir Leicester rings the bell , `` Make my compliments to Mr. Rouncewell , in the housekeeper 's apartments , and say I can receive him now . ''
Parsing [sent. 9183 len. 22]: My Lady , who has beard all this with slight attention outwardly , looks towards Mr. Rouncewell as he comes in .
Parsing [sent. 9184 len. 41]: He is a little over fifty perhaps , of a good figure , like his mother , and has a clear voice , a broad forehead from which his dark hair has retired , and a shrewd though open face .
Parsing [sent. 9185 len. 17]: He is a responsible-looking gentleman dressed in black , portly enough , but strong and active .
Parsing [sent. 9186 len. 23]: Has a perfectly natural and easy air and is not in the least embarrassed by the great presence into which he comes .
Parsing [sent. 9187 len. 27]: `` Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , as I have already apologized for intruding on you , I can not do better than be very brief .
Parsing [sent. 9188 len. 8]: I thank you , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 9189 len. 16]: The head of the Dedlocks has motioned towards a sofa between himself and my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9190 len. 8]: Mr. Rouncewell quietly takes his seat there .
Parsing [sent. 9191 len. 35]: `` In these busy times , when so many great undertakings are in progress , people like myself have so many workmen in so many places that we are always on the flight . ''
Parsing [sent. 9192 len. 98]: Sir Leicester is content enough that the ironmaster should feel that there is no hurry there ; there , in that ancient house , rooted in that quiet park , where the ivy and the moss have had time to mature , and the gnarled and warted elms and the umbrageous oaks stand deep in the fern and leaves of a hundred years ; and where the sun-dial on the terrace has dumbly recorded for centuries that time which was as much the property of every Dedlock -- while he lasted -- as the house and lands .
Parsing [sent. 9193 len. 23]: Sir Leicester sits down in an easy-chair , opposing his repose and that of Chesney Wold to the restless flights of ironmasters .
Parsing [sent. 9194 len. 37]: `` Lady Dedlock has been so kind , '' proceeds Mr. Rouncewell with a respectful glance and a bow that way , `` as to place near her a young beauty of the name of Rosa .
Parsing [sent. 9195 len. 38]: Now , my son has fallen in love with Rosa and has asked my consent to his proposing marriage to her and to their becoming engaged if she will take him -- which I suppose she will .
Parsing [sent. 9196 len. 24]: I have never seen Rosa until to-day , but I have some confidence in my son 's good sense -- even in love .
Parsing [sent. 9197 len. 26]: I find her what he represents her , to the best of my judgment ; and my mother speaks of her with great commendation . ''
Parsing [sent. 9198 len. 13]: `` She in all respects deserves it , '' says my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9199 len. 31]: `` I am happy , Lady Dedlock , that you say so , and I need not comment on the value to me of your kind opinion of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9200 len. 28]: `` That , '' observes Sir Leicester with unspeakable grandeur , for he thinks the ironmaster a little too glib , `` must be quite unnecessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 9201 len. 7]: `` Quite unnecessary , Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 9202 len. 18]: Now , my son is a very young man , and Rosa is a very young woman .
Parsing [sent. 9203 len. 25]: As I made my way , so my son must make his ; and his being married at present is out of the question .
Parsing [sent. 9204 len. 69]: But supposing I gave my consent to his engaging himself to this pretty girl , if this pretty girl will engage herself to him , I think it a piece of candour to say at once -- I am sure , Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , you will understand and excuse me -- I should make it a condition that she did not remain at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 9205 len. 49]: Therefore , before communicating further with my son , I take the liberty of saying that if her removal would be in any way inconvenient or objectionable , I will hold the matter over with him for any reasonable time and leave it precisely where it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 9206 len. 6]: Not remain at Chesney Wold !
Parsing [sent. 9207 len. 5]: Make it a condition !
Parsing [sent. 9208 len. 52]: All Sir Leicester 's old misgivings relative to Wat Tyler and the people in the iron districts who do nothing but turn out by torchlight come in a shower upon his head , the fine grey hair of which , as well as of his whiskers , actually stirs with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 9209 len. 90]: `` Am I to understand , sir , '' says Sir Leicester , `` and is my Lady to understand '' -- he brings her in thus specially , first as a point of gallantry , and next as a point of prudence , having great reliance on her sense -- `` am I to understand , Mr. Rouncewell , and is my Lady to understand , sir , that you consider this young woman too good for Chesney Wold or likely to be injured by remaining here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9210 len. 17]: `` Certainly not , Sir Leicester , '' `` I am glad to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9211 len. 6]: Sir Leicester very lofty indeed .
Parsing [sent. 9212 len. 40]: `` Pray , Mr. Rouncewell , '' says my Lady , warning Sir Leicester off with the slightest gesture of her pretty hand , as if he were a fly , `` explain to me what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 9213 len. 6]: `` Willingly , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 9214 len. 9]: There is nothing I could desire more . ''
Parsing [sent. 9215 len. 54]: Addressing her composed face , whose intelligence , however , is too quick and active to be concealed by any studied impassiveness , however habitual , to the strong Saxon face of the visitor , a picture of resolution and perseverance , my Lady listens with attention , occasionally slightly bending her head .
Parsing [sent. 9216 len. 20]: `` I am the son of your housekeeper , Lady Dedlock , and passed my childhood about this house .
Parsing [sent. 9217 len. 17]: My mother has lived here half a century and will die here I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 9218 len. 78]: She is one of those examples -- perhaps as good a one as there is -- of love , and attachment , and fidelity in such a nation , which England may well be proud of , but of which no order can appropriate the whole pride or the whole merit , because such an instance bespeaks high worth on two sides -- on the great side assuredly , on the small one no less assuredly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9219 len. 40]: Sir Leicester snorts a little to hear the law laid down in this way , but in his honour and his love of truth , he freely , though silently , admits the justice of the ironmaster 's proposition .
Parsing [sent. 9220 len. 56]: `` Pardon me for saying what is so obvious , but I would n't have it hastily supposed , '' with the least turn of his eyes towards Sir Leicester , `` that I am ashamed of my mother 's position here , or wanting in all just respect for Chesney Wold and the family .
Parsing [sent. 9221 len. 30]: I certainly may have desired -- I certainly have desired , Lady Dedlock -- that my mother should retire after so many years and end her days with me .
Parsing [sent. 9222 len. 26]: But as I have found that to sever this strong bond would be to break her heart , I have long abandoned that idea . ''
Parsing [sent. 9223 len. 26]: Sir Leicester very magnificent again at the notion of Mrs. Rouncewell being spirited off from her natural home to end her days with an ironmaster .
Parsing [sent. 9224 len. 23]: `` I have been , '' proceeds the visitor in a modest , clear way , `` an apprentice and a workman .
Parsing [sent. 9225 len. 23]: I have lived on workman 's wages , years and years , and beyond a certain point have had to educate myself .
Parsing [sent. 9226 len. 13]: My wife was a foreman 's daughter , and plainly brought up .
Parsing [sent. 9227 len. 37]: We have three daughters besides this son of whom I have spoken , and being fortunately able to give them greater advantages than we have had ourselves , we have educated them well , very well .
Parsing [sent. 9228 len. 19]: It has been one of our great cares and pleasures to make them worthy of any station . ''
Parsing [sent. 9229 len. 26]: A little boastfulness in his fatherly tone here , as if he added in his heart , `` even of the Chesney Wold station . ''
Parsing [sent. 9230 len. 15]: Not a little more magnificence , therefore , on the part of Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 9231 len. 42]: `` All this is so frequent , Lady Dedlock , where I live , and among the class to which I belong , that what would be generally called unequal marriages are not of such rare occurrence with us as elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9232 len. 27]: A son will sometimes make it known to his father that he has fallen in love , say , with a young woman in the factory .
Parsing [sent. 9233 len. 21]: The father , who once worked in a factory himself , will be a little disappointed at first very possibly .
Parsing [sent. 9234 len. 12]: It may be that he had other views for his son .
Parsing [sent. 9235 len. 36]: However , the chances are that having ascertained the young woman to be of unblemished character , he will say to his son , ' I must be quite sure you are in earnest here .
Parsing [sent. 9236 len. 10]: This is a serious matter for both of you .
Parsing [sent. 9237 len. 52]: Therefore I shall have this girl educated for two years , ' or it may be , ' I shall place this girl at the same school with your sisters for such a time , during which you will give me your word and honour to see her only so often .
Parsing [sent. 9238 len. 46]: If at the expiration of that time , when she has so far profited by her advantages as that you may be upon a fair equality , you are both in the same mind , I will do my part to make you happy . '
Parsing [sent. 9239 len. 26]: I know of several cases such as I describe , my Lady , and I think they indicate to me my own course now . ''
Parsing [sent. 9240 len. 6]: Sir Leicester 's magnificence explodes .
Parsing [sent. 9241 len. 5]: Calmly , but terribly .
Parsing [sent. 9242 len. 59]: `` Mr. Rouncewell , '' says Sir Leicester with his right hand in the breast of his blue coat , the attitude of state in which he is painted in the gallery , `` do you draw a parallel between Chesney Wold and a -- '' Here he resists a disposition to choke , `` a factory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9243 len. 37]: `` I need not reply , Sir Leicester , that the two places are very different ; but for the purposes of this case , I think a parallel may be justly drawn between them . ''
Parsing [sent. 9244 len. 26]: Sir Leicester directs his majestic glance down one side of the long drawing-room and up the other before he can believe that he is awake .
Parsing [sent. 9245 len. 35]: `` Are you aware , sir , that this young woman whom my Lady -- my Lady -- has placed near her person was brought up at the village school outside the gates ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9246 len. 11]: `` Sir Leicester , I am quite aware of it .
Parsing [sent. 9247 len. 15]: A very good school it is , and handsomely supported by this family . ''
Parsing [sent. 9248 len. 27]: `` Then , Mr. Rouncewell , '' returns Sir Leicester , `` the application of what you have said is , to me , incomprehensible . ''
Parsing [sent. 9249 len. 45]: `` Will it be more comprehensible , Sir Leicester , if I say , '' the ironmaster is reddening a little , `` that I do not regard the village school as teaching everything desirable to be known by my son 's wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9250 len. 132]: From the village school of Chesney Wold , intact as it is this minute , to the whole framework of society ; from the whole framework of society , to the aforesaid framework receiving tremendous cracks in consequence of people -LRB- iron-masters , lead-mistresses , and what not -RRB- not minding their catechism , and getting out of the station unto which they are called -- necessarily and for ever , according to Sir Leicester 's rapid logic , the first station in which they happen to find themselves ; and from that , to their educating other people out of THEIR stations , and so obliterating the landmarks , and opening the floodgates , and all the rest of it ; this is the swift progress of the Dedlock mind .
Parsing [sent. 9251 len. 9]: `` My Lady , I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 9252 len. 8]: Permit me , for one moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9253 len. 11]: She has given a faint indication of intending to speak .
Parsing [sent. 9254 len. 55]: `` Mr. Rouncewell , our views of duty , and our views of station , and our views of education , and our views of -- in short , ALL our views -- are so diametrically opposed , that to prolong this discussion must be repellent to your feelings and repellent to my own .
Parsing [sent. 9255 len. 13]: This young woman is honoured with my Lady 's notice and favour .
Parsing [sent. 9256 len. 84]: If she wishes to withdraw herself from that notice and favour or if she chooses to place herself under the influence of any one who may in his peculiar opinions -- you will allow me to say , in his peculiar opinions , though I readily admit that he is not accountable for them to me -- who may , in his peculiar opinions , withdraw her from that notice and favour , she is at any time at liberty to do so .
Parsing [sent. 9257 len. 14]: We are obliged to you for the plainness with which you have spoken .
Parsing [sent. 9258 len. 21]: It will have no effect of itself , one way or other , on the young woman 's position here .
Parsing [sent. 9259 len. 27]: Beyond this , we can make no terms ; and here we beg -- if you will be so good -- to leave the subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 9260 len. 17]: The visitor pauses a moment to give my Lady an opportunity , but she says nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9261 len. 39]: He then rises and replies , `` Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , allow me to thank you for your attention and only to observe that I shall very seriously recommend my son to conquer his present inclinations .
Parsing [sent. 9262 len. 4]: Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9263 len. 30]: `` Mr. Rouncewell , '' says Sir Leicester with all the nature of a gentleman shining in him , `` it is late , and the roads are dark .
Parsing [sent. 9264 len. 32]: I hope your time is not so precious but that you will allow my Lady and myself to offer you the hospitality of Chesney Wold , for to-night at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 9265 len. 10]: `` I hope so , '' adds my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9266 len. 35]: `` I am much obliged to you , but I have to travel all night in order to reach a distant part of the country punctually at an appointed time in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 9267 len. 22]: Therewith the ironmaster takes his departure , Sir Leicester ringing the bell and my Lady rising as he leaves the room .
Parsing [sent. 9268 len. 34]: When my Lady goes to her boudoir , she sits down thoughtfully by the fire , and inattentive to the Ghost 's Walk , looks at Rosa , writing in an inner room .
Parsing [sent. 9269 len. 6]: Presently my Lady calls her .
Parsing [sent. 9270 len. 7]: `` Come to me , child .
Parsing [sent. 9271 len. 5]: Tell me the truth .
Parsing [sent. 9272 len. 6]: Are you in love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9273 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9274 len. 4]: My Lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9275 len. 19]: My Lady , looking at the downcast and blushing face , says smiling , `` Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 9276 len. 8]: Is it Mrs. Rouncewell 's grandson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9277 len. 10]: `` Yes , if you please , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9278 len. 16]: But I do n't know that I am in love with him -- yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 9279 len. 8]: `` Yet , you silly little thing !
Parsing [sent. 9280 len. 11]: Do you know that he loves YOU , yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9281 len. 13]: `` I think he likes me a little , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 9282 len. 6]: And Rosa bursts into tears .
Parsing [sent. 9283 len. 30]: Is this Lady Dedlock standing beside the village beauty , smoothing her dark hair with that motherly touch , and watching her with eyes so full of musing interest ?
Parsing [sent. 9284 len. 6]: Aye , indeed it is !
Parsing [sent. 9285 len. 7]: `` Listen to me , child .
Parsing [sent. 9286 len. 16]: You are young and true , and I believe you are attached to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 9287 len. 8]: `` Indeed I am , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9288 len. 17]: Indeed there is nothing in the world I would n't do to show how much . ''
Parsing [sent. 9289 len. 23]: `` And I do n't think you would wish to leave me just yet , Rosa , even for a lover ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9290 len. 6]: `` No , my Lady !
Parsing [sent. 9291 len. 5]: Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9292 len. 14]: Rosa looks up for the first time , quite frightened at the thought .
Parsing [sent. 9293 len. 8]: `` Confide in me , my child .
Parsing [sent. 9294 len. 5]: Do n't fear me .
Parsing [sent. 9295 len. 24]: I wish you to be happy , and will make you so -- if I can make anybody happy on this earth . ''
Parsing [sent. 9296 len. 15]: Rosa , with fresh tears , kneels at her feet and kisses her hand .
Parsing [sent. 9297 len. 39]: My Lady takes the hand with which she has caught it , and standing with her eyes fixed on the fire , puts it about and about between her own two hands , and gradually lets it fall .
Parsing [sent. 9298 len. 20]: Seeing her so absorbed , Rosa softly withdraws ; but still my Lady 's eyes are on the fire .
Parsing [sent. 9299 len. 5]: In search of what ?
Parsing [sent. 9300 len. 26]: Of any hand that is no more , of any hand that never was , of any touch that might have magically changed her life ?
Parsing [sent. 9301 len. 18]: Or does she listen to the Ghost 's Walk and think what step does it most resemble ?
Parsing [sent. 9302 len. 4]: A man 's ?
Parsing [sent. 9303 len. 4]: A woman 's ?
Parsing [sent. 9304 len. 17]: The pattering of a little child 's feet , ever coming on -- on -- on ?
Parsing [sent. 9305 len. 26]: Some melancholy influence is upon her , or why should so proud a lady close the doors and sit alone upon the hearth so desolate ?
Parsing [sent. 9306 len. 15]: Volumnia is away next day , and all the cousins are scattered before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 9307 len. 42]: Not a cousin of the batch but is amazed to hear from Sir Leicester at breakfast-time of the obliteration of landmarks , and opening of floodgates , and cracking of the framework of society , manifested through Mrs. Rouncewell 's son .
Parsing [sent. 9308 len. 49]: Not a cousin of the batch but is really indignant , and connects it with the feebleness of William Buffy when in office , and really does feel deprived of a stake in the country -- or the pension list -- or something -- by fraud and wrong .
Parsing [sent. 9309 len. 40]: As to Volumnia , she is handed down the great staircase by Sir Leicester , as eloquent upon the theme as if there were a general rising in the north of England to obtain her rouge-pot and pearl necklace .
Parsing [sent. 9310 len. 77]: And thus , with a clatter of maids and valets -- for it is one appurtenance of their cousinship that however difficult they may find it to keep themselves , they MUST keep maids and valets -- the cousins disperse to the four winds of heaven ; and the one wintry wind that blows to-day shakes a shower from the trees near the deserted house , as if all the cousins had been changed into leaves .
Parsing [sent. 9311 len. 51]: Chapter XXIX -- The Young Man Chesney Wold is shut up , carpets are rolled into great scrolls in corners of comfortless rooms , bright damask does penance in brown holland , carving and gilding puts on mortification , and the Dedlock ancestors retire from the light of day again .
Parsing [sent. 9312 len. 29]: Around and around the house the leaves fall thick , but never fast , for they come circling down with a dead lightness that is sombre and slow .
Parsing [sent. 9313 len. 30]: Let the gardener sweep and sweep the turf as he will , and press the leaves into full barrows , and wheel them off , still they lie ankle-deep .
Parsing [sent. 9314 len. 22]: Howls the shrill wind round Chesney Wold ; the sharp rain beats , the windows rattle , and the chimneys growl .
Parsing [sent. 9315 len. 21]: Mists hide in the avenues , veil the points of view , and move in funeral-wise across the rising grounds .
Parsing [sent. 9316 len. 46]: On all the house there is a cold , blank smell like the smell of a little church , though something dryer , suggesting that the dead and buried Dedlocks walk there in the long nights and leave the flavour of their graves behind them .
Parsing [sent. 9317 len. 46]: But the house in town , which is rarely in the same mind as Chesney Wold at the same time , seldom rejoicing when it rejoices or mourning when it mourns , expecting when a Dedlock dies -- the house in town shines out awakened .
Parsing [sent. 9318 len. 70]: As warm and bright as so much state may be , as delicately redolent of pleasant scents that bear no trace of winter as hothouse flowers can make it , soft and hushed so that the ticking of the clocks and the crisp burning of the fires alone disturb the stillness in the rooms , it seems to wrap those chilled bones of Sir Leicester 's in rainbow-coloured wool .
Parsing [sent. 9319 len. 36]: And Sir Leicester is glad to repose in dignified contentment before the great fire in the library , condescendingly perusing the backs of his books or honouring the fine arts with a glance of approbation .
Parsing [sent. 9320 len. 10]: For he has his pictures , ancient and modern .
Parsing [sent. 9321 len. 29]: Some of the Fancy Ball School in which art occasionally condescends to become a master , which would be best catalogued like the miscellaneous articles in a sale .
Parsing [sent. 9322 len. 47]: As ' `` Three high-backed chairs , a table and cover , long-necked bottle -LRB- containing wine -RRB- , one flask , one Spanish female 's costume , three-quarter face portrait of Miss Jogg the model , and a suit of armour containing Don Quixote . ''
Parsing [sent. 9323 len. 57]: Or `` One stone terrace -LRB- cracked -RRB- , one gondola in distance , one Venetian senator 's dress complete , richly embroidered white satin costume with profile portrait of Miss Jogg the model , one Scimitar superbly mounted in gold with jewelled handle , elaborate Moorish dress -LRB- very rare -RRB- , and Othello . ''
Parsing [sent. 9324 len. 24]: Mr. Tulkinghorn comes and goes pretty often , there being estate business to do , leases to be renewed , and so on .
Parsing [sent. 9325 len. 33]: He sees my Lady pretty often , too ; and he and she are as composed , and as indifferent , and take as little heed of one another , as ever .
Parsing [sent. 9326 len. 17]: Yet it may be that my Lady fears this Mr. Tulkinghorn and that he knows it .
Parsing [sent. 9327 len. 22]: It may be that he pursues her doggedly and steadily , with no touch of compunction , remorse , or pity .
Parsing [sent. 9328 len. 35]: It may be that her beauty and all the state and brilliancy surrounding her only gives him the greater zest for what he is set upon and makes him the more inflexible in it .
Parsing [sent. 9329 len. 136]: Whether he be cold and cruel , whether immovable in what he has made his duty , whether absorbed in love of power , whether determined to have nothing hidden from him in ground where he has burrowed among secrets all his life , whether he in his heart despises the splendour of which he is a distant beam , whether he is always treasuring up slights and offences in the affability of his gorgeous clients -- whether he be any of this , or all of this , it may be that my Lady had better have five thousand pairs of fashionahle eyes upon her , in distrustful vigilance , than the two eyes of this rusty lawyer with his wisp of neckcloth and his dull black breeches tied with ribbons at the knees .
Parsing [sent. 9330 len. 26]: Sir Leicester sits in my Lady 's room -- that room in which Mr. Tulkinghorn read the affidavit in Jarndyce and Jarndyce -- particularly complacent .
Parsing [sent. 9331 len. 19]: My Lady , as on that day , sits before the fire with her screen in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 9332 len. 26]: Sir Leicester is particularly complacent because he has found in his newspaper some congenial remarks bearing directly on the floodgates and the framework of society .
Parsing [sent. 9333 len. 27]: They apply so happily to the late case that Sir Leicester has come from the library to my Lady 's room expressly to read them aloud .
Parsing [sent. 9334 len. 40]: `` The man who wrote this article , '' he observes by way of preface , nodding at the fire as if he were nodding down at the man from a mount , `` has a well-balanced mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 9335 len. 65]: The man 's mind is not so well balanced but that he bores my Lady , who , after a languid effort to listen , or rather a languid resignation of herself to a show of listening , becomes distraught and falls into a contemplation of the fire as if it were her fire at Chesney Wold , and she had never left it .
Parsing [sent. 9336 len. 67]: Sir Leicester , quite unconscious , reads on through his double eye-glass , occasionally stopping to remove his glass and express approval , as `` Very true indeed , '' `` Very properly put , '' `` I have frequently made the same remark myself , '' invariably losing his place after each observation , and going up and down the column to find it again .
Parsing [sent. 9337 len. 39]: Sir Leicester is reading with infinite gravity and state when the door opens , and the Mercury in powder makes this strange announcement , `` The young man , my Lady , of the name of Guppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9338 len. 23]: Sir Leicester pauses , stares , repeats in a killing voice , `` The young man of the name of Guppy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9339 len. 31]: Looking round , he beholds the young man of the name of Guppy , much discomfited and not presenting a very impressive letter of introduction in his manner and appearance .
Parsing [sent. 9340 len. 30]: `` Pray , '' says Sir Leicester to Mercury , `` what do you mean by announcing with this abruptness a young man of the name of Guppy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9341 len. 23]: `` I beg your pardon , Sir Leicester , but my Lady said she would see the young man whenever he called .
Parsing [sent. 9342 len. 13]: I was not aware that you were here , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 9343 len. 40]: With this apology , Mercury directs a scornful and indignant look at the young man of the name of Guppy which plainly says , `` What do you come calling here for and getting ME into a row ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9344 len. 6]: `` It 's quite right .
Parsing [sent. 9345 len. 11]: I gave him those directions , '' says my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9346 len. 8]: `` Let the young man wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 9347 len. 8]: `` By no means , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 9348 len. 15]: Since he has your orders to come , I will not interrupt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9349 len. 33]: Sir Leicester in his gallantry retires , rather declining to accept a bow from the young man as he goes out and majestically supposing him to be some shoemaker of intrusive appearance .
Parsing [sent. 9350 len. 25]: Lady Dedlock looks imperiously at her visitor when the servant has left the room , casting her eyes over him from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 9351 len. 15]: She suffers him to stand by the door and asks him what he wants .
Parsing [sent. 9352 len. 23]: `` That your ladyship would have the kindness to oblige me with a little conversation , '' returns Mr. Guppy , embarrassed .
Parsing [sent. 9353 len. 18]: `` You are , of course , the person who has written me so many letters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9354 len. 6]: `` Several , your ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 9355 len. 13]: Several before your ladyship condescended to favour me with an answer . ''
Parsing [sent. 9356 len. 15]: `` And could you not take the same means of rendering a Conversation unnecessary ?
Parsing [sent. 9357 len. 6]: Can you not still ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9358 len. 12]: Mr. Guppy screws his mouth into a silent `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9359 len. 5]: and shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 9360 len. 7]: `` You have been strangely importunate .
Parsing [sent. 9361 len. 49]: If it should appear , after all , that what you have to say does not concern me -- and I do n't know how it can , and do n't expect that it will -- you will allow me to cut you short with but little ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 9362 len. 12]: Say what you have to say , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 9363 len. 33]: My Lady , with a careless toss of her screen , turns herself towards the fire again , sitting almost with her back to the young man of the name of Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 9364 len. 24]: `` With your ladyship 's permission , then , '' says the young man , `` I will now enter on my business .
Parsing [sent. 9365 len. 2]: Hem !
Parsing [sent. 9366 len. 17]: I am , as I told your ladyship in my first letter , in the law .
Parsing [sent. 9367 len. 52]: Being in the law , I have learnt the habit of not committing myself in writing , and therefore I did not mention to your ladyship the name of the firm with which I am connected and in which my standing -- and I may add income -- is tolerably good .
Parsing [sent. 9368 len. 49]: I may now state to your ladyship , in confidence , that the name of that firm is Kenge and Carboy , of Lincoln 's Inn , which may not be altogether unknown to your ladyship in connexion with the case in Chancery of Jarndyce and Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 9369 len. 12]: My Lady 's figure begins to be expressive of some attention .
Parsing [sent. 9370 len. 16]: She has ceased to toss the screen and holds it as if she were listening .
Parsing [sent. 9371 len. 65]: `` Now , I may say to your ladyship at once , '' says Mr. Guppy , a little emboldened , `` it is no matter arising out of Jarndyce and Jarndyce that made me so desirous to speak to your ladyship , which conduct I have no doubt did appear , and does appear , obtrusive -- in fact , almost blackguardly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9372 len. 50]: After waiting for a moment to receive some assurance to the contrary , and not receiving any , Mr. Guppy proceeds , `` If it had been Jarndyce and Jarndyce , I should have gone at once to your ladyship 's solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn , of the Fields .
Parsing [sent. 9373 len. 40]: I have the pleasure of being acquainted with Mr. Tulkinghorn -- at least we move when we meet one another -- and if it had been any business of that sort , I should have gone to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9374 len. 17]: My Lady turns a little round and says , `` You had better sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 9375 len. 6]: `` Thank your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 9376 len. 5]: Mr. Guppy does so .
Parsing [sent. 9377 len. 51]: `` Now , your ladyship '' -- Mr. Guppy refers to a little slip of paper on which he has made small notes of his line of argument and which seems to involve him in the densest obscurity whenever he looks at it -- `` I -- Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 9378 len. 11]: -- I place myself entirely in your ladyship 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 9379 len. 31]: If your ladyship was to make any complaint to Kenge and Carboy or to Mr. Tulkinghorn of the present visit , I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation .
Parsing [sent. 9380 len. 6]: That , I openly admit .
Parsing [sent. 9381 len. 11]: Consequently , I rely upon your ladyship 's honour . ''
Parsing [sent. 9382 len. 26]: My Lady , with a disdainful gesture of the hand that holds the screen , assures him of his being worth no complaint from her .
Parsing [sent. 9383 len. 14]: `` Thank your ladyship , '' says Mr. Guppy ; `` quite satisfactory .
Parsing [sent. 9384 len. 7]: Now -- I -- dash it !
Parsing [sent. 9385 len. 42]: -- The fact is that I put down a head or two here of the order of the points I thought of touching upon , and they 're written short , and I ca n't quite make out what they mean .
Parsing [sent. 9386 len. 52]: If your ladyship will excuse me taking it to the window half a moment , I -- '' Mr. Guppy , going to the window , tumbles into a pair of love-birds , to whom he says in his confusion , `` I beg your pardon , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 9387 len. 12]: This does not tend to the greater legibility of his notes .
Parsing [sent. 9388 len. 32]: He murmurs , growing warm and red and holding the slip of paper now close to his eyes , now a long way off , `` C.S. What 's C.S. for ?
Parsing [sent. 9389 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9390 len. 2]: C.S. !
Parsing [sent. 9391 len. 5]: Oh , I know !
Parsing [sent. 9392 len. 7]: Yes , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9393 len. 5]: And comes back enlightened .
Parsing [sent. 9394 len. 46]: `` I am not aware , '' says Mr. Guppy , standing midway between my Lady and his chair , `` whether your ladyship ever happened to hear of , or to see , a young lady of the name of Miss Esther Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 9395 len. 9]: My Lady 's eyes look at him full .
Parsing [sent. 9396 len. 13]: `` I saw a young lady of that name not long ago .
Parsing [sent. 9397 len. 5]: This past autumn . ''
Parsing [sent. 9398 len. 15]: `` Now , did it strike your ladyship that she was like anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9399 len. 26]: asks Mr. Guppy , crossing his arms , holding his head on one side , and scratching the corner of his mouth with his memoranda .
Parsing [sent. 9400 len. 10]: My Lady removes her eyes from him no more .
Parsing [sent. 9401 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 9402 len. 9]: `` Not like your ladyship 's family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9403 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 9404 len. 21]: `` I think your ladyship , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` can hardly remember Miss Summerson 's face ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9405 len. 9]: `` I remember the young lady very well .
Parsing [sent. 9406 len. 9]: What has this to do with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9407 len. 98]: `` Your ladyship , I do assure you that having Miss Summerson 's image imprinted on my ` eart -- which I mention in confidence -- I found , when I had the honour of going over your ladyship 's mansion of Chesney Wold while on a short out in the county of Lincolnshire with a friend , such a resemblance between Miss Esther Summerson and your ladyship 's own portrait that it completely knocked me over , so much so that I did n't at the moment even know what it WAS that knocked me over .
Parsing [sent. 9408 len. 66]: And now I have the honour of beholding your ladyship near -LRB- I have often , since that , taken the liberty of looking at your ladyship in your carriage in the park , when I dare say you was not aware of me , but I never saw your ladyship so near -RRB- , it 's really more surprising than I thought it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9409 len. 8]: Young man of the name of Guppy !
Parsing [sent. 9410 len. 47]: There have been times , when ladies lived in strongholds and had unscrupulous attendants within call , when that poor life of yours would NOT have been worth a minute 's purchase , with those beautiful eyes looking at you as they look at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 9411 len. 29]: My Lady , slowly using her little hand-screen as a fan , asks him again what he supposes that his taste for likenesses has to do with her .
Parsing [sent. 9412 len. 22]: `` Your ladyship , '' replies Mr. Guppy , again referring to his paper , `` I am coming to that .
Parsing [sent. 9413 len. 4]: Dash these notes !
Parsing [sent. 9414 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9415 len. 5]: ` Mrs. Chadband . '
Parsing [sent. 9416 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9417 len. 13]: Mr. Guppy draws his chair a little forward and seats himself again .
Parsing [sent. 9418 len. 28]: My Lady reclines in her chair composedly , though with a trifle less of graceful ease than usual perhaps , and never falters in her steady gaze .
Parsing [sent. 9419 len. 10]: `` A -- stop a minute , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9420 len. 5]: Mr. Guppy refers again .
Parsing [sent. 9421 len. 4]: `` E.S. twice ?
Parsing [sent. 9422 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 9423 len. 12]: Yes , I see my way now , right on . ''
Parsing [sent. 9424 len. 19]: Rolling up the slip of paper as an instrument to point his speech with , Mr. Guppy proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 9425 len. 18]: `` Your ladyship , there is a mystery about Miss Esther Summerson 's birth and bringing up .
Parsing [sent. 9426 len. 29]: I am informed of that fact because -- which I mention in confidence -- I know it in the way of my profession at Kenge and Carboy 's .
Parsing [sent. 9427 len. 22]: Now , as I have already mentioned to your ladyship , Miss Summerson 's image is imprinted on my ` eart .
Parsing [sent. 9428 len. 80]: If I could clear this mystery for her , or prove her to be well related , or find that having the honour to be a remote branch of your ladyship 's family she had a right to be made a party in Jarndyce and Jarndyce , why , I might make a sort of a claim upon Miss Summerson to look with an eye of more dedicated favour on my proposals than she has exactly done as yet .
Parsing [sent. 9429 len. 14]: In fact , as yet she has n't favoured them at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 9430 len. 13]: A kind of angry smile just dawns upon my Lady 's face .
Parsing [sent. 9431 len. 111]: `` Now , it 's a very singular circumstance , your ladyship , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` though one of those circumstances that do fall in the way of us professional men -- which I may call myself , for though not admitted , yet I have had a present of my articles made to me by Kenge and Carboy , on my mother 's advancing from the principal of her little income the money for the stamp , which comes heavy -- that I have encountered the person who lived as servant with the lady who brought Miss Summerson up before Mr. Jarndyce took charge of her .
Parsing [sent. 9432 len. 11]: That lady was a Miss Barbary , your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 9433 len. 46]: Is the dead colour on my Lady 's face reflected from the screen which has a green silk ground and which she holds in her raised hand as if she had forgotten it , or is it a dreadful paleness that has fallen on her ?
Parsing [sent. 9434 len. 20]: `` Did your ladyship , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` ever happen to hear of Miss Barbary ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9435 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 9436 len. 4]: I think so .
Parsing [sent. 9437 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9438 len. 14]: `` Was Miss Barbary at all connected with your ladyship 's family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9439 len. 11]: My Lady 's lips move , but they utter nothing .
Parsing [sent. 9440 len. 5]: She shakes her head .
Parsing [sent. 9441 len. 5]: `` NOT connected ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9442 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 9443 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9444 len. 9]: Not to your ladyship 's knowledge , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 9445 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9446 len. 4]: But might be ?
Parsing [sent. 9447 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9448 len. 12]: After each of these interrogatories , she has inclined her head .
Parsing [sent. 9449 len. 4]: `` Very good !
Parsing [sent. 9450 len. 48]: Now , this Miss Barbary was extremely close -- seems to have been extraordinarily close for a female , females being generally -LRB- in common life at least -RRB- rather given to conversation -- and my witness never had an idea whether she possessed a single relative .
Parsing [sent. 9451 len. 44]: On one occasion , and only one , she seems to have been confidential to my witness on a single point , and she then told her that the little girl 's real name was not Esther Summerson , but Esther Hawdon . ''
Parsing [sent. 9452 len. 5]: `` My God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9453 len. 4]: Mr. Guppy stares .
Parsing [sent. 9454 len. 49]: Lady Dedlock sits before him looking him through , with the same dark shade upon her face , in the same attitude even to the holding of the screen , with her lips a little apart , her brow a little contracted , but for the moment dead .
Parsing [sent. 9455 len. 51]: He sees her consciousness return , sees a tremor pass across her frame like a ripple over water , sees her lips shake , sees her compose them by a great effort , sees her force herself back to the knowledge of his presence and of what he has said .
Parsing [sent. 9456 len. 46]: All this , so quickly , that her exclamation and her dead condition seem to have passed away like the features of those long-preserved dead bodies sometimes opened up in tombs , which , struck by the air like lightning , vanish in a breath .
Parsing [sent. 9457 len. 12]: `` Your ladyship is acquainted with the name of Hawdon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9458 len. 8]: `` I have heard it before . ''
Parsing [sent. 9459 len. 15]: `` Name of any collateral or remote branch of your ladyship 's family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9460 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 9461 len. 31]: `` Now , your ladyship , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` I come to the last point of the case , so far as I have got it up .
Parsing [sent. 9462 len. 19]: It 's going on , and I shall gather it up closer and closer as it goes on .
Parsing [sent. 9463 len. 48]: Your ladyship must know -- if your ladyship do n't happen , by any chance , to know already -- that there was found dead at the house of a person named Krook , near Chancery Lane , some time ago , a law-writer in great distress .
Parsing [sent. 9464 len. 21]: Upon which law-writer there was an inquest , and which law-writer was an anonymous character , his name being unknown .
Parsing [sent. 9465 len. 19]: But , your ladyship , I have discovered very lately that that law-writer 's name was Hawdon . ''
Parsing [sent. 9466 len. 9]: `` And what is THAT to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9467 len. 11]: `` Aye , your ladyship , that 's the question !
Parsing [sent. 9468 len. 15]: Now , your ladyship , a queer thing happened after that man 's death .
Parsing [sent. 9469 len. 29]: A lady started up , a disguised lady , your ladyship , who went to look at the scene of action and went to look at his grave .
Parsing [sent. 9470 len. 10]: She hired a crossing-sweeping boy to show it her .
Parsing [sent. 9471 len. 28]: If your ladyship would wish to have the boy produced in corroboration of this statement , I can lay my hand upon him at any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9472 len. 19]: The wretched boy is nothing to my Lady , and she does NOT wish to have him produced .
Parsing [sent. 9473 len. 20]: `` Oh , I assure your ladyship it 's a very queer start indeed , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 9474 len. 31]: `` If you was to hear him tell about the rings that sparkled on her fingers when she took her glove off , you 'd think it quite romantic . ''
Parsing [sent. 9475 len. 12]: There are diamonds glittering on the hand that holds the screen .
Parsing [sent. 9476 len. 35]: My Lady trifles with the screen and makes them glitter more , again with that expression which in other times might have been so dangerous to the young man of the name of Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 9477 len. 25]: `` It was supposed , your ladyship , that he left no rag or scrap behind him by which he could be possibly identified .
Parsing [sent. 9478 len. 4]: But he did .
Parsing [sent. 9479 len. 9]: He left a bundle of old letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 9480 len. 8]: The screen still goes , as before .
Parsing [sent. 9481 len. 10]: All this time her eyes never once release him .
Parsing [sent. 9482 len. 7]: `` They were taken and secreted .
Parsing [sent. 9483 len. 15]: And to-morrow night , your ladyship , they will come into my possession . ''
Parsing [sent. 9484 len. 13]: `` Still I ask you , what is this to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9485 len. 10]: `` Your ladyship , I conclude with that . ''
Parsing [sent. 9486 len. 4]: Mr. Guppy rises .
Parsing [sent. 9487 len. 101]: `` If you think there 's enough in this chain of circumstances put together -- in the undoubted strong likeness of this young lady to your ladyship , which is a positive fact for a jury ; in her having been brought up by Miss Barbary ; in Miss Barbary stating Miss Summerson 's real name to be Hawdon ; in your ladyship 's knowing both these names VERY WELL ; and in Hawdon 's dying as he did -- to give your ladyship a family interest in going further into the case , I will bring these papers here .
Parsing [sent. 9488 len. 25]: I do n't know what they are , except that they are old letters : I have never had them in my posession yet .
Parsing [sent. 9489 len. 24]: I will bring those papers here as soon as I get them and go over them for the first time with your ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 9490 len. 8]: I have told your ladyship my object .
Parsing [sent. 9491 len. 29]: I have told your ladyship that I should be placed in a very disagreeable situation if any complaint was made , and all is in strict confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 9492 len. 21]: Is this the full purpose of the young man of the name of Guppy , or has he any other ?
Parsing [sent. 9493 len. 29]: Do his words disclose the length , breadth , depth , of his object and suspicion in coming here ; or if not , what do they hide ?
Parsing [sent. 9494 len. 9]: He is a match for my Lady there .
Parsing [sent. 9495 len. 24]: She may look at him , but he can look at the table and keep that witness-box face of his from telling anything .
Parsing [sent. 9496 len. 18]: `` You may bring the letters , '' says my Lady , `` if you choose . ''
Parsing [sent. 9497 len. 23]: `` Your ladyship is not very encouraging , upon my word and honour , '' says Mr. Guppy , a little injured .
Parsing [sent. 9498 len. 22]: `` You may bring the letters , '' she repeats in the same tone , `` if you -- please . ''
Parsing [sent. 9499 len. 6]: `` It shall he done .
Parsing [sent. 9500 len. 8]: I wish your ladyship good day . ''
Parsing [sent. 9501 len. 21]: On a table near her is a rich bauble of a casket , barred and clasped like an old strong-chest .
Parsing [sent. 9502 len. 15]: She , looking at him still , takes it to her and unlocks it .
Parsing [sent. 9503 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9504 len. 31]: I assure your ladyship I am not actuated by any motives of that sort , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` and I could n't accept anything of the kind .
Parsing [sent. 9505 len. 18]: I wish your ladyship good day , and am much obliged to you all the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 9506 len. 35]: So the young man makes his bow and goes downstairs , where the supercilious Mercury does not consider himself called upon to leave his Olympus by the hall-fire to let the young man out .
Parsing [sent. 9507 len. 51]: As Sir Leicester basks in his library and dozes over his newspaper , is there no influence in the house to startle him , not to say to make the very trees at Chesney Wold fling up their knotted arms , the very portraits frown , the very armour stir ?
Parsing [sent. 9508 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 9509 len. 67]: Words , sobs , and cries are but air , and air is so shut in and shut out throughout the house in town that sounds need be uttered trumpet-tongued indeed by my Lady in her chamber to carry any faint vibration to Sir Leicester 's ears ; and yet this cry is in the house , going upward from a wild figure on its knees .
Parsing [sent. 9510 len. 8]: `` O my child , my child !
Parsing [sent. 9511 len. 32]: Not dead in the first hours of her life , as my cruel sister told me , but sternly nurtured by her , after she had renounced me and my name !
Parsing [sent. 9512 len. 9]: O my child , O my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9513 len. 25]: Chapter XXX -- Esther 's Narrative Richard had been gone away some time when a visitor came to pass a few days with us .
Parsing [sent. 9514 len. 6]: It was an elderly lady .
Parsing [sent. 9515 len. 72]: It was Mrs. Woodcourt , who , having come from Wales to stay with Mrs. Bayham Badger and having written to my guardian , `` by her son Allan 's desire , '' to report that she had heard from him and that he was well `` and sent his kind remembrances to all of us , '' had been invited by my guardian to make a visit to Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 9516 len. 8]: She stayed with us nearly three weeks .
Parsing [sent. 9517 len. 22]: She took very kindly to me and was extremely confidential , so much so that sometimes she almost made me uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 9518 len. 41]: I had no right , I knew very well , to be uncomfortable because she confided in me , and I felt it was unreasonable ; still , with all I could do , I could not quite help it .
Parsing [sent. 9519 len. 35]: She was such a sharp little lady and used to sit with her hands folded in each other looking so very watchful while she talked to me that perhaps I found that rather irksome .
Parsing [sent. 9520 len. 27]: Or perhaps it was her being so upright and trim , though I do n't think it was that , because I thought that quaintly pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 9521 len. 23]: Nor can it have been the general expression of her face , which was very sparkling and pretty for an old lady .
Parsing [sent. 9522 len. 8]: I do n't know what it was .
Parsing [sent. 9523 len. 15]: Or at least if I do now , I thought I did not then .
Parsing [sent. 9524 len. 10]: Or at least -- but it do n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 9525 len. 50]: Of a night when I was going upstairs to bed , she would invite me into her room , where she sat before the fire in a great chair ; and , dear me , she would tell me about Morgan ap -- Kerrig until I was quite low-spirited !
Parsing [sent. 9526 len. 39]: Sometimes she recited a few verses from Crumlinwallinwer and the Mewlinn-willinwodd -LRB- if those are the right names , which I dare say they are not -RRB- , and would become quite fiery with the sentiments they expressed .
Parsing [sent. 9527 len. 29]: Though I never knew what they were -LRB- being in Welsh -RRB- , further than that they were highly eulogistic of the lineage of Morgan ap -- Kerrig .
Parsing [sent. 9528 len. 30]: `` So , Miss Summerson , '' she would say to me with stately triumph , `` this , you see , is the fortune inherited by my son .
Parsing [sent. 9529 len. 14]: Wherever my son goes , he can claim kindred with Ap -- Kerrig .
Parsing [sent. 9530 len. 21]: He may not have money , but he always has what is much better -- family , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 9531 len. 28]: I had my doubts of their caring so very much for Morgan ap -- Kerrig in India and China , but of course I never expressed them .
Parsing [sent. 9532 len. 15]: I used to say it was a great thing to be so highly connected .
Parsing [sent. 9533 len. 17]: `` It IS , my dear , a great thing , '' Mrs. Woodcourt would reply .
Parsing [sent. 9534 len. 39]: `` It has its disadvantages ; my son 's choice of a wife , for instance , is limited by it , but the matrimonial choice of the royal family is limited in much the same manner . ''
Parsing [sent. 9535 len. 34]: Then she would pat me on the arm and smooth my dress , as much as to assure me that she had a good opinion of me , the distance between us notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 9536 len. 45]: `` Poor Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , '' she would say , and always with some emotion , for with her lofty pedigree she had a very affectionate heart , `` was descended from a great Highland family , the MacCoorts of MacCoort .
Parsing [sent. 9537 len. 21]: He served his king and country as an officer in the Royal Highlanders , and he died on the field .
Parsing [sent. 9538 len. 13]: My son is one of the last representatives of two old families .
Parsing [sent. 9539 len. 20]: With the blessing of heaven he will set them up again and unite them with another old family . ''
Parsing [sent. 9540 len. 37]: It was in vain for me to try to change the subject , as I used to try , only for the sake of novelty or perhaps because -- but I need not be so particular .
Parsing [sent. 9541 len. 9]: Mrs. Woodcourt never would let me change it .
Parsing [sent. 9542 len. 51]: `` My dear , '' she said one night , `` you have so much sense and you look at the world in a quiet manner so superior to your time of life that it is a comfort to me to talk to you about these family matters of mine .
Parsing [sent. 9543 len. 28]: You do n't know much of my son , my dear ; but you know enough of him , I dare say , to recollect him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9544 len. 5]: `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 9545 len. 5]: I recollect him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9546 len. 6]: `` Yes , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 9547 len. 26]: Now , my dear , I think you are a judge of character , and I should like to have your opinion of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 9548 len. 17]: `` Oh , Mrs. Woodcourt , '' said I , `` that is so difficult ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9549 len. 11]: `` Why is it so difficult , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9550 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 9551 len. 9]: `` I do n't see it myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9552 len. 17]: `` To give an opinion -- '' `` On so slight an acquaintance , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 9553 len. 5]: THAT 'S true . ''
Parsing [sent. 9554 len. 27]: I did n't mean that , because Mr. Woodcourt had been at our house a good deal altogether and had become quite intimate with my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 9555 len. 34]: I said so , and added that he seemed to be very clever in his profession -- we thought -- and that his kindness and gentleness to Miss Flite were above all praise .
Parsing [sent. 9556 len. 7]: `` You do him justice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9557 len. 8]: said Mrs. Woodcourt , pressing my hand .
Parsing [sent. 9558 len. 6]: `` You define him exactly .
Parsing [sent. 9559 len. 12]: Allan is a dear fellow , and in his profession faultless .
Parsing [sent. 9560 len. 10]: I say it , though I am his mother .
Parsing [sent. 9561 len. 14]: Still , I must confess he is not without faults , love . ''
Parsing [sent. 9562 len. 12]: `` None of us are , '' said I. `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 9563 len. 27]: But his really are faults that he might correct , and ought to correct , '' returned the sharp old lady , sharply shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 9564 len. 32]: `` I am so much attached to you that I may confide in you , my dear , as a third party wholly disinterested , that he is fickleness itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 9565 len. 36]: I said I should have thought it hardly possible that he could have been otherwise than constant to his profession and zealous in the pursuit of it , judging from the reputation he had earned .
Parsing [sent. 9566 len. 29]: `` You are right again , my dear , '' the old lady retorted , `` but I do n't refer to his profession , look you . ''
Parsing [sent. 9567 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9568 len. 9]: said I. `` No , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 9569 len. 12]: `` I refer , my dear , to his social conduct .
Parsing [sent. 9570 len. 21]: He is always paying trivial attentions to young ladies , and always has been , ever since he was eighteen .
Parsing [sent. 9571 len. 36]: Now , my dear , he has never really cared for any one of them and has never meant in doing this to do any harm or to express anything but politeness and good nature .
Parsing [sent. 9572 len. 14]: Still , it 's not right , you know ; is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9573 len. 15]: `` No , '' said I , as she seemed to wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 9574 len. 16]: `` And it might lead to mistaken notions , you see , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 9575 len. 5]: I supposed it might .
Parsing [sent. 9576 len. 28]: `` Therefore , I have told him many times that he really should be more careful , both in justice to himself and in justice to others .
Parsing [sent. 9577 len. 38]: And he has always said , ` Mother , I will be ; but you know me better than anybody else does , and you know I mean no harm -- in short , mean nothing . '
Parsing [sent. 9578 len. 15]: All of which is very true , my dear , but is no justification .
Parsing [sent. 9579 len. 34]: However , as he is now gone so far away and for an indefinite time , and as he will have good opportunities and introductions , we may consider this past and gone .
Parsing [sent. 9580 len. 30]: And you , my dear , '' said the old lady , who was now all nods and smiles , `` regarding your dear self , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9581 len. 7]: `` Me , Mrs. Woodcourt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9582 len. 42]: `` Not to be always selfish , talking of my son , who has gone to seek his fortune and to find a wife -- when do you mean to seek YOUR fortune and to find a husband , Miss Summerson ?
Parsing [sent. 9583 len. 5]: Hey , look you !
Parsing [sent. 9584 len. 5]: Now you blush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9585 len. 38]: I do n't think I did blush -- at all events , it was not important if I did -- and I said my present fortune perfectly contented me and I had no wish to change it .
Parsing [sent. 9586 len. 24]: `` Shall I tell you what I always think of you and the fortune yet to come for you , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9587 len. 4]: said Mrs. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 9588 len. 45]: `` If you believe you are a good prophet , '' said I. `` Why , then , it is that you will marry some one very rich and very worthy , much older -- five and twenty years , perhaps -- than yourself .
Parsing [sent. 9589 len. 17]: And you will be an excellent wife , and much beloved , and very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9590 len. 20]: `` That is a good fortune , '' said I. `` But why is it to be mine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9591 len. 43]: `` My dear , '' she returned , `` there 's suitability in it -- you are so busy , and so neat , and so peculiarly situated altogether that there 's suitability in it , and it will come to pass .
Parsing [sent. 9592 len. 20]: And nobody , my love , will congratulate you more sincerely on such a marriage than I shall . ''
Parsing [sent. 9593 len. 16]: It was curious that this should make me uncomfortable , but I think it did .
Parsing [sent. 9594 len. 5]: I know it did .
Parsing [sent. 9595 len. 11]: It made me for some part of that night uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 9596 len. 27]: I was so ashamed of my folly that I did not like to confess it even to Ada , and that made me more uncomfortable still .
Parsing [sent. 9597 len. 26]: I would have given anything not to have been so much in the bright old lady 's confidence if I could have possibly declined it .
Parsing [sent. 9598 len. 10]: It gave me the most inconsistent opinions of her .
Parsing [sent. 9599 len. 22]: At one time I thought she was a story-teller , and at another time that she was the pink of truth .
Parsing [sent. 9600 len. 24]: Now I suspected that she was very cunning , next moment I believed her honest Welsh heart to be perfectly innocent and simple .
Parsing [sent. 9601 len. 19]: And after all , what did it matter to me , and why did it matter to me ?
Parsing [sent. 9602 len. 54]: Why could not I , going up to bed with my basket of keys , stop to sit down by her fire and accommodate myself for a little while to her , at least as well as to anybody else , and not trouble myself about the harmless things she said to me ?
Parsing [sent. 9603 len. 56]: Impelled towards her , as I certainly was , for I was very anxious that she should like me and was very glad indeed that she did , why should I harp afterwards , with actual distress and pain , on every word she said and weigh it over and over again in twenty scales ?
Parsing [sent. 9604 len. 41]: Why was it so worrying to me to have her in our house , and confidential to me every night , when I yet felt that it was better and safer somehow that she should be there than anywhere else ?
Parsing [sent. 9605 len. 12]: These were perplexities and contradictions that I could not account for .
Parsing [sent. 9606 len. 30]: At least , if I could -- but I shall come to all that by and by , and it is mere idleness to go on about it now .
Parsing [sent. 9607 len. 18]: So when Mrs. Woodcourt went away , I was sorry to lose her but was relieved too .
Parsing [sent. 9608 len. 23]: And then Caddy Jellyby came down , and Caddy brought such a packet of domestic news that it gave us abundant occupation .
Parsing [sent. 9609 len. 23]: First Caddy declared -LRB- and would at first declare nothing else -RRB- that I was the best adviser that ever was known .
Parsing [sent. 9610 len. 24]: This , my pet said , was no news at all ; and this , I said , of course , was nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 9611 len. 34]: Then Caddy told us that she was going to be married in a month and that if Ada and I would be her bridesmaids , she was the happiest girl in the world .
Parsing [sent. 9612 len. 40]: To be sure , this was news indeed ; and I thought we never should have done talking about it , we had so much to say to Caddy , and Caddy had so much to say to us .
Parsing [sent. 9613 len. 104]: It seemed that Caddy 's unfortunate papa had got over his bankruptcy -- `` gone through the Gazette , '' was the expression Caddy used , as if it were a tunnel -- with the general clemency and commiseration of his creditors , and had got rid of his affairs in some blessed manner without succeeding in understanding them , and had given up everything he possessed -LRB- which was not worth much , I should think , to judge from the state of the furniture -RRB- , and had satisfied every one concerned that he could do no more , poor man .
Parsing [sent. 9614 len. 18]: So , he had been honourably dismissed to `` the office '' to begin the world again .
Parsing [sent. 9615 len. 58]: What he did at the office , I never knew ; Caddy said he was a `` custom-house and general agent , '' and the only thing I ever understood about that business was that when he wanted money more than usual he went to the docks to look for it , and hardly ever found it .
Parsing [sent. 9616 len. 97]: As soon as her papa had tranquillized his mind by becoming this shorn lamb , and they had removed to a furnished lodging in Hatton Garden -LRB- where I found the children , when I afterwards went there , cutting the horse hair out of the seats of the chairs and choking themselves with it -RRB- , Caddy had brought about a meeting between him and old Mr. Turveydrop ; and poor Mr. Jellyby , being very humble and meek , had deferred to Mr. Turveydrop 's deportment so submissively that they had become excellent friends .
Parsing [sent. 9617 len. 58]: By degrees , old Mr. Turveydrop , thus familiarized with the idea of his son 's marriage , had worked up his parental feelings to the height of contemplating that event as being near at hand and had given his gracious consent to the young couple commencing housekeeping at the academy in Newman Street when they would .
Parsing [sent. 9618 len. 7]: `` And your papa , Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9619 len. 6]: What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9620 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9621 len. 27]: Poor Pa , '' said Caddy , `` only cried and said he hoped we might get on better than he and Ma had got on .
Parsing [sent. 9622 len. 15]: He did n't say so before Prince , he only said so to me .
Parsing [sent. 9623 len. 56]: And he said , ` My poor girl , you have not been very well taught how to make a home for your husband , but unless you mean with all your heart to strive to do it , you bad better murder him than marry him -- if you really love him . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 9624 len. 11]: `` And how did you reassure him , Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9625 len. 33]: `` Why , it was very distressing , you know , to see poor Pa so low and hear him say such terrible things , and I could n't help crying myself .
Parsing [sent. 9626 len. 54]: But I told him that I DID mean it with all my heart and that I hoped our house would be a place for him to come and find some comfort in of an evening and that I hoped and thought I could be a better daughter to him there than at home .
Parsing [sent. 9627 len. 26]: Then I mentioned Peepy 's coming to stay with me , and then Pa began to cry again and said the children were Indians . ''
Parsing [sent. 9628 len. 6]: `` Indians , Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9629 len. 11]: `` Yes , '' said Caddy , `` wild Indians .
Parsing [sent. 9630 len. 46]: And Pa said '' -- here she began to sob , poor girl , not at all like the happiest girl in the world -- `` that he was sensible the best thing that could happen to them was their being all tomahawked together . ''
Parsing [sent. 9631 len. 18]: Ada suggested that it was comfortable to know that Mr. Jellyby did not mean these destructive sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 9632 len. 67]: `` No , of course I know Pa would n't like his family to be weltering in their blood , '' said Caddy , `` but he means that they are very unfortunate in being Ma 's children and that he is very unfortunate in being Ma 's husband ; and I am sure that 's true , though it seems unnatural to say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 9633 len. 13]: I asked Caddy if Mrs. Jellyby knew that her wedding-day was fixed .
Parsing [sent. 9634 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 9635 len. 12]: You know what Ma is , Esther , '' she returned .
Parsing [sent. 9636 len. 13]: `` It 's impossible to say whether she knows it or not .
Parsing [sent. 9637 len. 70]: She has been told it often enough ; and when she IS told it , she only gives me a placid look , as if I was I do n't know what -- a steeple in the distance , '' said Caddy with a sudden idea ; `` and then she shakes her head and says ` Oh , Caddy , Caddy , what a tease you are ! '
Parsing [sent. 9638 len. 9]: and goes on with the Borrioboola letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 9639 len. 9]: `` And about your wardrobe , Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9640 len. 11]: said I. For she was under no restraint with us .
Parsing [sent. 9641 len. 43]: `` Well , my dear Esther , '' she returned , drying her eyes , `` I must do the best I can and trust to my dear Prince never to have an unkind remembrance of my coming so shabbily to him .
Parsing [sent. 9642 len. 21]: If the question concerned an outfit for Borrioboola , Ma would know all about it and would be quite excited .
Parsing [sent. 9643 len. 12]: Being what it is , she neither knows nor cares . ''
Parsing [sent. 9644 len. 30]: Caddy was not at all deficient in natural affection for her mother , but mentioned this with tears as an undeniable fact , which I am afraid it was .
Parsing [sent. 9645 len. 46]: We were sorry for the poor dear girl and found so much to admire in the good disposition which had survived under such discouragement that we both at once -LRB- I mean Ada and I -RRB- proposed a little scheme that made her perfectly joyful .
Parsing [sent. 9646 len. 52]: This was her staying with us for three weeks , my staying with her for one , and our all three contriving and cutting out , and repairing , and sewing , and saving , and doing the very best we could think of to make the most of her stock .
Parsing [sent. 9647 len. 66]: My guardian being as pleased with the idea as Caddy was , we took her home next day to arrange the matter and brought her out again in triumph with her boxes and all the purchases that could be squeezed out of a ten-pound note , which Mr. Jellyby had found in the docks I suppose , but which he at all events gave her .
Parsing [sent. 9648 len. 37]: What my guardian would not have given her if we had encouraged him , it would be difficult to say , but we thought it right to compound for no more than her wedding-dress and bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 9649 len. 27]: He agreed to this compromise , and if Caddy had ever been happy in her life , she was happy when we sat down to work .
Parsing [sent. 9650 len. 26]: She was clumsy enough with her needle , poor girl , and pricked her fingers as much as she had been used to ink them .
Parsing [sent. 9651 len. 39]: She could not help reddening a little now and then , partly with the smart and partly with vexation at being able to do no better , but she soon got over that and began to improve rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 9652 len. 37]: So day after day she , and my darling , and my little maid Charley , and a milliner out of the town , and I , sat hard at work , as pleasantly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 9653 len. 19]: Over and above this , Caddy was very anxious `` to learn housekeeping , '' as she said .
Parsing [sent. 9654 len. 6]: Now , mercy upon us !
Parsing [sent. 9655 len. 36]: The idea of her learning housekeeping of a person of my vast experience was such a joke that I laughed , and coloured up , and fell into a comical confusion when she proposed it .
Parsing [sent. 9656 len. 44]: However , I said , `` Caddy , I am sure you are very welcome to learn anything that you can learn of ME , my dear , '' and I showed her all my books and methods and all my fidgety ways .
Parsing [sent. 9657 len. 61]: You would have supposed that I was showing her some wonderful inventions , by her study of them ; and if you had seen her , whenever I jingled my housekeeping keys , get up and attend me , certainly you might have thought that there never was a greater imposter than I with a blinder follower than Caddy Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 9658 len. 33]: So what with working and housekeeping , and lessons to Charley , and backgammon in the evening with my guardian , and duets with Ada , the three weeks slipped fast away .
Parsing [sent. 9659 len. 27]: Then I went home with Caddy to see what could be done there , and Ada and Charley remained behind to take care of my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 9660 len. 19]: When I say I went home with Caddy , I mean to the furnished lodging in Hatton Garden .
Parsing [sent. 9661 len. 79]: We went to Newman Street two or three times , where preparations were in progress too -- a good many , I observed , for enhancing the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop , and a few for putting the newly married couple away cheaply at the top of the house -- but our great point was to make the furnished lodging decent for the wedding-breakfast and to imbue Mrs. Jellyby beforehand with some faint sense of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 9662 len. 52]: The latter was the more difficult thing of the two because Mrs. Jellyby and an unwholesome boy occupied the front sitting-room -LRB- the back one was a mere closet -RRB- , and it was littered down with waste-paper and Borrioboolan documents , as an untidy stable might be littered with straw .
Parsing [sent. 9663 len. 19]: Mrs. Jellyby sat there all day drinking strong coffee , dictating , and holding Borrioboolan interviews by appointment .
Parsing [sent. 9664 len. 23]: The unwholesome boy , who seemed to me to be going into a decline , took his meals out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 9665 len. 16]: When Mr. Jellyby came home , he usually groaned and went down into the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 9666 len. 36]: There he got something to eat if the servant would give him anything , and then , feeling that he was in the way , went out and walked about Hatton Garden in the wet .
Parsing [sent. 9667 len. 19]: The poor children scrambled up and tumbled down the house as they had always been accustomed to do .
Parsing [sent. 9668 len. 69]: The production of these devoted little sacrifices in any presentable condition being quite out of the question at a week 's notice , I proposed to Caddy that we should make them as happy as we could on her marriage morning in the attic where they all slept , and should confine our greatest efforts to her mama and her mama 's room , and a clean breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 9669 len. 37]: In truth Mrs. Jellyby required a good deal of attention , the lattice-work up her back having widened considerably since I first knew her and her hair looking like the mane of a dustman 's horse .
Parsing [sent. 9670 len. 44]: Thinking that the display of Caddy 's wardrobe would be the best means of approaching the subject , I invited Mrs. Jellyby to come and look at it spread out on Caddy 's bed in the evening after the unwholesome boy was gone .
Parsing [sent. 9671 len. 39]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , '' said she , rising from her desk with her usual sweetness of temper , `` these are really ridiculous preparations , though your assisting them is a proof of your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 9672 len. 16]: There is something so inexpressibly absurd to me in the idea of Caddy being married !
Parsing [sent. 9673 len. 13]: Oh , Caddy , you silly , silly , silly puss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9674 len. 17]: She came upstairs with us notwithstanding and looked at the clothes in her customary far-off manner .
Parsing [sent. 9675 len. 43]: They suggested one distinct idea to her , for she said with her placid smile , and shaking her head , `` My good Miss Summerson , at half the cost , this weak child might have been equipped for Africa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9676 len. 22]: On our going downstairs again , Mrs. Jellyby asked me whether this troublesome business was really to take place next Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 9677 len. 21]: And on my replying yes , she said , `` Will my room be required , my dear Miss Summerson ?
Parsing [sent. 9678 len. 14]: For it 's quite impossible that I can put my papers away . ''
Parsing [sent. 9679 len. 25]: I took the liberty of saying that the room would certainly be wanted and that I thought we must put the papers away somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9680 len. 22]: `` Well , my dear Miss Summerson , '' said Mrs. Jellyby , `` you know best , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 9681 len. 35]: But by obliging me to employ a boy , Caddy has embarrassed me to that extent , overwhelmed as I am with public business , that I do n't know which way to turn .
Parsing [sent. 9682 len. 20]: We have a Ramification meeting , too , on Wednesday afternoon , and the inconvenience is very serious . ''
Parsing [sent. 9683 len. 15]: `` It is not likely to occur again , '' said I , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 9684 len. 11]: `` Caddy will be married but once , probably . ''
Parsing [sent. 9685 len. 18]: `` That 's true , '' Mrs. Jellyby replied ; `` that 's true , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 9686 len. 11]: I suppose we must make the best of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9687 len. 14]: The next question was how Mrs. Jellyby should be dressed on the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 9688 len. 43]: I thought it very curious to see her looking on serenely from her writing-table while Caddy and I discussed it , occasionally shaking her head at us with a half-reproachful smile like a superior spirit who could just bear with our trifling .
Parsing [sent. 9689 len. 46]: The state in which her dresses were , and the extraordinary confusion in which she kept them , added not a little to our difficulty ; but at length we devised something not very unlike what a common-place mother might wear on such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 9690 len. 55]: The abstracted manner in which Mrs. Jellyby would deliver herself up to having this attire tried on by the dressmaker , and the sweetness with which she would then observe to me how sorry she was that I had not turned my thoughts to Africa , were consistent with the rest of her behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 9691 len. 60]: The lodging was rather confined as to space , but I fancied that if Mrs. Jellyby 's household had been the only lodgers in Saint Paul 's or Saint Peter 's , the sole advantage they would have found in the size of the building would have been its affording a great deal of room to be dirty in .
Parsing [sent. 9692 len. 77]: I believe that nothing belonging to the family which it had been possible to break was unbroken at the time of those preparations for Caddy 's marriage , that nothing which it had been possible to spoil in any way was unspoilt , and that no domestic object which was capable of collecting dirt , from a dear child 's knee to the door-plate , was without as much dirt as could well accumulate upon it .
Parsing [sent. 9693 len. 53]: Poor Mr. Jellyby , who very seldom spoke and almost always sat when he was at home with his head against the wall , became interested when he saw that Caddy and I were attempting to establish some order among all this waste and ruin and took off his coat to help .
Parsing [sent. 9694 len. 117]: But such wonderful things came tumbling out of the closets when they were opened -- bits of mouldy pie , sour bottles , Mrs. Jellyby 's caps , letters , tea , forks , odd boots and shoes of children , firewood , wafers , saucepan-lids , damp sugar in odds and ends of paper bags , footstools , blacklead brushes , bread , Mrs. Jellyby 's bonnets , books with butter sticking to the binding , guttered candle ends put out by being turned upside down in broken candlesticks , nutshells , heads and tails of shrimps , dinner-mats , gloves , coffee-grounds , umbrellas -- that he looked frightened , and left off again .
Parsing [sent. 9695 len. 32]: But he came regularly every evening and sat without his coat , with his head against the wall , as though he would have helped us if he had known how .
Parsing [sent. 9696 len. 5]: `` Poor Pa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9697 len. 23]: said Caddy to me on the night before the great day , when we really had got things a little to rights .
Parsing [sent. 9698 len. 10]: `` It seems unkind to leave him , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 9699 len. 9]: But what could I do if I stayed !
Parsing [sent. 9700 len. 21]: Since I first knew you , I have tidied and tidied over and over again , but it 's useless .
Parsing [sent. 9701 len. 12]: Ma and Africa , together , upset the whole house directly .
Parsing [sent. 9702 len. 10]: We never have a servant who do n't drink .
Parsing [sent. 9703 len. 7]: Ma 's ruinous to everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 9704 len. 22]: Mr. Jellyby could not hear what she said , but he seemed very low indeed and shed tears , I thought .
Parsing [sent. 9705 len. 12]: `` My heart aches for him ; that it does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9706 len. 3]: sobbed Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9707 len. 36]: `` I ca n't help thinking to-night , Esther , how dearly I hope to be happy with Prince , and how dearly Pa hoped , I dare say , to be happy with Ma .
Parsing [sent. 9708 len. 6]: What a disappointed life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9709 len. 6]: `` My dear Caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9710 len. 11]: said Mr. Jellyby , looking slowly round from the wail .
Parsing [sent. 9711 len. 18]: It was the first time , I think , I ever heard him say three words together .
Parsing [sent. 9712 len. 6]: `` Yes , Pa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9713 len. 11]: cried Caddy , going to him and embracing him affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 9714 len. 10]: `` My dear Caddy , '' said Mr. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 9715 len. 12]: `` Never have -- '' `` Not Prince , Pa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9716 len. 3]: faltered Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9717 len. 6]: `` Not have Prince ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9718 len. 11]: `` Yes , my dear , '' said Mr. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 9719 len. 6]: `` Have him , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 9720 len. 34]: But , never have -- '' I mentioned in my account of our first visit in Thavies Inn that Richard described Mr. Jellyby as frequently opening his mouth after dinner without saying anything .
Parsing [sent. 9721 len. 7]: It was a habit of his .
Parsing [sent. 9722 len. 18]: He opened his mouth now a great many times and shook his head in a melancholy manner .
Parsing [sent. 9723 len. 10]: `` What do you wish me not to have ?
Parsing [sent. 9724 len. 9]: Do n't have what , dear Pa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9725 len. 13]: asked Caddy , coaxing him , with her arms round his neck .
Parsing [sent. 9726 len. 11]: `` Never have a mission , my dear child . ''
Parsing [sent. 9727 len. 34]: Mr. Jellyby groaned and laid his head against the wall again , and this was the only time I ever heard him make any approach to expressing his sentiments on the Borrioboolan question .
Parsing [sent. 9728 len. 25]: I suppose he had been more talkative and lively once , but he seemed to have been completely exhausted long before I knew him .
Parsing [sent. 9729 len. 20]: I thought Mrs. Jellyby never would have left off serenely looking over her papers and drinking coffee that night .
Parsing [sent. 9730 len. 42]: It was twelve o'clock before we could obtain possession of the room , and the clearance it required then was so discouraging that Caddy , who was almost tired out , sat down in the middle of the dust and cried .
Parsing [sent. 9731 len. 18]: But she soon cheered up , and we did wonders with it before we went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 9732 len. 28]: In the morning it looked , by the aid of a few flowers and a quantity of soap and water and a little arrangement , quite gay .
Parsing [sent. 9733 len. 14]: The plain breakfast made a cheerful show , and Caddy was perfectly charming .
Parsing [sent. 9734 len. 29]: But when my darling came , I thought -- and I think now -- that I never had seen such a dear face as my beautiful pet 's .
Parsing [sent. 9735 len. 80]: We made a little feast for the children upstairs , and we put Peepy at the head of the table , and we showed them Caddy in her bridal dress , and they clapped their hands and hurrahed , and Caddy cried to think that she was going away from them and hugged them over and over again until we brought Prince up to fetch her away -- when , I am sorry to say , Peepy bit him .
Parsing [sent. 9736 len. 47]: Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop downstairs , in a state of deportment not to be expressed , benignly blessing Caddy and giving my guardian to understand that his son 's happiness was his own parental work and that he sacrificed personal considerations to ensure it .
Parsing [sent. 9737 len. 39]: `` My dear sir , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` these young people will live with me ; my house is large enough for their accommodation , and they shall not want the shelter of my roof .
Parsing [sent. 9738 len. 51]: I could have wished -- you will understand the allusion , Mr. Jarndyce , for you remember my illustrious patron the Prince Regent -- I could have wished that my son had married into a family where there was more deportment , but the will of heaven be done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9739 len. 49]: Mr. and Mrs. Pardiggle were of the party -- Mr. Pardiggle , an obstinate-looking man with a large waistcoat and stubbly hair , who was always talking in a loud bass voice about his mite , or Mrs. Pardiggle 's mite , or their five boys ' mites .
Parsing [sent. 9740 len. 57]: Mr. Quale , with his hair brushed back as usual and his knobs of temples shining very much , was also there , not in the character of a disappointed lover , but as the accepted of a young -- at least , an unmarried -- lady , a Miss Wisk , who was also there .
Parsing [sent. 9741 len. 48]: Miss Wisk 's mission , my guardian said , was to show the world that woman 's mission was man 's mission and that the only genuine mission of both man and woman was to be always moving declaratory resolutions about things in general at public meetings .
Parsing [sent. 9742 len. 24]: The guests were few , but were , as one might expect at Mrs. Jellyby 's , all devoted to public objects only .
Parsing [sent. 9743 len. 52]: Besides those I have mentioned , there was an extremely dirty lady with her bonnet all awry and the ticketed price of her dress still sticking on it , whose neglected home , Caddy told me , was like a filthy wilderness , but whose church was like a fancy fair .
Parsing [sent. 9744 len. 37]: A very contentious gentleman , who said it was his mission to be everybody 's brother but who appeared to be on terms of coolness with the whole of his large family , completed the party .
Parsing [sent. 9745 len. 22]: A party , having less in common with such an occasion , could hardly have been got together by any ingenuity .
Parsing [sent. 9746 len. 65]: Such a mean mission as the domestic mission was the very last thing to be endured among them ; indeed , Miss Wisk informed us , with great indignation , before we sat down to breakfast , that the idea of woman 's mission lying chiefly in the narrow sphere of home was an outrageous slander on the part of her tyrant , man .
Parsing [sent. 9747 len. 43]: One other singularity was that nobody with a mission -- except Mr. Quale , whose mission , as I think I have formerly said , was to be in ecstasies with everybody 's mission -- cared at all for anybody 's mission .
Parsing [sent. 9748 len. 54]: Mrs. Pardiggle being as clear that the only one infallible course was her course of pouncing upon the poor and applying benevolence to them like a strait-waistcoat ; as Miss Wisk was that the only practical thing for the world was the emancipation of woman from the thraldom of her tyrant , man .
Parsing [sent. 9749 len. 22]: Mrs. Jellyby , all the while , sat smiling at the limited vision that could see anything but Borrioboola -- Gha .
Parsing [sent. 9750 len. 20]: But I am anticipating now the purport of our conversation on the ride home instead of first marrying Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9751 len. 13]: We all went to church , and Mr. Jellyby gave her away .
Parsing [sent. 9752 len. 63]: Of the air with which old Mr. Turveydrop , with his hat under his left arm -LRB- the inside presented at the clergyman like a cannon -RRB- and his eyes creasing themselves up into his wig , stood stiff and high-shouldered behind us bridesmaids during the ceremony , and afterwards saluted us , I could never say enough to do it justice .
Parsing [sent. 9753 len. 36]: Miss Wisk , whom I can not report as prepossessing in appearance , and whose manner was grim , listened to the proceedings , as part of woman 's wrongs , with a disdainful face .
Parsing [sent. 9754 len. 21]: Mrs. Jellyby , with her calm smile and her bright eyes , looked the least concerned of all the company .
Parsing [sent. 9755 len. 24]: We duly came back to breakfast , and Mrs. Jellyby sat at the head of the table and Mr. Jellyby at the foot .
Parsing [sent. 9756 len. 19]: Caddy had previously stolen upstairs to hug the children again and tell them that her name was Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 9757 len. 50]: But this piece of information , instead of being an agreeable surprise to Peepy , threw him on his back in such transports of kicking grief that I could do nothing on being sent for but accede to the proposal that he should be admitted to the breakfast table .
Parsing [sent. 9758 len. 42]: So he came down and sat in my lap ; and Mrs. Jellyby , after saying , in reference to the state of his pinafore , `` Oh , you naughty Peepy , what a shocking little pig you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9759 len. 6]: was not at all discomposed .
Parsing [sent. 9760 len. 44]: He was very good except that he brought down Noah with him -LRB- out of an ark I had given him before we went to church -RRB- and WOULD dip him head first into the wine-glasses and then put him in his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 9761 len. 26]: My guardian , with his sweet temper and his quick perception and his amiable face , made something agreeable even out of the ungenial company .
Parsing [sent. 9762 len. 69]: None of them seemed able to talk about anything but his , or her , own one subject , and none of them seemed able to talk about even that as part of a world in which there was anything else ; but my guardian turned it all to the merry encouragement of Caddy and the honour of the occasion , and brought us through the breakfast nobly .
Parsing [sent. 9763 len. 55]: What we should have done without him , I am afraid to think , for all the company despising the bride and bridegroom and old Mr. Turveydrop -- and old Mr. Thrveydrop , in virtue of his deportment , considering himself vastly superior to all the company -- it was a very unpromising case .
Parsing [sent. 9764 len. 35]: At last the time came when poor Caddy was to go and when all her property was packed on the hired coach and pair that was to take her and her husband to Gravesend .
Parsing [sent. 9765 len. 26]: It affected us to see Caddy clinging , then , to her deplorable home and hanging on her mother 's neck with the greatest tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 9766 len. 20]: `` I am very sorry I could n't go on writing from dictation , Ma , '' sobbed Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9767 len. 9]: `` I hope you forgive me now . ''
Parsing [sent. 9768 len. 8]: `` Oh , Caddy , Caddy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9769 len. 4]: said Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 9770 len. 25]: `` I have told you over and over again that I have engaged a boy , and there 's an end of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 9771 len. 15]: `` You are sure you are not the least angry with me , Ma ?
Parsing [sent. 9772 len. 12]: Say you are sure before I go away , Ma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9773 len. 30]: `` You foolish Caddy , '' returned Mrs. Jellyby , `` do I look angry , or have I inclination to be angry , or time to be angry ?
Parsing [sent. 9774 len. 5]: How CAN you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9775 len. 15]: `` Take a little care of Pa while I am gone , Mama ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9776 len. 8]: Mrs. Jellyby positively laughed at the fancy .
Parsing [sent. 9777 len. 15]: `` You romantic child , '' said she , lightly patting Caddy 's back .
Parsing [sent. 9778 len. 4]: `` Go along .
Parsing [sent. 9779 len. 7]: I am excellent friends with you .
Parsing [sent. 9780 len. 12]: Now , good-bye , Caddy , and be very happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9781 len. 23]: Then Caddy hung upon her father and nursed his cheek against hers as if he were some poor dull child in pain .
Parsing [sent. 9782 len. 8]: All this took place in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 9783 len. 24]: Her father released her , took out his pocket handkerchief , and sat down on the stairs with his head against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 9784 len. 9]: I hope he found some consolation in walls .
Parsing [sent. 9785 len. 6]: I almost think he did .
Parsing [sent. 9786 len. 27]: And then Prince took her arm in his and turned with great emotion and respect to his father , whose deportment at that moment was overwhelming .
Parsing [sent. 9787 len. 11]: `` Thank you over and over again , father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9788 len. 7]: said Prince , kissing his hand .
Parsing [sent. 9789 len. 27]: `` I am very grateful for all your kindness and consideration regarding our marriage , and so , I can assure you , is Caddy . ''
Parsing [sent. 9790 len. 7]: `` Very , '' sobbed Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9791 len. 4]: `` Ve-ry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9792 len. 21]: `` My dear son , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` and dear daughter , I have done my duty .
Parsing [sent. 9793 len. 29]: If the spirit of a sainted wooman hovers above us and looks down on the occasion , that , and your constant affection , will be my recompense .
Parsing [sent. 9794 len. 17]: You will not fail in YOUR duty , my son and daughter , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9795 len. 7]: `` Dear father , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9796 len. 3]: cried Prince .
Parsing [sent. 9797 len. 10]: `` Never , never , dear Mr. Turveydrop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9798 len. 3]: said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 9799 len. 15]: `` This , '' returned Mr. Turveydrop , `` is as it should be .
Parsing [sent. 9800 len. 18]: My children , my home is yours , my heart is yours , my all is yours .
Parsing [sent. 9801 len. 13]: I will never leave you ; nothing but death shall part us .
Parsing [sent. 9802 len. 16]: My dear son , you contemplate an absence of a week , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9803 len. 7]: `` A week , dear father .
Parsing [sent. 9804 len. 9]: We shall return home this day week . ''
Parsing [sent. 9805 len. 25]: `` My dear child , '' said Mr. Turveydrop , `` let me , even under the present exceptional circumstances , recommend strict punctuality .
Parsing [sent. 9806 len. 25]: It is highly important to keep the connexion together ; and schools , if at all neglected , are apt to take offence . ''
Parsing [sent. 9807 len. 18]: `` This day week , father , we shall be sure to be home to dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 9808 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9809 len. 4]: said Mr. Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 9810 len. 22]: `` You will find fires , my dear Caroline , in your own room , and dinner prepared in my apartment .
Parsing [sent. 9811 len. 7]: Yes , yes , Prince ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9812 len. 14]: anticipating some self-denying objection on his son 's part with a great air .
Parsing [sent. 9813 len. 27]: `` You and our Caroline will be strange in the upper part of the premises and will , therefore , dine that day in my apartment .
Parsing [sent. 9814 len. 6]: Now , bless ye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9815 len. 22]: They drove away , and whether I wondered most at Mrs. Jellyby or at Mr. Turveydrop , I did not know .
Parsing [sent. 9816 len. 17]: Ada and my guardian were in the same condition when we came to talk it over .
Parsing [sent. 9817 len. 19]: But before we drove away too , I received a most unexpected and eloquent compliment from Mr. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 9818 len. 24]: He came up to me in the hall , took both my hands , pressed them earnestly , and opened his mouth twice .
Parsing [sent. 9819 len. 22]: I was so sure of his meaning that I said , quite flurried , `` You are very welcome , sir .
Parsing [sent. 9820 len. 7]: Pray do n't mention it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9821 len. 24]: `` I hope this marriage is for the best , guardian , '' said I when we three were on our road home .
Parsing [sent. 9822 len. 9]: `` I hope it is , little woman .
Parsing [sent. 9823 len. 2]: Patience .
Parsing [sent. 9824 len. 5]: We shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 9825 len. 10]: `` Is the wind in the east to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9826 len. 6]: I ventured to ask him .
Parsing [sent. 9827 len. 10]: He laughed heartily and answered , `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 9828 len. 16]: `` But it must have been this morning , I think , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 9829 len. 41]: He answered `` No '' again , and this time my dear girl confidently answered `` No '' too and shook the lovely head which , with its blooming flowers against the golden hair , was like the very spring .
Parsing [sent. 9830 len. 28]: `` Much YOU know of east winds , my ugly darling , '' said I , kissing her in my admiration -- I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 9831 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 9832 len. 21]: It was only their love for me , I know very well , and it is a long time ago .
Parsing [sent. 9833 len. 20]: I must write it even if I rub it out again , because it gives me so much pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 9834 len. 27]: They said there could be no east wind where Somebody was ; they said that wherever Dame Durden went , there was sunshine and summer air .
Parsing [sent. 9835 len. 44]: Chapter XXXI -- Nurse and Patient I had not been at home again many days when one evening I went upstairs into my own room to take a peep over Charley 's shoulder and see how she was getting on with her copy-book .
Parsing [sent. 9836 len. 53]: Writing was a trying business to Charley , who seemed to have no natural power over a pen , but in whose hand every pen appeared to become perversely animated , and to go wrong and crooked , and to stop , and splash , and sidle into corners like a saddle-donkey .
Parsing [sent. 9837 len. 32]: It was very odd to see what old letters Charley 's young hand had made , they so wrinkled , and shrivelled , and tottering , it so plump and round .
Parsing [sent. 9838 len. 19]: Yet Charley was uncommonly expert at other things and had as nimble little fingers as I ever watched .
Parsing [sent. 9839 len. 42]: `` Well , Charley , '' said I , looking over a copy of the letter O in which it was represented as square , triangular , pear-shaped , and collapsed in all kinds of ways , `` we are improving .
Parsing [sent. 9840 len. 17]: If we only get to make it round , we shall be perfect , Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 9841 len. 28]: Then I made one , and Charley made one , and the pen would n't join Charley 's neatly , but twisted it up into a knot .
Parsing [sent. 9842 len. 6]: `` Never mind , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9843 len. 8]: We shall do it in time . ''
Parsing [sent. 9844 len. 43]: Charley laid down her pen , the copy being finished , opened and shut her cramped little hand , looked gravely at the page , half in pride and half in doubt , and got up , and dropped me a curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 9845 len. 6]: `` Thank you , miss .
Parsing [sent. 9846 len. 19]: If you please , miss , did you know a poor person of the name of Jenny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9847 len. 8]: `` A brickmaker 's wife , Charley ?
Parsing [sent. 9848 len. 3]: Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 9849 len. 24]: `` She came and spoke to me when I was out a little while ago , and said you knew her , miss .
Parsing [sent. 9850 len. 31]: She asked me if I was n't the young lady 's little maid -- meaning you for the young lady , miss -- and I said yes , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 9851 len. 13]: `` I thought she had left this neighbourhood altogether , Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 9852 len. 24]: `` So she had , miss , but she 's come back again to where she used to live -- she and Liz .
Parsing [sent. 9853 len. 15]: Did you know another poor person of the name of Liz , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9854 len. 14]: `` I think I do , Charley , though not by name . ''
Parsing [sent. 9855 len. 8]: `` That 's what she said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9856 len. 3]: returned Chariey .
Parsing [sent. 9857 len. 18]: `` They have both come back , miss , and have been tramping high and low . ''
Parsing [sent. 9858 len. 12]: `` Tramping high and low , have they , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9859 len. 6]: `` Yes , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 9860 len. 30]: If Charley could only have made the letters in her copy as round as the eyes with which she looked into my face , they would have been excellent .
Parsing [sent. 9861 len. 36]: `` And this poor person came about the house three or four days , hoping to get a glimpse of you , miss -- all she wanted , she said -- but you were away .
Parsing [sent. 9862 len. 7]: That was when she saw me .
Parsing [sent. 9863 len. 33]: She saw me a-going about , miss , '' said Charley with a short laugh of the greatest delight and pride , `` and she thought I looked like your maid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9864 len. 10]: `` Did she though , really , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9865 len. 6]: `` Yes , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9866 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9867 len. 6]: `` Really and truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 9868 len. 27]: And Charley , with another short laugh of the purest glee , made her eyes very round again and looked as serious as became my maid .
Parsing [sent. 9869 len. 46]: I was never tired of seeing Charley in the full enjoyment of that great dignity , standing before me with her youthful face and figure , and her steady manner , and her childish exultation breaking through it now and then in the pleasantest way .
Parsing [sent. 9870 len. 11]: `` And where did you see her , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9871 len. 22]: said I. My little maid 's countenance fell as she replied , `` By the doctor 's shop , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 9872 len. 8]: For Charley wore her black frock yet .
Parsing [sent. 9873 len. 15]: I asked if the brickmaker 's wife were ill , but Charley said no .
Parsing [sent. 9874 len. 6]: It was some one else .
Parsing [sent. 9875 len. 21]: Some one in her cottage who had tramped down to Saint Albans and was tramping he did n't know where .
Parsing [sent. 9876 len. 7]: A poor boy , Charley said .
Parsing [sent. 9877 len. 10]: No father , no mother , no any one .
Parsing [sent. 9878 len. 30]: `` Like as Tom might have been , miss , if Emma and me had died after father , '' said Charley , her round eyes filling with tears .
Parsing [sent. 9879 len. 12]: `` And she was getting medicine for him , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9880 len. 23]: `` She said , miss , '' returned Charley , `` how that he had once done as much for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 9881 len. 36]: My little maid 's face was so eager and her quiet hands were folded so closely in one another as she stood looking at me that I had no great difficulty in reading her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 9882 len. 36]: `` Well , Charley , '' said I , `` it appears to me that you and I can do no better than go round to Jenny 's and see what 's the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 9883 len. 38]: The alacrity with which Charley brought my bonnet and veil , and having dressed me , quaintly pinned herself into her warm shawl and made herself look like a little old woman , sufficiently expressed her readiness .
Parsing [sent. 9884 len. 15]: So Charley and I , without saying anything to any one , went out .
Parsing [sent. 9885 len. 16]: It was a cold , wild night , and the trees shuddered in the wind .
Parsing [sent. 9886 len. 18]: The rain had been thick and heavy all day , and with little intermission for many days .
Parsing [sent. 9887 len. 8]: None was falling just then , however .
Parsing [sent. 9888 len. 22]: The sky had partly cleared , but was very gloomy -- even above us , where a few stars were shining .
Parsing [sent. 9889 len. 46]: In the north and north-west , where the sun had set three hours before , there was a pale dead light both beautiful and awful ; and into it long sullen lines of cloud waved up like a sea stricken immovable as it was heaving .
Parsing [sent. 9890 len. 61]: Towards London a lurid glare overhung the whole dark waste , and the contrast between these two lights , and the fancy which the redder light engendered of an unearthly fire , gleaming on all the unseen buildings of the city and on all the faces of its many thousands of wondering inhabitants , was as solemn as might be .
Parsing [sent. 9891 len. 23]: I had no thought that night -- none , I am quite sure -- of what was soon to happen to me .
Parsing [sent. 9892 len. 49]: But I have always remembered since that when we had stopped at the garden-gate to look up at the sky , and when we went upon our way , I had for a moment an undefinable impression of myself as being something different from what I then was .
Parsing [sent. 9893 len. 12]: I know it was then and there that I had it .
Parsing [sent. 9894 len. 47]: I have ever since connected the feeling with that spot and time and with everything associated with that spot and time , to the distant voices in the town , the barking of a dog , and the sound of wheels coming down the miry hill .
Parsing [sent. 9895 len. 22]: It was Saturday night , and most of the people belonging to the place where we were going were drinking elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 9896 len. 16]: We found it quieter than I had previously seen it , though quite as miserable .
Parsing [sent. 9897 len. 17]: The kilns were burning , and a stifling vapour set towards us with a pale-blue glare .
Parsing [sent. 9898 len. 17]: We came to the cottage , where there was a feeble candle in the patched window .
Parsing [sent. 9899 len. 9]: We tapped at the door and went in .
Parsing [sent. 9900 len. 45]: The mother of the little child who had died was sitting in a chair on one side of the poor fire by the bed ; and opposite to her , a wretched boy , supported by the chimney-piece , was cowering on the floor .
Parsing [sent. 9901 len. 36]: He held under his arm , like a little bundle , a fragment of a fur cap ; and as he tried to warm himself , he shook until the crazy door and window shook .
Parsing [sent. 9902 len. 16]: The place was closer than before and had an unhealthy and a very peculiar smell .
Parsing [sent. 9903 len. 24]: I had not lifted by veil when I first spoke to the woman , which was at the moment of our going in .
Parsing [sent. 9904 len. 18]: The boy staggered up instantly and stared at me with a remarkable expression of surprise and terror .
Parsing [sent. 9905 len. 24]: His action was so quick and my being the cause of it was so evident that I stood still instead of advancing nearer .
Parsing [sent. 9906 len. 30]: `` I wo n't go no more to the berryin ground , '' muttered the boy ; `` I ai n't a-going there , so I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9907 len. 10]: I lifted my veil and spoke to the woman .
Parsing [sent. 9908 len. 17]: She said to me in a low voice , `` Do n't mind him , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 9909 len. 26]: He 'll soon come back to his head , '' and said to him , `` Jo , Jo , what 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9910 len. 10]: `` I know wot she 's come for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9911 len. 4]: cried the boy .
Parsing [sent. 9912 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9913 len. 5]: `` The lady there .
Parsing [sent. 9914 len. 16]: She 's come to get me to go along with her to the berryin ground .
Parsing [sent. 9915 len. 9]: I wo n't go to the berryin ground .
Parsing [sent. 9916 len. 9]: I do n't like the name on it .
Parsing [sent. 9917 len. 7]: She might go a-berryin ME . ''
Parsing [sent. 9918 len. 19]: His shivering came on again , and as he leaned against the wall , he shook the hovel .
Parsing [sent. 9919 len. 21]: `` He has been talking off and on about such like all day , ma'am , '' said Jenny softly .
Parsing [sent. 9920 len. 7]: `` Why , how you stare !
Parsing [sent. 9921 len. 8]: This is MY lady , Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 9922 len. 5]: `` Is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9923 len. 18]: returned the boy doubtfully , and surveying me with his arm held out above his burning eyes .
Parsing [sent. 9924 len. 11]: `` She looks to me the t ` other one .
Parsing [sent. 9925 len. 26]: It ai n't the bonnet , nor yet it ai n't the gownd , but she looks to me the t ` other one . ''
Parsing [sent. 9926 len. 42]: My little Charley , with her premature experience of illness and trouble , had pulled off her bonnet and shawl and now went quietly up to him with a chair and sat him down in it like an old sick nurse .
Parsing [sent. 9927 len. 21]: Except that no such attendant could have shown him Charley 's youthful face , which seemed to engage his confidence .
Parsing [sent. 9928 len. 5]: `` I say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9929 len. 4]: said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 9930 len. 5]: `` YOU tell me .
Parsing [sent. 9931 len. 11]: Ai n't the lady the t ` other lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9932 len. 21]: Charley shook her head as she methodically drew his rags about him and made him as warm as she could .
Parsing [sent. 9933 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9934 len. 4]: the boy muttered .
Parsing [sent. 9935 len. 11]: `` Then I s ` pose she ai n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 9936 len. 25]: `` I came to see if I could do you any good , '' said I. `` What is the matter with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9937 len. 43]: `` I 'm a-being froze , '' returned the boy hoarsely , with his haggard gaze wandering about me , `` and then burnt up , and then froze , and then burnt up , ever so many times in a hour .
Parsing [sent. 9938 len. 30]: And my head 's all sleepy , and all a-going mad-like -- and I 'm so dry -- and my bones is n't half so much bones as pain .
Parsing [sent. 9939 len. 8]: `` When did he come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9940 len. 5]: I asked the woman .
Parsing [sent. 9941 len. 16]: `` This morning , ma'am , I found him at the corner of the town .
Parsing [sent. 9942 len. 9]: I had known him up in London yonder .
Parsing [sent. 9943 len. 7]: Had n't I , Jo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9944 len. 11]: `` Tom-all -- Alone 's , '' the boy replied .
Parsing [sent. 9945 len. 18]: Whenever he fixed his attention or his eyes , it was only for a very little while .
Parsing [sent. 9946 len. 23]: He soon began to droop his head again , and roll it heavily , and speak as if he were half awake .
Parsing [sent. 9947 len. 9]: `` When did he come from London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9948 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9949 len. 20]: `` I come from London yes ` day , '' said the boy himself , now flushed and hot .
Parsing [sent. 9950 len. 7]: `` I 'm a-going somewheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 9951 len. 7]: `` Where is he going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9952 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 9953 len. 12]: `` Somewheres , '' repeated the boy in a louder tone .
Parsing [sent. 9954 len. 31]: `` I have been moved on , and moved on , more nor ever I was afore , since the t ` other one give me the sov ` ring .
Parsing [sent. 9955 len. 20]: Mrs. Snagsby , she 's always a-watching , and a-driving of me -- what have I done to her ?
Parsing [sent. 9956 len. 11]: -- and they 're all a-watching and a-driving of me .
Parsing [sent. 9957 len. 30]: Every one of 'em 's doing of it , from the time when I do n't get up , to the time when I do n't go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 9958 len. 6]: And I 'm a-going somewheres .
Parsing [sent. 9959 len. 9]: That 's where I 'm a -- going .
Parsing [sent. 9960 len. 25]: She told me , down in Tom-all -- Alone 's , as she came from Stolbuns , and so I took the Stolbuns Road .
Parsing [sent. 9961 len. 8]: It 's as good as another . ''
Parsing [sent. 9962 len. 7]: He always concluded by addressing Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9963 len. 10]: `` What is to be done with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9964 len. 8]: said I , taking the woman aside .
Parsing [sent. 9965 len. 22]: `` He could not travel in this state even if he had a purpose and knew where he was going ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9966 len. 21]: `` I know no more , ma'am , than the dead , '' she replied , glancing compassionately at him .
Parsing [sent. 9967 len. 14]: `` Perhaps the dead know better , if they could only tell us .
Parsing [sent. 9968 len. 89]: I 've kept him here all day for pity 's sake , and I 've given him broth and physic , and Liz has gone to try if any one will take him in -LRB- here 's my pretty in the bed -- her child , but I call it mine -RRB- ; but I ca n't keep him long , for if my husband was to come home and find him here , he 'd be rough in putting him out and might do him a hurt .
Parsing [sent. 9969 len. 2]: Hark !
Parsing [sent. 9970 len. 6]: Here comes Liz back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9971 len. 27]: The other woman came hurriedly in as she spoke , and the boy got up with a half-obscured sense that he was expected to be going .
Parsing [sent. 9972 len. 34]: When the little child awoke , and when and how Charley got at it , took it out of bed , and began to walk about hushing it , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 9973 len. 28]: There she was , doing all this in a quiet motherly manner as if she were living in Mrs. Blinder 's attic with Tom and Emma again .
Parsing [sent. 9974 len. 26]: The friend had been here and there , and had been played about from hand to hand , and had come back as she went .
Parsing [sent. 9975 len. 25]: At first it was too early for the boy to be received into the proper refuge , and at last it was too late .
Parsing [sent. 9976 len. 48]: One official sent her to another , and the other sent her back again to the first , and so backward and forward , until it appeared to me as if both must have been appointed for their skill in evading their duties instead of performing them .
Parsing [sent. 9977 len. 57]: And now , after all , she said , breathing quickly , for she had been running and was frightened too , `` Jenny , your master 's on the road home , and mine 's not far behind , and the Lord help the boy , for we can do no more for him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9978 len. 32]: They put a few halfpence together and hurried them into his hand , and so , in an oblivious , half-thankful , half-insensible way , he shuffled out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 9979 len. 23]: `` Give me the child , my dear , '' said its mother to Charley , `` and thank you kindly too !
Parsing [sent. 9980 len. 8]: Jenny , woman dear , good night !
Parsing [sent. 9981 len. 39]: Young lady , if my master do n't fall out with me , I 'll look down by the kiln by and by , where the boy will be most like , and again in the morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 9982 len. 30]: She hurried off , and presenfty we passed her hushing and singing to her child at her own door and looking anxiously along the road for her drunken husband .
Parsing [sent. 9983 len. 20]: I was afraid of staying then to speak to either woman , lest I should bring her into trouble .
Parsing [sent. 9984 len. 15]: But I said to Charley that we must not leave the boy to die .
Parsing [sent. 9985 len. 41]: Charley , who knew what to do much better than I did , and whose quickness equalled her presence of mind , glided on before me , and presently we came up with Jo , just short of the brick-kiln .
Parsing [sent. 9986 len. 25]: I think he must have begun his journey with some small bundle under his arm and must have had it stolen or lost it .
Parsing [sent. 9987 len. 27]: For he still carried his wretched fragment of fur cap like a bundle , though he went bareheaded through the rain , which now fell fast .
Parsing [sent. 9988 len. 36]: He stopped when we called to him and again showed a dread of me when I came up , standing with his lustrous eyes fixed upon me , and even arrested in his shivering fit .
Parsing [sent. 9989 len. 22]: I asked him to come with us , and we would take care that he had some shelter for the night .
Parsing [sent. 9990 len. 22]: `` I do n't want no shelter , '' he said ; `` I can lay amongst the warm bricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 9991 len. 12]: `` But do n't you know that people die there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9992 len. 3]: replied Charley .
Parsing [sent. 9993 len. 10]: `` They dies everywheres , '' said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 9994 len. 27]: `` They dies in their lodgings -- she knows where ; I showed her -- and they dies down in Tom-all -- Alone 's in heaps .
Parsing [sent. 9995 len. 14]: They dies more than they lives , according to what I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 9996 len. 23]: Then he hoarsely whispered Charley , `` If she ai n't the t ` other one , she ai n't the forrenner .
Parsing [sent. 9997 len. 8]: Is there THREE of 'em then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 9998 len. 8]: Charley looked at me a little frightened .
Parsing [sent. 9999 len. 14]: I felt half frightened at myself when the boy glared on me so .
Parsing [sent. 10000 len. 28]: But he turned and followed when I beckoned to him , and finding that he acknowledged that influence in me , I led the way straight home .
Parsing [sent. 10001 len. 13]: It was not far , only at the summit of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 10002 len. 6]: We passed but one man .
Parsing [sent. 10003 len. 21]: I doubted if we should have got home without assistance , the boy 's steps were so uncertain and tremulous .
Parsing [sent. 10004 len. 23]: He made no complaint , however , and was strangely unconcerned about himself , if I may say so strange a thing .
Parsing [sent. 10005 len. 46]: Leaving him in the hall for a moment , shrunk into the corner of the window-seat and staring with an indifference that scarcely could be called wonder at the comfort and brightness about him , I went into the drawing-room to speak to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 10006 len. 36]: There I found Mr. Skimpole , who had come down by the coach , as he frequently did without notice , and never bringing any clothes with him , but always borrowing everything he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 10007 len. 12]: They came out with me directly to look at the boy .
Parsing [sent. 10008 len. 33]: The servants had gathered in the hall too , and he shivered in the window-seat with Charley standing by him , like some wounded animal that had been found in a ditch .
Parsing [sent. 10009 len. 26]: `` This is a sorrowful case , '' said my guardian after asking him a question or two and touching him and examining his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 10010 len. 9]: `` What do you say , Harold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10011 len. 13]: `` You had better turn him out , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 10012 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10013 len. 7]: inquired my guardian , almost sternly .
Parsing [sent. 10014 len. 22]: `` My dear Jarndyce , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` you know what I am : I am a child .
Parsing [sent. 10015 len. 9]: Be cross to me if I deserve it .
Parsing [sent. 10016 len. 12]: But I have a constitutional objection to this sort of thing .
Parsing [sent. 10017 len. 11]: I always had , when I was a medical man .
Parsing [sent. 10018 len. 8]: He 's not safe , you know .
Parsing [sent. 10019 len. 12]: There 's a very bad sort of fever about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 10020 len. 28]: Mr. Skimpole had retreated from the hall to the drawing-room again and said this in his airy way , seated on the music-stool as we stood by .
Parsing [sent. 10021 len. 18]: `` You 'll say it 's childish , '' observed Mr. Skimpole , looking gaily at us .
Parsing [sent. 10022 len. 25]: `` Well , I dare say it may be ; but I AM a child , and I never pretend to be anything else .
Parsing [sent. 10023 len. 18]: If you put him out in the road , you only put him where he was before .
Parsing [sent. 10024 len. 13]: He will be no worse off than he was , you know .
Parsing [sent. 10025 len. 10]: Even make him better off , if you like .
Parsing [sent. 10026 len. 29]: Give him sixpence , or five shillings , or five pound ten -- you are arithmeticians , and I am not -- and get rid of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10027 len. 10]: `` And what is he to do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10028 len. 4]: asked my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 10029 len. 32]: `` Upon my life , '' said Mr. Skimpole , shrugging his shoulders with his engaging smile , `` I have not the least idea what he is to do then .
Parsing [sent. 10030 len. 11]: But I have no doubt he 'll do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10031 len. 85]: `` Now , is it not a horrible reflection , '' said my guardian , to whom I had hastily explained the unavailing efforts of the two women , `` is it not a horrible reflection , '' walking up and down and rumpling his hair , `` that if this wretched creature were a convicted prisoner , his hospital would be wide open to him , and he would be as well taken care of as any sick boy in the kingdom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10032 len. 45]: `` My dear Jarndyce , '' returned Mr. Skimpole , `` you 'll pardon the simplicity of the question , coming as it does from a creature who is perfectly simple in worldly matters , but why IS N'T he a prisoner then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10033 len. 19]: My guardian stopped and looked at him with a whimsical mixture of amusement and indignation in his face .
Parsing [sent. 10034 len. 26]: `` Our young friend is not to be suspected of any delicacy , I should imagine , '' said Mr. Skimpole , unabashed and candid .
Parsing [sent. 10035 len. 35]: `` It seems to me that it would be wiser , as well as in a certain kind of way more respectable , if he showed some misdirected energy that got him into prison .
Parsing [sent. 10036 len. 22]: There would be more of an adventurous spirit in it , and consequently more of a certain sort of poetry . ''
Parsing [sent. 10037 len. 28]: `` I believe , '' returned my guardian , resuming his uneasy walk , `` that there is not such another child on earth as yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 10038 len. 6]: `` Do you really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10039 len. 4]: said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 10040 len. 5]: `` I dare say !
Parsing [sent. 10041 len. 31]: But I confess I do n't see why our young friend , in his degree , should not seek to invest himself with such poetry as is open to him .
Parsing [sent. 10042 len. 27]: He is no doubt born with an appetite -- probably , when he is in a safer state of health , he has an excellent appetite .
Parsing [sent. 10043 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 10044 len. 42]: At our young friend 's natural dinner hour , most likely about noon , our young friend says in effect to society , ' I am hungry ; will you have the goodness to produce your spoon and feed me ? '
Parsing [sent. 10045 len. 53]: Society , which has taken upon itself the general arrangement of the whole system of spoons and professes to have a spoon for our young friend , does NOT produce that spoon ; and our young friend , therefore , says ` You really must excuse me if I seize it . '
Parsing [sent. 10046 len. 67]: Now , this appears to me a case of misdirected energy , which has a certain amount of reason in it and a certain amount of romance ; and I do n't know but what I should be more interested in our young friend , as an illustration of such a case , than merely as a poor vagabond -- which any one can be . ''
Parsing [sent. 10047 len. 18]: `` In the meantime , '' I ventured to observe , `` he is getting worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 10048 len. 29]: `` In the meantime , '' said Mr. Skimpole cheerfully , `` as Miss Summerson , with her practical good sense , observes , he is getting worse .
Parsing [sent. 10049 len. 14]: Therefore I recommend your turning him out before he gets still worse . ''
Parsing [sent. 10050 len. 16]: The amiable face with which he said it , I think I shall never forget .
Parsing [sent. 10051 len. 52]: `` Of course , little woman , '' observed my guardian , tuming to me , `` I can ensure his admission into the proper place by merely going there to enforce it , though it 's a bad state of things when , in his condition , that is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 10052 len. 21]: But it 's growing late , and is a very bad night , and the boy is worn out already .
Parsing [sent. 10053 len. 30]: There is a bed in the wholesome loft-room by the stable ; we had better keep him there till morning , when he can be wrapped up and removed .
Parsing [sent. 10054 len. 6]: We 'll do that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10055 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10056 len. 18]: said Mr. Skimpole , with his hands upon the keys of the piano as we moved away .
Parsing [sent. 10057 len. 11]: `` Are you going back to our young friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10058 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 10059 len. 11]: `` How I envy you your constitution , Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10060 len. 7]: returned Mr. Skimpole with playful admiration .
Parsing [sent. 10061 len. 13]: `` You do n't mind these things ; neither does Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 10062 len. 14]: You are ready at all times to go anywhere , and do anything .
Parsing [sent. 10063 len. 4]: Such is will !
Parsing [sent. 10064 len. 17]: I have no will at all -- and no wo n't -- simply ca n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 10065 len. 14]: `` You ca n't recommend anything for the boy , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10066 len. 28]: said my guardian , looking back over his shoulder half angrily ; only half angrily , for he never seemed to consider Mr. Skimpole an accountable being .
Parsing [sent. 10067 len. 29]: `` My dear Jarndyce , I observed a bottle of cooling medicine in his pocket , and it 's impossible for him to do better than take it .
Parsing [sent. 10068 len. 26]: You can tell them to sprinkle a little vinegar about the place where he sleeps and to keep it moderately cool and him moderately warm .
Parsing [sent. 10069 len. 12]: But it is mere impertinence in me to offer any recommendation .
Parsing [sent. 10070 len. 25]: Miss Summerson has such a knowledge of detail and such a capacity for the administration of detail that she knows all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10071 len. 50]: We went back into the hall and explained to Jo what we proposed to do , which Charley explained to him again and which he received with the languid unconcern I had already noticed , wearily looking on at what was done as if it were for somebody else .
Parsing [sent. 10072 len. 39]: The servants compassionating his miserable state and being very anxious to help , we soon got the loft-room ready ; and some of the men about the house carried him across the wet yard , well wrapped up .
Parsing [sent. 10073 len. 37]: It was pleasant to observe how kind they were to him and how there appeared to be a general impression among them that frequently calling him `` Old Chap '' was likely to revive his spirits .
Parsing [sent. 10074 len. 30]: Charley directed the operations and went to and fro between the loft-room and the house with such little stimulants and comforts as we thought it safe to give him .
Parsing [sent. 10075 len. 54]: My guardian himself saw him before he was left for the night and reported to me when he returned to the growlery to write a letter on the boy 's behalf , which a messenger was charged to deliver at day-light in the morning , that he seemed easier and inclined to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 10076 len. 34]: They had fastened his door on the outside , he said , in case of his being delirious , but had so arranged that he could not make any noise without being heard .
Parsing [sent. 10077 len. 45]: Ada being in our room with a cold , Mr. Skimpole was left alone all this time and entertained himself by playing snatches of pathetic airs and sometimes singing to them -LRB- as we heard at a distance -RRB- with great expression and feeling .
Parsing [sent. 10078 len. 63]: When we rejoined him in the drawing-room he said he would give us a little ballad which had come into his head `` apropos of our young friend , '' and he sang one about a peasant boy , `` Thrown on the wide world , doomed to wander and roam , Bereft of his parents , bereft of a home . ''
Parsing [sent. 10079 len. 3]: quite exquisitely .
Parsing [sent. 10080 len. 14]: It was a song that always made him cry , he told us .
Parsing [sent. 10081 len. 36]: He was extremely gay all the rest of the evening , for he absolutely chirped -- those were his delighted words -- when he thought by what a happy talent for business he was surrounded .
Parsing [sent. 10082 len. 19]: He gave us , in his glass of negus , `` Better health to our young friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10083 len. 20]: and supposed and gaily pursued the case of his being reserved like Whittington to become Lord Mayor of London .
Parsing [sent. 10084 len. 28]: In that event , no doubt , he would establish the Jarndyce Institution and the Summerson Almshouses , and a little annual Corporation Pilgrimage to St. Albans .
Parsing [sent. 10085 len. 85]: He had no doubt , he said , that our young friend was an excellent boy in his way , but his way was not the Harold Skimpole way ; what Harold Skimpole was , Harold Skimpole had found himself , to his considerable surprise , when he first made his own acquaintance ; he had accepted himself with all his failings and had thought it sound philosophy to make the best of the bargain ; and he hoped we would do the same .
Parsing [sent. 10086 len. 11]: Charley 's last report was that the boy was quiet .
Parsing [sent. 10087 len. 31]: I could see , from my window , the lantern they had left him burning quietly ; and I went to bed very happy to think that he was sheltered .
Parsing [sent. 10088 len. 19]: There was more movement and more talking than usual a little before daybreak , and it awoke me .
Parsing [sent. 10089 len. 35]: As I was dressing , I looked out of my window and asked one of our men who had been among the active sympathizers last night whether there was anything wrong about the house .
Parsing [sent. 10090 len. 9]: The lantern was still burning in the loft-window .
Parsing [sent. 10091 len. 12]: `` It 's the boy , miss , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 10092 len. 6]: `` Is he worse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10093 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 10094 len. 5]: `` Gone , miss .
Parsing [sent. 10095 len. 4]: `` Dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10096 len. 5]: `` Dead , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 10097 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10098 len. 5]: Gone clean off . ''
Parsing [sent. 10099 len. 23]: At what time of the night he had gone , or how , or why , it seemed hopeless ever to divine .
Parsing [sent. 10100 len. 41]: The door remaining as it had been left , and the lantern standing in the window , it could only be supposed that he had got out by a trap in the floor which communicated with an empty cart-house below .
Parsing [sent. 10101 len. 24]: But he had shut it down again , if that were so ; and it looked as if it had not been raised .
Parsing [sent. 10102 len. 7]: Nothing of any kind was missing .
Parsing [sent. 10103 len. 110]: On this fact being clearly ascertained , we all yielded to the painful belief that delirium had come upon him in the night and that , allured by some imaginary object or pursued by some imaginary horror , he had strayed away in that worse than helpless state ; all of us , that is to say , but Mr. Skimpole , who repeatedly suggested , in his usual easy light style , that it had occurred to our young friend that he was not a safe inmate , having a bad kind of fever upon him , and that he had with great natural politeness taken himself off .
Parsing [sent. 10104 len. 12]: Every possible inquiry was made , and every place was searched .
Parsing [sent. 10105 len. 34]: The brick-kilns were examined , the cottages were visited , the two women were particularly questioned , but they knew nothing of him , and nobody could doubt that their wonder was genuine .
Parsing [sent. 10106 len. 25]: The weather had for some time been too wet and the night itself had been too wet to admit of any tracing by footsteps .
Parsing [sent. 10107 len. 50]: Hedge and ditch , and wall , and rick and stack , were examined by our men for a long distance round , lest the boy should be lying in such a place insensible or dead ; but nothing was seen to indicate that he had ever been near .
Parsing [sent. 10108 len. 14]: From the time when he was left in the loft-room , he vanished .
Parsing [sent. 10109 len. 7]: The search continued for five days .
Parsing [sent. 10110 len. 25]: I do not mean that it ceased even then , but that my attention was then diverted into a current very memorable to me .
Parsing [sent. 10111 len. 30]: As Charley was at her writing again in my room in the evening , and as I sat opposite to her at work , I felt the table tremble .
Parsing [sent. 10112 len. 14]: Looking up , I saw my little maid shivering from head to foot .
Parsing [sent. 10113 len. 14]: `` Charley , '' said I , `` are you so cold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10114 len. 12]: `` I think I am , miss , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 10115 len. 9]: `` I do n't know what it is .
Parsing [sent. 10116 len. 7]: I ca n't hold myself still .
Parsing [sent. 10117 len. 12]: I felt so yesterday at about this same time , miss .
Parsing [sent. 10118 len. 12]: Do n't be uneasy , I think I 'm ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 10119 len. 27]: I heard Ada 's voice outside , and I hurried to the door of communication between my room and our pretty sitting-room , and locked it .
Parsing [sent. 10120 len. 18]: Just in time , for she tapped at it while my hand was yet upon the key .
Parsing [sent. 10121 len. 20]: Ada called to me to let her in , but I said , `` Not now , my dearest .
Parsing [sent. 10122 len. 3]: Go away .
Parsing [sent. 10123 len. 14]: There 's nothing the matter ; I will come to you presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 10124 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 10125 len. 17]: It was a long , long time before my darling girl and I were companions again .
Parsing [sent. 10126 len. 4]: Charley fell ill .
Parsing [sent. 10127 len. 8]: In twelve hours she was very ill .
Parsing [sent. 10128 len. 22]: I moved her to my room , and laid her in my bed , and sat down quietly to nurse her .
Parsing [sent. 10129 len. 32]: I told my guardian all about it , and why I felt it was necessary that I should seclude myself , and my reason for not seeing my darling above all .
Parsing [sent. 10130 len. 64]: At first she came very often to the door , and called to me , and even reproached me with sobs and tears ; but I wrote her a long letter saying that she made me anxious and unhappy and imploring her , as she loved me and wished my mind to be at peace , to come no nearer than the garden .
Parsing [sent. 10131 len. 63]: After that she came beneath the window even oftener than she had come to the door , and if I had learnt to love her dear sweet voice before when we were hardly ever apart , how did I learn to love it then , when I stood behind the window-curtain listening and replying , but not so much as looking out !
Parsing [sent. 10132 len. 15]: How did I learn to love it afterwards , when the harder time came !
Parsing [sent. 10133 len. 45]: They put a bed for me in our sitting-room ; and by keeping the door wide open , I turned the two rooms into one , now that Ada had vacated that part of the house , and kept them always fresh and airy .
Parsing [sent. 10134 len. 68]: There was not a servant in or about the house but was so good that they would all most gladly have come to me at any hour of the day or night without the least fear or unwillingness , but I thought it best to choose one worthy woman who was never to see Ada and whom I could trust to come and go with all precaution .
Parsing [sent. 10135 len. 40]: Through her means I got out to take the air with my guardian when there was no fear of meeting Ada , and wanted for nothing in the way of attendance , any more than in any other respect .
Parsing [sent. 10136 len. 31]: And thus poor Charley sickened and grew worse , and fell into heavy danger of death , and lay severely ill for many a long round of day and night .
Parsing [sent. 10137 len. 71]: So patient she was , so uncomplaining , and inspired by such a gentle fortitude that very often as I sat by Charley holding her head in my arms -- repose would come to her , so , when it would come to her in no other attitude -- I silently prayed to our Father in heaven that I might not forget the lesson which this little sister taught me .
Parsing [sent. 10138 len. 48]: I was very sorrowful to think that Charley 's pretty looks would change and be disfigured , even if she recovered -- she was such a child with her dimpled face -- but that thought was , for the greater part , lost in her greater peril .
Parsing [sent. 10139 len. 60]: When she was at the worst , and her mind rambled again to the cares of her father 's sick bed and the little children , she still knew me so far as that she would be quiet in my arms when she could lie quiet nowhere else , and murmur out the wanderings of her mind less restlessly .
Parsing [sent. 10140 len. 39]: At those times I used to think , how should I ever tell the two remaining babies that the baby who had learned of her faithful heart to be a mother to them in their need was dead !
Parsing [sent. 10141 len. 40]: There were other times when Charley knew me well and talked to me , telling me that she sent her love to Tom and Emma and that she was sure Tom would grow up to be a good man .
Parsing [sent. 10142 len. 65]: At those times Charley would speak to me of what she had read to her father as well as she could to comfort him , of that young man carried out to be buried who was the only son of his mother and she was a widow , of the ruler 's daughter raised up by the gracious hand upon her bed of death .
Parsing [sent. 10143 len. 67]: And Charley told me that when her father died she had kneeled down and prayed in her first sorrow that he likewise might be raised up and given back to his poor children , and that if she should never get better and should die too , she thought it likely that it might come into Tom 's mind to offer the same prayer for her .
Parsing [sent. 10144 len. 33]: Then would I show Tom how these people of old days had been brought back to life on earth , only that we might know our hope to be restored to heaven !
Parsing [sent. 10145 len. 28]: But of all the various times there were in Charley 's illness , there was not one when she lost the gentle qualities I have spoken of .
Parsing [sent. 10146 len. 39]: And there were many , many when I thought in the night of the last high belief in the watching angel , and the last higher trust in God , on the part of her poor despised father .
Parsing [sent. 10147 len. 6]: And Charley did not die .
Parsing [sent. 10148 len. 20]: She flutteringiy and slowly turned the dangerous point , after long lingering there , and then began to mend .
Parsing [sent. 10149 len. 44]: The hope that never had been given , from the first , of Charley being in outward appearance Charley any more soon began to be encouraged ; and even that prospered , and I saw her growing into her old childish likeness again .
Parsing [sent. 10150 len. 40]: It was a great morning when I could tell Ada all this as she stood out in the garden ; and it was a great evening when Charley and I at last took tea together in the next room .
Parsing [sent. 10151 len. 14]: But on that same evening , I felt that I was stricken cold .
Parsing [sent. 10152 len. 33]: Happily for both of us , it was not until Charley was safe in bed again and placidly asleep that I began to think the contagion of her illness was upon me .
Parsing [sent. 10153 len. 34]: I had been able easily to hide what I felt at tea-time , but I was past that already now , and I knew that I was rapidly following in Charley 's steps .
Parsing [sent. 10154 len. 37]: I was well enough , however , to be up early in the morning , and to return my darling 's cheerful blessing from the garden , and to talk with her as long as usual .
Parsing [sent. 10155 len. 55]: But I was not free from an impression that I had been walking about the two rooms in the night , a little beside myself , though knowing where I was ; and I felt confused at times -- with a curious sense of fullness , as if I were becoming too large altogether .
Parsing [sent. 10156 len. 35]: In the evening I was so much worse that I resolved to prepare Charley , with which view I said , `` You 're getting quite strong , Charley , are you not ? '
Parsing [sent. 10157 len. 6]: `` Oh , quite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10158 len. 3]: said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 10159 len. 15]: `` Strong enough to be told a secret , I think , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10160 len. 10]: `` Quite strong enough for that , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10161 len. 3]: cried Charley .
Parsing [sent. 10162 len. 48]: But Charley 's face fell in the height of her delight , for she saw the secret in MY face ; and she came out of the great chair , and fell upon my bosom , and said `` Oh , miss , it 's my doing !
Parsing [sent. 10163 len. 6]: It 's my doing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10164 len. 14]: and a great deal more out of the fullness of her grateful heart .
Parsing [sent. 10165 len. 37]: `` Now , Charley , '' said I after letting her go on for a little while , `` if I am to be ill , my great trust , humanly speaking , is in you .
Parsing [sent. 10166 len. 26]: And unless you are as quiet and composed for me as you always were for yourself , you can never fulfil it , Charley . ''
Parsing [sent. 10167 len. 17]: `` If you 'll let me cry a little longer , miss , '' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 10168 len. 9]: `` Oh , my dear , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 10169 len. 11]: If you 'll only let me cry a little longer .
Parsing [sent. 10170 len. 6]: Oh , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10171 len. 30]: -- how affectionately and devotedly she poured this out as she clung to my neck , I never can remember without tears -- `` I 'll be good . ''
Parsing [sent. 10172 len. 16]: So I let Charley cry a little longer , and it did us both good .
Parsing [sent. 10173 len. 17]: `` Trust in me now , if you please , miss , '' said Charley quietly .
Parsing [sent. 10174 len. 10]: `` I am listening to everything you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 10175 len. 10]: `` It 's very little at present , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 10176 len. 24]: I shall tell your doctor to-night that I do n't think I am well and that you are going to nurse me . ''
Parsing [sent. 10177 len. 12]: For that the poor child thanked me with her whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 10178 len. 53]: `` And in the morning , when you hear Miss Ada in the garden , if I should not be quite able to go to the window-curtain as usual , do you go , Charley , and say I am asleep -- that I have rather tired myself , and am asleep .
Parsing [sent. 10179 len. 21]: At all times keep the room as I have kept it , Charley , and let no one come . ''
Parsing [sent. 10180 len. 14]: Charley promised , and I lay down , for I was very heavy .
Parsing [sent. 10181 len. 31]: I saw the doctor that night and asked the favour of him that I wished to ask relative to his saying nothing of my illness in the house as yet .
Parsing [sent. 10182 len. 41]: I have a very indistinct remembrance of that night melting into day , and of day melting into night again ; but I was just able on the first morning to get to the window and speak to my darling .
Parsing [sent. 10183 len. 16]: On the second morning I heard her dear voice -- Oh , how dear now !
Parsing [sent. 10184 len. 27]: -- outside ; and I asked Charley , with some difficulty -LRB- speech being painful to me -RRB- , to go and say I was asleep .
Parsing [sent. 10185 len. 19]: I heard her answer softly , `` Do n't disturb her , Charley , for the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10186 len. 11]: `` How does my own Pride look , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10187 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 10188 len. 14]: `` Disappointed , miss , '' said Charley , peeping through the curtain .
Parsing [sent. 10189 len. 12]: `` But I know she is very beautiful this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 10190 len. 13]: `` She is indeed , miss , '' answered Charley , peeping .
Parsing [sent. 10191 len. 9]: `` Still looking up at the window . ''
Parsing [sent. 10192 len. 17]: With her blue clear eyes , God bless them , always loveliest when raised like that !
Parsing [sent. 10193 len. 12]: I called Charley to me and gave her her last charge .
Parsing [sent. 10194 len. 23]: `` Now , Charley , when she knows I am ill , she will try to make her way into the room .
Parsing [sent. 10195 len. 16]: Keep her out , Charley , if you love me truly , to the last !
Parsing [sent. 10196 len. 28]: Charley , if you let her in but once , only to look upon me for one moment as I lie here , I shall die . ''
Parsing [sent. 10197 len. 5]: `` I never will !
Parsing [sent. 10198 len. 5]: I never will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10199 len. 4]: she promised me .
Parsing [sent. 10200 len. 9]: `` I believe it , my dear Charley .
Parsing [sent. 10201 len. 19]: And now come and sit beside me for a little while , and touch me with your hand .
Parsing [sent. 10202 len. 14]: For I can not see you , Charley ; I am blind . ''
Parsing [sent. 10203 len. 54]: Chapter XXXII -- The Appointed Time It is night in Lincoln 's Inn -- perplexed and troublous valley of the shadow of the law , where suitors generally find but little day -- and fat candles are snuffed out in offices , and clerks have rattled down the crazy wooden stairs and dispersed .
Parsing [sent. 10204 len. 40]: The bell that rings at nine o'clock has ceased its doleful clangour about nothing ; the gates are shut ; and the night-porter , a solemn warder with a mighty power of sleep , keeps guard in his lodge .
Parsing [sent. 10205 len. 34]: From tiers of staircase windows clogged lamps like the eyes of Equity , bleared Argus with a fathomless pocket for every eye and an eye upon it , dimly blink at the stars .
Parsing [sent. 10206 len. 50]: In dirty upper casements , here and there , hazy little patches of candlelight reveal where some wise draughtsman and conveyancer yet toils for the entanglement of real estate in meshes of sheep-skin , in the average ratio of about a dozen of sheep to an acre of land .
Parsing [sent. 10207 len. 32]: Over which bee-like industry these benefactors of their species linger yet , though office-hours be past , that they may give , for every day , some good account at last .
Parsing [sent. 10208 len. 27]: In the neighbouring court , where the Lord Chancellor of the rag and bottle shop dwells , there is a general tendency towards beer and supper .
Parsing [sent. 10209 len. 81]: Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , whose respective sons , engaged with a circle of acquaintance in the game of hide and seek , have been lying in ambush about the by-ways of Chancery Lane for some hours and scouring the plain of the same thoroughfare to the confusion of passengers -- Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins have but now exchanged congratulations on the children being abed , and they still linger on a door-step over a few parting words .
Parsing [sent. 10210 len. 39]: Mr. Krook and his lodger , and the fact of Mr. Krook 's being `` continually in liquor , '' and the testamentary prospects of the young man are , as usual , the staple of their conversation .
Parsing [sent. 10211 len. 88]: But they have something to say , likewise , of the Harmonic Meeting at the Sol 's Arms , where the sound of the piano through the partly opened windows jingles out into the court , and where Little Swills , after keeping the lovers of harmony in a roar like a very Yorick , may now be heard taking the gruff line in a concerted piece and sentimentally adjuring his friends and patrons to `` Listen , listen , listen , tew the wa-ter fall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10212 len. 87]: Mrs. Perkins and Mrs. Piper compare opinions on the subject of the young lady of professional celebrity who assists at the Harmonic Meetings and who has a space to herself in the manuscript announcement in the window , Mrs. Perkins possessing information that she has been married a year and a half , though announced as Miss M. Melvilleson , the noted siren , and that her baby is clandestinely conveyed to the Sol 's Arms every night to receive its natural nourishment during the entertainments .
Parsing [sent. 10213 len. 23]: `` Sooner than which , myself , '' says Mrs. Perkins , `` I would get my living by selling lucifers . ''
Parsing [sent. 10214 len. 43]: Mrs. Piper , as in duty bound , is of the same opinion , holding that a private station is better than public applause , and thanking heaven for her own -LRB- and , by implication , Mrs. Perkins ' -RRB- respectability .
Parsing [sent. 10215 len. 64]: By this time the pot-boy of the Sol 's Arms appearing with her supper-pint well frothed , Mrs. Piper accepts that tankard and retires indoors , first giving a fair good night to Mrs. Perkins , who has had her own pint in her hand ever since it was fetched from the same hostelry by young Perkins before he was sent to bed .
Parsing [sent. 10216 len. 39]: Now there is a sound of putting up shop -- shutters in the court and a smell as of the smoking of pipes ; and shooting stars are seen in upper windows , further indicating retirement to rest .
Parsing [sent. 10217 len. 41]: Now , too , the policeman begins to push at doors ; to try fastenings ; to be suspicious of bundles ; and to administer his beat , on the hypothesis that every one is either robbing or being robbed .
Parsing [sent. 10218 len. 28]: It is a close night , though the damp cold is searching too , and there is a laggard mist a little way up in the air .
Parsing [sent. 10219 len. 36]: It is a fine steaming night to turn the slaughter-houses , the unwholesome trades , the sewerage , bad water , and burial-grounds to account , and give the registrar of deaths some extra business .
Parsing [sent. 10220 len. 39]: It may be something in the air -- there is plenty in it -- or it may be something in himself that is in fault ; but Mr. Weevle , otherwise Jobling , is very ill at ease .
Parsing [sent. 10221 len. 18]: He comes and goes between his own room and the open street door twenty times an hour .
Parsing [sent. 10222 len. 11]: He has been doing so ever since it fell dark .
Parsing [sent. 10223 len. 52]: Since the Chancellor shut up his shop , which he did very early to-night , Mr. Weevle has been down and up , and down and up -LRB- with a cheap tight velvet skull-cap on his head , making his whiskers look out of all proportion -RRB- , oftener than before .
Parsing [sent. 10224 len. 36]: It is no phenomenon that Mr. Snagsby should be ill at ease too , for he always is so , more or less , under the oppressive influence of the secret that is upon him .
Parsing [sent. 10225 len. 39]: Impelled by the mystery of which he is a partaker and yet in which he is not a sharer , Mr. Snagsby haunts what seems to be its fountain-head -- the rag and bottle shop in the court .
Parsing [sent. 10226 len. 8]: It has an irresistible attraction for him .
Parsing [sent. 10227 len. 51]: Even now , coming round by the Sol 's Arms with the intention of passing down the court , and out at the Chancery Lane end , and so terminating his unpremeditated after-supper stroll of ten minutes ' long from his own door and back again , Mr. Snagsby approaches .
Parsing [sent. 10228 len. 7]: `` What , Mr. Weevle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10229 len. 8]: says the stationer , stopping to speak .
Parsing [sent. 10230 len. 6]: `` Are YOU there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10231 len. 4]: `` Aye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10232 len. 12]: says Weevle , `` Here I am , Mr. Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 10233 len. 16]: `` Airing yourself , as I am doing , before you go to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10234 len. 4]: the stationer inquires .
Parsing [sent. 10235 len. 34]: `` Why , there 's not much air to be got here ; and what there is , is not very freshening , '' Weevle answers , glancing up and down the court .
Parsing [sent. 10236 len. 6]: `` Very true , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10237 len. 53]: Do n't you observe , '' says Mr. Snagsby , pausing to sniff and taste the air a little , `` do n't you observe , Mr. Weevle , that you 're -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- that you 're rather greasy here , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10238 len. 25]: `` Why , I have noticed myself that there is a queer kind of flavour in the place to-night , '' Mr. Weevle rejoins .
Parsing [sent. 10239 len. 13]: `` I suppose it 's chops at the Sol 's Arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 10240 len. 7]: `` Chops , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 10241 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10242 len. 5]: Chops , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10243 len. 7]: Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again .
Parsing [sent. 10244 len. 10]: `` Well , sir , I suppose it is .
Parsing [sent. 10245 len. 15]: But I should say their cook at the Sol wanted a little looking after .
Parsing [sent. 10246 len. 8]: She has been burning 'em , sir !
Parsing [sent. 10247 len. 50]: And I do n't think '' -- Mr. Snagsby sniffs and tastes again and then spits and wipes his mouth -- `` I do n't think -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- that they were quite fresh when they were shown the gridiron . ''
Parsing [sent. 10248 len. 6]: `` That 's very likely .
Parsing [sent. 10249 len. 9]: It 's a tainting sort of weather . ''
Parsing [sent. 10250 len. 25]: `` It IS a tainting sort of weather , '' says Mr. Snagsby , `` and I find it sinking to the spirits . ''
Parsing [sent. 10251 len. 4]: `` By George !
Parsing [sent. 10252 len. 13]: I find it gives me the horrors , '' returns Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 10253 len. 56]: `` Then , you see , you live in a lonesome way , and in a lonesome room , with a black circumstance hanging over it , '' says Mr. Snagsby , looking in past the other 's shoulder along the dark passage and then falling back a step to look up at the house .
Parsing [sent. 10254 len. 16]: `` I could n't live in that room alone , as you do , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10255 len. 31]: I should get so fidgety and worried of an evening , sometimes , that I should be driven to come to the door and stand here sooner than sit there .
Parsing [sent. 10256 len. 21]: But then it 's very true that you did n't see , in your room , what I saw there .
Parsing [sent. 10257 len. 6]: That makes a difference . ''
Parsing [sent. 10258 len. 12]: `` I know quite enough about it , '' returns Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10259 len. 10]: `` It 's not agreeable , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10260 len. 14]: pursues Mr. Snagsby , coughing his cough of mild persuasion behind his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10261 len. 11]: `` Mr. Krook ought to consider it in the rent .
Parsing [sent. 10262 len. 10]: I hope he does , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 10263 len. 10]: `` I hope he does , '' says Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10264 len. 7]: `` But I doubt it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10265 len. 14]: `` You find the rent too high , do you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10266 len. 4]: returns the stationer .
Parsing [sent. 10267 len. 7]: `` Rents ARE high about here .
Parsing [sent. 10268 len. 20]: I do n't know how it is exactly , but the law seems to put things up in price .
Parsing [sent. 10269 len. 29]: Not , '' adds Mr. Snagsby with his apologetic cough , `` that I mean to say a word against the profession I get my living by . ''
Parsing [sent. 10270 len. 16]: Mr. Weevle again glances up and down the court and then looks at the stationer .
Parsing [sent. 10271 len. 31]: Mr. Snagsby , blankly catching his eye , looks upward for a star or so and coughs a cough expressive of not exactly seeing his way out of this conversation .
Parsing [sent. 10272 len. 32]: `` It 's a curious fact , sir , '' he observes , slowly rubbing his hands , `` that he should have been -- '' `` Who 's he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10273 len. 4]: interrupts Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 10274 len. 29]: `` The deceased , you know , '' says Mr. Snagsby , twitching his head and right eyebrow towards the staircase and tapping his acquaintance on the button .
Parsing [sent. 10275 len. 8]: `` Ah , to be sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10276 len. 13]: returns the other as if he were not over-fond of the subject .
Parsing [sent. 10277 len. 10]: `` I thought we had done with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 10278 len. 49]: `` I was only going to say it 's a curious fact , sir , that he should have come and lived here , and been one of my writers , and then that you should come and live here , and be one of my writers too .
Parsing [sent. 10279 len. 58]: Which there is nothing derogatory , but far from it in the appellation , '' says Mr. Snagsby , breaking off with a mistrust that he may have unpolitely asserted a kind of proprietorship in Mr. Weevle , `` because I have known writers that have gone into brewers ' houses and done really very respectable indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10280 len. 20]: Eminently respectable , sir , '' adds Mr. Snagsby with a misgiving that he has not improved the matter .
Parsing [sent. 10281 len. 24]: `` It 's a curious coincidence , as you say , '' answers Weevle , once more glancing up and down the court .
Parsing [sent. 10282 len. 12]: `` Seems a fate in it , do n't there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10283 len. 4]: suggests the stationer .
Parsing [sent. 10284 len. 5]: `` There does . ''
Parsing [sent. 10285 len. 13]: `` Just so , '' observes the stationer with his confirmatory cough .
Parsing [sent. 10286 len. 7]: `` Quite a fate in it .
Parsing [sent. 10287 len. 4]: Quite a fate .
Parsing [sent. 10288 len. 57]: Well , Mr. Weevle , I am afraid I must bid you good night '' -- Mr. Snagsby speaks as if it made him desolate to go , though he has been casting about for any means of escape ever since he stopped to speak -- `` my little woman will be looking for me else .
Parsing [sent. 10289 len. 6]: Good night , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10290 len. 28]: If Mr. Snagsby hastens home to save his little woman the trouble of looking for him , he might set his mind at rest on that score .
Parsing [sent. 10291 len. 46]: His little woman has had her eye upon him round the Sol 's Arms all this time and now glides after him with a pocket handkerchief wrapped over her head , honourmg Mr. Weevle and his doorway with a searching glance as she goes past .
Parsing [sent. 10292 len. 44]: `` You 'll know me again , ma'am , at all events , '' says Mr. Weevle to himself ; `` and I ca n't compliment you on your appearance , whoever you are , with your head tied up in a bundle .
Parsing [sent. 10293 len. 7]: Is this fellow NEVER coming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10294 len. 7]: This fellow approaches as he speaks .
Parsing [sent. 10295 len. 21]: Mr. Weevle softly holds up his finger , and draws him into the passage , and closes the street door .
Parsing [sent. 10296 len. 22]: Then they go upstairs , Mr. Weevle heavily , and Mr. Guppy -LRB- for it is he -RRB- very lightly indeed .
Parsing [sent. 10297 len. 13]: When they are shut into the back room , they speak low .
Parsing [sent. 10298 len. 19]: `` I thought you had gone to Jericho at least instead of coming here , '' says Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10299 len. 9]: `` Why , I said about ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 10300 len. 10]: `` You said about ten , '' Tony repeats .
Parsing [sent. 10301 len. 10]: `` Yes , so you did say about ten .
Parsing [sent. 10302 len. 18]: But according to my count , it 's ten times ten -- it 's a hundred o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 10303 len. 11]: I never had such a night in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10304 len. 8]: `` What has been the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10305 len. 6]: `` That 's it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10306 len. 3]: says Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10307 len. 7]: `` Nothing has been the matter .
Parsing [sent. 10308 len. 27]: But here have I been stewing and fuming in this jolly old crib till I have had the horrors falling on me as thick as hail .
Parsing [sent. 10309 len. 7]: THERE 'S a blessed-looking candle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10310 len. 22]: says Tony , pointing to the heavily burning taper on his table with a great cabbage head and a long winding-sheet .
Parsing [sent. 10311 len. 18]: `` That 's easily improved , '' Mr. Guppy observes as he takes the snuffers in hand .
Parsing [sent. 10312 len. 5]: `` IS it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10313 len. 4]: returns his friend .
Parsing [sent. 10314 len. 8]: `` Not so easily as you think .
Parsing [sent. 10315 len. 13]: It has been smouldering like that ever since it was lighted . ''
Parsing [sent. 10316 len. 13]: `` Why , what 's the matter with you , Tony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10317 len. 23]: inquires Mr. Guppy , looking at him , snuffers in hand , as he sits down with his elbow on the table .
Parsing [sent. 10318 len. 16]: `` William Guppy , '' replies the other , `` I am in the downs .
Parsing [sent. 10319 len. 18]: It 's this unbearably dull , suicidal room -- and old Boguey downstairs , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 10320 len. 32]: Mr. Weevle moodily pushes the snuffers-tray from him with his elbow , leans his head on his hand , puts his feet on the fender , and looks at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10321 len. 25]: Mr. Guppy , observing him , slightly tosses his head and sits down on the other side of the table in an easy attitude .
Parsing [sent. 10322 len. 12]: `` Was n't that Snagsby talking to you , Tony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10323 len. 24]: `` Yes , and he -- yes , it was Snagsby , '' said Mr. Weevle , altering the construction of his sentence .
Parsing [sent. 10324 len. 5]: `` On business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10325 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 10326 len. 3]: No business .
Parsing [sent. 10327 len. 11]: He was only sauntering by and stopped to prose . ''
Parsing [sent. 10328 len. 34]: `` I thought it was Snagsby , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` and thought it as well that he should n't see me , so I waited till he was gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 10329 len. 10]: `` There we go again , William G. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10330 len. 9]: cried Tony , looking up for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 10331 len. 6]: `` So mysterious and secret !
Parsing [sent. 10332 len. 22]: By George , if we were going to commit a murder , we could n't have more mystery about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10333 len. 105]: Mr. Guppy affects to smile , and with the view of changing the conversation , looks with an admiration , real or pretended , round the room at the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty , terminating his survey with the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf , in which she is represented on a terrace , with a pedestal upon the terrace , and a vase upon the pedestal , and her shawl upon the vase , and a prodigious piece of fur upon the shawl , and her arm on the prodigious piece of fur , and a bracelet on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 10334 len. 13]: `` That 's very like Lady Dedlock , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10335 len. 8]: `` It 's a speaking likeness . ''
Parsing [sent. 10336 len. 15]: `` I wish it was , '' growls Tony , without changing his position .
Parsing [sent. 10337 len. 13]: `` I should have some fashionable conversation , here , then . ''
Parsing [sent. 10338 len. 31]: Finding by this time that his friend is not to be wheedled into a more sociable humour , Mr. Guppy puts about upon the ill-used tack and remonstrates with him .
Parsing [sent. 10339 len. 61]: `` Tony , '' says he , `` I can make allowances for lowness of spirits , for no man knows what it is when it does come upon a man better than I do , and no man perhaps has a better right to know it than a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on his ` eart .
Parsing [sent. 10340 len. 42]: But there are bounds to these things when an unoffending party is in question , and I will acknowledge to you , Tony , that I do n't think your manner on the present occasion is hospitable or quite gentlemanly . ''
Parsing [sent. 10341 len. 14]: `` This is strong language , William Guppy , '' returns Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 10342 len. 24]: `` Sir , it may be , '' retorts Mr. William Guppy , `` but I feel strongly when I use it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10343 len. 20]: Mr. Weevle admits that he has been wrong and begs Mr. William Guppy to think no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 10344 len. 23]: Mr. William Guppy , however , having got the advantage , can not quite release it without a little more injured remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 10345 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 10346 len. 51]: Dash it , Tony , '' says that gentleman , `` you really ought to be careful how you wound the feelings of a man who has an unrequited image imprinted on his ` eart and who is NOT altogether happy in those chords which vibrate to the tenderest emotions .
Parsing [sent. 10347 len. 20]: You , Tony , possess in yourself all that is calculated to charm the eye and allure the taste .
Parsing [sent. 10348 len. 32]: It is not -- happily for you , perhaps , and I may wish that I could say the same -- it is not your character to hover around one flower .
Parsing [sent. 10349 len. 17]: The ole garden is open to you , and your airy pinions carry you through it .
Parsing [sent. 10350 len. 24]: Still , Tony , far be it from me , I am sure , to wound even your feelings without a cause ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10351 len. 23]: Tony again entreats that the subject may be no longer pursued , saying emphatically , `` William Guppy , drop it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10352 len. 25]: Mr. Guppy acquiesces , with the reply , `` I never should have taken it up , Tony , of my own accord . ''
Parsing [sent. 10353 len. 20]: `` And now , '' says Tony , stirring the fire , `` touching this same bundle of letters .
Parsing [sent. 10354 len. 22]: Is n't it an extraordinary thing of Krook to have appointed twelve o'clock to-night to hand 'em over to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10355 len. 3]: `` Very .
Parsing [sent. 10356 len. 8]: What did he do it for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10357 len. 8]: `` What does he do anything for ?
Parsing [sent. 10358 len. 5]: HE do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 10359 len. 16]: Said to-day was his birthday and he 'd hand 'em over to-night at twelve o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 10360 len. 10]: He 'll have drunk himself blind by that time .
Parsing [sent. 10361 len. 9]: He has been at it all day . ''
Parsing [sent. 10362 len. 12]: `` He has n't forgotten the appointment , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10363 len. 3]: `` Forgotten ?
Parsing [sent. 10364 len. 5]: Trust him for that .
Parsing [sent. 10365 len. 5]: He never forgets anything .
Parsing [sent. 10366 len. 28]: I saw him to-night , about eight -- helped him to shut up his shop -- and he had got the letters then in his hairy cap .
Parsing [sent. 10367 len. 9]: He pulled it off and showed 'em me .
Parsing [sent. 10368 len. 30]: When the shop was closed , he took them out of his cap , hung his cap on the chair-back , and stood turning them over before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10369 len. 44]: I heard him a little while afterwards , through the floor here , humming like the wind , the only song he knows -- about Bibo , and old Charon , and Bibo being drunk when he died , or something or other .
Parsing [sent. 10370 len. 16]: He has been as quiet since as an old rat asleep in his hole . ''
Parsing [sent. 10371 len. 11]: `` And you are to go down at twelve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10372 len. 4]: `` At twelve .
Parsing [sent. 10373 len. 17]: And as I tell you , when you came it seemed to me a hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 10374 len. 27]: `` Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy after considering a little with his legs crossed , `` he ca n't read yet , can he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10375 len. 3]: `` Read !
Parsing [sent. 10376 len. 5]: He 'll never read .
Parsing [sent. 10377 len. 38]: He can make all the letters separately , and he knows most of them separately when he sees them ; he has got on that much , under me ; but he ca n't put them together .
Parsing [sent. 10378 len. 17]: He 's too old to acquire the knack of it now -- and too drunk . ''
Parsing [sent. 10379 len. 28]: `` Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs , `` how do you suppose he spelt out that name of Hawdon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10380 len. 7]: `` He never spelt it out .
Parsing [sent. 10381 len. 26]: You know what a curious power of eye he has and how he has been used to employ himself in copying things by eye alone .
Parsing [sent. 10382 len. 20]: He imitated it , evidently from the direction of a letter , and asked me what it meant . ''
Parsing [sent. 10383 len. 33]: `` Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy , uncrossing and recrossing his legs again , `` should you say that the original was a man 's writing or a woman 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10384 len. 5]: `` A woman 's .
Parsing [sent. 10385 len. 27]: Fifty to one a lady 's -- slopes a good deal , and the end of the letter ` n , ' long and hasty . ''
Parsing [sent. 10386 len. 23]: Mr. Guppy has been biting his thumb-nail during this dialogue , generally changing the thumb when he has changed the cross leg .
Parsing [sent. 10387 len. 17]: As he is going to do so again , he happens to look at his coat-sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 10388 len. 5]: It takes his attention .
Parsing [sent. 10389 len. 7]: He stares at it , aghast .
Parsing [sent. 10390 len. 16]: `` Why , Tony , what on earth is going on in this house to-night ?
Parsing [sent. 10391 len. 8]: Is there a chimney on fire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10392 len. 6]: `` Chimney on fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10393 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10394 len. 4]: returns Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10395 len. 8]: `` See how the soot 's falling .
Parsing [sent. 10396 len. 7]: See here , on my arm !
Parsing [sent. 10397 len. 8]: See again , on the table here !
Parsing [sent. 10398 len. 16]: Confound the stuff , it wo n't blow off -- smears like black fat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10399 len. 26]: They look at one another , and Tony goes listening to the door , and a little way upstairs , and a little way downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 10400 len. 32]: Comes back and says it 's all right and all quiet , and quotes the remark he lately made to Mr. Snagsby about their cooking chops at the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 10401 len. 64]: `` And it was then , '' resumes Mr. Guppy , still glancing with remarkable aversion at the coat-sleeve , as they pursue their conversation before the fire , leaning on opposite sides of the table , with their heads very near together , `` that he told you of his having taken the bundle of letters from his lodger 's portmanteau ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10402 len. 17]: `` That was the time , sir , '' answers Tony , faintly adjusting his whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 10403 len. 37]: `` Whereupon I wrote a line to my dear boy , the Honourable William Guppy , informing him of the appointment for to-night and advising him not to call before , Boguey being a slyboots . ''
Parsing [sent. 10404 len. 48]: The light vivacious tone of fashionable life which is usually assumed by Mr. Weevle sits so ill upon him to-night that he abandons that and his whiskers together , and after looking over his shoulder , appears to yield himself up a prey to the horrors again .
Parsing [sent. 10405 len. 29]: `` You are to bring the letters to your room to read and compare , and to get yourself into a position to tell him all about them .
Parsing [sent. 10406 len. 12]: That 's the arrangement , is n't it , Tony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10407 len. 9]: asks Mr. Guppy , anxiously biting his thumb-nail .
Parsing [sent. 10408 len. 8]: `` You ca n't speak too low .
Parsing [sent. 10409 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 10410 len. 9]: That 's what he and I agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 10411 len. 23]: `` I tell you what , Tony -- '' `` You ca n't speak too low , '' says Tony once more .
Parsing [sent. 10412 len. 18]: Mr. Guppy nods his sagacious head , advances it yet closer , and drops into a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 10413 len. 6]: `` I tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 10414 len. 41]: The first thing to be done is to make another packet like the real one so that if he should ask to see the real one while it 's in my possession , you can show him the dummy . ''
Parsing [sent. 10415 len. 36]: `` And suppose he detects the dummy as soon as he sees it , which with his biting screw of an eye is about five hundred times more likely than not , '' suggests Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10416 len. 8]: `` Then we 'll face it out .
Parsing [sent. 10417 len. 12]: They do n't belong to him , and they never did .
Parsing [sent. 10418 len. 21]: You found that , and you placed them in my hands -- a legal friend of yours -- for security .
Parsing [sent. 10419 len. 17]: If he forces us to it , they 'll be producible , wo n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10420 len. 11]: `` Ye-es , '' is Mr. Weevle 's reluctant admission .
Parsing [sent. 10421 len. 15]: `` Why , Tony , '' remonstrates his friend , `` how you look !
Parsing [sent. 10422 len. 7]: You do n't doubt William Guppy ?
Parsing [sent. 10423 len. 8]: You do n't suspect any harm ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10424 len. 19]: `` I do n't suspect anything more than I know , William , '' returns the other gravely .
Parsing [sent. 10425 len. 8]: `` And what do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10426 len. 58]: urges Mr. Guppy , raising his voice a little ; but on his friend 's once more warning him , `` I tell you , you ca n't speak too low , '' he repeats his question without any sound at all , forming with his lips only the words , `` What do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10427 len. 6]: `` I know three things .
Parsing [sent. 10428 len. 18]: First , I know that here we are whispering in secrecy , a pair of conspirators . ''
Parsing [sent. 10429 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10430 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10431 len. 38]: `` And we had better be that than a pair of noodles , which we should be if we were doing anything else , for it 's the only way of doing what we want to do .
Parsing [sent. 10432 len. 3]: Secondly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10433 len. 22]: `` Secondly , it 's not made out to me how it 's likely to be profitable , after all . ''
Parsing [sent. 10434 len. 34]: Mr. Guppy casts up his eyes at the portrait of Lady Dedlock over the mantelshelf and replies , `` Tony , you are asked to leave that to the honour of your friend .
Parsing [sent. 10435 len. 36]: Besides its being calculated to serve that friend in those chords of the human mind which -- which need not be called into agonizing vibration on the present occasion -- your friend is no fool .
Parsing [sent. 10436 len. 5]: What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10437 len. 14]: `` It 's eleven o'clock striking by the bell of Saint Paul 's .
Parsing [sent. 10438 len. 14]: Listen and you 'll hear all the bells in the city jangling . ''
Parsing [sent. 10439 len. 29]: Both sit silent , listening to the metal voices , near and distant , resounding from towers of various heights , in tones more various than their situations .
Parsing [sent. 10440 len. 15]: When these at length cease , all seems more mysterious and quiet than before .
Parsing [sent. 10441 len. 58]: One disagreeable result of whispering is that it seems to evoke an atmosphere of silence , haunted by the ghosts of sound -- strange cracks and tickings , the rustling of garments that have no substance in them , and the tread of dreadful feet that would leave no mark on the sea-sand or the winter snow .
Parsing [sent. 10442 len. 35]: So sensitive the two friends happen to be that the air is full of these phantoms , and the two look over their shoulders by one consent to see that the door is shut .
Parsing [sent. 10443 len. 6]: `` Yes , Tony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10444 len. 15]: says Mr. Guppy , drawing nearer to the fire and biting his unsteady thumb-nail .
Parsing [sent. 10445 len. 10]: `` You were going to say , thirdly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10446 len. 32]: `` It 's far from a pleasant thing to be plotting about a dead man in the room where he died , especially when you happen to live in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10447 len. 12]: `` But we are plotting nothing against him , Tony . ''
Parsing [sent. 10448 len. 12]: `` May be not , still I do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 10449 len. 12]: Live here by yourself and see how YOU like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10450 len. 28]: `` As to dead men , Tony , '' proceeds Mr. Guppy , evading this proposal , `` there have been dead men in most rooms . ''
Parsing [sent. 10451 len. 27]: `` I know there have , but in most rooms you let them alone , and -- and they let you alone , '' Tony answers .
Parsing [sent. 10452 len. 8]: The two look at each other again .
Parsing [sent. 10453 len. 24]: Mr. Guppy makes a hurried remark to the effect that they may be doing the deceased a service , that he hopes so .
Parsing [sent. 10454 len. 28]: There is an oppressive blank until Mr. Weevle , by stirring the fire suddenly , makes Mr. Guppy start as if his heart had been stirred instead .
Parsing [sent. 10455 len. 3]: `` Fah !
Parsing [sent. 10456 len. 14]: Here 's more of this hateful soot hanging about , '' says he .
Parsing [sent. 10457 len. 15]: `` Let us open the window a bit and get a mouthful of air .
Parsing [sent. 10458 len. 6]: It 's too close . ''
Parsing [sent. 10459 len. 22]: He raises the sash , and they both rest on the window-sill , half in and half out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 10460 len. 56]: The neighbouring houses are too near to admit of their seeing any sky without craning their necks and looking up , but lights in frowsy windows here and there , and the rolling of distant carriages , and the new expression that there is of the stir of men , they find to be comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 10461 len. 18]: Mr. Guppy , noiselessly tapping on the window-sill , resumes his whisperirig in quite a light-comedy tone .
Parsing [sent. 10462 len. 21]: `` By the by , Tony , do n't forget old Smallweed , '' meaning the younger of that name .
Parsing [sent. 10463 len. 12]: `` I have not let him into this , you know .
Parsing [sent. 10464 len. 10]: That grandfather of his is too keen by half .
Parsing [sent. 10465 len. 7]: It runs in the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 10466 len. 8]: `` I remember , '' says Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10467 len. 9]: `` I am up to all that . ''
Parsing [sent. 10468 len. 11]: `` And as to Krook , '' resumes Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10469 len. 33]: `` Now , do you suppose he really has got hold of any other papers of importance , as he has boasted to you , since you have been such allies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10470 len. 5]: Tony shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 10471 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 10472 len. 4]: Ca n't Imagine .
Parsing [sent. 10473 len. 20]: If we get through this business without rousing his suspicions , I shall be better informed , no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 10474 len. 15]: How can I know without seeing them , when he do n't know himself ?
Parsing [sent. 10475 len. 53]: He is always spelling out words from them , and chalking them over the table and the shop-wall , and asking what this is and what that is ; but his whole stock from beginning to end may easily be the waste-paper he bought it as , for anything I can say .
Parsing [sent. 10476 len. 14]: It 's a monomania with him to think he is possessed of documents .
Parsing [sent. 10477 len. 27]: He has been going to learn to read them this last quarter of a century , I should judge , from what he tells me . ''
Parsing [sent. 10478 len. 12]: `` How did he first come by that idea , though ?
Parsing [sent. 10479 len. 20]: That 's the question , '' Mr. Guppy suggests with one eye shut , after a little forensic meditation .
Parsing [sent. 10480 len. 43]: `` He may have found papers in something he bought , where papers were not supposed to be , and may have got it into his shrewd head from the manner and place of their concealment that they are worth something . ''
Parsing [sent. 10481 len. 14]: `` Or he may have been taken in , in some pretended bargain .
Parsing [sent. 10482 len. 41]: Or he may have been muddled altogether by long staring at whatever he HAS got , and by drink , and by hanging about the Lord Chancellor 's Court and hearing of documents for ever , '' returns Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 10483 len. 44]: Mr. Guppy sitting on the window-sill , nodding his head and balancing all these possibilities in his mind , continues thoughtfully to tap it , and clasp it , and measure it with his hand , until he hastily draws his hand away .
Parsing [sent. 10484 len. 17]: `` What , in the devil 's name , '' he says , `` is this !
Parsing [sent. 10485 len. 6]: Look at my fingers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10486 len. 23]: A thick , yellow liquor defiles them , which is offensive to the touch and sight and more offensive to the smell .
Parsing [sent. 10487 len. 17]: A stagnant , sickening oil with some natural repulsion in it that makes them both shudder .
Parsing [sent. 10488 len. 8]: `` What have you been doing here ?
Parsing [sent. 10489 len. 10]: What have you been pouring out of window ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10490 len. 7]: `` I pouring out of window !
Parsing [sent. 10491 len. 5]: Nothing , I swear !
Parsing [sent. 10492 len. 9]: Never , since I have been here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10493 len. 4]: cries the lodger .
Parsing [sent. 10494 len. 9]: And yet look here -- and look here !
Parsing [sent. 10495 len. 33]: When he brings the candle here , from the corner of the window-sill , it slowly drips and creeps away down the bricks , here lies in a little thick nauseous pool .
Parsing [sent. 10496 len. 17]: `` This is a horrible house , '' says Mr. Guppy , shutting down the window .
Parsing [sent. 10497 len. 14]: `` Give me some water or I shall cut my hand off . ''
Parsing [sent. 10498 len. 65]: He so washes , and rubs , and scrubs , and smells , and washes , that he has not long restored himself with a glass of brandy and stood silently before the fire when Saint Paul 's bell strikes twelve and all those other bells strike twelve from their towers of various heights in the dark air , and in their many tones .
Parsing [sent. 10499 len. 19]: When all is quiet again , the lodger says , `` It 's the appointed time at last .
Parsing [sent. 10500 len. 5]: Shall I go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10501 len. 29]: Mr. Guppy nods and gives him a `` lucky touch '' on the back , but not with the washed hand , though it is his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 10502 len. 20]: He goes downstairs , and Mr. Guppy tries to compose himself before the fire for waiting a long time .
Parsing [sent. 10503 len. 18]: But in no more than a minute or two the stairs creak and Tony comes swiftly back .
Parsing [sent. 10504 len. 7]: `` Have you got them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10505 len. 4]: `` Got them !
Parsing [sent. 10506 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10507 len. 8]: The old man 's not there . ''
Parsing [sent. 10508 len. 34]: He has been so horribly frightened in the short interval that his terror seizes the other , who makes a rush at him and asks loudly , `` What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10509 len. 18]: `` I could n't make him hear , and I softly opened the door and looked in .
Parsing [sent. 10510 len. 26]: And the burning smell is there -- and the soot is there , and the oil is there -- and he is not there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10511 len. 7]: Tony ends this with a groan .
Parsing [sent. 10512 len. 6]: Mr. Guppy takes the light .
Parsing [sent. 10513 len. 23]: They go down , more dead than alive , and holding one another , push open the door of the back shop .
Parsing [sent. 10514 len. 24]: The cat has retreated close to it and stands snarling , not at them , at something on the ground before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 10515 len. 34]: There is a very little fire left in the grate , but there is a smouldering , suffocating vapour in the room and a dark , greasy coating on the walls and ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 10516 len. 20]: The chairs and table , and the bottle so rarely absent from the table , all stand as usual .
Parsing [sent. 10517 len. 13]: On one chair-back hang the old man 's hairy cap and coat .
Parsing [sent. 10518 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10519 len. 17]: whispers the lodger , pointing his friend 's attention to these objects with a trembling finger .
Parsing [sent. 10520 len. 6]: `` I told you so .
Parsing [sent. 10521 len. 77]: When I saw him last , he took his cap off , took out the little bundle of old letters , hung his cap on the back of the chair -- his coat was there already , for he had pulled that off before he went to put the shutters up -- and I left him turning the letters over in his hand , standing just where that crumbled black thing is upon the floor . ''
Parsing [sent. 10522 len. 5]: Is he hanging somewhere ?
Parsing [sent. 10523 len. 4]: They look up .
Parsing [sent. 10524 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10525 len. 4]: `` See ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10526 len. 3]: whispers Tony .
Parsing [sent. 10527 len. 24]: `` At the foot of the same chair there lies a dirty bit of thin red cord that they tie up pens with .
Parsing [sent. 10528 len. 6]: That went round the letters .
Parsing [sent. 10529 len. 24]: He undid it slowly , leering and laughing at me , before he began to turn them over , and threw it there .
Parsing [sent. 10530 len. 6]: I saw it fall . ''
Parsing [sent. 10531 len. 10]: `` What 's the matter with the cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10532 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10533 len. 6]: `` Look at her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10534 len. 6]: `` Mad , I think .
Parsing [sent. 10535 len. 9]: And no wonder in this evil place . ''
Parsing [sent. 10536 len. 10]: They advance slowly , looking at all these things .
Parsing [sent. 10537 len. 25]: The cat remains where they found her , still snarling at the something on the ground before the fire and between the two chairs .
Parsing [sent. 10538 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 10539 len. 5]: Hold up the light .
Parsing [sent. 10540 len. 62]: Here is a small burnt patch of flooring ; here is the tinder from a little bundle of burnt paper , but not so light as usual , seeming to be steeped in something ; and here is -- is it the cinder of a small charred and broken log of wood sprinkled with white ashes , or is it coal ?
Parsing [sent. 10541 len. 8]: Oh , horror , he IS here !
Parsing [sent. 10542 len. 26]: And this from which we run away , striking out the light and overturning one another into the street , is all that represents him .
Parsing [sent. 10543 len. 6]: Help , help , help !
Parsing [sent. 10544 len. 9]: Come into this house for heaven 's sake !
Parsing [sent. 10545 len. 10]: Plenty will come in , but none can help .
Parsing [sent. 10546 len. 51]: The Lord Chancellor of that court , true to his title in his last act , has died the death of all lord chancellors in all courts and of all authorities in all places under all names soever , where false pretences are made , and where injustice is done .
Parsing [sent. 10547 len. 69]: Call the death by any name your Highness will , attribute it to whom you will , or say it might have been prevented how you will , it is the same death eternally -- inborn , inbred , engendered in the corrupted humours of the vicious body itself , and that only -- spontaneous combustion , and none other of all the deaths that can be died .
Parsing [sent. 10548 len. 76]: Chapter XXXIII -- Interlopers Now do those two gentlemen not very neat about the cuffs and buttons who attended the last coroner 's inquest at the Sol 's Arms reappear in the precincts with surprising swiftness -LRB- being , in fact , breathlessly fetched by the active and intelligent beadle -RRB- , and institute perquisitions through the court , and dive into the Sol 's parlour , and write with ravenous little pens on tissue-paper .
Parsing [sent. 10549 len. 45]: Now do they note down , in the watches of the night , how the neighbourhood of Chancery Lane was yesterday , at about midnight , thrown into a state of the most intense agitation and excitement by the following alarming and horrible discovery .
Parsing [sent. 10550 len. 126]: Now do they set forth how it will doubtless be remembered that some time back a painful sensation was created in the public mind by a case of mysterious death from opium occurring in the first floor of the house occupied as a rag , bottle , and general marine store shop , by an eccentric individual of intemperate habits , far advanced in life , named Krook ; and how , by a remarkable coincidence , Krook was examined at the inquest , which it may be recollected was held on that occasion at the Sol 's Arms , a well-conducted tavern immediately adjoining the premises in question on the west side and licensed to a highly respectable landlord , Mr. James George Bogsby .
Parsing [sent. 10551 len. 184]: Now do they show -LRB- in as many words as possible -RRB- how during some hours of yesterday evening a very peculiar smell was observed by the inhabitants of the court , in which the tragical occurrence which forms the subject of that present account transpired ; and which odour was at one time so powerful that Mr. Swills , a comic vocalist professionally engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby , has himself stated to our reporter that he mentioned to Miss M. Melvilleson , a lady of some pretensions to musical ability , likewise engaged by Mr. J. G. Bogsby to sing at a series of concerts called Harmonic Assemblies , or Meetings , which it would appear are held at the Sol 's Arms under Mr. Bogsby 's direction pursuant to the Act of George the Second , that he -LRB- Mr. Swills -RRB- found his voice seriously affected by the impure state of the atmosphere , his jocose expression at the time being that he was like an empty post-office , for he had n't a single note in him .
Parsing [sent. 10552 len. 58]: How this account of Mr. Swills is entirely corroborated by two intelligent married females residing in the same court and known respectively by the names of Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins , both of whom observed the foetid effluvia and regarded them as being emitted from the premises in the occupation of Krook , the unfortunate deceased .
Parsing [sent. 10553 len. 65]: All this and a great deal more the two gentlemen who have formed an amicable partnership in the melancholy catastrophe write down on the spot ; and the boy population of the court -LRB- out of bed in a moment -RRB- swarm up the shutters of the Sol 's Arms parlour , to behold the tops of their heads while they are about it .
Parsing [sent. 10554 len. 39]: The whole court , adult as well as boy , is sleepless for that night , and can do nothing but wrap up its many heads , and talk of the ill-fated house , and look at it .
Parsing [sent. 10555 len. 28]: Miss Flite has been bravely rescued from her chamber , as if it were in flames , and accommodated with a bed at the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 10556 len. 36]: The Sol neither turns off its gas nor shuts its door all night , for any kind of public excitement makes good for the Sol and causes the court to stand in need of comfort .
Parsing [sent. 10557 len. 21]: The house has not done so much in the stomachic article of cloves or in brandy-and-water warm since the inquest .
Parsing [sent. 10558 len. 31]: The moment the pot-boy heard what had happened , he rolled up his shirt-sleeves tight to his shoulders and said , `` There 'll be a run upon us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10559 len. 45]: In the first outcry , young Piper dashed off for the fire-engines and returned in triumph at a jolting gallop perched up aloft on the Phoenix and holding on to that fabulous creature with all his might in the midst of helmets and torches .
Parsing [sent. 10560 len. 38]: One helmet remains behind after careful investigation of all chinks and crannies and slowly paces up and down before the house in company with one of the two policemen who have likewise been left in charge thereof .
Parsing [sent. 10561 len. 22]: To this trio everybody in the court possessed of sixpence has an insatiate desire to exhibit hospitality in a liquid form .
Parsing [sent. 10562 len. 32]: Mr. Weevle and his friend Mr. Guppy are within the bar at the Sol and are worth anything to the Sol that the bar contains if they will only stay there .
Parsing [sent. 10563 len. 52]: `` This is not a time , says Mr. Bogsby , `` to haggle about money , '' though he looks something sharply after it , over the counter ; `` give your orders , you two gentlemen , and you 're welcome to whatever you put a name to . ''
Parsing [sent. 10564 len. 69]: Thus entreated , the two gentlemen -LRB- Mr. Weevle especially -RRB- put names to so many things that in course of time they find it difficult to put a name to anything quite distinctly , though they still relate to all new-comers some version of the night they have had of it , and of what they said , and what they thought , and what they saw .
Parsing [sent. 10565 len. 35]: Meanwhile , one or other of the policemen often flits about the door , and pushing it open a little way at the full length of his arm , looks in from outer gloom .
Parsing [sent. 10566 len. 22]: Not that he has any suspicions , but that he may as well know what they are up to in there .
Parsing [sent. 10567 len. 42]: Thus night pursues its leaden course , finding the court still out of bed through the unwonted hours , still treating and being treated , still conducting itself similarly to a court that has had a little money left it unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 10568 len. 39]: Thus night at length with slow-retreating steps departs , and the lamp-lighter going his rounds , like an executioner to a despotic king , strikes off the little heads of fire that have aspired to lessen the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 10569 len. 9]: Thus the day cometh , whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 10570 len. 22]: And the day may discern , even with its dim London eye , that the court has been up all night .
Parsing [sent. 10571 len. 39]: Over and above the faces that have fallen drowsily on tables and the heels that lie prone on hard floors instead of beds , the brick and mortar physiognomy of the very court itself looks worn and jaded .
Parsing [sent. 10572 len. 54]: And now the neighbourhood , waking up and beginning to hear of what has happened , comes streaming in , half dressed , to ask questions ; and the two policemen and the helmet -LRB- who are far less impressible externally than the court -RRB- have enough to do to keep the door .
Parsing [sent. 10573 len. 7]: `` Good gracious , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10574 len. 7]: says Mr. Snagsby , coming up .
Parsing [sent. 10575 len. 8]: `` What 's this I hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10576 len. 14]: `` Why , it 's true , '' returns one of the policemen .
Parsing [sent. 10577 len. 7]: `` That 's what it is .
Parsing [sent. 10578 len. 8]: Now move on here , come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10579 len. 42]: `` Why , good gracious , gentlemen , '' says Mr. Snagsby , somewhat promptly backed away , `` I was at this door last night betwixt ten and eleven o'clock in conversation with the young man who lodges here . ''
Parsing [sent. 10580 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10581 len. 4]: returns the policeman .
Parsing [sent. 10582 len. 11]: `` You will find the young man next door then .
Parsing [sent. 10583 len. 18]: Now move on here , some of you , '' `` Not hurt , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10584 len. 4]: says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 10585 len. 3]: `` Hurt ?
Parsing [sent. 10586 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 10587 len. 7]: What 's to hurt him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10588 len. 44]: Mr. Snagsby , wholly unable to answer this or any question in his troubled mind , repairs to the Sol 's Arms and finds Mr. Weevle languishing over tea and toast with a considerable expression on him of exhausted excitement and exhausted tobacco-smoke .
Parsing [sent. 10589 len. 7]: `` And Mr. Guppy likewise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10590 len. 4]: quoth Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 10591 len. 7]: `` Dear , dear , dear !
Parsing [sent. 10592 len. 9]: What a fate there seems in all this !
Parsing [sent. 10593 len. 25]: And my lit -- '' Mr. Snagsby 's power of speech deserts him in the formation of the words `` my little woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 10594 len. 39]: For to see that injured female walk into the Sol 's Arms at that hour of the morning and stand before the beer-engine , with her eyes fixed upon him like an accusing spirit , strikes him dumb .
Parsing [sent. 10595 len. 20]: `` My dear , '' says Mr. Snagsby when his tongue is loosened , `` will you take anything ?
Parsing [sent. 10596 len. 18]: A little -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- drop of shrub ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10597 len. 8]: `` No , '' says Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 10598 len. 11]: `` My love , you know these two gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10599 len. 4]: `` Yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10600 len. 21]: says Mrs. Snagsby , and in a rigid manner acknowledges their presence , still fixing Mr. Snagsby with her eye .
Parsing [sent. 10601 len. 10]: The devoted Mr. Snagsby can not bear this treatment .
Parsing [sent. 10602 len. 16]: He takes Mrs. Snagsby by the hand and leads her aside to an adjacent cask .
Parsing [sent. 10603 len. 15]: `` My little woman , why do you look at me in that way ?
Parsing [sent. 10604 len. 7]: Pray do n't do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10605 len. 23]: `` I ca n't help my looks , '' says Mrs. Snagsby , `` and if I could I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 10606 len. 21]: Mr. Snagsby , with his cough of meekness , rejoins , `` Would n't you really , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10607 len. 3]: and meditates .
Parsing [sent. 10608 len. 20]: Then coughs his cough of trouble and says , `` This is a dreadful mystery , my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10609 len. 9]: still fearfully disconcerted by Mrs. Snagsby 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 10610 len. 19]: `` It IS , '' returns Mrs. Snagsby , shaking her head , `` a dreadful mystery . ''
Parsing [sent. 10611 len. 37]: `` My little woman , '' urges Mr. Snagsby in a piteous manner , `` do n't for goodness ' sake speak to me with that bitter expression and look at me in that searching way !
Parsing [sent. 10612 len. 11]: I beg and entreat of you not to do it .
Parsing [sent. 10613 len. 20]: Good Lord , you do n't suppose that I would go spontaneously combusting any person , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10614 len. 11]: `` I ca n't say , '' returns Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 10615 len. 18]: On a hasty review of his unfortunate position , Mr. Snagsby `` ca n't say '' either .
Parsing [sent. 10616 len. 18]: He is not prepared positively to deny that he may have had something to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 10617 len. 41]: He has had something -- he do n't know what -- to do with so much in this connexion that is mysterious that it is possible he may even be implicated , without knowing it , in the present transaction .
Parsing [sent. 10618 len. 11]: He faintly wipes his forehead with his handkerchief and gasps .
Parsing [sent. 10619 len. 39]: `` My life , '' says the unhappy stationer , `` would you have any objections to mention why , being in general so delicately circumspect in your conduct , you come into a wine-vaults before breakfast ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10620 len. 8]: `` Why do YOU come here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10621 len. 4]: inquires Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 10622 len. 27]: `` My dear , merely to know the rights of the fatal accident which has happened to the venerable party who has been -- combusted . ''
Parsing [sent. 10623 len. 11]: Mr. Snagsby has made a pause to suppress a groan .
Parsing [sent. 10624 len. 19]: `` I should then have related them to you , my love , over your French roll . ''
Parsing [sent. 10625 len. 7]: `` I dare say you would !
Parsing [sent. 10626 len. 10]: You relate everything to me , Mr. Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 10627 len. 54]: `` Every -- my lit -- '' `` I should be glad , '' says Mrs. Snagsby after contemplating his increased confusion with a severe and sinister smile , `` if you would come home with me ; I think you may be safer there , Mr. Snagsby , than anywhere else . ''
Parsing [sent. 10628 len. 18]: `` My love , I do n't know but what I may be , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 10629 len. 7]: I am ready to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 10630 len. 40]: Mr. Snagsby casts his eye forlornly round the bar , gives Messrs. Weevle and Guppy good morning , assures them of the satisfaction with which he sees them uninjured , and accompanies Mrs. Snagsby from the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 10631 len. 40]: Before night his doubt whether he may not be responsible for some inconceivable part in the catastrophe which is the talk of the whole neighbourhood is almost resolved into certainty by Mrs. Snagsby 's pertinacity in that fixed gaze .
Parsing [sent. 10632 len. 36]: His mental sufferings are so great that he entertains wandering ideas of delivering himself up to justice and requiring to be cleared if innocent and punished with the utmost rigour of the law if guilty .
Parsing [sent. 10633 len. 42]: Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , having taken their breakfast , step into Lincoln 's Inn to take a little walk about the square and clear as many of the dark cobwebs out of their brains as a little walk may .
Parsing [sent. 10634 len. 58]: `` There can be no more favourable time than the present , Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy after they have broodingly made out the four sides of the square , `` for a word or two between us upon a point on which we must , with very little delay , come to an understanding . ''
Parsing [sent. 10635 len. 12]: `` Now , I tell you what , William G. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10636 len. 12]: returns the other , eyeing his companion with a bloodshot eye .
Parsing [sent. 10637 len. 19]: `` If it 's a point of conspiracy , you need n't take the trouble to mention it .
Parsing [sent. 10638 len. 17]: I have had enough of that , and I ai n't going to have any more .
Parsing [sent. 10639 len. 15]: We shall have YOU taking fire next or blowing up with a bang . ''
Parsing [sent. 10640 len. 56]: This supposititious phenomenon is so very disagreeable to Mr. Guppy that his voice quakes as he says in a moral way , `` Tony , I should have thought that what we went through last night would have been a lesson to you never to be personal any more as long as you lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 10641 len. 33]: To which Mr. Weevle returns , `` William , I should have thought it would have been a lesson to YOU never to conspire any more as long as you lived . ''
Parsing [sent. 10642 len. 12]: To which Mr. Guppy says , `` Who 's conspiring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10643 len. 13]: To which Mr. Jobling replies , `` Why , YOU are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10644 len. 14]: To which Mr. Guppy retorts , `` No , I am not . ''
Parsing [sent. 10645 len. 14]: To which Mr. Jobling retorts again , `` Yes , you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10646 len. 12]: To which Mr. Guppy retorts , `` Who says so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10647 len. 12]: To which Mr. Jobling retorts , `` I say so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10648 len. 12]: To which Mr. Guppy retorts , `` Oh , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10649 len. 12]: To which Mr. Jobling retorts , `` Yes , indeed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10650 len. 21]: And both being now in a heated state , they walk on silently for a while to cool down again .
Parsing [sent. 10651 len. 29]: `` Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy then , `` if you heard your friend out instead of flying at him , you would n't fall into mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 10652 len. 11]: But your temper is hasty and you are not considerate .
Parsing [sent. 10653 len. 19]: Possessing in yourself , Tony , all that is calculated to charm the eye -- '' `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10654 len. 5]: Blow the eye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10655 len. 8]: cries Mr. Weevle , cutting him short .
Parsing [sent. 10656 len. 10]: `` Say what you have got to say ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10657 len. 65]: Finding his friend in this morose and material condition , Mr. Guppy only expresses the finer feelings of his soul through the tone of injury in which he recommences , `` Tony , when I say there is a point on which we must come to an understanding pretty soon , I say so quite apart from any kind of conspiring , however innocent .
Parsing [sent. 10658 len. 21]: You know it is professionally arranged beforehand in all cases that are tried what facts the witnesses are to prove .
Parsing [sent. 10659 len. 32]: Is it or is it not desirable that we should know what facts we are to prove on the inquiry into the death of this unfortunate old mo -- gentleman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10660 len. 23]: -LRB- Mr. Guppy was going to say `` mogul , '' but thinks `` gentleman '' better suited to the circumstances . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 10661 len. 4]: `` What facts ?
Parsing [sent. 10662 len. 4]: THE facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 10663 len. 8]: `` The facts bearing on that inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 10664 len. 46]: Those are '' -- Mr. Guppy tells them off on his fingers -- `` what we knew of his habits , when you saw him last , what his condition was then , the discovery that we made , and how we made it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10665 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' says Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 10666 len. 8]: `` Those are about the facts . ''
Parsing [sent. 10667 len. 51]: `` We made the discovery in consequence of his having , in his eccentric way , an appointment with you at twelve o'clock at night , when you were to explain some writing to him as you had often done before on account of his not being able to read .
Parsing [sent. 10668 len. 16]: I , spending the evening with you , was called down -- and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 10669 len. 31]: The inquiry being only into the circumstances touching the death of the deceased , it 's not necessary to go beyond these facts , I suppose you 'll agree ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10670 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10671 len. 4]: returns Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 10672 len. 6]: `` I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 10673 len. 11]: `` And this is not a conspiracy , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10674 len. 5]: says the injured Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10675 len. 23]: `` No , '' returns his friend ; `` if it 's nothing worse than this , I withdraw the observation . ''
Parsing [sent. 10676 len. 51]: `` Now , Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy , taking his arm again and walking him slowly on , `` I should like to know , in a friendly way , whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your continuing to live at that place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10677 len. 7]: `` What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10678 len. 5]: says Tony , stopping .
Parsing [sent. 10679 len. 20]: `` Whether you have yet thought over the many advantages of your continuing to live at that place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10680 len. 9]: repeats Mr. Guppy , walking him on again .
Parsing [sent. 10681 len. 5]: `` At what place ?
Parsing [sent. 10682 len. 4]: THAT place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10683 len. 11]: pointing in the direction of the rag and bottle shop .
Parsing [sent. 10684 len. 4]: Mr. Guppy nods .
Parsing [sent. 10685 len. 27]: `` Why , I would n't pass another night there for any consideration that you could offer me , '' says Mr. Weevle , haggardly staring .
Parsing [sent. 10686 len. 10]: `` Do you mean it though , Tony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10687 len. 4]: `` Mean it !
Parsing [sent. 10688 len. 9]: Do I look as if I mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 10689 len. 21]: I feel as if I do ; I know that , '' says Mr. Weevle with a very genuine shudder .
Parsing [sent. 10690 len. 79]: `` Then the possibility or probability -- for such it must be considered -- of your never being disturbed in possession of those effects lately belonging to a lone old man who seemed to have no relation in the world , and the certainty of your being able to find out what he really had got stored up there , do n't weigh with you at all against last night , Tony , if I understand you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10691 len. 13]: says Mr. Guppy , biting his thumb with the appetite of vexation .
Parsing [sent. 10692 len. 4]: `` Certainly not .
Parsing [sent. 10693 len. 13]: Talk in that cool way of a fellow 's living there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10694 len. 5]: cries Mr. Weevle indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 10695 len. 8]: `` Go and live there yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 10696 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10697 len. 5]: I , Tony ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10698 len. 7]: says Mr. Guppy , soothing him .
Parsing [sent. 10699 len. 22]: `` I have never lived there and could n't get a lodging there now , whereas you have got one . ''
Parsing [sent. 10700 len. 17]: `` You are welcome to it , '' rejoins his friend , `` and -- ugh !
Parsing [sent. 10701 len. 11]: -- you may make yourself at home in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10702 len. 30]: `` Then you really and truly at this point , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` give up the whole thing , if I understand you , Tony ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10703 len. 23]: `` You never , '' returns Tony with a most convincing steadfastness , `` said a truer word in all your life .
Parsing [sent. 10704 len. 4]: I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10705 len. 30]: While they are so conversing , a hackney-coach drives into the square , on the box of which vehicle a very tall hat makes itself manifest to the public .
Parsing [sent. 10706 len. 45]: Inside the coach , and consequently not so manifest to the multitude , though sufficiently so to the two friends , for the coach stops almost at their feet , are the venerable Mr. Smallweed and Mrs. Smallweed , accompanied by their granddaughter Judy .
Parsing [sent. 10707 len. 47]: An air of haste and excitement pervades the party , and as the tall hat -LRB- surmounting Mr. Smallweed the younger -RRB- alights , Mr. Smallweed the elder pokes his head out of window and bawls to Mr. Guppy , `` How de do , sir !
Parsing [sent. 10708 len. 5]: How de do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10709 len. 20]: `` What do Chick and his family want here at this time of the morning , I wonder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10710 len. 9]: says Mr. Guppy , nodding to his familiar .
Parsing [sent. 10711 len. 18]: `` My dear sir , '' cries Grandfather Smallweed , `` would you do me a favour ?
Parsing [sent. 10712 len. 30]: Would you and your friend be so very obleeging as to carry me into the public-house in the court , while Bart and his sister bring their grandmother along ?
Parsing [sent. 10713 len. 13]: Would you do an old man that good turn , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10714 len. 18]: Mr. Guppy looks at his friend , repeating inquiringly , `` The public-house in the court ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10715 len. 14]: And they prepare to bear the venerable burden to the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 10716 len. 7]: `` There 's your fare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10717 len. 18]: says the patriarch to the coachman with a fierce grin and shaking his incapable fist at him .
Parsing [sent. 10718 len. 18]: `` Ask me for a penny more , and I 'll have my lawful revenge upon you .
Parsing [sent. 10719 len. 14]: My dear young men , be easy with me , if you please .
Parsing [sent. 10720 len. 9]: Allow me to catch you round the neck .
Parsing [sent. 10721 len. 11]: I wo n't squeeze you tighter than I can help .
Parsing [sent. 10722 len. 4]: Oh , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 10723 len. 5]: Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 10724 len. 6]: Oh , my bones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10725 len. 25]: It is well that the Sol is not far off , for Mr. Weevle presents an apoplectic appearance before half the distance is accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 10726 len. 49]: With no worse aggravation of his symptoms , however , than the utterance of divers croaking sounds expressive of obstructed respiration , he fulils his share of the porterage and the benevolent old gentleman is deposited by his own desire in the parlour of the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 10727 len. 6]: `` Oh , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10728 len. 14]: gasps Mr. Smallweed , looking about him , breathless , from an arm-chair .
Parsing [sent. 10729 len. 6]: `` Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 10730 len. 7]: Oh , my bones and back !
Parsing [sent. 10731 len. 7]: Oh , my aches and pains !
Parsing [sent. 10732 len. 13]: Sit down , you dancing , prancing , shambling , scrambling poll-parrot !
Parsing [sent. 10733 len. 4]: Sit down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10734 len. 50]: This little apostrophe to Mrs. Smallweed is occasioned by a propensity on the part of that unlucky old lady whenever she finds herself on her feet to amble about and `` set '' to inanimate objects , accompanying herself with a chattering noise , as in a witch dance .
Parsing [sent. 10735 len. 94]: A nervous affection has probably as much to do with these demonstrations as any imbecile intention in the poor old woman , but on the present occasion they are so particularly lively in connexion with the Windsor arm-chair , fellow to that in which Mr. Smallweed is seated , that she only quite desists when her grandchildren have held her down in it , her lord in the meanwhile bestowing upon her , with great volubility , the endearing epithet of `` a pig-headed jackdaw , '' repeated a surprising number of times .
Parsing [sent. 10736 len. 23]: `` My dear sir , '' Grandfather Smallweed then proceeds , addressing Mr. Guppy , `` there has been a calamity here .
Parsing [sent. 10737 len. 11]: Have you heard of it , either of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10738 len. 7]: `` Heard of it , sir !
Parsing [sent. 10739 len. 7]: Why , we discovered it . ''
Parsing [sent. 10740 len. 5]: `` You discovered it .
Parsing [sent. 10741 len. 5]: You two discovered it !
Parsing [sent. 10742 len. 7]: Bart , THEY discovered it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10743 len. 13]: The two discoverers stare at the Smallweeds , who return the compliment .
Parsing [sent. 10744 len. 39]: `` My dear friends , '' whines Grandfather Smallweed , putting out both his hands , `` I owe you a thousand thanks for discharging the melancholy office of discovering the ashes of Mrs. Smallweed 's brother . ''
Parsing [sent. 10745 len. 4]: `` Eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10746 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 10747 len. 14]: `` Mrs. Smallweed 's brother , my dear friend -- her only relation .
Parsing [sent. 10748 len. 21]: We were not on terms , which is to be deplored now , but he never WOULD be on terms .
Parsing [sent. 10749 len. 7]: He was not fond of us .
Parsing [sent. 10750 len. 9]: He was eccentric -- he was very eccentric .
Parsing [sent. 10751 len. 22]: Unless he has left a will -LRB- which is not at all likely -RRB- I shall take out letters of administration .
Parsing [sent. 10752 len. 21]: I have come down to look after the property ; it must be sealed up , it must be protected .
Parsing [sent. 10753 len. 31]: I have come down , '' repeats Grandfather Smallweed , hooking the air towards him with all his ten fingers at once , `` to look after the property . ''
Parsing [sent. 10754 len. 27]: `` I think , Small , '' says the disconsolate Mr. Guppy , `` you might have mentioned that the old man was your uncle . ''
Parsing [sent. 10755 len. 31]: `` You two were so close about him that I thought you would like me to be the same , '' returns that old bird with a secretly glistening eye .
Parsing [sent. 10756 len. 11]: `` Besides , I was n't proud of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 10757 len. 23]: `` Besides which , it was nothing to you , you know , whether he was or not , '' says Judy .
Parsing [sent. 10758 len. 7]: Also with a secretly glistening eye .
Parsing [sent. 10759 len. 32]: `` He never saw me in his life to know me , '' observed Small ; `` I do n't know why I should introduce HIM , I am sure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10760 len. 46]: `` No , he never communicated with us , which is to be deplored , '' the old gentleman strikes in , `` but I have come to look after the property -- to look over the papers , and to look after the property .
Parsing [sent. 10761 len. 7]: We shall make good our title .
Parsing [sent. 10762 len. 9]: It is in the hands of my solicitor .
Parsing [sent. 10763 len. 38]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , of Lincoln 's Inn Fields , over the way there , is so good as to act as my solicitor ; and grass do n't grow under HIS feet , I can tell ye .
Parsing [sent. 10764 len. 24]: Krook was Mrs. Smallweed 's only brother ; she had no relation but Krook , and Krook had no relation but Mrs. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 10765 len. 19]: I am speaking of your brother , you brimstone black-beetle , that was seventy-six years of age . ''
Parsing [sent. 10766 len. 19]: Mrs. Smallweed instantly begins to shake her head and pipe up , `` Seventy-six pound seven and sevenpence !
Parsing [sent. 10767 len. 6]: Seventysix thousand bags of money !
Parsing [sent. 10768 len. 10]: Seventy-six hundred thousand million of parcels of bank-notes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10769 len. 10]: `` Will somebody give me a quart pot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10770 len. 17]: exclaims her exasperated husband , looking helplessly about him and finding no missile within his reach .
Parsing [sent. 10771 len. 9]: `` Will somebody obleege me with a spittoon ?
Parsing [sent. 10772 len. 13]: Will somebody hand me anything hard and bruising to pelt at her ?
Parsing [sent. 10773 len. 14]: You hag , you cat , you dog , you brimstone barker ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10774 len. 53]: Here Mr. Smallweed , wrought up to the highest pitch by his own eloquence , actually throws Judy at her grandmother in default of anything else , by butting that young virgin at the old lady with such force as he can muster and then dropping into his chair in a heap .
Parsing [sent. 10775 len. 30]: `` Shake me up , somebody , if you 'll he so good , '' says the voice from within the faintly struggling bundle into which he has collapsed .
Parsing [sent. 10776 len. 10]: `` I have come to look after the property .
Parsing [sent. 10777 len. 23]: Shake me up , and call in the police on duty at the next house to be explained to about the property .
Parsing [sent. 10778 len. 11]: My solicitor will be here presently to protect the property .
Parsing [sent. 10779 len. 13]: Transportation or the gallows for anybody who shall touch the property ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10780 len. 36]: As his dutiful grandchildren set him up , panting , and putting him through the usual restorative process of shaking and punching , he still repeats like an echo , `` The -- the property !
Parsing [sent. 10781 len. 3]: The property !
Parsing [sent. 10782 len. 3]: Property ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10783 len. 33]: Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy look at each other , the former as having relinquished the whole affair , the latter with a discomfited countenance as having entertained some lingering expectations yet .
Parsing [sent. 10784 len. 14]: But there is nothing to be done in opposition to the Smallweed interest .
Parsing [sent. 10785 len. 51]: Mr. Tulkinghorn 's clerk comes down from his official pew in the chambers to mention to the police that Mr. Tulkinghorn is answerable for its being all correct about the next of kin and that the papers and effects will be formally taken possession of in due time and course .
Parsing [sent. 10786 len. 49]: Mr. Smallweed is at once permitted so far to assert his supremacy as to be carried on a visit of sentiment into the next house and upstairs into Miss Flite 's deserted room , where he looks like a hideous bird of prey newly added to her aviary .
Parsing [sent. 10787 len. 26]: The arrival of this unexpected heir soon taking wind in the court still makes good for the Sol and keeps the court upon its mettle .
Parsing [sent. 10788 len. 35]: Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins think it hard upon the young man if there really is no will , and consider that a handsome present ought to be made him out of the estate .
Parsing [sent. 10789 len. 49]: Young Piper and young Perkins , as members of that restless juvenile circle which is the terror of the foot-passengers in Chancery Lane , crumble into ashes behind the pump and under the archway all day long , where wild yells and hootings take place over their remains .
Parsing [sent. 10790 len. 27]: Little Swills and Miss M. Melvilleson enter into affable conversation with their patrons , feeling that these unusual occurrences level the barriers between professionals and non-professionals .
Parsing [sent. 10791 len. 88]: Mr. Bogsby puts up `` The popular song of King Death , with chorus by the whole strength of the company , '' as the great Harmonic feature of the week and announces in the bill that `` J. G. B. is induced to do so at a considerable extra expense in consequence of a wish which has been very generally expressed at the bar by a large body of respectable individuals and in homage to a late melancholy event which has aroused so much sensation . ''
Parsing [sent. 10792 len. 39]: There is one point connected with the deceased upon which the court is particularly anxious , namely , that the fiction of a full-sized coffin should be preserved , though there is so little to put in it .
Parsing [sent. 10793 len. 49]: Upon the undertaker 's stating in the Sol 's bar in the course of the day that he has received orders to construct `` a six-footer , '' the general solicitude is much relieved , and it is considered that Mr. Smallweed 's conduct does him great honour .
Parsing [sent. 10794 len. 63]: Out of the court , and a long way out of it , there is considerable excitement too , for men of science and philosophy come to look , and carriages set down doctors at the corner who arrive with the same intent , and there is more learned talk about inflammable gases and phosphuretted hydrogen than the court has ever imagined .
Parsing [sent. 10795 len. 203]: Some of these authorities -LRB- of course the wisest -RRB- hold with indignation that the deceased had no business to die in the alleged manner ; and being reminded by other authorities of a certain inquiry into the evidence for such deaths reprinted in the sixth volume of the Philosophical Transactions ; and also of a book not quite unknown on English medical jurisprudence ; and likewise of the Italian case of the Countess Cornelia Baudi as set forth in detail by one Bianchini , prebendary of Verona , who wrote a scholarly work or so and was occasionally heard of in his time as having gleams of reason in him ; and also of the testimony of Messrs. Fodere and Mere , two pestilent Frenchmen who WOULD investigate the subject ; and further , of the corroborative testimony of Monsieur Le Cat , a rather celebrated French surgeon once upon a time , who had the unpoliteness to live in a house where such a case occurred and even to write an account of it -- still they regard the late Mr. Krook 's obstinacy in going out of the world by any such by-way as wholly unjustifiable and personally offensive .
Parsing [sent. 10796 len. 33]: The less the court understands of all this , the more the court likes it , and the greater enjoyment it has in the stock in trade of the Sol 's Arms .
Parsing [sent. 10797 len. 81]: Then there comes the artist of a picture newspaper , with a foreground and figures ready drawn for anything from a wreck on the Cornish coast to a review in Hyde Park or a meeting in Manchester , and in Mrs. Perkins ' own room , memorable evermore , he then and there throws in upon the block Mr. Krook 's house , as large as life ; in fact , considerably larger , making a very temple of it .
Parsing [sent. 10798 len. 38]: Similarly , being permitted to look in at the door of the fatal chamber , he depicts that apartment as three-quarters of a mile long by fifty yards high , at which the court is particularly charmed .
Parsing [sent. 10799 len. 50]: All this time the two gentlemen before mentioned pop in and out of every house and assist at the philosophical disputations -- go everywhere and listen to everybody -- and yet are always diving into the Sol 's parlour and writing with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper .
Parsing [sent. 10800 len. 77]: At last come the coroner and his inquiry , like as before , except that the coroner cherishes this case as being out of the common way and tells the gentlemen of the jury , in his private capacity , that `` that would seem to be an unlucky house next door , gentlemen , a destined house ; but so we sometimes find it , and these are mysteries we ca n't account for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10801 len. 12]: After which the six-footer comes into action and is much admired .
Parsing [sent. 10802 len. 62]: In all these proceedings Mr. Guppy has so slight a part , except when he gives his evidence , that he is moved on like a private individual and can only haunt the secret house on the outside , where he has the mortification of seeing Mr. Smallweed padlocking the door , and of bitterly knowing himself to be shut out .
Parsing [sent. 10803 len. 37]: But before these proceedings draw to a close , that is to say , on the night next after the catastrophe , Mr. Guppy has a thing to say that must be said to Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 10804 len. 58]: For which reason , with a sinking heart and with that hang-dog sense of guilt upon him which dread and watching enfolded in the Sol 's Arms have produced , the young man of the name of Guppy presents himself at the town mansion at about seven o'clock in the evening and requests to see her ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 10805 len. 20]: Mercury replies that she is going out to dinner ; do n't he see the carriage at the door ?
Parsing [sent. 10806 len. 20]: Yes , he does see the carriage at the door ; but he wants to see my Lady too .
Parsing [sent. 10807 len. 30]: Mercury is disposed , as he will presently declare to a fellow-gentleman in waiting , `` to pitch into the young man '' ; but his instructions are positive .
Parsing [sent. 10808 len. 15]: Therefore he sulkily supposes that the young man must come up into the library .
Parsing [sent. 10809 len. 21]: There he leaves the young man in a large room , not over-light , while he makes report of him .
Parsing [sent. 10810 len. 24]: Mr. Guppy looks into the shade in all directions , discovering everywhere a certain charred and whitened little heap of coal or wood .
Parsing [sent. 10811 len. 6]: Presently he hears a rustling .
Parsing [sent. 10812 len. 4]: Is it -- ?
Parsing [sent. 10813 len. 17]: No , it 's no ghost , but fair flesh and blood , most brilliantly dressed .
Parsing [sent. 10814 len. 18]: `` I have to beg your ladyship 's pardon , '' Mr. Guppy stammers , very downcast .
Parsing [sent. 10815 len. 21]: `` This is an inconvenient time -- '' `` I told you , you could come at any time . ''
Parsing [sent. 10816 len. 15]: She takes a chair , looking straight at him as on the last occasion .
Parsing [sent. 10817 len. 5]: `` Thank your ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 10818 len. 7]: Your ladyship is very affable . ''
Parsing [sent. 10819 len. 7]: `` You can sit down . ''
Parsing [sent. 10820 len. 9]: There is not much affability in her tone .
Parsing [sent. 10821 len. 45]: `` I do n't know , your ladyship , that it 's worth while my sitting down and detaining you , for I -- I have not got the letters that I mentioned when I had the honour of waiting on your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 10822 len. 10]: `` Have you come merely to say so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10823 len. 10]: `` Merely to say so , your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 10824 len. 26]: Mr. Guppy besides being depressed , disappointed , and uneasy , is put at a further disadvantage by the splendour and beauty of her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 10825 len. 22]: She knows its influence perfectly , has studied it too well to miss a grain of its effect on any one .
Parsing [sent. 10826 len. 54]: As she looks at him so steadily and coldly , he not only feels conscious that he has no guide in the least perception of what is really the complexion of her thoughts , but also that he is being every moment , as it were , removed further and further from her .
Parsing [sent. 10827 len. 9]: She will not speak , it is plain .
Parsing [sent. 10828 len. 4]: So he must .
Parsing [sent. 10829 len. 42]: `` In short , your ladyship , '' says Mr. Guppy like a meanly penitent thief , `` the person I was to have had the letters of , has come to a sudden end , and -- '' He stops .
Parsing [sent. 10830 len. 7]: Lady Dedlock calmly finishes the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 10831 len. 11]: `` And the letters are destroyed with the person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10832 len. 16]: Mr. Guppy would say no if he could -- as he is unable to hide .
Parsing [sent. 10833 len. 9]: `` I believe so , your ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 10834 len. 14]: If he could see the least sparkle of relief in her face now ?
Parsing [sent. 10835 len. 32]: No , he could see no such thing , even if that brave outside did not utterly put him away , and he were not looking beyond it and about it .
Parsing [sent. 10836 len. 11]: He falters an awkward excuse or two for his failure .
Parsing [sent. 10837 len. 10]: `` Is this all you have to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10838 len. 18]: inquires Lady Dedlock , having heard him out -- or as nearly out as he can stumble .
Parsing [sent. 10839 len. 7]: Mr. Guppy thinks that 's all .
Parsing [sent. 10840 len. 28]: `` You had better be sure that you wish to say nothing more to me , this being the last time you will have the opportunity . ''
Parsing [sent. 10841 len. 6]: Mr. Guppy is quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 10842 len. 14]: And indeed he has no such wish at present , by any means .
Parsing [sent. 10843 len. 5]: `` That is enough .
Parsing [sent. 10844 len. 6]: I will dispense with excuses .
Parsing [sent. 10845 len. 6]: Good evening to you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10846 len. 17]: And she rings for Mercury to show the young man of the name of Guppy out .
Parsing [sent. 10847 len. 23]: But in that house , in that same moment , there happens to be an old man of the name of Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 10848 len. 46]: And that old man , coming with his quiet footstep to the library , has his hand at that moment on the handle of the door -- comes in -- and comes face to face with the young man as he is leaving the room .
Parsing [sent. 10849 len. 23]: One glance between the old man and the lady , and for an instant the blind that is always down flies up .
Parsing [sent. 10850 len. 9]: Suspicion , eager and sharp , looks out .
Parsing [sent. 10851 len. 6]: Another instant , close again .
Parsing [sent. 10852 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 10853 len. 8]: I beg your pardon a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 10854 len. 13]: It is so very unusual to find you here at this hour .
Parsing [sent. 10855 len. 7]: I supposed the room was empty .
Parsing [sent. 10856 len. 6]: I beg your pardon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10857 len. 4]: `` Stay ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10858 len. 6]: She negligently calls him back .
Parsing [sent. 10859 len. 7]: `` Remain here , I beg .
Parsing [sent. 10860 len. 7]: I am going out to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 10861 len. 12]: I have nothing more to say to this young man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10862 len. 23]: The disconcerted young man bows , as he goes out , and cringingly hopes that Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields is well .
Parsing [sent. 10863 len. 6]: `` Aye , aye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10864 len. 25]: says the lawyer , looking at him from under his bent brows , though he has no need to look again -- not he .
Parsing [sent. 10865 len. 10]: `` From Kenge and Carboy 's , surely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10866 len. 9]: `` Kenge and Carboy 's , Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 10867 len. 7]: Name of Guppy , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 10868 len. 5]: `` To be sure .
Parsing [sent. 10869 len. 14]: Why , thank you , Mr. Guppy , I am very well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10870 len. 8]: `` Happy to hear it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 10871 len. 17]: You ca n't be too well , sir , for the credit of the profession . ''
Parsing [sent. 10872 len. 8]: `` Thank you , Mr. Guppy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10873 len. 5]: Mr. Guppy sneaks away .
Parsing [sent. 10874 len. 26]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , such a foil in his old-fashioned rusty black to Lady Dedlock 's brightness , hands her down the staircase to her carriage .
Parsing [sent. 10875 len. 19]: He returns rubbing his chin , and rubs it a good deal in the course of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 10876 len. 23]: Chapter XXXIV -- A Turn of the Screw `` Now , what , '' says Mr. George , `` may this be ?
Parsing [sent. 10877 len. 7]: Is it blank cartridge or ball ?
Parsing [sent. 10878 len. 10]: A flash in the pan or a shot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10879 len. 20]: An open letter is the subject of the trooper 's speculations , and it seems to perplex him mightily .
Parsing [sent. 10880 len. 58]: He looks at it at arm 's length , brings it close to him , holds it in his right hand , holds it in his left hand , reads it with his head on this side , with his head on that side , contracts his eyebrows , elevates them , still can not satisfy himself .
Parsing [sent. 10881 len. 39]: He smooths it out upon the table with his heavy palm , and thoughtfully walking up and down the gallery , makes a halt before it every now and then to come upon it with a fresh eye .
Parsing [sent. 10882 len. 6]: Even that wo n't do .
Parsing [sent. 10883 len. 17]: `` Is it , '' Mr. George still muses , `` blank cartridge or ball ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10884 len. 46]: Phil Squod , with the aid of a brush and paint-pot , is employed in the distance whitening the targets , softly whistling in quick-march time and in drum-and-fife manner that he must and will go back again to the girl he left behind him .
Parsing [sent. 10885 len. 4]: `` Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10886 len. 8]: The trooper beckons as he calls him .
Parsing [sent. 10887 len. 29]: Phil approaches in his usual way , sidling off at first as if he were going anywhere else and then bearing down upon his commander like a bayonet-charge .
Parsing [sent. 10888 len. 26]: Certain splashes of white show in high relief upon his dirty face , and he scrapes his one eyebrow with the handle of the brush .
Parsing [sent. 10889 len. 5]: `` Attention , Phil !
Parsing [sent. 10890 len. 5]: Listen to this . ''
Parsing [sent. 10891 len. 9]: `` Steady , commander , steady . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 10892 len. 3]: ` Sir .
Parsing [sent. 10893 len. 73]: Allow me to remind you -LRB- though there is no legal necessity for my doing so , as you are aware -RRB- that the bill at two months ' date drawn on yourself by Mr. Matthew Bagnet , and by you accepted , for the sum of ninety-seven pounds four shillings and ninepence , will become due to-morrow , when you will please be prepared to take up the same on presentation .
Parsing [sent. 10894 len. 6]: Yours , Joshua Smallweed . '
Parsing [sent. 10895 len. 10]: What do you make of that , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10896 len. 8]: `` Mischief , guv ` ner . ''
Parsing [sent. 10897 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10898 len. 34]: `` I think , '' replies Phil after pensively tracing out a cross-wrinkle in his forehead with the brush-handle , `` that mischeevious consequences is always meant when money 's asked for . ''
Parsing [sent. 10899 len. 15]: `` Lookye , Phil , '' says the trooper , sitting on the table .
Parsing [sent. 10900 len. 29]: `` First and last , I have paid , I may say , half as much again as this principal in interest and one thing and another . ''
Parsing [sent. 10901 len. 36]: Phil intimates by sidling back a pace or two , with a very unaccountable wrench of his wry face , that he does not regard the transaction as being made more promising by this incident .
Parsing [sent. 10902 len. 23]: `` And lookye further , Phil , '' says the trooper , staying his premature conclusions with a wave of his hand .
Parsing [sent. 10903 len. 18]: `` There has always been an understanding that this bill was to be what they call renewed .
Parsing [sent. 10904 len. 10]: And it has been renewed no end of times .
Parsing [sent. 10905 len. 7]: What do you say now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10906 len. 17]: `` I say that I think the times is come to a end at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 10907 len. 4]: `` You do ?
Parsing [sent. 10908 len. 2]: Humph !
Parsing [sent. 10909 len. 10]: I am much of the same mind myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 10910 len. 14]: `` Joshua Smallweed is him that was brought here in a chair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10911 len. 5]: `` The same . ''
Parsing [sent. 10912 len. 46]: `` Guv ` ner , '' says Phil with exceeding gravity , `` he 's a leech in his dispositions , he 's a screw and a wice in his actions , a snake in his twistings , and a lobster in his claws . ''
Parsing [sent. 10913 len. 61]: Having thus expressively uttered his sentiments , Mr. Squod , after waiting a little to ascertain if any further remark be expected of him , gets back by his usual series of movements to the target he has in hand and vigorously signifies through his former musical medium that he must and he will return to that ideal young lady .
Parsing [sent. 10914 len. 12]: George , having folded the letter , walks in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 10915 len. 23]: `` There IS a way , commander , '' says Phil , looking cunningly at him , `` of settling this . ''
Parsing [sent. 10916 len. 8]: `` Paying the money , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 10917 len. 6]: I wish I could . ''
Parsing [sent. 10918 len. 5]: Phil shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 10919 len. 15]: `` No , guv ` ner , no ; not so bad as that .
Parsing [sent. 10920 len. 26]: There IS a way , '' says Phil with a highly artistic turn of his brush ; `` what I 'm a-doing at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 10921 len. 4]: `` Whitewashing . ''
Parsing [sent. 10922 len. 3]: Phil nods .
Parsing [sent. 10923 len. 8]: `` A pretty way that would be !
Parsing [sent. 10924 len. 13]: Do you know what would become of the Bagnets in that case ?
Parsing [sent. 10925 len. 14]: Do you know they would be ruined to pay off my old scores ?
Parsing [sent. 10926 len. 32]: YOU 'RE a moral character , '' says the trooper , eyeing him in his large way with no small indignation ; `` upon my life you are , Phil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10927 len. 88]: Phil , on one knee at the target , is in course of protesting earnestly , though not without many allegorical scoops of his brush and smoothings of the white surface round the rim with his thumb , that he had forgotten the Bagnet responsibility and would not so much as injure a hair of the head of any member of that worthy family when steps are audible in the long passage without , and a cheerful voice is heard to wonder whether George is at home .
Parsing [sent. 10928 len. 25]: Phil , with a look at his master , hobbles up , saying , `` Here 's the guv ` ner , Mrs. Bagnet !
Parsing [sent. 10929 len. 5]: Here he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10930 len. 13]: and the old girl herself , accompanied by Mr. Bagnet , appears .
Parsing [sent. 10931 len. 67]: The old girl never appears in walking trim , in any season of the year , without a grey cloth cloak , coarse and much worn but very clean , which is , undoubtedly , the identical garment rendered so interesting to Mr. Bagnet by having made its way home to Europe from another quarter of the globe in company with Mrs. Bagnet and an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 10932 len. 19]: The latter faithful appendage is also invariably a part of the old girl 's presence out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 10933 len. 82]: It is of no colour known in this life and has a corrugated wooden crook for a handle , with a metallic object let into its prow , or beak , resembling a little model of a fanlight over a street door or one of the oval glasses out of a pair of spectacles , which ornamental object has not that tenacious capacity of sticking to its post that might be desired in an article long associated with the British army .
Parsing [sent. 10934 len. 49]: The old girl 's umbrella is of a flabby habit of waist and seems to be in need of stays -- an appearance that is possibly referable to its having served through a series of years at home as a cupboard and on journeys as a carpet bag .
Parsing [sent. 10935 len. 53]: She never puts it up , having the greatest reliance on her well-proved cloak with its capacious hood , but generally uses the instrument as a wand with which to point out joints of meat or bunches of greens in marketing or to arrest the attention of tradesmen by a friendly poke .
Parsing [sent. 10936 len. 21]: Without her market-basket , which is a sort of wicker well with two flapping lids , she never stirs abroad .
Parsing [sent. 10937 len. 37]: Attended by these her trusty companions , therefore , her honest sunburnt face looking cheerily out of a rough straw bonnet , Mrs. Bagnet now arrives , fresh-coloured and bright , in George 's Shooting Gallery .
Parsing [sent. 10938 len. 24]: `` Well , George , old fellow , '' says she , `` and how do YOU do , this sunshiny morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10939 len. 26]: Giving him a friendly shake of the hand , Mrs. Bagnet draws a long breath after her walk and sits down to enjoy a rest .
Parsing [sent. 10940 len. 46]: Having a faculty , matured on the tops of baggage-waggons and in other such positions , of resting easily anywhere , she perches on a rough bench , unties her bonnet-strings , pushes back her bonnet , crosses her arms , and looks perfectly comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 10941 len. 28]: Mr. Bagnet in the meantime has shaken hands with his old comrade and with Phil , on whom Mrs. Bagnet likewise bestows a good-humoured nod and smile .
Parsing [sent. 10942 len. 85]: `` Now , George , '' said Mrs. Bagnet briskly , `` here we are , Lignum and myself '' -- she often speaks of her husband by this appellation , on account , as it is supposed , of Lignum Vitae having been his old regimental nickname when they first became acquainted , in compliment to the extreme hardness and toughness of his physiognomy -- `` just looked in , we have , to make it all correct as usual about that security .
Parsing [sent. 10943 len. 20]: Give him the new bill to sign , George , and he 'll sign it like a man . ''
Parsing [sent. 10944 len. 15]: `` I was coming to you this morning , '' observes the trooper reluctantly .
Parsing [sent. 10945 len. 41]: `` Yes , we thought you 'd come to us this morning , but we turned out early and left Woolwich , the best of boys , to mind his sisters and came to you instead -- as you see !
Parsing [sent. 10946 len. 23]: For Lignum , he 's tied so close now , and gets so little exercise , that a walk does him good .
Parsing [sent. 10947 len. 9]: But what 's the matter , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10948 len. 10]: asks Mrs. Bagnet , stopping in her cheerful talk .
Parsing [sent. 10949 len. 8]: `` You do n't look yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 10950 len. 25]: `` I am not quite myself , '' returns the trooper ; `` I have been a little put out , Mrs. Bagnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 10951 len. 9]: Her bright quick eye catches the truth directly .
Parsing [sent. 10952 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10953 len. 5]: holding up her forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 10954 len. 16]: `` Do n't tell me there 's anything wrong about that security of Lignum 's !
Parsing [sent. 10955 len. 14]: Do n't do it , George , on account of the children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10956 len. 10]: The trooper looks at her with a troubled visage .
Parsing [sent. 10957 len. 25]: `` George , '' says Mrs. Bagnet , using both her arms for emphasis and occasionally bringing down her open hands upon her knees .
Parsing [sent. 10958 len. 67]: `` If you have allowed anything wrong to come to that security of Lignum 's , and if you have let him in for it , and if you have put us in danger of being sold up -- and I see sold up in your face , George , as plain as print -- you have done a shameful action and have deceived us cruelly .
Parsing [sent. 10959 len. 8]: I tell you , cruelly , George .
Parsing [sent. 10960 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10961 len. 42]: Mr. Bagnet , otherwise as immovable as a pump or a lamp-post , puts his large right hand on the top of his bald head as if to defend it from a shower-bath and looks with great uneasiness at Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 10962 len. 15]: `` George , '' says that old girl , `` I wonder at you !
Parsing [sent. 10963 len. 8]: George , I am ashamed of you !
Parsing [sent. 10964 len. 13]: George , I could n't have believed you would have done it !
Parsing [sent. 10965 len. 37]: I always knew you to be a rolling sone that gathered no moss , but I never thought you would have taken away what little moss there was for Bagnet and the children to lie upon .
Parsing [sent. 10966 len. 11]: You know what a hard-working , steady-going chap he is .
Parsing [sent. 10967 len. 30]: You know what Quebec and Malta and Woolwich are , and I never did think you would , or could , have had the heart to serve us so .
Parsing [sent. 10968 len. 5]: Oh , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10969 len. 25]: Mrs. Bagnet gathers up her cloak to wipe her eyes on in a very genuine manner , `` How could you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10970 len. 41]: Mrs. Bagnet ceasing , Mr. Bagnet removes his hand from his head as if the shower-bath were over and looks disconsolately at Mr. George , who has turned quite white and looks distressfully at the grey cloak and straw bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 10971 len. 47]: `` Mat , '' says the trooper in a subdued voice , addressing him but still looking at his wife , `` I am sorry you take it so much to heart , because I do hope it 's not so bad as that comes to .
Parsing [sent. 10972 len. 28]: I certainly have , this morning , received this letter '' -- which he reads aloud -- `` but I hope it may be set right yet .
Parsing [sent. 10973 len. 14]: As to a rolling stone , why , what you say is true .
Parsing [sent. 10974 len. 27]: I AM a rolling stone , and I never rolled in anybody 's way , I fully believe , that I rolled the least good to .
Parsing [sent. 10975 len. 37]: But it 's impossible for an old vagabond comrade to like your wife and family better than I like 'em , Mat , and I trust you 'll look upon me as forgivingly as you can .
Parsing [sent. 10976 len. 10]: Do n't think I 've kept anything from you .
Parsing [sent. 10977 len. 15]: I have n't had the letter more than a quarter of an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 10978 len. 22]: `` Old girl , '' murmurs Mr. Bagnet after a short silence , `` will you tell him my opinion ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10979 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 10980 len. 26]: Why did n't he marry , '' Mrs. Bagnet answers , half laughing and half crying , `` Joe Pouch 's widder in North America ?
Parsing [sent. 10981 len. 12]: Then he would n't have got himself into these troubles . ''
Parsing [sent. 10982 len. 21]: `` The old girl , '' says Mr. Baguet , `` puts it correct -- why did n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10983 len. 20]: `` Well , she has a better husband by this time , I hope , '' returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 10984 len. 19]: `` Anyhow , here I stand , this present day , NOT married to Joe Pouch 's widder .
Parsing [sent. 10985 len. 5]: What shall I do ?
Parsing [sent. 10986 len. 9]: You see all I have got about me .
Parsing [sent. 10987 len. 9]: It 's not mine ; it 's yours .
Parsing [sent. 10988 len. 12]: Give the word , and I 'll sell off every morsel .
Parsing [sent. 10989 len. 23]: If I could have hoped it would have brought in nearly the sum wanted , I 'd have sold all long ago .
Parsing [sent. 10990 len. 16]: Do n't believe that I 'll leave you or yours in the lurch , Mat .
Parsing [sent. 10991 len. 6]: I 'd sell myself first .
Parsing [sent. 10992 len. 37]: I only wish , '' says the trooper , giving himself a disparaging blow in the chest , `` that I knew of any one who 'd buy such a second-hand piece of old stores . ''
Parsing [sent. 10993 len. 19]: `` Old girl , '' murmurs Mr. Bagnet , `` give him another bit of my mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 10994 len. 34]: `` George , '' says the old girl , `` you are not so much to be blamed , on full consideration , except for ever taking this business without the means . ''
Parsing [sent. 10995 len. 8]: `` And that was like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 10996 len. 9]: observes the penitent trooper , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 10997 len. 8]: `` Like me , I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 10998 len. 3]: `` Silence !
Parsing [sent. 10999 len. 26]: The old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet , `` is correct -- in her way of giving my opinions -- hear me out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11000 len. 30]: `` That was when you never ought to have asked for the security , George , and when you never ought to have got it , all things considered .
Parsing [sent. 11001 len. 9]: But what 's done ca n't be undone .
Parsing [sent. 11002 len. 22]: You are always an honourable and straightforward fellow , as far as lays in your power , though a little flighty .
Parsing [sent. 11003 len. 28]: On the other hand , you ca n't admit but what it 's natural in us to be anxious with such a thing hanging over our heads .
Parsing [sent. 11004 len. 9]: So forget and forgive all round , George .
Parsing [sent. 11005 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 11006 len. 7]: Forget and forgive all round ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11007 len. 33]: Mrs. Bagnet , giving him one of her honest hands and giving her husband the other , Mr. George gives each of them one of his and holds them while he speaks .
Parsing [sent. 11008 len. 19]: `` I do assure you both , there 's nothing I would n't do to discharge this obligation .
Parsing [sent. 11009 len. 19]: But whatever I have been able to scrape together has gone every two months in keeping it up .
Parsing [sent. 11010 len. 11]: We have lived plainly enough here , Phil and I .
Parsing [sent. 11011 len. 27]: But the gallery do n't quite do what was expected of it , and it 's not -- in short , it 's not the mint .
Parsing [sent. 11012 len. 9]: It was wrong in me to take it ?
Parsing [sent. 11013 len. 6]: Well , so it was .
Parsing [sent. 11014 len. 56]: But I was in a manner drawn into that step , and I thought it might steady me , and set me up , and you 'll try to overlook my having such expectations , and upon my soul , I am very much obliged to you , and very much ashamed of myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 11015 len. 54]: With these concluding words , Mr. George gives a shake to each of the hands he holds , and relinquishing them , backs a pace or two in a broad-chested , upright attitude , as if he had made a final confession and were immediately going to be shot with all military honours .
Parsing [sent. 11016 len. 8]: `` George , hear me out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11017 len. 9]: says Mr. Bagnet , glancing at his wife .
Parsing [sent. 11018 len. 8]: `` Old girl , go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11019 len. 64]: Mr. Bagnet , being in this singular manner heard out , has merely to observe that the letter must be attended to without any delay , that it is advisable that George and he should immediately wait on Mr. Smallweed in person , and that the primary object is to save and hold harmless Mr. Bagnet , who had none of the money .
Parsing [sent. 11020 len. 23]: Mr. George , entirely assenting , puts on his hat and prepares to march with Mr. Bagnet to the enemy 's camp .
Parsing [sent. 11021 len. 24]: `` Do n't you mind a woman 's hasty word , George , '' says Mrs. Bagnet , patting him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 11022 len. 21]: `` I trust my old Lignum to you , and I am sure you 'll bring him through it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11023 len. 18]: The trooper returns that this is kindly said and that he WILL bring Lignum through it somehow .
Parsing [sent. 11024 len. 41]: Upon which Mrs. Bagnet , with her cloak , basket , and umbrella , goes home , bright-eyed again , to the rest of her family , and the comrades sally forth on the hopeful errand of mollifying Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 11025 len. 32]: Whether there are two people in England less likely to come satisfactorily out of any negotiation with Mr. Smallweed than Mr. George and Mr. Matthew Bagnet may be very reasonably questioned .
Parsing [sent. 11026 len. 36]: Also , notwithstanding their martial appearance , broad square shoulders , and heavy tread , whether there are within the same limits two more simple and unaccustomed children in all the Smallweedy affairs of life .
Parsing [sent. 11027 len. 40]: As they proceed with great gravity through the streets towards the region of Mount Pleasant , Mr. Bagnet , observing his companion to be thoughtful , considers it a friendly part to refer to Mrs. Bagnet 's late sally .
Parsing [sent. 11028 len. 19]: `` George , you know the old girl -- she 's as sweet and as mild as milk .
Parsing [sent. 11029 len. 18]: But touch her on the children -- or myself -- and she 's off like gunpowder . ''
Parsing [sent. 11030 len. 9]: `` It does her credit , Mat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11031 len. 30]: `` George , '' says Mr. Bagnet , looking straight before him , `` the old girl -- ca n't do anything -- that do n't do her credit .
Parsing [sent. 11032 len. 4]: More or less .
Parsing [sent. 11033 len. 5]: I never say so .
Parsing [sent. 11034 len. 6]: Discipline must he maintained . ''
Parsing [sent. 11035 len. 14]: `` She 's worth her weight in gold , '' says the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 11036 len. 5]: `` In gold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11037 len. 4]: says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 11038 len. 7]: `` I 'll tell you what .
Parsing [sent. 11039 len. 11]: The old girl 's weight -- is twelve stone six .
Parsing [sent. 11040 len. 15]: Would I take that weight -- in any metal -- for the old girl ?
Parsing [sent. 11041 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 11042 len. 3]: Why not ?
Parsing [sent. 11043 len. 17]: Because the old girl 's metal is far more precious -- - than the preciousest metal .
Parsing [sent. 11044 len. 7]: And she 's ALL metal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11045 len. 8]: `` You are right , Mat ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11046 len. 28]: `` When she took me -- and accepted of the ring -- she ` listed under me and the children -- heart and head , for life .
Parsing [sent. 11047 len. 36]: She 's that earnest , '' says Mr. Bagnet , `` and true to her colours -- that , touch us with a finger -- and she turns out -- and stands to her arms .
Parsing [sent. 11048 len. 24]: If the old girl fires wide -- once in a way -- at the call of duty -- look over it , George .
Parsing [sent. 11049 len. 6]: For she 's loyal ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11050 len. 24]: `` Why , bless her , Mat , '' returns the trooper , `` I think the higher of her for it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11051 len. 6]: `` You are right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11052 len. 18]: says Mr. Bagnet with the warmest enthusiasm , though without relaxing the rigidity of a single muscle .
Parsing [sent. 11053 len. 27]: `` Think as high of the old girl -- as the rock of Gibraltar -- and still you 'll be thinking low -- of such merits .
Parsing [sent. 11054 len. 9]: But I never own to it before her .
Parsing [sent. 11055 len. 6]: Discipline must be maintained . ''
Parsing [sent. 11056 len. 14]: These encomiums bring them to Mount Pleasant and to Grandfather Smallweed 's house .
Parsing [sent. 11057 len. 44]: The door is opened by the perennial Judy , who , having surveyed them from top to toe with no particular favour , but indeed with a malignant sneer , leaves them standing there while she consults the oracle as to their admission .
Parsing [sent. 11058 len. 32]: The oracle may be inferred to give consent from the circumstance of her returning with the words on her honey lips that they can come in if they want to it .
Parsing [sent. 11059 len. 42]: Thus privileged , they come in and find Mr. Smallweed with his feet in the drawer of his chair as if it were a paper foot-bath and Mrs. Smallweed obscured with the cushion like a bird that is not to sing .
Parsing [sent. 11060 len. 20]: `` My dear friend , '' says Grandfather Smallweed with those two lean affectionate arms of his stretched forth .
Parsing [sent. 11061 len. 5]: `` How de do ?
Parsing [sent. 11062 len. 4]: How de do ?
Parsing [sent. 11063 len. 10]: Who is our friend , my dear friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11064 len. 36]: `` Why this , '' returns George , not able to be very conciliatory at first , `` is Matthew Bagnet , who has obliged me in that matter of ours , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 11065 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11066 len. 3]: Mr. Bagnet ?
Parsing [sent. 11067 len. 3]: Surely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11068 len. 10]: The old man looks at him under his hand .
Parsing [sent. 11069 len. 9]: `` Hope you 're well , Mr. Bagnet ?
Parsing [sent. 11070 len. 6]: Fine man , Mr. George !
Parsing [sent. 11071 len. 6]: Military air , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11072 len. 17]: No chairs being offered , Mr. George brings one forward for Bagnet and one for himself .
Parsing [sent. 11073 len. 25]: They sit down , Mr. Bagnet as if he had no power of bending himself , except at the hips , for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 11074 len. 14]: `` Judy , '' says Mr. Smallweed , `` bring the pipe . ''
Parsing [sent. 11075 len. 41]: `` Why , I do n't know , '' Mr. George interposes , `` that the young woman need give herself that trouble , for to tell you the truth , I am not inclined to smoke it to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 11076 len. 6]: `` Ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11077 len. 5]: returns the old man .
Parsing [sent. 11078 len. 8]: `` Judy , bring the pipe . ''
Parsing [sent. 11079 len. 25]: `` The fact is , Mr. Smallweed , '' proceeds George , `` that I find myself in rather an unpleasant state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 11080 len. 19]: It appears to me , sir , that your friend in the city has been playing tricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 11081 len. 7]: `` Oh , dear no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11082 len. 4]: says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 11083 len. 7]: `` He never does that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11084 len. 5]: `` Do n't he ?
Parsing [sent. 11085 len. 18]: Well , I am glad to hear it , because I thought it might be HIS doing .
Parsing [sent. 11086 len. 10]: This , you know , I am speaking of .
Parsing [sent. 11087 len. 4]: This letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 11088 len. 14]: Grandfather Smallweed smiles in a very ugly way in recognition of the letter .
Parsing [sent. 11089 len. 7]: `` What does it mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11090 len. 4]: asks Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 11091 len. 9]: `` Judy , '' says the old man .
Parsing [sent. 11092 len. 7]: `` Have you got the pipe ?
Parsing [sent. 11093 len. 5]: Give it to me .
Parsing [sent. 11094 len. 13]: Did you say what does it mean , my good friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11095 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 11096 len. 83]: Now , come , come , you know , Mr. Smallweed , '' urges the trooper , constraining himself to speak as smoothly and confidentially as he can , holding the open letter in one hand and resting the broad knuckles of the other on his thigh , `` a good lot of money has passed between us , and we are face to face at the present moment , and are both well aware of the understanding there has always been .
Parsing [sent. 11097 len. 20]: I am prepared to do the usual thing which I have done regularly and to keep this matter going .
Parsing [sent. 11098 len. 61]: I never got a letter like this from you before , and I have been a little put about by it this morning , because here 's my friend Matthew Bagnet , who , you know , had none of the money -- '' `` I DO N'T know it , you know , '' says the old man quietly .
Parsing [sent. 11099 len. 21]: `` Why , con-found you -- it , I mean -- I tell you so , do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11100 len. 15]: `` Oh , yes , you tell me so , '' returns Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 11101 len. 9]: `` But I do n't know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11102 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11103 len. 8]: says the trooper , swallowing his fire .
Parsing [sent. 11104 len. 6]: `` I know it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11105 len. 10]: Mr. Smallweed replies with excellent temper , `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 11106 len. 7]: That 's quite another thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11107 len. 10]: And adds , `` But it do n't matter .
Parsing [sent. 11108 len. 13]: Mr. Bagnet 's situation is all one , whether or no . ''
Parsing [sent. 11109 len. 25]: The unfortunate George makes a great effort to arrange the affair comfortably and to propitiate Mr. Smallweed by taking him upon his own terms .
Parsing [sent. 11110 len. 8]: `` That 's just what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 11111 len. 19]: As you say , Mr. Smallweed , here 's Matthew Bagnet liable to be fixed whether or no .
Parsing [sent. 11112 len. 52]: Now , you see , that makes his good lady very uneasy in her mind , and me too , for whereas I 'm a harurn-scarum sort of a good-for-nought that more kicks than halfpence come natural to , why he 's a steady family man , do n't you see ?
Parsing [sent. 11113 len. 59]: Now , Mr. Smallweed , '' says the trooper , gaining confidence as he proceeds in his soldierly mode of doing business , `` although you and I are good friends enough in a certain sort of a way , I am well aware that I ca n't ask you to let my friend Bagnet off entirely . ''
Parsing [sent. 11114 len. 10]: `` Oh , dear , you are too modest .
Parsing [sent. 11115 len. 10]: You can ASK me anything , Mr. George . ''
Parsing [sent. 11116 len. 14]: -LRB- There is an ogreish kind of jocularity in Grandfather Smallweed to-day . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11117 len. 11]: `` And you can refuse , you mean , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 11118 len. 15]: Or not you so much , perhaps , as your friend in the city ?
Parsing [sent. 11119 len. 5]: Ha ha ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11120 len. 6]: `` Ha ha ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11121 len. 4]: echoes Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 11122 len. 29]: In such a very hard manner and with eyes so particularly green that Mr. Bagnet 's natural gravity is much deepened by the contemplation of that venerable man .
Parsing [sent. 11123 len. 4]: `` Come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11124 len. 5]: says the sanguine George .
Parsing [sent. 11125 len. 19]: `` I am glad to find we can be pleasant , because I want to arrange this pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 11126 len. 31]: Here 's my friend Bagnet , and here am I. We 'll settle the matter on the spot , if you please , Mr. Smallweed , in the usual way .
Parsing [sent. 11127 len. 32]: And you 'll ease my friend Bagnet 's mind , and his family 's mind , a good deal if you 'll just mention to him what our understanding is . ''
Parsing [sent. 11128 len. 17]: Here some shrill spectre cries out in a mocking manner , `` Oh , good gracious !
Parsing [sent. 11129 len. 3]: Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11130 len. 38]: Unless , indeed , it be the sportive Judy , who is found to be silent when the startled visitors look round , but whose chin has received a recent toss , expressive of derision and contempt .
Parsing [sent. 11131 len. 9]: Mr. Bagnet 's gravity becomes yet more profound .
Parsing [sent. 11132 len. 46]: `` But I think you asked me , Mr. George '' -- old Smallweed , who all this time has had the pipe in his hand , is the speaker now -- `` I think you asked me , what did the letter mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11133 len. 36]: `` Why , yes , I did , '' returns the trooper in his off-hand way , `` but I do n't care to know particularly , if it 's all correct and pleasant . ''
Parsing [sent. 11134 len. 27]: Mr. Smallweed , purposely balking himself in an aim at the trooper 's head , throws the pipe on the ground and breaks it to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 11135 len. 11]: `` That 's what it means , my dear friend .
Parsing [sent. 11136 len. 5]: I 'll smash you .
Parsing [sent. 11137 len. 5]: I 'll crumble you .
Parsing [sent. 11138 len. 5]: I 'll powder you .
Parsing [sent. 11139 len. 6]: Go to the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11140 len. 10]: The two friends rise and look at one another .
Parsing [sent. 11141 len. 11]: Mr. Bagnet 's gravity has now attained its profoundest point .
Parsing [sent. 11142 len. 7]: `` Go to the devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11143 len. 5]: repeats the old man .
Parsing [sent. 11144 len. 12]: `` I 'll have no more of your pipe-smokings and swaggerings .
Parsing [sent. 11145 len. 2]: What ?
Parsing [sent. 11146 len. 8]: You 're an independent dragoon , too !
Parsing [sent. 11147 len. 24]: Go to my lawyer -LRB- you remember where ; you have been there before -RRB- and show your independeuce now , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 11148 len. 13]: Come , my dear friend , there 's a chance for you .
Parsing [sent. 11149 len. 12]: Open the street door , Judy ; put these blusterers out !
Parsing [sent. 11150 len. 9]: Call in help if they do n't go .
Parsing [sent. 11151 len. 5]: Put 'em out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11152 len. 46]: He vociferates this so loudly that Mr. Bagnet , laying his hands on the shoulders of his comrade before the latter can recover from his amazement , gets him on the outside of the street door , which is instantly slammed by the triumphant Judy .
Parsing [sent. 11153 len. 12]: Utterly confounded , Mr. George awhile stands looking at the knocker .
Parsing [sent. 11154 len. 37]: Mr. Bagnet , in a perfect abyss of gravity , walks up and down before the little parlour window like a sentry and looks in every time he passes , apparently revolving something in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 11155 len. 22]: `` Come , Mat , '' says Mr. George when he has recovered himself , `` we must try the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 11156 len. 11]: Now , what do you think of this rascal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11157 len. 41]: Mr. Bagnet , stopping to take a farewell look into the parlour , replies with one shake of his head directed at the interior , `` If my old girl had been here -- I 'd have told him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11158 len. 26]: Having so discharged himself of the subject of his cogitations , he falls into step and marches off with the trooper , shoulder to shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 11159 len. 20]: When they present themselves in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , Mr. Tulkinghorn is engaged and not to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 11160 len. 61]: He is not at all willing to see them , for when they have waited a full hour , and the clerk , on his bell being rung , takes the opportunity of mentioning as much , he brings forth no more encouraging message than that Mr. Tulkinghorn has nothing to say to them and they had better not wait .
Parsing [sent. 11161 len. 33]: They do wait , however , with the perseverance of military tactics , and at last the bell rings again and the client in possession comes out of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's room .
Parsing [sent. 11162 len. 19]: The client is a handsome old lady , no other than Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 11163 len. 17]: She comes out of the sanctuary with a fair old-fashioned curtsy and softly shuts the door .
Parsing [sent. 11164 len. 29]: She is treated with some distinction there , for the clerk steps out of his pew to show her through the outer office and to let her out .
Parsing [sent. 11165 len. 17]: The old lady is thanking him for his attention when she observes the comrades in waiting .
Parsing [sent. 11166 len. 17]: `` I beg your pardon , sir , but I think those gentlemen are military ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11167 len. 24]: The clerk referring the question to them with his eye , and Mr. George not turning round from the almanac over the fire-place .
Parsing [sent. 11168 len. 13]: Mr. Bagnet takes upon himself to reply , `` Yes , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 11169 len. 3]: Formerly . ''
Parsing [sent. 11170 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 11171 len. 6]: I was sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 11172 len. 12]: My heart warms , gentlemen , at the sight of you .
Parsing [sent. 11173 len. 9]: It always does at the sight of such .
Parsing [sent. 11174 len. 6]: God bless you , gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 11175 len. 19]: You 'll excuse an old woman , but I had a son once who went for a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 11176 len. 25]: A fine handsome youth he was , and good in his bold way , though some people did disparage him to his poor mother .
Parsing [sent. 11177 len. 10]: I ask your pardon for troubling you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11178 len. 7]: God bless you , gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11179 len. 8]: `` Same to you , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11180 len. 8]: returns Mr. Bagnet with right good will .
Parsing [sent. 11181 len. 26]: There is something very touching in the earnestness of the old lady 's voice and in the tremble that goes through her quaint old figure .
Parsing [sent. 11182 len. 40]: But Mr. George is so occupied with the almanac over the fireplace -LRB- calculating the coming months by it perhaps -RRB- that he does not look round until she has gone away and the door is closed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 11183 len. 18]: `` George , '' Mr. Bagnet gruffly whispers when he does turn from the almanac at last .
Parsing [sent. 11184 len. 7]: `` Do n't be cast down !
Parsing [sent. 11185 len. 15]: ` Why , soldiers , why -- should we be melancholy , boys ? '
Parsing [sent. 11186 len. 7]: Cheer up , my hearty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11187 len. 33]: The clerk having now again gone in to say that they are still there and Mr. Tulkinghorn being heard to return with some irascibility , `` Let 'em come in then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11188 len. 18]: they pass into the great room with the painted ceiling and find him standing before the fire .
Parsing [sent. 11189 len. 11]: `` Now , you men , what do you want ?
Parsing [sent. 11190 len. 21]: Sergeant , I told you the last time I saw you that I do n't desire your company here . ''
Parsing [sent. 11191 len. 46]: Sergeant replies -- dashed within the last few minutes as to his usual manner of speech , and even as to his usual carriage -- that he has received this letter , has been to Mr. Smallweed about it , and has been referred there .
Parsing [sent. 11192 len. 14]: `` I have nothing to say to you , '' rejoins Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 11193 len. 17]: `` If you get into debt , you must pay your debts or take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 11194 len. 15]: You have no occasion to come here to learn that , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11195 len. 14]: Sergeant is sorry to say that he is not prepared with the money .
Parsing [sent. 11196 len. 4]: `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 11197 len. 20]: Then the other man -- this man , if this is he -- must pay it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 11198 len. 17]: Sergeant is sorry to add that the other man is not prepared with the money either .
Parsing [sent. 11199 len. 4]: `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 11200 len. 19]: Then you must pay it between you or you must both be sued for it and both suffer .
Parsing [sent. 11201 len. 10]: You have had the money and must refund it .
Parsing [sent. 11202 len. 19]: You are not to pocket other people 's pounds , shillings , and pence and escape scot-free . ''
Parsing [sent. 11203 len. 12]: The lawyer sits down in his easy-chair and stirs the fire .
Parsing [sent. 11204 len. 25]: Mr. George hopes he will have the goodness to -- `` I tell you , sergeant , I have nothing to say to you .
Parsing [sent. 11205 len. 13]: I do n't like your associates and do n't want you here .
Parsing [sent. 11206 len. 18]: This matter is not at all in my course of practice and is not in my office .
Parsing [sent. 11207 len. 20]: Mr. Smallweed is good enough to offer these affairs to me , but they are not in my way .
Parsing [sent. 11208 len. 12]: You must go to Melchisedech 's in Clifford 's Inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 11209 len. 54]: `` I must make an apology to you , sir , '' says Mr. George , `` for pressing myself upon you with so little encouragement -- which is almost as unpleasant to me as it can be to you -- but would you let me say a private word to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11210 len. 18]: Mr. Tulkinghorn rises with his hands in his pockets and walks into one of the window recesses .
Parsing [sent. 11211 len. 3]: `` Now !
Parsing [sent. 11212 len. 8]: I have no time to waste . ''
Parsing [sent. 11213 len. 41]: In the midst of his perfect assumption of indifference , he directs a sharp look at the trooper , taking care to stand with his own back to the light and to have the other with his face towards it .
Parsing [sent. 11214 len. 45]: `` Well , sir , '' says Mr. George , `` this man with me is the other party implicated in this unfortunate affair -- nominally , only nominally -- and my sole object is to prevent his getting into trouble on my account .
Parsing [sent. 11215 len. 55]: He is a most respectable man with a wife and family , formerly in the Royal Artillery -- '' `` My friend , I do n't care a pinch of snuff for the whole Royal Artillery establishment -- officers , men , tumbrils , waggons , horses , guns , and ammunition . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 11216 len. 6]: 'T is likely , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11217 len. 19]: But I care a good deal for Bagnet and his wife and family being injured on my account .
Parsing [sent. 11218 len. 35]: And if I could bring them through this matter , I should have no help for it but to give up without any other consideration what you wanted of me the other day . ''
Parsing [sent. 11219 len. 8]: `` Have you got it here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11220 len. 10]: `` I have got it here , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 11221 len. 42]: `` Sergeant , '' the lawyer proceeds in his dry passionless manner , far more hopeless in the dealing with than any amount of vehemence , `` make up your mind while I speak to you , for this is final .
Parsing [sent. 11222 len. 18]: After I have finished speaking I have closed the subject , and I wo n't re-open it .
Parsing [sent. 11223 len. 3]: Understand that .
Parsing [sent. 11224 len. 32]: You can leave here , for a few days , what you say you have brought here if you choose ; you can take it away at once if you choose .
Parsing [sent. 11225 len. 74]: In case you choose to leave it here , I can do this for you -- I can replace this matter on its old footing , and I can go so far besides as to give you a written undertaking that this man Bagnet shall never be troubled in any way until you have been proceeded against to the utmost , that your means shall be exhausted before the creditor looks to his .
Parsing [sent. 11226 len. 9]: This is in fact all but freeing him .
Parsing [sent. 11227 len. 5]: Have you decided ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11228 len. 24]: The trooper puts his hand into his breast and answers with a long breath , `` I must do it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 11229 len. 68]: So Mr. Tulkinghorn , putting on his spectacles , sits down and writes the undertaking , which he slowly reads and explains to Bagnet , who has all this time been staring at the ceiling and who puts his hand on his bald head again , under this new verbal shower-bath , and seems exceedingly in need of the old girl through whom to express his sentiments .
Parsing [sent. 11230 len. 25]: The trooper then takes from his breast-pocket a folded paper , which he lays with an unwilling hand at the lawyer 's elbow . ''
Parsing [sent. 11231 len. 10]: 'T is ouly a letter of instructions , sir .
Parsing [sent. 11232 len. 9]: The last I ever had from him . ''
Parsing [sent. 11233 len. 38]: Look at a millstone , Mr. George , for some change in its expression , and you will find it quite as soon as in the face of Mr. Tulkinghorn when he opens and reads the letter !
Parsing [sent. 11234 len. 17]: He refolds it and lays it in his desk with a countenance as unperturbable as death .
Parsing [sent. 11235 len. 30]: Nor has he anything more to say or do but to nod once in the same frigid and discourteous manner and to say briefly , `` You can go .
Parsing [sent. 11236 len. 8]: Show these men out , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11237 len. 14]: Being shown out , they repair to Mr. Bagnet 's residence to dine .
Parsing [sent. 11238 len. 73]: Boiled beef and greens constitute the day 's variety on the former repast of boiled pork and greens , and Mrs. Bagnet serves out the meal in the same way and seasons it with the best of temper , being that rare sort of old girl that she receives Good to her arms without a hint that it might be Better and catches light from any little spot of darkness near her .
Parsing [sent. 11239 len. 20]: The spot on this occasion is the darkened brow of Mr. George ; he is unusually thoughtful and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 11240 len. 59]: At first Mrs. Bagnet trusts to the combined endearments of Quebec and Malta to restore him , but finding those young ladies sensible that their existing Bluffy is not the Bluffy of their usual frolicsome acquaintance , she winks off the light infantry and leaves him to deploy at leisure on the open ground of the domestic hearth .
Parsing [sent. 11241 len. 5]: But he does not .
Parsing [sent. 11242 len. 10]: He remains in close order , clouded and depressed .
Parsing [sent. 11243 len. 30]: During the lengthy cleaning up and pattening process , when he and Mr. Bagnet are supplied with their pipes , he is no better than he was at dinner .
Parsing [sent. 11244 len. 37]: He forgets to smoke , looks at the fire and ponders , lets his pipe out , fills the breast of Mr. Bagnet with perturbation and dismay by showing that he has no enjoyment of tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 11245 len. 30]: Therefore when Mrs. Bagnet at last appears , rosy from the invigorating pail , and sits down to her work , Mr. Bagnet growls , `` Old girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11246 len. 13]: and winks monitions to her to find out what 's the matter .
Parsing [sent. 11247 len. 6]: `` Why , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11248 len. 9]: says Mrs. Bagnet , quietly threading her needle .
Parsing [sent. 11249 len. 7]: `` How low you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11250 len. 4]: `` Am I ?
Parsing [sent. 11251 len. 4]: Not good company ?
Parsing [sent. 11252 len. 10]: Well , I am afraid I am not . ''
Parsing [sent. 11253 len. 12]: `` He ai n't at all like Blulfy , mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11254 len. 4]: cries little Malta .
Parsing [sent. 11255 len. 16]: `` Because he ai n't well , I think , mother , '' adds Quebec .
Parsing [sent. 11256 len. 16]: `` Sure that 's a bad sign not to be like Bluffy , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11257 len. 9]: returns the trooper , kissing the young damsels .
Parsing [sent. 11258 len. 18]: `` But it 's true , '' with a sigh , `` true , I am afraid .
Parsing [sent. 11259 len. 8]: These little ones are always right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11260 len. 64]: `` George , '' says Mrs. Bagnet , working busily , `` if I thought you cross enough to think of anything that a shrill old soldier 's wife -- who could have bitten her tongue off afterwards and ought to have done it almost -- said this morning , I do n't know what I should n't say to you now . ''
Parsing [sent. 11261 len. 13]: `` My kind soul of a darling , '' returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 11262 len. 8]: `` Not a morsel of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11263 len. 32]: `` Because really and truly , George , what I said and meant to say was that I trusted Lignum to you and was sure you 'd bring him through it .
Parsing [sent. 11264 len. 11]: And you HAVE brought him through it , noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11265 len. 7]: `` Thankee , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11266 len. 3]: says George .
Parsing [sent. 11267 len. 10]: `` I am glad of your good opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 11268 len. 35]: In giving Mrs. Bagnet 's hand , with her work in it , a friendly shake -- for she took her seat beside him -- the trooper 's attention is attracted to her face .
Parsing [sent. 11269 len. 35]: After looking at it for a little while as she plies her needle , he looks to young Woolwich , sitting on his stool in the corner , and beckons that fifer to him .
Parsing [sent. 11270 len. 32]: `` See there , my boy , '' says George , very gently smoothing the mother 's hair with his hand , `` there 's a good loving forehead for you !
Parsing [sent. 11271 len. 10]: All bright with love of you , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 11272 len. 34]: A little touched by the sun and the weather through following your father about and taking care of you , but as fresh and wholesome as a ripe apple on a tree . ''
Parsing [sent. 11273 len. 21]: Mr. Bagnet 's face expresses , so far as in its wooden material lies , the highest approbation and acquiescence .
Parsing [sent. 11274 len. 46]: `` The time will come , my boy , '' pursues the trooper , `` when this hair of your mother 's will be grey , and this forehead all crossed and re-crossed with wrinkles , and a fine old lady she 'll be then .
Parsing [sent. 11275 len. 38]: Take care , while you are young , that you can think in those days , ' I never whitened a hair of her dear head -- I never marked a sorrowful line in her face ! '
Parsing [sent. 11276 len. 28]: For of all the many things that you can think of when you are a man , you had better have THAT by you , Woolwich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11277 len. 41]: Mr. George concludes by rising from his chair , seating the boy beside his mother in it , and saying , with something of a hurry about him , that he 'll smoke his pipe in the street a bit .
Parsing [sent. 11278 len. 26]: Chapter XXXV -- Esther 's Narrative I lay ill through several weeks , and the usual tenor of my life became like an old remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 11279 len. 28]: But this was not the effect of time so much as of the change in all my habits made by the helplessness and inaction of a sick-room .
Parsing [sent. 11280 len. 42]: Before I had been confined to it many days , everything else seemed to have retired into a remote distance where there was little or no separation between the various stages of my life which had been really divided by years .
Parsing [sent. 11281 len. 32]: In falling ill , I seemed to have crossed a dark lake and to have left all my experiences , mingled together by the great distance , on the healthy shore .
Parsing [sent. 11282 len. 64]: My housekeeping duties , though at first it caused me great anxiety to think that they were unperformed , were soon as far off as the oldest of the old duties at Greenleaf or the summer afternoons when I went home from school with my portfolio under my arm , and my childish shadow at my side , to my godmother 's house .
Parsing [sent. 11283 len. 22]: I had never known before how short life really was and into how small a space the mind could put it .
Parsing [sent. 11284 len. 24]: While I was very ill , the way in which these divisions of time became confused with one another distressed my mind exceedingly .
Parsing [sent. 11285 len. 46]: At once a child , an elder girl , and the little woman I had been so happy as , I was not only oppressed by cares and difficulties adapted to each station , but by the great perplexity of endlessly trying to reconcile them .
Parsing [sent. 11286 len. 27]: I suppose that few who have not been in such a condition can quite understand what I mean or what painful unrest arose from this source .
Parsing [sent. 11287 len. 72]: For the same reason I am almost afraid to hint at that time in my disorder -- it seemed one long night , but I believe there were both nights and days in it -- when I laboured up colossal staircases , ever striving to reach the top , and ever turned , as I have seen a worm in a garden path , by some obstruction , and labouring again .
Parsing [sent. 11288 len. 71]: I knew perfectly at intervals , and I think vaguely at most times , that I was in my bed ; and I talked with Charley , and felt her touch , and knew her very well ; yet I would find myself complaining , `` Oh , more of these never-ending stairs , Charley -- more and more -- piled up to the sky ' , I think ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11289 len. 5]: and labouring on again .
Parsing [sent. 11290 len. 42]: Dare I hint at that worse time when , strung together somewhere in great black space , there was a flaming necklace , or ring , or starry circle of some kind , of which I was one of the beads !
Parsing [sent. 11291 len. 31]: And when my only prayer was to be taken off from the rest and when it was such inexplicable agony and misery to be a part of the dreadful thing ?
Parsing [sent. 11292 len. 21]: Perhaps the less I say of these sick experiences , the less tedious and the more intelligible I shall be .
Parsing [sent. 11293 len. 21]: I do not recall them to make others unhappy or because I am now the least unhappy in remembering them .
Parsing [sent. 11294 len. 23]: It may be that if we knew more of such strange afflictions we might be the better able to alleviate their intensity .
Parsing [sent. 11295 len. 68]: The repose that succeeded , the long delicious sleep , the blissful rest , when in my weakness I was too calm to have any care for myself and could have heard -LRB- or so I think now -RRB- that I was dying , with no other emotion than with a pitying love for those I left behind -- this state can be perhaps more widely understood .
Parsing [sent. 11296 len. 39]: I was in this state when I first shrunk from the light as it twinkled on me once more , and knew with a boundless joy for which no words are rapturous enough that I should see again .
Parsing [sent. 11297 len. 76]: I had heard my Ada crying at the door , day and night ; I had heard her calling to me that I was cruel and did not love her ; I had heard her praying and imploring to be let in to nurse and comfort me and to leave my bedside no more ; but I had only said , when I could speak , `` Never , my sweet girl , never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11298 len. 25]: and I had over and over again reminded Charley that she was to keep my darling from the room whether I lived or died .
Parsing [sent. 11299 len. 27]: Charley had been true to me in that time of need , and with her little hand and her great heart had kept the door fast .
Parsing [sent. 11300 len. 55]: But now , my sight strengthening and the glorious light coming every day more fully and brightly on me , I could read the letters that my dear wrote to me every morning and evening and could put them to my lips and lay my cheek upon them with no fear of hurting her .
Parsing [sent. 11301 len. 33]: I could see my little maid , so tender and so careful , going about the two rooms setting everything in order and speaking cheerfully to Ada from the open window again .
Parsing [sent. 11302 len. 28]: I could understand the stillness in the house and the thoughtfulness it expressed on the part of all those who had always been so good to me .
Parsing [sent. 11303 len. 26]: I could weep in the exquisite felicity of my heart and be as happy in my weakness as ever I had been in my strength .
Parsing [sent. 11304 len. 10]: By and by my strength began to be restored .
Parsing [sent. 11305 len. 66]: Instead of lying , with so strange a calmness , watching what was done for me , as if it were done for some one else whom I was quietly sorry for , I helped it a little , and so on to a little more and much more , until I became useful to myself , and interested , and attached to life again .
Parsing [sent. 11306 len. 27]: How well I remember the pleasant afternoon when I was raised in bed with pillows for the first time to enjoy a great tea-drinking with Charley !
Parsing [sent. 11307 len. 99]: The little creature -- sent into the world , surely , to minister to the weak and sick -- was so happy , and so busy , and stopped so often in her preparations to lay her head upon my bosom , and fondle me , and cry with joyful tears she was so glad , she was so glad , that I was obliged to say , `` Charley , if you go on in this way , I must lie down again , my darling , for I am weaker than I thought I was ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11308 len. 47]: So Charley became as quiet as a mouse and took her bright face here and there across and across the two rooms , out of the shade into the divine sunshine , and out of the sunshine into the shade , while I watched her peacefully .
Parsing [sent. 11309 len. 66]: When all her preparations were concluded and the pretty tea-table with its little delicacies to tempt me , and its white cloth , and its flowers , and everything so lovingly and beautifully arranged for me by Ada downstairs , was ready at the bedside , I felt sure I was steady enough to say something to Charley that was not new to my thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 11310 len. 35]: First I complimented Charley on the room , and indeed it was so fresh and airy , so spotless and neat , that I could scarce believe I had been lying there so long .
Parsing [sent. 11311 len. 12]: This delighted Charley , and her face was brighter than before .
Parsing [sent. 11312 len. 26]: `` Yet , Charley , '' said I , looking round , `` I miss something , surely , that I am accustomed to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11313 len. 19]: Poor little Charley looked round too and pretended to shake her head as if there were nothing absent .
Parsing [sent. 11314 len. 12]: `` Are the pictures all as they used to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11315 len. 4]: I asked her .
Parsing [sent. 11316 len. 12]: `` Every one of them , miss , '' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11317 len. 8]: `` And the furniture , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11318 len. 16]: `` Except where I have moved it about to make more room , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 11319 len. 15]: `` And yet , '' said I , `` I miss some familiar object .
Parsing [sent. 11320 len. 10]: Ah , I know what it is , Charley !
Parsing [sent. 11321 len. 6]: It 's the looking-glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 11322 len. 29]: Charley got up from the table , making as if she had forgotten something , and went into the next room ; and I heard her sob there .
Parsing [sent. 11323 len. 8]: I had thought of this very often .
Parsing [sent. 11324 len. 7]: I was now certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 11325 len. 14]: I could thank God that it was not a shock to me now .
Parsing [sent. 11326 len. 44]: I called Charley back , and when she came -- at first pretending to smile , but as she drew nearer to me , looking grieved -- I took her in my arms and said , `` It matters very little , Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11327 len. 13]: I hope I can do without my old face very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 11328 len. 31]: I was presently so far advanced as to be able to sit up in a great chair and even giddily to walk into the adjoining room , leaning on Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11329 len. 28]: The mirror was gone from its usual place in that room too , but what I had to bear was none the harder to bear for that .
Parsing [sent. 11330 len. 25]: My guardian had throughout been earnest to visit me , and there was now no good reason why I should deny myself that happiness .
Parsing [sent. 11331 len. 30]: He came one morning , and when he first came in , could only hold me in his embrace and say , `` My dear , dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11332 len. 10]: I had long known -- who could know better ?
Parsing [sent. 11333 len. 31]: -- what a deep fountain of affection and generosity his heart was ; and was it not worth my trivial suffering and change to fill such a place in it ?
Parsing [sent. 11334 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11335 len. 3]: I thought .
Parsing [sent. 11336 len. 39]: `` He has seen me , and he loves me better than he did ; he has seen me and is even fonder of me than he was before ; and what have I to mourn for ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11337 len. 15]: He sat down by me on the sofa , supporting me with his arm .
Parsing [sent. 11338 len. 25]: For a little while he sat with his hand over his face , but when he removed it , fell into his usual manner .
Parsing [sent. 11339 len. 15]: There never can have been , there never can be , a pleasanter manner .
Parsing [sent. 11340 len. 18]: `` My little woman , '' said he , `` what a sad time this has been .
Parsing [sent. 11341 len. 12]: Such an inflexible little woman , too , through all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11342 len. 17]: `` Only for the best , guardian , '' said I. `` For the best ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11343 len. 4]: he repeated tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 11344 len. 8]: `` Of course , for the best .
Parsing [sent. 11345 len. 57]: But here have Ada and I been perfectly forlorn and miserable ; here has your friend Caddy been coming and going late and early ; here has every one about the house been utterly lost and dejected ; here has even poor Rick been writing -- to ME too -- in his anxiety for you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11346 len. 15]: I had read of Caddy in Ada 's letters , but not of Richard .
Parsing [sent. 11347 len. 5]: I told him so .
Parsing [sent. 11348 len. 12]: `` Why , no , my dear , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 11349 len. 14]: `` I have thought it better not to mention it to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 11350 len. 18]: `` And you speak of his writing to YOU , '' said I , repeating his emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 11351 len. 26]: `` As if it were not natural for him to do so , guardian ; as if he could write to a better friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11352 len. 21]: `` He thinks he could , my love , '' returned my guardian , `` and to many a better .
Parsing [sent. 11353 len. 35]: The truth is , he wrote to me under a sort of protest while unable to write to you with any hope of an answer -- wrote coldly , haughtily , distantly , resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 11354 len. 13]: Well , dearest little woman , we must look forbearingly on it .
Parsing [sent. 11355 len. 6]: He is not to blame .
Parsing [sent. 11356 len. 16]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce has warped him out of himself and perverted me in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 11357 len. 16]: I have known it do as bad deeds , and worse , many a time .
Parsing [sent. 11358 len. 18]: If two angels could be concerned in it , I believe it would change their nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 11359 len. 10]: `` It has not changed yours , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 11360 len. 16]: `` Oh , yes , it has , my dear , '' he said laughingly .
Parsing [sent. 11361 len. 16]: `` It has made the south wind easterly , I do n't know how often .
Parsing [sent. 11362 len. 19]: Rick mistrusts and suspects me -- goes to lawyers , and is taught to mistrust and suspect me .
Parsing [sent. 11363 len. 14]: Hears I have conflicting interests , claims clashing against his and what not .
Parsing [sent. 11364 len. 78]: Whereas , heaven knows that if I could get out of the mountains of wiglomeration on which my unfortunate name has been so long bestowed -LRB- which I ca n't -RRB- or could level them by the extinction of my own original right -LRB- which I ca n't either , and no human power ever can , anyhow , I believe , to such a pass have we got -RRB- , I would do it this hour .
Parsing [sent. 11365 len. 67]: I would rather restore to poor Rick his proper nature than be endowed with all the money that dead suitors , broken , heart and soul , upon the wheel of Chancery , have left unclaimed with the Accountant -- General -- and that 's money enough , my dear , to be cast into a pyramid , in memory of Chancery 's transcendent wickedness . ''
Parsing [sent. 11366 len. 23]: `` IS it possible , guardian , '' I asked , amazed , `` that Richard can be suspicious of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11367 len. 28]: `` Ah , my love , my love , '' he said , `` it is in the subtle poison of such abuses to breed such diseases .
Parsing [sent. 11368 len. 15]: His blood is infected , and objects lose their natural aspects in his sight .
Parsing [sent. 11369 len. 7]: It is not HIS fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 11370 len. 11]: `` But it is a terrible misfortune , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 11371 len. 22]: `` It is a terrible misfortune , little woman , to be ever drawn within the influences of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 11372 len. 5]: I know none greater .
Parsing [sent. 11373 len. 28]: By little and little he has been induced to trust in that rotten reed , and it communicates some portion of its rottenness to everything around him .
Parsing [sent. 11374 len. 21]: But again I say with all my soul , we must be patient with poor Rick and not blame him .
Parsing [sent. 11375 len. 22]: What a troop of fine fresh hearts like his have I seen in my time turned by the same means ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11376 len. 22]: I could not help expressing something of my wonder and regret that his benevolent , disinterested intentions had prospered so little .
Parsing [sent. 11377 len. 29]: `` We must not say so , Dame Durden , '' he cheerfully rephed ; `` Ada is the happier , I hope , and that is much .
Parsing [sent. 11378 len. 33]: I did think that I and both these young creatures might be friends instead of distrustful foes and that we might so far counter-act the suit and prove too strong for it .
Parsing [sent. 11379 len. 8]: But it was too much to expect .
Parsing [sent. 11380 len. 12]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce was the curtain of Rick 's cradle . ''
Parsing [sent. 11381 len. 26]: `` But , guardian , may we not hope that a little experience will teach him what a false and wretched thing it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11382 len. 26]: `` We WILL hope so , my Esther , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` and that it may not teach him so too late .
Parsing [sent. 11383 len. 11]: In any case we must not be hard on him .
Parsing [sent. 11384 len. 45]: There are not many grown and matured men living while we speak , good men too , who if they were thrown into this same court as suitors would not be vitally changed and depreciated within three years -- within two -- within one .
Parsing [sent. 11385 len. 9]: How can we stand amazed at poor Rick ?
Parsing [sent. 11386 len. 33]: A young man so unfortunate , '' here he fell into a lower tone , as if he were thinking aloud , `` can not at first believe -LRB- who could ? -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 11387 len. 7]: that Chancery is what it is .
Parsing [sent. 11388 len. 22]: He looks to it , flushed and fitfully , to do something with his interests and bring them to some settlement .
Parsing [sent. 11389 len. 43]: It procrastinates , disappoints , tries , tortures him ; wears out his sanguine hopes and patience , thread by thread ; but he still looks to it , and hankers after it , and finds his whole world treacherous and hollow .
Parsing [sent. 11390 len. 6]: Well , well , well !
Parsing [sent. 11391 len. 8]: Enough of this , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11392 len. 40]: He had supported me , as at first , all this time , and his tenderness was so precious to me that I leaned my head upon his shoulder and loved him as if he had been my father .
Parsing [sent. 11393 len. 29]: I resolved in my own mind in this little pause , by some means , to see Richard when I grew strong and try to set him right .
Parsing [sent. 11394 len. 29]: `` There are better subjects than these , '' said my guardian , `` for such a joyful time as the time of our dear girl 's recovery .
Parsing [sent. 11395 len. 19]: And I had a commission to broach one of them as soon as I should begin to talk .
Parsing [sent. 11396 len. 12]: When shall Ada come to see you , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11397 len. 8]: I had been thinking of that too .
Parsing [sent. 11398 len. 29]: A little in connexion with the absent mirrors , but not much , for I knew my loving girl would be changed by no change in my looks .
Parsing [sent. 11399 len. 44]: `` Dear guardian , '' said I , `` as I have shut her out so long -- though indeed , indeed , she is like the light to me -- '' `` I know it well , Dame Durden , well . ''
Parsing [sent. 11400 len. 40]: He was so good , his touch expressed such endearing compassion and affection , and the tone of his voice carried such comfort into my heart that I stopped for a little while , quite unable to go on .
Parsing [sent. 11401 len. 19]: `` Yes , yes , you are tired , '' said he , `` Rest a little . ''
Parsing [sent. 11402 len. 36]: `` As I have kept Ada out so long , '' I began afresh after a short while , `` I think I should like to have my own way a little longer , guardian .
Parsing [sent. 11403 len. 14]: It would be best to be away from here before I see her .
Parsing [sent. 11404 len. 62]: If Charley and I were to go to some country lodging as soon as I can move , and if I had a week there in which to grow stronger and to be revived by the sweet air and to look forward to the happiness of having Ada with me again , I think it would be better for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 11405 len. 44]: I hope it was not a poor thing in me to wish to be a little more used to my altered self before I met the eyes of the dear girl I longed so ardently to see , but it is the truth .
Parsing [sent. 11406 len. 3]: I did .
Parsing [sent. 11407 len. 16]: He understood me , I was sure ; but I was not afraid of that .
Parsing [sent. 11408 len. 15]: If it were a poor thing , I knew he would pass it over .
Parsing [sent. 11409 len. 34]: `` Our spoilt little woman , '' said my guardian , `` shall have her own way even in her inflexibility , though at the price , I know , of tears downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 11410 len. 4]: And see here !
Parsing [sent. 11411 len. 64]: Here is Boythorn , heart of chivalry , breathing such ferocious vows as never were breathed on paper before , that if you do n't go and occupy his whole house , he having already turned out of it expressly for that purpose , by heaven and by earth he 'll pull it down and not leave one brick standing on another ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11412 len. 86]: And my guardian put a letter in my hand , without any ordinary beginning such as `` My dear Jarndyce , '' but rushing at once into the words , `` I swear if Miss Summerson do not come down and take possession of my house , which I vacate for her this day at one o'clock , P.M. , '' and then with the utmost seriousness , and in the most emphatic terms , going on to make the extraordinary declaration he had quoted .
Parsing [sent. 11413 len. 34]: We did not appreciate the writer the less for laughing heartily over it , and we settled that I should send him a letter of thanks on the morrow and accept his offer .
Parsing [sent. 11414 len. 33]: It was a most agreeable one to me , for all the places I could have thought of , I should have liked to go to none so well as Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 11415 len. 46]: `` Now , little housewife , '' said my guardian , looking at his watch , `` I was strictly timed before I came upstairs , for you must not be tired too soon ; and my time has waned away to the last minute .
Parsing [sent. 11416 len. 6]: I have one other petition .
Parsing [sent. 11417 len. 35]: Little Miss Flite , hearing a rumour that you were ill , made nothing of walking down here -- twenty miles , poor soul , in a pair of dancing shoes -- to inquire .
Parsing [sent. 11418 len. 19]: It was heaven 's mercy we were at home , or she would have walked back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 11419 len. 8]: The old conspiracy to make me happy !
Parsing [sent. 11420 len. 7]: Everybody seemed to be in it !
Parsing [sent. 11421 len. 67]: `` Now , pet , '' said my guardian , `` if it would not be irksome to you to admit the harmless little creature one afternoon before you save Boythorn 's otherwise devoted house from demolition , I believe you would make her prouder and better pleased with herself than I -- though my eminent name is Jarndyce -- could do in a lifetime . ''
Parsing [sent. 11422 len. 33]: I have no doubt he knew there would be something in the simple image of the poor afflicted creature that would fall like a gentle lesson on my mind at that time .
Parsing [sent. 11423 len. 9]: I felt it as he spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 11424 len. 15]: I could not tell him heartily enough how ready I was to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 11425 len. 12]: I had always pitied her , never so much as now .
Parsing [sent. 11426 len. 26]: I had always been glad of my little power to soothe her under her calamity , but never , never , half so glad before .
Parsing [sent. 11427 len. 19]: We arranged a time for Miss Flite to come out by the coach and share my early dinner .
Parsing [sent. 11428 len. 40]: When my guardian left me , I turned my face away upon my couch and prayed to be forgiven if I , surrounded by such blessings , had magnified to myself the little trial that I had to undergo .
Parsing [sent. 11429 len. 64]: The childish prayer of that old birthday when I had aspired to be industrious , contented , and true-hearted and to do good to some one and win some love to myself if I could came back into my mind with a reproachful sense of all the happiness I had since enjoyed and all the affectionate hearts that had been turned towards me .
Parsing [sent. 11430 len. 14]: If I were weak now , what had I profited by those mercies ?
Parsing [sent. 11431 len. 23]: I repeated the old childish prayer in its old childish words and found that its old peace had not departed from it .
Parsing [sent. 11432 len. 7]: My guardian now came every day .
Parsing [sent. 11433 len. 23]: In a week or so more I could walk about our rooms and hold long talks with Ada from behind the window-curtain .
Parsing [sent. 11434 len. 33]: Yet I never saw her , for I had not as yet the courage to look at the dear face , though I could have done so easily without her seeing me .
Parsing [sent. 11435 len. 8]: On the appointed day Miss Flite arrived .
Parsing [sent. 11436 len. 31]: The poor little creature ran into my room quite forgetful of her usual dignity , and crying from her very heart of hearts , `` My dear Fitz Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11437 len. 10]: fell upon my neck and kissed me twenty times .
Parsing [sent. 11438 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11439 len. 31]: said she , putting her hand into her reticule , `` I have nothing here but documents , my dear Fitz Jarndyce ; I must borrow a pocket handkerchief . ''
Parsing [sent. 11440 len. 37]: Charley gave her one , and the good creature certainly made use of it , for she held it to her eyes with both hands and sat so , shedding tears for the next ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 11441 len. 16]: `` With pleasure , my dear Fitz Jarndyce , '' she was careful to explain .
Parsing [sent. 11442 len. 6]: `` Not the least pain .
Parsing [sent. 11443 len. 7]: Pleasure to see you well again .
Parsing [sent. 11444 len. 12]: Pleasure at having the honour of being admitted to see you .
Parsing [sent. 11445 len. 16]: I am so much fonder of you , my love , than of the Chancellor .
Parsing [sent. 11446 len. 7]: Though I DO attend court regularly .
Parsing [sent. 11447 len. 33]: By the by , my dear , mentioning pocket handkerchiefs -- '' Miss Flite here looked at Charley , who had been to meet her at the place where the coach stopped .
Parsing [sent. 11448 len. 12]: Charley glanced at me and looked unwilling to pursue the suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 11449 len. 5]: `` Ve-ry right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11450 len. 8]: said Miss Flite , `` Ve-ry correct .
Parsing [sent. 11451 len. 2]: Truly !
Parsing [sent. 11452 len. 48]: Highly indiscreet of me to mention it ; but my dear Miss Fitz Jarndyce , I am afraid I am at times -LRB- between ourselves , you would n't think it -RRB- a little -- rambling you know , '' said Miss Flite , touching her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 11453 len. 15]: `` Nothing more , '' `` What were you going to tell me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11454 len. 14]: said I , smiling , for I saw she wanted to go on .
Parsing [sent. 11455 len. 15]: `` You have roused my curiosity , and now you must gratify it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11456 len. 37]: Miss Flite looked at Charley for advice in this important crisis , who said , `` If you please , ma'am , you had better tell then , '' and therein gratified Miss Flite beyond measure .
Parsing [sent. 11457 len. 18]: `` So sagacious , our young friend , '' said she to me in her mysterious way .
Parsing [sent. 11458 len. 3]: `` Diminutive .
Parsing [sent. 11459 len. 4]: But ve-ry sagacious !
Parsing [sent. 11460 len. 11]: Well , my dear , it 's a pretty anecdote .
Parsing [sent. 11461 len. 3]: Nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 11462 len. 6]: Still I think it charming .
Parsing [sent. 11463 len. 38]: Who should follow us down the road from the coach , my dear , but a poor person in a very ungenteel bonnet -- '' `` Jenny , if you please , miss , '' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11464 len. 5]: `` Just so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11465 len. 8]: Miss Flite acquiesced with the greatest suavity .
Parsing [sent. 11466 len. 3]: `` Jenny .
Parsing [sent. 11467 len. 2]: Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 11468 len. 50]: And what does she tell our young friend but that there has been a lady with a veil inquiring at her cottage after my dear Fitz Jarndyce 's health and taking a handkerchief away with her as a little keepsake merely because it was my amiable Fitz Jarndyce 's !
Parsing [sent. 11469 len. 16]: Now , you know , so very prepossessing in the lady with the veil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11470 len. 50]: `` If you please , miss , '' said Charley , to whom I looked in some astonishment , `` Jenny says that when her baby died , you left a handkerchief there , and that she put it away and kept it with the baby 's little things .
Parsing [sent. 11471 len. 25]: I think , if you please , partly because it was yours , miss , and partly because it had covered the baby . ''
Parsing [sent. 11472 len. 23]: `` Diminutive , '' whispered Miss Flite , making a variety of motions about her own forehead to express intellect in Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11473 len. 5]: `` But ex-ceedingly sagacious !
Parsing [sent. 11474 len. 4]: And so dear !
Parsing [sent. 11475 len. 14]: My love , she 's clearer than any counsel I ever heard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11476 len. 9]: `` Yes , Charley , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 11477 len. 5]: `` I remember it .
Parsing [sent. 11478 len. 3]: Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11479 len. 19]: `` Well , miss , '' said Charley , `` and that 's the handkerchief the lady took .
Parsing [sent. 11480 len. 33]: And Jenny wants you to know that she would n't have made away with it herself for a heap of money but that the lady took it and left some money instead .
Parsing [sent. 11481 len. 15]: Jenny do n't know her at all , if you please , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11482 len. 9]: `` Why , who can she be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11483 len. 45]: said I. `` My love , '' Miss Flite suggested , advancing her lips to my ear with her most mysterious look , `` in MY opinion -- do n't mention this to our diminutive friend -- she 's the Lord Chancellor 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 11484 len. 7]: He 's married , you know .
Parsing [sent. 11485 len. 10]: And I understand she leads him a terrible life .
Parsing [sent. 11486 len. 21]: Throws his lordship 's papers into the fire , my dear , if he wo n't pay the jeweller ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11487 len. 22]: I did not think very much about this lady then , for I had an impression that it might be Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 11488 len. 62]: Besides , my attention was diverted by my visitor , who was cold after her ride and looked hungry and who , our dinner being brought in , required some little assistance in arraying herself with great satisfaction in a pitiable old scarf and a much-worn and often-mended pair of gloves , which she had brought down in a paper parcel .
Parsing [sent. 11489 len. 65]: I had to preside , too , over the entertainment , consisting of a dish of fish , a roast fowl , a sweetbread , vegetables , pudding , and Madeira ; and it was so pleasant to see how she enjoyed it , and with what state and ceremony she did honour to it , that I was soon thinking of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 11490 len. 64]: When we had finished and had our little dessert before us , embellished by the hands of my dear , who would yield the superintendence of everything prepared for me to no one , Miss Flite was so very chatty and happy that I thought I would lead her to her own history , as she was always pleased to talk about herself .
Parsing [sent. 11491 len. 19]: I began by saying `` You have attended on the Lord Chancellor many years , Miss Flite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11492 len. 13]: `` Oh , many , many , many years , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11493 len. 6]: But I expect a judgment .
Parsing [sent. 11494 len. 3]: Shortly . ''
Parsing [sent. 11495 len. 22]: There was an anxiety even in her hopefulness that made me doubtful if I had done right in approaching the subject .
Parsing [sent. 11496 len. 10]: I thought I would say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 11497 len. 12]: `` My father expected a judgment , '' said Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 11498 len. 4]: `` My brother .
Parsing [sent. 11499 len. 3]: My sister .
Parsing [sent. 11500 len. 6]: They all expected a judgment .
Parsing [sent. 11501 len. 7]: The same that I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 11502 len. 9]: `` They are all -- '' `` Ye-es .
Parsing [sent. 11503 len. 11]: Dead of course , my dear , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 11504 len. 28]: As I saw she would go on , I thought it best to try to be serviceable to her by meeting the theme rather than avoiding it .
Parsing [sent. 11505 len. 20]: `` Would it not be wiser , '' said I , `` to expect this judgment no more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11506 len. 18]: `` Why , my dear , '' she answered promptly , `` of course it would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11507 len. 10]: `` And to attend the court no more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11508 len. 9]: `` Equally of course , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 11509 len. 18]: `` Very wearing to be always in expectation of what never comes , my dear Fitz Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 11510 len. 11]: Wearing , I assure you , to the bone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11511 len. 14]: She slightly showed me her arm , and it was fearfully thin indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11512 len. 25]: `` But , my dear , '' she went on in her mysterious way , `` there 's a dreadful attraction in the place .
Parsing [sent. 11513 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 11514 len. 13]: Do n't mention it to our diminutive friend when she comes in .
Parsing [sent. 11515 len. 6]: Or it may frighten her .
Parsing [sent. 11516 len. 4]: With good reason .
Parsing [sent. 11517 len. 9]: There 's a cruel attraction in the place .
Parsing [sent. 11518 len. 6]: You CA N'T leave it .
Parsing [sent. 11519 len. 6]: And you MUST expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 11520 len. 11]: I tried to assure her that this was not so .
Parsing [sent. 11521 len. 15]: She heard me patiently and smilingly , but was ready with her own answer .
Parsing [sent. 11522 len. 7]: `` Aye , aye , aye !
Parsing [sent. 11523 len. 10]: You think so because I am a little rambling .
Parsing [sent. 11524 len. 13]: Ve-ry absurd , to be a little rambling , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 11525 len. 5]: Ve-ry confusing , too .
Parsing [sent. 11526 len. 4]: To the head .
Parsing [sent. 11527 len. 5]: I find it so .
Parsing [sent. 11528 len. 17]: But , my dear , I have been there many years , and I have noticed .
Parsing [sent. 11529 len. 11]: It 's the mace and seal upon the table . ''
Parsing [sent. 11530 len. 9]: What could they do , did she think ?
Parsing [sent. 11531 len. 5]: I mildly asked her .
Parsing [sent. 11532 len. 8]: `` Draw , '' returned Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 11533 len. 8]: `` Draw people on , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11534 len. 6]: Draw peace out of them .
Parsing [sent. 11535 len. 5]: Sense out of them .
Parsing [sent. 11536 len. 6]: Good looks out of them .
Parsing [sent. 11537 len. 6]: Good qualities out of them .
Parsing [sent. 11538 len. 13]: I have felt them even drawing my rest away in the night .
Parsing [sent. 11539 len. 6]: Cold and glittering devils ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11540 len. 42]: She tapped me several times upon the arm and nodded good-humouredly as if she were anxious I should understand that I had no cause to fear her , though she spoke so gloomily , and confided these awful secrets to me .
Parsing [sent. 11541 len. 9]: `` Let me see , '' said she .
Parsing [sent. 11542 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you my own case .
Parsing [sent. 11543 len. 21]: Before they ever drew me -- before I had ever seen them -- what was it I used to do ?
Parsing [sent. 11544 len. 3]: Tambourine playing ?
Parsing [sent. 11545 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 11546 len. 3]: Tambour work .
Parsing [sent. 11547 len. 9]: I and my sister worked at tambour work .
Parsing [sent. 11548 len. 11]: Our father and our brother had a builder 's business .
Parsing [sent. 11549 len. 5]: We all lived together .
Parsing [sent. 11550 len. 6]: Ve-ry respectably , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 11551 len. 9]: First , our father was drawn -- slowly .
Parsing [sent. 11552 len. 6]: Home was drawn with him .
Parsing [sent. 11553 len. 25]: In a few years he was a fierce , sour , angry bankrupt without a kind word or a kind look for any one .
Parsing [sent. 11554 len. 9]: He had been so different , Fitz Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 11555 len. 9]: He was drawn to a debtors ' prison .
Parsing [sent. 11556 len. 4]: There he died .
Parsing [sent. 11557 len. 11]: Then our brother was drawn -- swiftly -- to drunkenness .
Parsing [sent. 11558 len. 3]: And rags .
Parsing [sent. 11559 len. 3]: And death .
Parsing [sent. 11560 len. 6]: Then my sister was drawn .
Parsing [sent. 11561 len. 2]: Hush !
Parsing [sent. 11562 len. 5]: Never ask to what !
Parsing [sent. 11563 len. 27]: Then I was ill and in misery , and heard , as I had often heard before , that this was all the work of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 11564 len. 13]: When I got better , I went to look at the monster .
Parsing [sent. 11565 len. 18]: And then I found out how it was , and I was drawn to stay there . ''
Parsing [sent. 11566 len. 42]: Having got over her own short narrative , in the delivery of which she had spoken in a low , strained voice , as if the shock were fresh upon her , she gradually resumed her usual air of amiable importance .
Parsing [sent. 11567 len. 11]: `` You do n't quite credit me , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 11568 len. 4]: Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 11569 len. 6]: You will , some day .
Parsing [sent. 11570 len. 6]: I am a little rambling .
Parsing [sent. 11571 len. 5]: But I have noticed .
Parsing [sent. 11572 len. 23]: I have seen many new faces come , unsuspicious , within the influence of the mace and seal in these many years .
Parsing [sent. 11573 len. 7]: As my father 's came there .
Parsing [sent. 11574 len. 5]: As my brother 's .
Parsing [sent. 11575 len. 5]: As my sister 's .
Parsing [sent. 11576 len. 4]: As my own .
Parsing [sent. 11577 len. 22]: I hear Conversation Kenge and the rest of them say to the new faces , ` Here 's little Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 11578 len. 20]: Oh , you are new here ; and you must come and be presented to little Miss Flite ! '
Parsing [sent. 11579 len. 3]: Ve-ry good .
Parsing [sent. 11580 len. 9]: Proud I am sure to have the honour !
Parsing [sent. 11581 len. 5]: And we all laugh .
Parsing [sent. 11582 len. 11]: But , Fitz Jarndyce , I know what will happen .
Parsing [sent. 11583 len. 15]: I know , far better than they do , when the attraction has begun .
Parsing [sent. 11584 len. 8]: I know the signs , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11585 len. 7]: I saw them begin in Gridley .
Parsing [sent. 11586 len. 6]: And I saw them end .
Parsing [sent. 11587 len. 24]: Fitz Jarndyce , my love , '' speaking low again , `` I saw them beginning in our friend the ward in Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 11588 len. 7]: Let some one hold him back .
Parsing [sent. 11589 len. 8]: Or he 'll be drawn to ruin .
Parsing [sent. 11590 len. 19]: She looked at me in silence for some moments , with her face gradually softening into a smile .
Parsing [sent. 11591 len. 49]: Seeming to fear that she had been too gloomy , and seeming also to lose the connexion in her mind , she said politely as she sipped her glass of wine , `` Yes , my dear , as I was saying , I expect a judgment shortly .
Parsing [sent. 11592 len. 15]: Then I shall release my birds , you know , and confer estates . ''
Parsing [sent. 11593 len. 33]: I was much impressed by her allusion to Richard and by the sad meaning , so sadly illustrated in her poor pinched form , that made its way through all her incoherence .
Parsing [sent. 11594 len. 18]: But happily for her , she was quite complacent again now and beamed with nods and smiles .
Parsing [sent. 11595 len. 21]: `` But , my dear , '' she said , gaily , reaching another hand to put it upon mine .
Parsing [sent. 11596 len. 10]: `` You have not congratulated me on my physician .
Parsing [sent. 11597 len. 7]: Positively not once , yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11598 len. 15]: I was obliged to confess that I did not quite know what she meant .
Parsing [sent. 11599 len. 18]: `` My physician , Mr. Woodcourt , my dear , who was so exceedingly attentive to me .
Parsing [sent. 11600 len. 8]: Though his services were rendered quite gratuitously .
Parsing [sent. 11601 len. 6]: Until the Day of Judgment .
Parsing [sent. 11602 len. 18]: I mean THE judgment that will dissolve the spell upon me of the mace and seal . ''
Parsing [sent. 11603 len. 30]: `` Mr. Woodcourt is so far away , now , '' said I , `` that I thought the time for such congratulation was past , Miss Flite . ''
Parsing [sent. 11604 len. 24]: `` But , my child , '' she returned , `` is it possible that you do n't know what has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11605 len. 21]: `` No , '' said I. `` Not what everybody has been talking of , my beloved Fitz Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11606 len. 17]: `` No , '' said I. `` You forget how long I have been here . ''
Parsing [sent. 11607 len. 3]: `` True !
Parsing [sent. 11608 len. 9]: My dear , for the moment -- true .
Parsing [sent. 11609 len. 4]: I blame myself .
Parsing [sent. 11610 len. 19]: But my memory has been drawn out of me , with everything else , by what I mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 11611 len. 8]: Ve-ry strong influence , is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 11612 len. 19]: Well , my dear , there has been a terrible shipwreck over in those East Indian seas . ''
Parsing [sent. 11613 len. 6]: `` Mr. Woodcourt shipwrecked ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11614 len. 9]: `` Do n't be agitated , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 11615 len. 4]: He is safe .
Parsing [sent. 11616 len. 4]: An awful scene .
Parsing [sent. 11617 len. 5]: Death in all shapes .
Parsing [sent. 11618 len. 6]: Hundreds of dead and dying .
Parsing [sent. 11619 len. 7]: Fire , storm , and darkness .
Parsing [sent. 11620 len. 9]: Numbers of the drowning thrown upon a rock .
Parsing [sent. 11621 len. 14]: There , and through it all , my dear physician was a hero .
Parsing [sent. 11622 len. 6]: Calm and brave through everything .
Parsing [sent. 11623 len. 50]: Saved many lives , never complained in hunger and thirst , wrapped naked people in his spare clothes , took the lead , showed them what to do , governed them , tended the sick , buried the dead , and brought the poor survivors safely off at last !
Parsing [sent. 11624 len. 12]: My dear , the poor emaciated creatures all but worshipped him .
Parsing [sent. 11625 len. 16]: They fell down at his feet when they got to the land and blessed him .
Parsing [sent. 11626 len. 7]: The whole country rings with it .
Parsing [sent. 11627 len. 2]: Stay !
Parsing [sent. 11628 len. 7]: Where 's my bag of documents ?
Parsing [sent. 11629 len. 18]: I have got it there , and you shall read it , you shall read it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11630 len. 55]: And I DID read all the noble history , though very slowly and imperfectly then , for my eyes were so dimmed that I could not see the words , and I cried so much that I was many times obliged to lay down the long account she had cut out of the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 11631 len. 57]: I felt so triumphant ever to have known the man who had done such generous and gallant deeds , I felt such glowing exultation in his renown , I so admired and loved what he had done , that I envied the storm-worn people who had fallen at his feet and blessed him as their preserver .
Parsing [sent. 11632 len. 28]: I could myself have kneeled down then , so far away , and blessed him in my rapture that he should be so truly good and brave .
Parsing [sent. 11633 len. 23]: I felt that no one -- mother , sister , wife -- could honour him more than I. I did , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 11634 len. 64]: My poor little visitor made me a present of the account , and when as the evening began to close in she rose to take her leave , lest she should miss the coach by which she was to return , she was still full of the shipwreck , which I had not yet sufflciently composed myself to understand in all its details .
Parsing [sent. 11635 len. 30]: `` My dear , '' said she as she carefully folded up her scarf and gloves , `` my brave physician ought to have a title bestowed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 11636 len. 6]: And no doubt he will .
Parsing [sent. 11637 len. 7]: You are of that opinlon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11638 len. 8]: That he well deserved one , yes .
Parsing [sent. 11639 len. 9]: That he would ever have one , no .
Parsing [sent. 11640 len. 8]: `` Why not , Fitz Jarndyce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11641 len. 5]: she asked rather sharply .
Parsing [sent. 11642 len. 40]: I said it was not the custom in England to confer titles on men distinguished by peaceful services , however good and great , unless occasionally when they consisted of the accumulation of some very large amount of money .
Parsing [sent. 11643 len. 18]: `` Why , good gracious , '' said Miss Flite , `` how can you say that ?
Parsing [sent. 11644 len. 33]: Surely you know , my dear , that all the greatest ornaments of England in knowledge , imagination , active humanity , and improvement of every sort are added to its nobility !
Parsing [sent. 11645 len. 10]: Look round you , my dear , and consider .
Parsing [sent. 11646 len. 32]: YOU must be rambling a little now , I think , if you do n't know that this is the great reason why titles will always last in the land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11647 len. 20]: I am afraid she believed what she said , for there were moments when she was very mad indeed .
Parsing [sent. 11648 len. 17]: And now I must part with the little secret I have thus far tried to keep .
Parsing [sent. 11649 len. 33]: I had thought , sometimes , that Mr. Woodcourt loved me and that if he had been richer he would perhaps have told me that he loved me before he went away .
Parsing [sent. 11650 len. 21]: I had thought , sometimes , that if he had done so , I should have been glad of it .
Parsing [sent. 11651 len. 13]: But how much better it was now that this had never happened !
Parsing [sent. 11652 len. 47]: What should I have suffered if I had had to write to him and tell him that the poor face he had known as mine was quite gone from me and that I freely released him from his bondage to one whom he had never seen !
Parsing [sent. 11653 len. 11]: Oh , it was so much better as it was !
Parsing [sent. 11654 len. 119]: With a great pang mercifully spared me , I could take back to my heart my childish prayer to be all he had so brightly shown himself ; and there was nothing to be undone : no chain for me to break or for him to drag ; and I could go , please God , my lowly way along the path of duty , and he could go his nobler way upon its broader road ; and though we were apart upon the journey , I might aspire to meet him , unselfishly , innocently , better far than he had thought me when I found some favour in his eyes , at the journey 's end .
Parsing [sent. 11655 len. 19]: Chapter XXXVI -- Chesney Wold Charley and I did not set off alone upon our expedition into Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 11656 len. 37]: My guardian had made up his mind not to lose sight of me until I was safe in Mr. Boythorn 's house , so he accompanied us , and we were two days upon the road .
Parsing [sent. 11657 len. 45]: I found every breath of air , and every scent , and every flower and leaf and blade of grass , and every passing cloud , and everything in nature , more beautiful and wonderful to me than I had ever found it yet .
Parsing [sent. 11658 len. 9]: This was my first gain from my illness .
Parsing [sent. 11659 len. 18]: How little I had lost , when the wide world was so full of delight for me .
Parsing [sent. 11660 len. 25]: My guardian intending to go back immediately , we appointed , on our way down , a day when my dear girl should come .
Parsing [sent. 11661 len. 36]: I wrote her a letter , of which he took charge , and he left us within half an hour of our arrival at our destination , on a delightful evening in the early summer-time .
Parsing [sent. 11662 len. 38]: If a good fairy had built the house for me with a wave of her wand , and I had been a princess and her favoured god-child , I could not have been more considered in it .
Parsing [sent. 11663 len. 41]: So many preparations were made for me and such an endearing remembrance was shown of all my little tastes and likings that I could have sat down , overcome , a dozen times before I had revisited half the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 11664 len. 16]: I did better than that , however , by showing them all to Charley instead .
Parsing [sent. 11665 len. 40]: Charley 's delight calmed mine ; and after we had had a walk in the garden , and Charley had exhausted her whole vocabulary of admiring expressions , I was as tranquilly happy as I ought to have been .
Parsing [sent. 11666 len. 43]: It was a great comfort to be able to say to myself after tea , `` Esther , my dear , I think you are quite sensible enough to sit down now and write a note of thanks to your host . ''
Parsing [sent. 11667 len. 37]: He had left a note of welcome for me , as sunny as his own face , and had confided his bird to my care , which I knew to be his highest mark of confidence .
Parsing [sent. 11668 len. 86]: Accordingly I wrote a little note to him in London , telling him how all his favourite plants and trees were looking , and how the most astonishing of birds had chirped the honours of the house to me in the most hospitable manner , and how , after singing on my shoulder , to the inconceivable rapture of my little maid , he was then at roost in the usual corner of his cage , but whether dreaming or no I could not report .
Parsing [sent. 11669 len. 41]: My note finished and sent off to the post , I made myself very busy in unpacking and arranging ; and I sent Charley to bed in good time and told her I should want her no more that night .
Parsing [sent. 11670 len. 21]: For I had not yet looked in the glass and had never asked to have my own restored to me .
Parsing [sent. 11671 len. 33]: I knew this to be a weakness which must be overcome , but I had always said to myself that I would begin afresh when I got to where I now was .
Parsing [sent. 11672 len. 54]: Therefore I had wanted to be alone , and therefore I said , now alone , in my own room , `` Esther , if you are to be happy , if you are to have any right to pray to be true-hearted , you must keep your word , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 11673 len. 24]: I was quite resolved to keep it , but I sat down for a little while first to reflect upon all my blessings .
Parsing [sent. 11674 len. 12]: And then I said my prayers and thought a little more .
Parsing [sent. 11675 len. 18]: My hair had not been cut off , though it had been in danger more than once .
Parsing [sent. 11676 len. 6]: It was long and thick .
Parsing [sent. 11677 len. 20]: I let it down , and shook it out , and went up to the glass upon the dressing-table .
Parsing [sent. 11678 len. 10]: There was a little muslin curtain drawn across it .
Parsing [sent. 11679 len. 25]: I drew it back and stood for a moment looking through such a veil of my own hair that I could see nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 11680 len. 25]: Then I put my hair aside and looked at the reflection in the mirror , encouraged by seeing how placidly it looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 11681 len. 13]: I was very much changed -- oh , very , very much .
Parsing [sent. 11682 len. 31]: At first my face was so strange to me that I think I should have put my hands before it and started back but for the encouragement I have mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 11683 len. 26]: Very soon it became more familiar , and then I knew the extent of the alteration in it better than I had done at first .
Parsing [sent. 11684 len. 27]: It was not like what I had expected , but I had expected nothing definite , and I dare say anything definite would have surprised me .
Parsing [sent. 11685 len. 22]: I had never been a beauty and had never thought myself one , but I had been very different from this .
Parsing [sent. 11686 len. 6]: It was all gone now .
Parsing [sent. 11687 len. 31]: Heaven was so good to me that I could let it go with a few not bitter tears and could stand there arranging my hair for the night quite thankfully .
Parsing [sent. 11688 len. 19]: One thing troubled me , and I considered it for a long time before I went to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 11689 len. 8]: I had kept Mr. Woodcourt 's flowers .
Parsing [sent. 11690 len. 20]: When they were withered I had dried them and put them in a book that I was fond of .
Parsing [sent. 11691 len. 8]: Nobody knew this , not even Ada .
Parsing [sent. 11692 len. 29]: I was doubtful whether I had a right to preserve what he had sent to one so different -- whether it was generous towards him to do it .
Parsing [sent. 11693 len. 37]: I wished to be generous to him , even in the secret depths of my heart , which he would never know , because I could have loved him -- could have been devoted to him .
Parsing [sent. 11694 len. 42]: At last I came to the conclusion that I might keep them if I treasured them only as a remembrance of what was irrevocably past and gone , never to be looked back on any more , in any other light .
Parsing [sent. 11695 len. 8]: I hope this may not seem trivial .
Parsing [sent. 11696 len. 7]: I was very much in earnest .
Parsing [sent. 11697 len. 23]: I took care to be up early in the morning and to be before the glass when Charley came in on tiptoe .
Parsing [sent. 11698 len. 8]: `` Dear , dear , miss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11699 len. 5]: cried Charley , starting .
Parsing [sent. 11700 len. 6]: `` Is that you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11701 len. 15]: `` Yes , Charley , '' said I , quietly putting up my hair .
Parsing [sent. 11702 len. 13]: `` And I am very well indeed , and very happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 11703 len. 20]: I saw it was a weight off Charley 's mind , but it was a greater weight off mine .
Parsing [sent. 11704 len. 11]: I knew the worst now and was composed to it .
Parsing [sent. 11705 len. 36]: I shall not conceal , as I go on , the weaknesses I could not quite conquer , but they always passed from me soon and the happier frame of mind stayed by me faithfully .
Parsing [sent. 11706 len. 37]: Wishing to be fully re-established in my strength and my good spirits before Ada came , I now laid down a little series of plans with Charley for being in the fresh air all day long .
Parsing [sent. 11707 len. 62]: We were to be out before breakfast , and were to dine early , and were to be out again before and after dinner , and were to talk in the garden after tea , and were to go to rest betimes , and were to climb every hill and explore every road , lane , and field in the neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 11708 len. 64]: As to restoratives and strengthening delicacies , Mr. Boythorn 's good housekeeper was for ever trotting about with something to eat or drink in her hand ; I could not even be heard of as resting in the park but she would come trotting after me with a basket , her cheerful face shining with a lecture on the importance of frequent nourishment .
Parsing [sent. 11709 len. 42]: Then there was a pony expressly for my riding , a chubby pony with a short neck and a mane all over his eyes who could canter -- when he would -- so easily and quietly that he was a treasure .
Parsing [sent. 11710 len. 30]: In a very few days he would come to me in the paddock when I called him , and eat out of my hand , and follow me about .
Parsing [sent. 11711 len. 104]: We arrived at such a capital understanding that when he was jogging with me lazily , and rather obstinately , down some shady lane , if I patted his neck and said , `` Stubbs , I am surprised you do n't canter when you know how much I like it ; and I think you might oblige me , for you are only getting stupid and going to sleep , '' he would give his head a comical shake or two and set off directly , while Charley would stand still and laugh with such enjoyment that her laughter was like music .
Parsing [sent. 11712 len. 25]: I do n't know who had given Stubbs his name , but it seemed to belong to him as naturally as his rough coat .
Parsing [sent. 11713 len. 81]: Once we put him in a little chaise and drove him triumphantly through the green lanes for five miles ; but all at once , as we were extolling him to the skies , he seemed to take it ill that he should have been accompanied so far by the circle of tantalizing little gnats that had been hovering round and round his ears the whole way without appearing to advance an inch , and stopped to think about it .
Parsing [sent. 11714 len. 60]: I suppose he came to the decision that it was not to be borne , for he steadily refused to move until I gave the reins to Charley and got out and walked , when he followed me with a sturdy sort of good humour , putting his head under my arm and rubbing his ear against my sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 11715 len. 50]: It was in vain for me to say , `` Now , Stubbs , I feel quite sure from what I know of you that you will go on if I ride a little while , '' for the moment I left him , he stood stock still again .
Parsing [sent. 11716 len. 28]: Consequently I was obliged to lead the way , as before ; and in this order we returned home , to the great delight of the village .
Parsing [sent. 11717 len. 56]: Charley and I had reason to call it the most friendly of villages , I am sure , for in a week 's time the people were so glad to see us go by , though ever so frequently in the course of a day , that there were faces of greeting in every cottage .
Parsing [sent. 11718 len. 29]: I had known many of the grown people before and almost all the children , but now the very steeple began to wear a familiar and affectionate look .
Parsing [sent. 11719 len. 38]: Among my new friends was an old old woman who lived in such a little thatched and whitewashed dwelling that when the outside shutter was turned up on its hinges , it shut up the whole house-front .
Parsing [sent. 11720 len. 47]: This old lady had a grandson who was a sailor , and I wrote a letter to him for her and drew at the top of it the chimney-corner in which she had brought him up and where his old stool yet occupied its old place .
Parsing [sent. 11721 len. 77]: This was considered by the whole village the most wonderful achievement in the world , but when an answer came back all the way from Plymouth , in which he mentioned that he was going to take the picture all the way to America , and from America would write again , I got all the credit that ought to have been given to the post-office and was invested with the merit of the whole system .
Parsing [sent. 11722 len. 66]: Thus , what with being so much in the air , playing with so many children , gossiping with so many people , sitting on invitation in so many cottages , going on with Charley 's education , and writing long letters to Ada every day , I had scarcely any time to think about that little loss of mine and was almost always cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 11723 len. 23]: If I did think of it at odd moments now and then , I had only to be busy and forget it .
Parsing [sent. 11724 len. 35]: I felt it more than I had hoped I should once when a child said , `` Mother , why is the lady not a pretty lady now like she used to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11725 len. 38]: But when I found the child was not less fond of me , and drew its soft hand over my face with a kind of pitying protection in its touch , that soon set me up again .
Parsing [sent. 11726 len. 30]: There were many little occurrences which suggested to me , with great consolation , how natural it is to gentle hearts to be considerate and delicate towards any inferiority .
Parsing [sent. 11727 len. 7]: One of these particularly touched me .
Parsing [sent. 11728 len. 25]: I happened to stroll into the little church when a marriage was just concluded , and the young couple had to sign the register .
Parsing [sent. 11729 len. 30]: The bridegroom , to whom the pen was handed first , made a rude cross for his mark ; the bride , who came next , did the same .
Parsing [sent. 11730 len. 45]: Now , I had known the bride when I was last there , not only as the prettiest girl in the place , but as having quite distinguished herself in the school , and I could not help looking at her with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 11731 len. 57]: She came aside and whispered to me , while tears of honest love and admiration stood in her bright eyes , `` He 's a dear good fellow , miss ; but he ca n't write yet -- he 's going to learn of me -- and I would n't shame him for the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11732 len. 26]: Why , what had I to fear , I thought , when there was this nobility in the soul of a labouring man 's daughter !
Parsing [sent. 11733 len. 33]: The air blew as freshly and revivingly upon me as it had ever blown , and the healthy colour came into my new face as it had come into my old one .
Parsing [sent. 11734 len. 28]: Charley was wonderful to see , she was so radiant and so rosy ; and we both enjoyed the whole day and slept soundly the whole night .
Parsing [sent. 11735 len. 24]: There was a favourite spot of mine in the park-woods of Chesney Wold where a seat had been erected commanding a lovely view .
Parsing [sent. 11736 len. 33]: The wood had been cleared and opened to improve this point of sight , and the bright sunny landscape beyond was so beautiful that I rested there at least once every day .
Parsing [sent. 11737 len. 65]: A picturesque part of the Hall , called the Ghost 's Walk , was seen to advantage from this higher ground ; and the startling name , and the old legend in the Dedlock family which I had heard from Mr. Boythorn accounting for it , mingled with the view and gave it something of a mysterious interest in addition to its real charms .
Parsing [sent. 11738 len. 42]: There was a bank here , too , which was a famous one for violets ; and as it was a daily delight of Charley 's to gather wild flowers , she took as much to the spot as I did .
Parsing [sent. 11739 len. 21]: It would be idle to inquire now why I never went close to the house or never went inside it .
Parsing [sent. 11740 len. 18]: The family were not there , I had heard on my arrival , and were not expected .
Parsing [sent. 11741 len. 52]: I was far from being incurious or uninterested about the building ; on the contrary , I often sat in this place wondering how the rooms ranged and whether any echo like a footstep really did resound at times , as the story said , upon the lonely Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 11742 len. 27]: The indefinable feeling with which Lady Dedlock had impressed me may have had some influence in keeping me from the house even when she was absent .
Parsing [sent. 11743 len. 5]: I am not sure .
Parsing [sent. 11744 len. 27]: Her face and figure were associated with it , naturally ; but I can not say that they repelled me from it , though something did .
Parsing [sent. 11745 len. 26]: For whatever reason or no reason , I had never once gone near it , down to the day at which my story now arrives .
Parsing [sent. 11746 len. 24]: I was resting at my favourite point after a long ramble , and Charley was gathering violets at a little distance from me .
Parsing [sent. 11747 len. 43]: I had been looking at the Ghost 's Walk lying in a deep shade of masonry afar off and picturing to myself the female shape that was said to haunt it when I became aware of a figure approaching through the wood .
Parsing [sent. 11748 len. 42]: The perspective was so long and so darkened by leaves , and the shadows of the branches on the ground made it so much more intricate to the eye , that at first I could not discern what figure it was .
Parsing [sent. 11749 len. 21]: By little and little it revealed itself to be a woman 's -- a lady 's -- Lady Dedlock 's .
Parsing [sent. 11750 len. 27]: She was alone and coming to where I sat with a much quicker step , I observed to my surprise , than was usual with her .
Parsing [sent. 11751 len. 30]: I was fluttered by her being unexpectedly so near -LRB- she was almost within speaking distance before I knew her -RRB- and would have risen to continue my walk .
Parsing [sent. 11752 len. 5]: But I could not .
Parsing [sent. 11753 len. 5]: I was rendered motionless .
Parsing [sent. 11754 len. 79]: Not so much by her hurried gesture of entreaty , not so much by her quick advance and outstretched hands , not so much by the great change in her manner and the absence of her haughty self-restraint , as by a something in her face that I had pined for and dreamed of when I was a little child , something I had never seen in any face , something I had never seen in hers before .
Parsing [sent. 11755 len. 14]: A dread and faintness fell upon me , and I called to Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11756 len. 17]: Lady Dedlock stopped upon the instant and changed back almost to what I had known her .
Parsing [sent. 11757 len. 20]: `` Miss Summerson , I am afraid I have startled you , '' she said , now advancing slowly .
Parsing [sent. 11758 len. 8]: `` You can scarcely be strong yet .
Parsing [sent. 11759 len. 9]: You have been very ill , I know .
Parsing [sent. 11760 len. 10]: I have been much concerned to hear it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11761 len. 25]: I could no more have removed my eyes from her pale face than I could have stirred from the bench on which I sat .
Parsing [sent. 11762 len. 29]: She gave me her hand , and its deadly coldness , so at variance with the enforced composure of her features , deepened the fascination that overpowered me .
Parsing [sent. 11763 len. 11]: I can not say what was in my whirling thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 11764 len. 7]: `` You are recovering again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11765 len. 4]: she asked kindly .
Parsing [sent. 11766 len. 14]: `` I was quite well but a moment ago , Lady Dedlock . ''
Parsing [sent. 11767 len. 8]: `` Is this your young attendant ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11768 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 11769 len. 16]: `` Will you send her on before and walk towards your house with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11770 len. 21]: `` Charley , '' said I , `` take your flowers home , and I will follow you directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 11771 len. 17]: Charley , with her best curtsy , blushingly tied on her bonnet and went her way .
Parsing [sent. 11772 len. 15]: When she was gone , Lady Dedlock sat down on the seat beside me .
Parsing [sent. 11773 len. 31]: I can not tell in any words what the state of my mind was when I saw in her hand my handkerchief with which I had covered the dead baby .
Parsing [sent. 11774 len. 25]: I looked at her , but I could not see her , I could not hear her , I could not draw my breath .
Parsing [sent. 11775 len. 22]: The beating of my heart was so violent and wild that I felt as if my life were breaking from me .
Parsing [sent. 11776 len. 55]: But when she caught me to her breast , kissed me , wept over me , compassionated me , and called me back to myself ; when she fell down on her knees and cried to me , `` Oh , my child , my child , I am your wicked and unhappy mother !
Parsing [sent. 11777 len. 8]: Oh , try to forgive me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11778 len. 79]: -- when I saw her at my feet on the bare earth in her great agony of mind , I felt , through all my tumult of emotion , a burst of gratitude to the providence of God that I was so changed as that I never could disgrace her by any trace of likeness , as that nobody could ever now look at me and look at her and remotely think of any near tie between us .
Parsing [sent. 11779 len. 21]: I raised my mother up , praying and beseeching her not to stoop before me in such affliction and humiliation .
Parsing [sent. 11780 len. 27]: I did so in broken , incoherent words , for besides the trouble I was in , it frightened me to see her at MY feet .
Parsing [sent. 11781 len. 46]: I told her -- or I tried to tell her -- that if it were for me , her child , under any circumstances to take upon me to forgive her , I did it , and had done it , many , many years .
Parsing [sent. 11782 len. 28]: I told her that my heart overflowed with love for her , that it was natural love which nothing in the past had changed or could change .
Parsing [sent. 11783 len. 61]: That it was not for me , then resting for the first time on my mother 's bosom , to take her to account for having given me life , but that my duty was to bless her and receive her , though the whole world turned from her , and that I only asked her leave to do it .
Parsing [sent. 11784 len. 43]: I held my mother in my embrace , and she held me in hers , and among the still woods in the silence of the summer day there seemed to be nothing but our two troubled minds that was not at peace .
Parsing [sent. 11785 len. 19]: `` To bless and receive me , '' groaned my mother , `` it is far too late .
Parsing [sent. 11786 len. 17]: I must travel my dark road alone , and it will lead me where it will .
Parsing [sent. 11787 len. 22]: From day to day , sometimes from hour to hour , I do not see the way before my guilty feet .
Parsing [sent. 11788 len. 11]: This is the earthly punishment I have brought upon myself .
Parsing [sent. 11789 len. 10]: I bear it , and I hide it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11790 len. 30]: Even in the thinking of her endurance , she drew her habitual air of proud indifference about her like a veil , though she soon cast it off again .
Parsing [sent. 11791 len. 21]: `` I must keep this secret , if by any means it can be kept , not wholly for myself .
Parsing [sent. 11792 len. 14]: I have a husband , wretched and dishonouring creature that I am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11793 len. 20]: These words she uttered with a suppressed cry of despair , more terrible in its sound than any shriek .
Parsing [sent. 11794 len. 46]: Covering her face with her hands , she shrank down in my embrace as if she were unwilling that I should touch her ; nor could I , by my utmost persuasions or by any endearments I could use , prevail upon her to rise .
Parsing [sent. 11795 len. 43]: She said , no , no , no , she could only speak to me so ; she must be proud and disdainful everywhere else ; she would be humbled and ashamed there , in the only natural moments of her life .
Parsing [sent. 11796 len. 15]: My unhappy mother told me that in my illness she had been nearly frantic .
Parsing [sent. 11797 len. 11]: She had but then known that her child was living .
Parsing [sent. 11798 len. 12]: She could not have suspected me to be that child before .
Parsing [sent. 11799 len. 17]: She had followed me down here to speak to me but once in all her life .
Parsing [sent. 11800 len. 22]: We never could associate , never could communicate , never probably from that time forth could interchange another word on earth .
Parsing [sent. 11801 len. 55]: She put into my hands a letter she had written for my reading only and said when I had read it and destroyed it -- but not so much for her sake , since she asked nothing , as for her husband 's and my own -- I must evermore consider her as dead .
Parsing [sent. 11802 len. 48]: If I could believe that she loved me , in this agony in which I saw her , with a mother 's love , she asked me to do that , for then I might think of her with a greater pity , imagining what she suffered .
Parsing [sent. 11803 len. 12]: She had put herself beyond all hope and beyond all help .
Parsing [sent. 11804 len. 51]: Whether she preserved her secret until death or it came to be discovered and she brought dishonour and disgrace upon the name she had taken , it was her solitary struggle always ; and no affection could come near her , and no human creature could render her any aid .
Parsing [sent. 11805 len. 10]: `` But is the secret safe so far ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11806 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 11807 len. 10]: `` Is it safe now , dearest mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11808 len. 8]: `` No , '' replied my mother .
Parsing [sent. 11809 len. 8]: `` It has been very near discovery .
Parsing [sent. 11810 len. 7]: It was saved by an accident .
Parsing [sent. 11811 len. 14]: It may be lost by another accident -- to-morrow , any day . ''
Parsing [sent. 11812 len. 9]: `` Do you dread a particular person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11813 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 11814 len. 10]: Do not tremble and cry so much for me .
Parsing [sent. 11815 len. 17]: I am not worthy of these tears , '' said my mother , kissing my hands .
Parsing [sent. 11816 len. 9]: `` I dread one person very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 11817 len. 5]: `` An enemy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11818 len. 5]: `` Not a friend .
Parsing [sent. 11819 len. 9]: One who is too passionless to be either .
Parsing [sent. 11820 len. 35]: He is Sir Leicester Dedlock 's lawyer , mechanically faithful without attachment , and very jealous of the profit , privilege , and reputation of being master of the mysteries of great houses . ''
Parsing [sent. 11821 len. 7]: `` Has he any suspicions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11822 len. 4]: `` Many . ''
Parsing [sent. 11823 len. 6]: `` Not of you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11824 len. 4]: I said alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 11825 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 11826 len. 9]: He is always vigilant and always near me .
Parsing [sent. 11827 len. 17]: I may keep him at a standstill , but I can never shake him off . ''
Parsing [sent. 11828 len. 10]: `` Has he so little pity or compunction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11829 len. 9]: `` He has none , and no anger .
Parsing [sent. 11830 len. 9]: He is indifferent to everything but his calling .
Parsing [sent. 11831 len. 28]: His calling is the acquisition of secrets and the holding possession of such power as they give him , with no sharer or opponent in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11832 len. 8]: `` Could you trust in him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11833 len. 6]: `` I shall never try .
Parsing [sent. 11834 len. 16]: The dark road I have trodden for so many years will end where it will .
Parsing [sent. 11835 len. 13]: I follow it alone to the end , whatever the end be .
Parsing [sent. 11836 len. 20]: It may be near , it may be distant ; while the road lasts , nothing turns me . ''
Parsing [sent. 11837 len. 10]: `` Dear mother , are you so resolved ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11838 len. 5]: `` I AM resolved .
Parsing [sent. 11839 len. 29]: I have long outbidden folly with folly , pride with pride , scorn with scorn , insolence with insolence , and have outlived many vanities with many more .
Parsing [sent. 11840 len. 14]: I will outlive this danger , and outdie it , if I can .
Parsing [sent. 11841 len. 30]: It has closed around me almost as awfully as if these woods of Chesney Wold had closed around the house , but my course through it is the same .
Parsing [sent. 11842 len. 12]: I have but one ; I can have but one . ''
Parsing [sent. 11843 len. 20]: `` Mr. Jarndyce -- '' I was beginning when my mother hurriedly inquired , `` Does HE suspect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11844 len. 11]: `` No , '' said I. `` No , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 11845 len. 8]: Be assured that he does not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11846 len. 17]: And I told her what he had related to me as his knowledge of my story .
Parsing [sent. 11847 len. 47]: `` But he is so good and sensible , '' said I , `` that perhaps if he knew -- '' My mother , who until this time had made no change in her position , raised her hand up to my lips and stopped me .
Parsing [sent. 11848 len. 14]: `` Confide fully in him , '' she said after a little while .
Parsing [sent. 11849 len. 19]: `` You have my free consent -- a small gift from such a mother to her injured child !
Parsing [sent. 11850 len. 10]: -- -- but do not tell me of it .
Parsing [sent. 11851 len. 10]: Some pride is left in me even yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 11852 len. 136]: I explained , as nearly as I could then , or can recall now -- for my agitation and distress throughout were so great that I scarcely understood myself , though every word that was uttered in the mother 's voice , so unfamiliar and so melancholy to me , which in my childhood I had never learned to love and recognize , had never been sung to sleep with , had never heard a blessing from , had never had a hope inspired by , made an enduring impression on my memory -- I say I explained , or tried to do it , how I had only hoped that Mr. Jarndyce , who had been the best of fathers to me , might be able to afford some counsel and support to her .
Parsing [sent. 11853 len. 16]: But my mother answered no , it was impossible ; no one could help her .
Parsing [sent. 11854 len. 13]: Through the desert that lay before her , she must go alone .
Parsing [sent. 11855 len. 8]: `` My child , my child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11856 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 11857 len. 6]: `` For the last time !
Parsing [sent. 11858 len. 7]: These kisses for the last time !
Parsing [sent. 11859 len. 10]: These arms upon my neck for the last time !
Parsing [sent. 11860 len. 6]: We shall meet no more .
Parsing [sent. 11861 len. 20]: To hope to do what I seek to do , I must be what I have been so long .
Parsing [sent. 11862 len. 7]: Such is my reward and doom .
Parsing [sent. 11863 len. 26]: If you hear of Lady Dedlock , brilliant , prosperous , and flattered , think of your wretched mother , conscience-stricken , underneath that mask !
Parsing [sent. 11864 len. 31]: Think that the reality is in her suffering , in her useless remorse , in her murdering within her breast the only love and truth of which it is capable !
Parsing [sent. 11865 len. 22]: And then forgive her if you can , and cry to heaven to forgive her , which it never can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11866 len. 52]: We held one another for a little space yet , but she was so firm that she took my hands away , and put them back against my breast , and with a last kiss as she held them there , released them , and went from me into the wood .
Parsing [sent. 11867 len. 60]: I was alone , and calm and quiet below me in the sun and shade lay the old house , with its terraces and turrets , on which there had seemed to me to be such complete repose when I first saw it , but which now looked like the obdurate and unpitying watcher of my mother 's misery .
Parsing [sent. 11868 len. 42]: Stunned as I was , as weak and helpless at first as I had ever been in my sick chamber , the necessity of guarding against the danger of discovery , or even of the remotest suspicion , did me service .
Parsing [sent. 11869 len. 38]: I took such precautions as I could to hide from Charley that I had been crying , and I constrained myself to think of every sacred obligation that there was upon me to be careful and collected .
Parsing [sent. 11870 len. 34]: It was not a little while before I could succeed or could even restrain bursts of grief , but after an hour or so I was better and felt that I might return .
Parsing [sent. 11871 len. 44]: I went home very slowly and told Charley , whom I found at the gate looking for me , that I had been tempted to extend my walk after Lady Dedlock had left me and that I was over-tired and would lie down .
Parsing [sent. 11872 len. 11]: Safe in my own room , I read the letter .
Parsing [sent. 11873 len. 22]: I clearly derived from it -- and that was much then -- that I had not been abandoned by my mother .
Parsing [sent. 11874 len. 68]: Her elder and only sister , the godmother of my childhood , discovering signs of life in me when I had been laid aside as dead , had in her stern sense of duty , with no desire or willingness that I should live , reared me in rigid secrecy and had never again beheld my mother 's face from within a few hours of my birth .
Parsing [sent. 11875 len. 47]: So strangely did I hold my place in this world that until within a short time back I had never , to my own mother 's knowledge , breathed -- had been buried -- had never been endowed with life -- had never borne a name .
Parsing [sent. 11876 len. 40]: When she had first seen me in the church she had been startled and had thought of what would have been like me if it had ever lived , and had lived on , but that was all then .
Parsing [sent. 11877 len. 13]: What more the letter told me needs not to be repeated here .
Parsing [sent. 11878 len. 11]: It has its own times and places in my story .
Parsing [sent. 11879 len. 18]: My first care was to burn what my mother had written and to consume even its ashes .
Parsing [sent. 11880 len. 26]: I hope it may not appear very unnatural or bad in me that I then became heavily sorrowful to think I had ever been reared .
Parsing [sent. 11881 len. 24]: That I felt as if I knew it would have been better and happier for many people if indeed I had never breathed .
Parsing [sent. 11882 len. 25]: That I had a terror of myself as the danger and the possible disgrace of my own mother and of a proud family name .
Parsing [sent. 11883 len. 45]: That I was so confused and shaken as to be possessed by a belief that it was right and had been intended that I should die in my birth , and that it was wrong and not intended that I should be then alive .
Parsing [sent. 11884 len. 9]: These are the real feelings that I had .
Parsing [sent. 11885 len. 30]: I fell asleep worn out , and when I awoke I cried afresh to think that I was back in the world with my load of trouble for others .
Parsing [sent. 11886 len. 64]: I was more than ever frightened of myself , thinking anew of her against whom I was a witness , of the owner of Chesney Wold , of the new and terrible meaning of the old words now moaning in my ear like a surge upon the shore , `` Your mother , Esther , was your disgrace , and you are hers .
Parsing [sent. 11887 len. 31]: The time will come -- and soon enough -- when you will understand this better , and will feel it too , as no one save a woman can . ''
Parsing [sent. 11888 len. 24]: With them , those other words returned , `` Pray daily that the sins of others be not visited upon your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 11889 len. 32]: I could not disentangle all that was about me , and I felt as if the blame and the shame were all in me , and the visitation had come down .
Parsing [sent. 11890 len. 21]: The day waned into a gloomy evening , overcast and sad , and I still contended with the same distress .
Parsing [sent. 11891 len. 46]: I went out alone , and after walking a little in the park , watching the dark shades falling on the trees and the fitful flight of the bats , which sometimes almost touched me , was attracted to the house for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 11892 len. 19]: Perhaps I might not have gone near it if I had been in a stronger frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 11893 len. 14]: As it was , I took the path that led close by it .
Parsing [sent. 11894 len. 97]: I did not dare to linger or to look up , but I passed before the terrace garden with its fragrant odours , and its broad walks , and its well-kept beds and smooth turf ; and I saw how beautiful and grave it was , and how the old stone balustrades and parapets , and wide flights of shallow steps , were seamed by time and weather ; and how the trained moss and ivy grew about them , and around the old stone pedestal of the sun-dial ; and I heard the fountain falling .
Parsing [sent. 11895 len. 47]: Then the way went by long lines of dark windows diversified by turreted towers and porches of eccentric shapes , where old stone lions and grotesque monsters bristled outside dens of shadow and snarled at the evening gloom over the escutcheons they held in their grip .
Parsing [sent. 11896 len. 83]: Thence the path wound underneath a gateway , and through a court-yard where the principal entrance was -LRB- I hurried quickly on -RRB- , and by the stables where none but deep voices seemed to be , whether in the murmuring of the wind through the strong mass of ivy holding to a high red wall , or in the low complaining of the weathercock , or in the barking of the dogs , or in the slow striking of a clock .
Parsing [sent. 11897 len. 52]: So , encountering presently a sweet smell of limes , whose rustling I could hear , I turned with the turning of the path to the south front , and there above me were the balustrades of the Ghost 's Walk and one lighted window that might be my mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 11898 len. 25]: The way was paved here , like the terrace overhead , and my footsteps from being noiseless made an echoing sound upon the flags .
Parsing [sent. 11899 len. 83]: Stopping to look at nothing , but seeing all I did see as I went , I was passing quickly on , and in a few moments should have passed the lighted window , when my echoing footsteps brought it suddenly into my mind that there was a dreadful truth in the legend of the Ghost 's Walk , that it was I who was to bring calamity upon the stately house and that my warning feet were haunting it even then .
Parsing [sent. 11900 len. 48]: Seized with an augmented terror of myself which turned me cold , I ran from myself and everything , retraced the way by which I had come , and never paused until I had gained the lodge-gate , and the park lay sullen and black behind me .
Parsing [sent. 11901 len. 33]: Not before I was alone in my own room for the night and had again been dejected and unhappy there did I begin to know how wrong and thankless this state was .
Parsing [sent. 11902 len. 113]: But from my darling who was coming on the morrow , I found a joyful letter , full of such loving anticipation that I must have been of marble if it had not moved me ; from my guardian , too , I found another letter , asking me to tell Dame Durden , if I should see that little woman anywhere , that they had moped most pitiably without her , that the housekeeping was going to rack and ruin , that nobody else could manage the keys , and that everybody in and about the house declared it was not the same house and was becoming rebellious for her return .
Parsing [sent. 11903 len. 23]: Two such letters together made me think how far beyond my deserts I was beloved and how happy I ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 11904 len. 28]: That made me think of all my past life ; and that brought me , as it ought to have done before , into a better condition .
Parsing [sent. 11905 len. 36]: For I saw very well that I could not have been intended to die , or I should never have lived ; not to say should never have been reserved for such a happy life .
Parsing [sent. 11906 len. 44]: I saw very well how many things had worked together for my welfare , and that if the sins of the fathers were sometimes visited upon the children , the phrase did not mean what I had in the morning feared it meant .
Parsing [sent. 11907 len. 34]: I knew I was as innocent of my birth as a queen of hers and that before my Heavenly Father I should not be punished for birth nor a queen rewarded for it .
Parsing [sent. 11908 len. 33]: I had had experience , in the shock of that very day , that I could , even thus soon , find comforting reconcilements to the change that had fallen on me .
Parsing [sent. 11909 len. 35]: I renewed my resolutions and prayed to be strengthened in them , pouring out my heart for myself and for my unhappy mother and feeling that the darkness of the morning was passing away .
Parsing [sent. 11910 len. 21]: It was not upon my sleep ; and when the next day 's light awoke me , it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 11911 len. 13]: My dear girl was to arrive at five o'clock in the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 11912 len. 61]: How to help myself through the intermediate time better than by taking a long walk along the road by which she was to come , I did not know ; so Charley and I and Stubbs -- Stubbs saddled , for we never drove him after the one great occasion -- made a long expedition along that road and back .
Parsing [sent. 11913 len. 38]: On our return , we held a great review of the house and garden and saw that everything was in its prettiest condition , and had the bird out ready as an important part of the establishment .
Parsing [sent. 11914 len. 38]: There were more than two full hours yet to elapse before she could come , and in that interval , which seemed a long one , I must confess I was nervously anxious about my altered looks .
Parsing [sent. 11915 len. 21]: I loved my darling so well that I was more concerned for their effect on her than on any one .
Parsing [sent. 11916 len. 35]: I was not in this slight distress because I at all repined -- I am quite certain I did not , that day -- but , I thought , would she be wholly prepared ?
Parsing [sent. 11917 len. 16]: When she first saw me , might she not be a little shocked and disappointed ?
Parsing [sent. 11918 len. 11]: Might it not prove a little worse than she expected ?
Parsing [sent. 11919 len. 13]: Might she not look for her old Esther and not find her ?
Parsing [sent. 11920 len. 16]: Might she not have to grow used to me and to begin all over again ?
Parsing [sent. 11921 len. 40]: I knew the various expressions of my sweet girl 's face so well , and it was such an honest face in its loveliness , that I was sure beforehand she could not hide that first look from me .
Parsing [sent. 11922 len. 28]: And I considered whether , if it should signify any one of these meanings , which was so very likely , could I quite answer for myself ?
Parsing [sent. 11923 len. 7]: Well , I thought I could .
Parsing [sent. 11924 len. 9]: After last night , I thought I could .
Parsing [sent. 11925 len. 33]: But to wait and wait , and expect and expect , and think and think , was such bad preparation that I resolved to go along the road again and meet her .
Parsing [sent. 11926 len. 25]: So I said to Charley , ' `` Charley , I will go by myself and walk along the road until she comes . ''
Parsing [sent. 11927 len. 17]: Charley highly approving of anything that pleased me , I went and left her at home .
Parsing [sent. 11928 len. 50]: But before I got to the second milestone , I had been in so many palpitations from seeing dust in the distance -LRB- though I knew it was not , and could not , be the coach yet -RRB- that I resolved to turn back and go home again .
Parsing [sent. 11929 len. 50]: And when I had turned , I was in such fear of the coach coming up behind me -LRB- though I still knew that it neither would , nor could , do any such thing -RRB- that I ran the greater part of the way to avoid being overtaken .
Parsing [sent. 11930 len. 22]: Then , I considered , when I had got safe back again , this was a nice thing to have done !
Parsing [sent. 11931 len. 16]: Now I was hot and had made the worst of it instead of the best .
Parsing [sent. 11932 len. 41]: At last , when I believed there was at least a quarter of an hour more yet , Charley all at once cried out to me as I was trembling in the garden , `` Here she comes , miss !
Parsing [sent. 11933 len. 5]: Here she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11934 len. 22]: I did not mean to do it , but I ran upstairs into my room and hid myself behind the door .
Parsing [sent. 11935 len. 30]: There I stood trembling , even when I heard my darling calling as she came upstairs , `` Esther , my dear , my love , where are you ?
Parsing [sent. 11936 len. 8]: Little woman , dear Dame Durden ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11937 len. 14]: She ran in , and was running out again when she saw me .
Parsing [sent. 11938 len. 6]: Ah , my angel girl !
Parsing [sent. 11939 len. 14]: The old dear look , all love , all fondness , all affection .
Parsing [sent. 11940 len. 11]: Nothing else in it -- no , nothing , nothing !
Parsing [sent. 11941 len. 68]: Oh , how happy I was , down upon the floor , with my sweet beautiful girl down upon the floor too , holding my scarred face to her lovely cheek , bathing it with tears and kisses , rocking me to and fro like a child , calling me by every tender name that she could think of , and pressing me to her faithful heart .
Parsing [sent. 11942 len. 31]: Chapter XXXVII -- Jarndyce and Jarndyce If the secret I had to keep had been mine , I must have confided it to Ada before we had been long together .
Parsing [sent. 11943 len. 31]: But it was not mine , and I did not feel that I had a right to tell it , even to my guardian , unless some great emergency arose .
Parsing [sent. 11944 len. 38]: It was a weight to bear alone ; still my present duty appeared to be plain , and blest in the attachment of my dear , I did not want an impulse and encouragement to do it .
Parsing [sent. 11945 len. 78]: Though often when she was asleep and all was quiet , the remembrance of my mother kept me waking and made the night sorrowful , I did not yield to it at another time ; and Ada found me what I used to be -- except , of course , in that particular of which I have said enough and which I have no intention of mentioning any more just now , if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 11946 len. 60]: The difficulty that I felt in being quite composed that first evening when Ada asked me , over our work , if the family were at the house , and when I was obliged to answer yes , I believed so , for Lady Dedlock had spoken to me in the woods the day before yesterday , was great .
Parsing [sent. 11947 len. 45]: Greater still when Ada asked me what she had said , and when I replied that she had been kind and interested , and when Ada , while admitting her beauty and elegance , remarked upon her proud manner and her imperious chilling air .
Parsing [sent. 11948 len. 61]: But Charley helped me through , unconsciously , by telling us that Lady Dedlock had only stayed at the house two nights on her way from London to visit at some other great house in the next county and that she had left early on the morning after we had seen her at our view , as we called it .
Parsing [sent. 11949 len. 34]: Charley verified the adage about little pitchers , I am sure , for she heard of more sayings and doings in a day than would have come to my ears in a month .
Parsing [sent. 11950 len. 11]: We were to stay a month at Mr. Boythorn 's .
Parsing [sent. 11951 len. 60]: My pet had scarcely been there a bright week , as I recollect the time , when one evening after we had finished helping the gardener in watering his flowers , and just as the candles were lighted , Charley , appearing with a very important air behind Ada 's chair , beckoned me mysteriously out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 11952 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 11953 len. 22]: If you please , miss , '' said Charley in a whisper , with her eyes at their roundest and largest .
Parsing [sent. 11954 len. 10]: `` You 're wanted at the Dedlock Arms . ''
Parsing [sent. 11955 len. 20]: `` Why , Charley , '' said I , `` who can possibly want me at the public-house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11956 len. 68]: `` I do n't know , miss , '' returned Charley , putting her head forward and folding her hands tight upon the band of her little apron , which she always did in the enjoyment of anything mysterious or confidential , `` but it 's a gentleman , miss , and his compliments , and will you please to come without saying anything about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 11957 len. 7]: `` Whose compliments , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11958 len. 22]: `` His ` n , miss , '' returned Charley , whose grammatical education was advancing , but not very rapidly .
Parsing [sent. 11959 len. 14]: `` And how do you come to be the messenger , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11960 len. 19]: `` I am not the messenger , if you please , miss , '' returned my little maid .
Parsing [sent. 11961 len. 9]: `` It was W. Grubble , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 11962 len. 10]: `` And who is W. Grubble , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11963 len. 10]: `` Mister Grubble , miss , '' returned Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11964 len. 8]: `` Do n't you know , miss ?
Parsing [sent. 11965 len. 22]: The Dedlock Arms , by W. Grubble , '' which Charley delivered as if she were slowly spelling out the sign .
Parsing [sent. 11966 len. 3]: `` Aye ?
Parsing [sent. 11967 len. 6]: The landlord , Charley ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11968 len. 5]: `` Yes , miss .
Parsing [sent. 11969 len. 24]: If you please , miss , his wife is a beautiful woman , but she broke her ankle , and it never joined .
Parsing [sent. 11970 len. 32]: And her brother 's the sawyer that was put in the cage , miss , and they expect he 'll drink himself to death entirely on beer , '' said Charley .
Parsing [sent. 11971 len. 26]: Not knowing what might be the matter , and being easily apprehensive now , I thought it best to go to this place by myself .
Parsing [sent. 11972 len. 42]: I bade Charley be quick with my bonnet and veil and my shawl , and having put them on , went away down the little hilly street , where I was as much at home as in Mr. Boythorn 's garden .
Parsing [sent. 11973 len. 20]: Mr. Grubble was standing in his shirt-sleeves at the door of his very clean little tavern waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 11974 len. 112]: He lifted off his hat with both hands when he saw me coming , and carrying it so , as if it were an iron vessel -LRB- it looked as heavy -RRB- , preceded me along the sanded passage to his best parlour , a neat carpeted room with more plants in it than were quite convenient , a coloured print of Queen Caroline , several shells , a good many tea-trays , two stuffed and dried fish in glass cases , and either a curious egg or a curious pumpkin -LRB- but I do n't know which , and I doubt if many people did -RRB- hanging from his ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 11975 len. 17]: I knew Mr. Grubble very well by sight , from his often standing at his door .
Parsing [sent. 11976 len. 35]: A pleasant-looking , stoutish , middle-aged man who never seemed to consider himself cozily dressed for his own fire-side without his hat and top-boots , but who never wore a coat except at church .
Parsing [sent. 11977 len. 40]: He snuffed the candle , and backing away a little to see how it looked , backed out of the room -- unexpectedly to me , for I was going to ask him by whom he had been sent .
Parsing [sent. 11978 len. 25]: The door of the opposite parlour being then opened , I heard some voices , familiar in my ears I thought , which stopped .
Parsing [sent. 11979 len. 21]: A quick light step approached the room in which I was , and who should stand before me but Richard !
Parsing [sent. 11980 len. 6]: `` My dear Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11981 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 11982 len. 6]: `` My best friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11983 len. 32]: And he really was so warm-hearted and earnest that in the first surprise and pleasure of his brotherly greeting I could scarcely find breath to tell him that Ada was well .
Parsing [sent. 11984 len. 13]: `` Answering my very thoughts -- always the same dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11985 len. 14]: said Richard , leading me to a chair and seating himself beside me .
Parsing [sent. 11986 len. 10]: I put my veil up , but not quite .
Parsing [sent. 11987 len. 8]: `` Always the same dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 11988 len. 8]: said Richard just as heartily as before .
Parsing [sent. 11989 len. 62]: I put up my veil altogether , and laying my hand on Richard 's sleeve and looking in his face , told him how much I thanked him for his kind welcome and how greatly I rejoiced to see him , the more so because of the determination I had made in my illness , which I now conveyed to him .
Parsing [sent. 11990 len. 34]: `` My love , '' said Richard , `` there is no one with whom I have a greater wish to talk than you , for I want you to understand me . ''
Parsing [sent. 11991 len. 24]: `` And I want you , Richard , '' said I , shaking my head , `` to understand some one else . ''
Parsing [sent. 11992 len. 23]: `` Since you refer so immediately to John Jarndyce , '' said Richard , '' -- I suppose you mean him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 11993 len. 7]: `` Of course I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 11994 len. 28]: `` Then I may say at once that I am glad of it , because it is on that subject that I am anxious to be understood .
Parsing [sent. 11995 len. 10]: By you , mind -- you , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 11996 len. 12]: I am not accountable to Mr. Jarndyce or Mr. Anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 11997 len. 15]: I was pained to find him taking this tone , and he observed it .
Parsing [sent. 11998 len. 21]: `` Well , well , my dear , '' said Richard , `` we wo n't go into that now .
Parsing [sent. 11999 len. 24]: I want to appear quietly in your country-house here , with you under my arm , and give my charming cousin a surprise .
Parsing [sent. 12000 len. 12]: I suppose your loyalty to John Jarndyce will allow that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12001 len. 41]: `` My dear Richard , '' I returned , `` you know you would be heartily welcome at his house -- your home , if you will but consider it so ; and you are as heartily welcome here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12002 len. 10]: `` Spoken like the best of little women ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12003 len. 4]: cried Richard gaily .
Parsing [sent. 12004 len. 9]: I asked him how he liked his profession .
Parsing [sent. 12005 len. 10]: `` Oh , I like it well enough ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12006 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12007 len. 6]: `` It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 12008 len. 12]: It does as well as anything else , for a time .
Parsing [sent. 12009 len. 36]: I do n't know that I shall care about it when I come to be settled , but I can sell out then and -- however , never mind all that botheration at present . ''
Parsing [sent. 12010 len. 17]: So young and handsome , and in all respects so perfectly the opposite of Miss Flite !
Parsing [sent. 12011 len. 21]: And yet , in the clouded , eager , seeking look that passed over him , so dreadfully like her !
Parsing [sent. 12012 len. 14]: `` I am in town on leave just now , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12013 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12014 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12015 len. 26]: I have run over to look after my -- my Chancery interests before the long vacation , '' said Richard , forcing a careless laugh .
Parsing [sent. 12016 len. 19]: `` We are beginning to spin along with that old suit at last , I promise you . ''
Parsing [sent. 12017 len. 8]: No wonder that I shook my head !
Parsing [sent. 12018 len. 13]: `` As you say , it 's not a pleasant subject . ''
Parsing [sent. 12019 len. 12]: Richard spoke with the same shade crossing his face as before .
Parsing [sent. 12020 len. 11]: `` Let it go to the four winds for to-night .
Parsing [sent. 12021 len. 2]: Puff !
Parsing [sent. 12022 len. 2]: Gone !
Parsing [sent. 12023 len. 9]: Who do you suppose is with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12024 len. 11]: `` Was it Mr. Skimpole 's voice I heard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12025 len. 6]: `` That 's the man !
Parsing [sent. 12026 len. 8]: He does me more good than anybody .
Parsing [sent. 12027 len. 8]: What a fascinating child it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12028 len. 13]: I asked Richard if any one knew of their coming down together .
Parsing [sent. 12029 len. 7]: He answered , no , nobody .
Parsing [sent. 12030 len. 65]: He had been to call upon the dear old infant -- so he called Mr. Skimpole -- and the dear old infant had told him where we were , and he had told the dear old infant he was bent on coming to see us , and the dear old infant had directly wanted to come too ; and so he had brought him .
Parsing [sent. 12031 len. 24]: `` And he is worth -- not to say his sordid expenses -- but thrice his weight in gold , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12032 len. 8]: `` He is such a cheery fellow .
Parsing [sent. 12033 len. 5]: No worldliness about him .
Parsing [sent. 12034 len. 5]: Fresh and green-hearted ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12035 len. 29]: I certainly did not see the proof of Mr. Skimpole 's worldliness in his having his expenses paid by Richard , but I made no remark about that .
Parsing [sent. 12036 len. 10]: Indeed , he came in and turned our conversation .
Parsing [sent. 12037 len. 113]: He was charmed to see me , said he had been shedding delicious tears of joy and sympathy at intervals for six weeks on my account , had never been so happy as in hearing of my progress , began to understand the mixture of good and evil in the world now , felt that he appreciated health the more when somebody else was ill , did n't know but what it might be in the scheme of things that A should squint to make B happier in looking straight or that C should carry a wooden leg to make D better satisfied with his flesh and blood in a silk stocking .
Parsing [sent. 12038 len. 37]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , here is our friend Richard , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` full of the brightest visions of the future , which he evokes out of the darkness of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 12039 len. 15]: Now that 's delightful , that 's inspiriting , that 's full of poetry !
Parsing [sent. 12040 len. 25]: In old times the woods and solitudes were made joyous to the shepherd by the imaginary piping and dancing of Pan and the nymphs .
Parsing [sent. 12041 len. 34]: This present shepherd , our pastoral Richard , brightens the dull Inns of Court by making Fortune and her train sport through them to the melodious notes of a judgment from the bench .
Parsing [sent. 12042 len. 8]: That 's very pleasant , you know !
Parsing [sent. 12043 len. 21]: Some ill-conditioned growling fellow may say to me , ` What 's the use of these legal and equitable abuses ?
Parsing [sent. 12044 len. 7]: How do you defend them ? '
Parsing [sent. 12045 len. 22]: I reply , ` My growling friend , I DO N'T defend them , but they are very agreeable to me .
Parsing [sent. 12046 len. 23]: There is a shepherd -- youth , a friend of mine , who transmutes them into something highly fascinating to my simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 12047 len. 43]: I do n't say it is for this that they exist -- for I am a child among you worldly grumblers , and not called upon to account to you or myself for anything -- but it may be so . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 12048 len. 17]: I began seriously to think that Richard could scarcely have found a worse friend than this .
Parsing [sent. 12049 len. 42]: It made me uneasy that at such a time when he most required some right principle and purpose he should have this captivating looseness and putting-off of everything , this airy dispensing with all principle and purpose , at his elbow .
Parsing [sent. 12050 len. 88]: I thought I could understand how such a nature as my guardian 's , experienced in the world and forced to contemplate the miserable evasions and contentions of the family misfortune , found an immense relief in Mr. Skimpole 's avowal of his weaknesses and display of guileless candour ; but I could not satisfy myself that it was as artless as it seemed or that it did not serve Mr. Skimpole 's idle turn quite as well as any other part , and with less trouble .
Parsing [sent. 12051 len. 41]: They both walked back with me , and Mr. Skimpole leaving us at the gate , I walked softly in with Richard and said , `` Ada , my love , I have brought a gentleman to visit you . ''
Parsing [sent. 12052 len. 12]: It was not difficult to read the blushing , startled face .
Parsing [sent. 12053 len. 15]: She loved him dearly , and he knew it , and I knew it .
Parsing [sent. 12054 len. 13]: It was a very transparent business , that meeting as cousins only .
Parsing [sent. 12055 len. 24]: I almost mistrusted myself as growing quite wicked in my suspicions , but I was not so sure that Richard loved her dearly .
Parsing [sent. 12056 len. 42]: He admired her very much -- any one must have done that -- and I dare say would have renewed their youthful engagement with great pride and ardour but that he knew how she would respect her promise to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 12057 len. 40]: Still I had a tormenting idea that the influence upon him extended even here , that he was postponing his best truth and earnestness in this as in all things until Jarndyce and Jarndyce should be off his mind .
Parsing [sent. 12058 len. 3]: Ah me !
Parsing [sent. 12059 len. 15]: What Richard would have been without that blight , I never shall know now !
Parsing [sent. 12060 len. 68]: He told Ada , in his most ingenuous way , that he had not come to make any secret inroad on the terms she had accepted -LRB- rather too implicitly and confidingly , he thought -RRB- from Mr. Jarndyce , that he had come openly to see her and to see me and to justify himself for the present terms on which he stood with Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12061 len. 39]: As the dear old infant would be with us directly , he begged that I would make an appointment for the morning , when he might set himself right through the means of an unreserved conversation with me .
Parsing [sent. 12062 len. 18]: I proposed to walk with him in the park at seven o'clock , and this was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 12063 len. 13]: Mr. Skimpole soon afterwards appeared and made us merry for an hour .
Parsing [sent. 12064 len. 71]: He particularly requested to see little Coavinses -LRB- meaning Charley -RRB- and told her , with a patriarchal air , that he had given her late father all the business in his power and that if one of her little brothers would make haste to get set up in the same profession , he hoped he should still be able to put a good deal of employment in his way .
Parsing [sent. 12065 len. 38]: `` For I am constantly being taken in these nets , '' said Mr. Skimpole , looking beamingly at us over a glass of wine-and-water , `` and am constantly being bailed out -- like a boat .
Parsing [sent. 12066 len. 10]: Or paid off -- like a ship 's company .
Parsing [sent. 12067 len. 7]: Somebody always does it for me .
Parsing [sent. 12068 len. 16]: I ca n't do it , you know , for I never have any money .
Parsing [sent. 12069 len. 5]: But somebody does it .
Parsing [sent. 12070 len. 19]: I get out by somebody 's means ; I am not like the starling ; I get out .
Parsing [sent. 12071 len. 19]: If you were to ask me who somebody is , upon my word I could n't tell you .
Parsing [sent. 12072 len. 6]: Let us drink to somebody .
Parsing [sent. 12073 len. 5]: God bless him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12074 len. 26]: Richard was a little late in the morning , but I had not to wait for him long , and we turned into the park .
Parsing [sent. 12075 len. 13]: The air was bright and dewy and the sky without a cloud .
Parsing [sent. 12076 len. 77]: The birds sang delightfully ; the sparkles in the fern , the grass , and trees , were exquisite to see ; the richness of the woods seemed to have increased twenty-fold since yesterday , as if , in the still night when they had looked so massively hushed in sleep , Nature , through all the minute details of every wonderful leaf , had been more wakeful than usual for the glory of that day .
Parsing [sent. 12077 len. 14]: `` This is a lovely place , '' said Richard , looking round .
Parsing [sent. 12078 len. 12]: `` None of the jar and discord of law-suits here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12079 len. 6]: But there was other trouble .
Parsing [sent. 12080 len. 36]: `` I tell you what , my dear girl , '' said Richard , `` when I get affairs in general settled , I shall come down here , I think , and rest . ''
Parsing [sent. 12081 len. 11]: `` Would it not be better to rest now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12082 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 12083 len. 27]: `` Oh , as to resting NOW , '' said Richard , `` or as to doing anything very definite NOW , that 's not easy .
Parsing [sent. 12084 len. 18]: In short , it ca n't be done ; I ca n't do it at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 12085 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12086 len. 10]: said I. `` You know why not , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 12087 len. 56]: If you were living in an unfinished house , liable to have the roof put on or taken off -- to be from top to bottom pulled down or built up -- to-morrow , next day , next week , next month , next year -- you would find it hard to rest or settle .
Parsing [sent. 12088 len. 5]: So do I. Now ?
Parsing [sent. 12089 len. 9]: There 's no now for us suitors . ''
Parsing [sent. 12090 len. 28]: I could almost have believed in the attraction on which my poor little wandering friend had expatiated when I saw again the darkened look of last night .
Parsing [sent. 12091 len. 18]: Terrible to think it bad in it also a shade of that unfortunate man who had died .
Parsing [sent. 12092 len. 20]: `` My dear Richard , '' said I , `` this is a bad beginning of our conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 12093 len. 13]: `` I knew you would tell me so , Dame Durden . ''
Parsing [sent. 12094 len. 9]: `` And not I alone , dear Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12095 len. 21]: It was not I who cautioned you once never to found a hope or expectation on the family curse . ''
Parsing [sent. 12096 len. 10]: `` There you come back to John Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12097 len. 4]: said Richard impatiently .
Parsing [sent. 12098 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 12099 len. 28]: We must approach him sooner or later , for he is the staple of what I have to say , and it 's as well at once .
Parsing [sent. 12100 len. 11]: My dear Esther , how can you be so blind ?
Parsing [sent. 12101 len. 48]: Do n't you see that he is an interested party and that it may be very well for him to wish me to know nothing of the suit , and care nothing about it , but that it may not be quite so well for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12102 len. 63]: `` Oh , Richard , '' I remonstrated , `` is it possible that you can ever have seen him and heard him , that you can ever have lived under his roof and known him , and can yet breathe , even to me in this solitary place where there is no one to hear us , such unworthy suspicions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12103 len. 15]: He reddened deeply , as if his natural generosity felt a pang of reproach .
Parsing [sent. 12104 len. 50]: He was silent for a little while before he replied in a subdued voice , `` Esther , I am sure you know that I am not a mean fellow and that I have some sense of suspicion and distrust being poor qualities in one of my years . ''
Parsing [sent. 12105 len. 20]: `` I know it very well , '' said I. `` I am not more sure of anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 12106 len. 22]: `` That 's a dear girl , '' retorted Richard , `` and like you , because it gives me comfort .
Parsing [sent. 12107 len. 35]: I had need to get some scrap of comfort out of all this business , for it 's a bad one at the best , as I have no occasion to tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 12108 len. 21]: `` I know perfectly , '' said I. `` I know as well , Richard -- what shall I say ?
Parsing [sent. 12109 len. 15]: as well as you do -- that such misconstructions are foreign to your nature .
Parsing [sent. 12110 len. 16]: And I know , as well as you know , what so changes it . ''
Parsing [sent. 12111 len. 26]: `` Come , sister , come , '' said Richard a little more gaily , `` you will be fair with me at all events .
Parsing [sent. 12112 len. 15]: If I have the misfortune to be under that influence , so has he .
Parsing [sent. 12113 len. 17]: If it has a little twisted me , it may have a little twisted him too .
Parsing [sent. 12114 len. 26]: I do n't say that he is not an honourable man , out of all this complication and uncertainty ; I am sure he is .
Parsing [sent. 12115 len. 5]: But it taints everybody .
Parsing [sent. 12116 len. 6]: You know it taints everybody .
Parsing [sent. 12117 len. 9]: You have heard him say so fifty times .
Parsing [sent. 12118 len. 7]: Then why should HE escape ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12119 len. 27]: `` Because , '' said I , `` his is an uncommon character , and he has resolutely kept himself outside the circle , Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 12120 len. 8]: `` Oh , because and because ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12121 len. 7]: replied Richard in his vivacious way .
Parsing [sent. 12122 len. 24]: `` I am not sure , my dear girl , but that it may be wise and specious to preserve that outward indifference .
Parsing [sent. 12123 len. 40]: It may cause other parties interested to become lax about their interests ; and people may die off , and points may drag themselves out of memory , and many things may smoothly happen that are convenient enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 12124 len. 22]: I was so touched with pity for Richard that I could not reproach him any more , even by a look .
Parsing [sent. 12125 len. 22]: I remembered my guardian 's gentleness towards his errors and with what perfect freedom from resentment he had spoken of them .
Parsing [sent. 12126 len. 26]: `` Esther , '' Richard resumed , `` you are not to suppose that I have come here to make underhanded charges against John Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12127 len. 8]: I have only come to justify myself .
Parsing [sent. 12128 len. 54]: What I say is , it was all very well and we got on very well while I was a boy , utterly regardless of this same suit ; but as soon as I began to take an interest in it and to look into it , then it was quite another thing .
Parsing [sent. 12129 len. 30]: Then John Jarndyce discovers that Ada and I must break off and that if I do n't amend that very objectionable course , I am not fit for her .
Parsing [sent. 12130 len. 38]: Now , Esther , I do n't mean to amend that very objectionable course : I will not hold John Jarndyce 's favour on those unfair terms of compromise , which he has no right to dictate .
Parsing [sent. 12131 len. 17]: Whether it pleases him or displeases him , I must maintain my rights and Ada 's .
Parsing [sent. 12132 len. 21]: I have been thinking about it a good deal , and this is the conclusion I have come to . ''
Parsing [sent. 12133 len. 4]: Poor dear Richard !
Parsing [sent. 12134 len. 11]: He had indeed been thinking about it a good deal .
Parsing [sent. 12135 len. 15]: His face , his voice , his manner , all showed that too plainly .
Parsing [sent. 12136 len. 37]: `` So I tell him honourably -LRB- you are to know I have written to him about all this -RRB- that we are at issue and that we had better be at issue openly than covertly .
Parsing [sent. 12137 len. 21]: I thank him for his goodwill and his protection , and he goes his road , and I go mine .
Parsing [sent. 12138 len. 11]: The fact is , our roads are not the same .
Parsing [sent. 12139 len. 16]: Under one of the wills in dispute , I should take much more than he .
Parsing [sent. 12140 len. 27]: I do n't mean to say that it is the one to be established , but there it is , and it has its chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 12141 len. 22]: `` I have not to learn from you , my dear Richard , '' said I , `` of your letter .
Parsing [sent. 12142 len. 14]: I had heard of it already without an offended or angry word . ''
Parsing [sent. 12143 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12144 len. 5]: replied Richard , softening .
Parsing [sent. 12145 len. 19]: `` I am glad I said he was an honourable man , out of all this wretched affair .
Parsing [sent. 12146 len. 11]: But I always say that and have never doubted it .
Parsing [sent. 12147 len. 32]: Now , my dear Esther , I know these views of mine appear extremely harsh to you , and will to Ada when you tell her what has passed between us .
Parsing [sent. 12148 len. 60]: But if you had gone into the case as I have , if you had only applied yourself to the papers as I did when I was at Kenge 's , if you only knew what an accumulation of charges and counter-charges , and suspicions and cross-suspicions , they involve , you would think me moderate in comparison . ''
Parsing [sent. 12149 len. 29]: `` Perhaps so , '' said I. `` But do you think that , among those many papers , there is much truth and justice , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12150 len. 46]: `` There is truth and justice somewhere in the case , Esther -- '' `` Or was once , long ago , '' said I. `` Is -- is -- must be somewhere , '' pursued Richard impetuously , `` and must be brought out .
Parsing [sent. 12151 len. 20]: To allow Ada to be made a bribe and hush-money of is not the way to bring it out .
Parsing [sent. 12152 len. 28]: You say the suit is changing me ; John Jarndyce says it changes , has changed , and will change everybody who has any share in it .
Parsing [sent. 12153 len. 25]: Then the greater right I have on my side when I resolve to do all I can to bring it to an end . ''
Parsing [sent. 12154 len. 7]: `` All you can , Richard !
Parsing [sent. 12155 len. 16]: Do you think that in these many years no others have done all they could ?
Parsing [sent. 12156 len. 12]: Has the difficulty grown easier because of so many failures ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12157 len. 27]: `` It ca n't last for ever , '' returned Richard with a fierceness kindling in him which again presented to me that last sad reminder .
Parsing [sent. 12158 len. 18]: `` I am young and earnest , and energy and determination have done wonders many a time .
Parsing [sent. 12159 len. 9]: Others have only half thrown themselves into it .
Parsing [sent. 12160 len. 6]: I devote myself to it .
Parsing [sent. 12161 len. 10]: I make it the object of my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 12162 len. 19]: `` Oh , Richard , my dear , so much the worse , so much the worse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12163 len. 20]: `` No , no , no , do n't you be afraid for me , '' he returned affectionately .
Parsing [sent. 12164 len. 21]: `` You 're a dear , good , wise , quiet , blessed girl ; but you have your prepossessions .
Parsing [sent. 12165 len. 8]: So I come round to John Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12166 len. 30]: I tell you , my good Esther , when he and I were on those terms which he found so convenient , we were not on natural terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 12167 len. 12]: `` Are division and animosity your natural terms , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12168 len. 9]: `` No , I do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 12169 len. 19]: I mean that all this business puts us on unnatural terms , with which natural relations are incompatible .
Parsing [sent. 12170 len. 8]: See another reason for urging it on !
Parsing [sent. 12171 len. 17]: I may find out when it 's over that I have been mistaken in John Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12172 len. 23]: My head may be clearer when I am free of it , and I may then agree with what you say to-day .
Parsing [sent. 12173 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 12174 len. 11]: Then I shall acknowledge it and make him reparation . ''
Parsing [sent. 12175 len. 7]: Everything postponed to that imaginary time !
Parsing [sent. 12176 len. 9]: Everything held in confusion and indecision until then !
Parsing [sent. 12177 len. 46]: `` Now , my best of confidantes , '' said Richard , `` I want my cousin Ada to understand that I am not captious , fickle , and wilful about John Jarndyce , but that I have this purpose and reason at my back .
Parsing [sent. 12178 len. 106]: I wish to represent myself to her through you , because she has a great esteem and respect for her cousin John ; and I know you will soften the course I take , even though you disapprove of it ; and -- and in short , '' said Richard , who had been hesitating through these words , `` I -- I do n't like to represent myself in this litigious , contentious , doubting character to a confiding girl like Ada , '' I told him that he was more like himself in those latter words than in anything he had said yet .
Parsing [sent. 12179 len. 17]: `` Why , '' acknowledged Richard , `` that may be true enough , my love .
Parsing [sent. 12180 len. 8]: I rather feel it to be so .
Parsing [sent. 12181 len. 13]: But I shall be able to give myself fair-play by and by .
Parsing [sent. 12182 len. 16]: I shall come all right again , then , do n't you be afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 12183 len. 14]: I asked him if this were all he wished me to tell Ada .
Parsing [sent. 12184 len. 8]: `` Not quite , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12185 len. 50]: `` I am bound not to withhold from her that John Jarndyce answered my letter in his usual manner , addressing me as ` My dear Rick , ' trying to argue me out of my opinions , and telling me that they should make no difference in him .
Parsing [sent. 12186 len. 14]: -LRB- All very well of course , but not altering the case . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12187 len. 83]: I also want Ada to know that if I see her seldom just now , I am looking after her interests as well as my own -- we two being in the same boat exactly -- and that I hope she will not suppose from any flying rumours she may hear that I am at all light-headed or imprudent ; on the contrary , I am always looking forward to the termination of the suit , and always planning in that direction .
Parsing [sent. 12188 len. 45]: Being of age now and having taken the step I have taken , I consider myself free from any accountability to John Jarndyce ; but Ada being still a ward of the court , I do n't yet ask her to renew our engagement .
Parsing [sent. 12189 len. 29]: When she is free to act for herself , I shall be myself once more and we shall both be in very different worldly circumstances , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 12190 len. 45]: If you tell her all this with the advantage of your considerate way , you will do me a very great and a very kind service , my dear Esther ; and I shall knock Jarndyce and Jarndyce on the head with greater vigour .
Parsing [sent. 12191 len. 12]: Of course I ask for no secrecy at Bleak House . ''
Parsing [sent. 12192 len. 27]: `` Richard , '' said I , `` you place great confidence in me , but I fear you will not take advice from me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12193 len. 15]: `` It 's impossible that I can on this subject , my dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 12194 len. 7]: On any other , readily . ''
Parsing [sent. 12195 len. 10]: As if there were any other in his life !
Parsing [sent. 12196 len. 14]: As if his whole career and character were not being dyed one colour !
Parsing [sent. 12197 len. 12]: `` But I may ask you a question , Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12198 len. 11]: `` I think so , '' said he , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 12199 len. 15]: `` I do n't know who may not , if you may not . ''
Parsing [sent. 12200 len. 16]: `` You say , yourself , you are not leading a very settled life . ''
Parsing [sent. 12201 len. 14]: `` How can I , my dear Esther , with nothing settled ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12202 len. 8]: `` Are you in debt again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12203 len. 17]: `` Why , of course I am , '' said Richard , astonished at my simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 12204 len. 7]: `` Is it of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12205 len. 7]: `` My dear child , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 12206 len. 13]: I ca n't throw myself into an object so completely without expense .
Parsing [sent. 12207 len. 22]: You forget , or perhaps you do n't know , that under either of the wills Ada and I take something .
Parsing [sent. 12208 len. 13]: It 's only a question between the larger sum and the smaller .
Parsing [sent. 12209 len. 9]: I shall be within the mark any way .
Parsing [sent. 12210 len. 24]: Bless your heart , my excellent girl , '' said Richard , quite amused with me , `` I shall be all right !
Parsing [sent. 12211 len. 9]: I shall pull through , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12212 len. 54]: I felt so deeply sensible of the danger in which he stood that I tried , in Ada 's name , in my guardian 's , in my own , by every fervent means that I could think of , to warn him of it and to show him some of his mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 12213 len. 22]: He received everything I said with patience and gentleness , but it all rebounded from him without taking the least effect .
Parsing [sent. 12214 len. 30]: I could not wonder at this after the reception his preoccupied mind had given to my guardian 's letter , but I determined to try Ada 's influence yet .
Parsing [sent. 12215 len. 55]: So when our walk brought us round to the village again , and I went home to breakfast , I prepared Ada for the account I was going to give her and told her exactly what reason we had to dread that Richard was losing himself and scattering his whole life to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 12216 len. 38]: It made her very unhappy , of course , though she had a far , far greater reliance on his correcting his errors than I could have -- which was so natural and loving in my dear !
Parsing [sent. 12217 len. 26]: -- and she presently wrote him this little letter : My dearest cousin , Esther has told me all you said to her this morning .
Parsing [sent. 12218 len. 64]: I write this to repeat most earnestly for myself all that she said to you and to let you know how sure I am that you will sooner or later find our cousin John a pattern of truth , sincerity , and goodness , when you will deeply , deeply grieve to have done him -LRB- without intending it -RRB- so much wrong .
Parsing [sent. 12219 len. 27]: I do not quite know how to write what I wish to say next , but I trust you will understand it as I mean it .
Parsing [sent. 12220 len. 36]: I have some fears , my dearest cousin , that it may be partly for my sake you are now laying up so much unhappiness for yourself -- and if for yourself , for me .
Parsing [sent. 12221 len. 33]: In case this should be so , or in case you should entertain much thought of me in what you are doing , I most earnestly entreat and beg you to desist .
Parsing [sent. 12222 len. 30]: You can do nothing for my sake that will make me half so happy as for ever turning your back upon the shadow in which we both were born .
Parsing [sent. 12223 len. 10]: Do not be angry with me for saying this .
Parsing [sent. 12224 len. 51]: Pray , pray , dear Richard , for my sake , and for your own , and in a natural repugnance for that source of trouble which had its share in making us both orphans when we were very young , pray , pray , let it go for ever .
Parsing [sent. 12225 len. 31]: We have reason to know by this time that there is no good in it and no hope , that there is nothing to be got from it but sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 12226 len. 38]: My dearest cousin , it is needless for me to say that you are quite free and that it is very likely you may find some one whom you will love much better than your first fancy .
Parsing [sent. 12227 len. 92]: I am quite sure , if you will let me say so , that the object of your choice would greatly prefer to follow your fortunes far and wide , however moderate or poor , and see you happy , doing your duty and pursuing your chosen way , than to have the hope of being , or even to be , very rich with you -LRB- if such a thing were possible -RRB- at the cost of dragging years of procrastination and anxiety and of your indifference to other aims .
Parsing [sent. 12228 len. 28]: You may wonder at my saying this so confidently with so little knowledge or experience , but I know it for a certainty from my own heart .
Parsing [sent. 12229 len. 29]: Ever , my dearest cousin , your most affectionate Ada This note brought Richard to us very soon , but it made little change in him if any .
Parsing [sent. 12230 len. 25]: We would fairly try , he said , who was right and who was wrong -- he would show us -- we should see !
Parsing [sent. 12231 len. 44]: He was animated and glowing , as if Ada 's tenderness had gratified him ; but I could only hope , with a sigh , that the letter might have some stronger effect upon his mind on re-perusal than it assuredly had then .
Parsing [sent. 12232 len. 32]: As they were to remain with us that day and had taken their places to return by the coach next morning , I sought an opportunity of speaking to Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 12233 len. 23]: Our out-of-door life easily threw one in my way , and I delicately said that there was a responsibility in encouraging Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12234 len. 9]: `` Responsibility , my dear Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12235 len. 12]: he repeated , catching at the word with the pleasantest smile .
Parsing [sent. 12236 len. 14]: `` I am the last man in the world for such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 12237 len. 14]: I never was responsible in my life -- I ca n't be . ''
Parsing [sent. 12238 len. 32]: `` I am afraid everybody is obliged to be , '' said I timidly enough , he being so much older and more clever than I. `` No , really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12239 len. 16]: said Mr. Skimpole , receiving this new light with a most agreeable jocularity of surprise .
Parsing [sent. 12240 len. 11]: `` But every man 's not obliged to be solvent ?
Parsing [sent. 12241 len. 4]: I am not .
Parsing [sent. 12242 len. 4]: I never was .
Parsing [sent. 12243 len. 28]: See , my dear Miss Summerson , '' he took a handful of loose silver and halfpence from his pocket , `` there 's so much money .
Parsing [sent. 12244 len. 8]: I have not an idea how much .
Parsing [sent. 12245 len. 8]: I have not the power of counting .
Parsing [sent. 12246 len. 12]: Call it four and ninepence -- call it four pound nine .
Parsing [sent. 12247 len. 9]: They tell me I owe more than that .
Parsing [sent. 12248 len. 6]: I dare say I do .
Parsing [sent. 12249 len. 15]: I dare say I owe as much as good-natured people will let me owe .
Parsing [sent. 12250 len. 10]: If they do n't stop , why should I ?
Parsing [sent. 12251 len. 8]: There you have Harold Skimpole in little .
Parsing [sent. 12252 len. 10]: If that 's responsibility , I am responsible . ''
Parsing [sent. 12253 len. 54]: The perfect ease of manner with which he put the money up again and looked at me with a smile on his refined face , as if he had been mentioning a curious little fact about somebody else , almost made me feel as if he really had nothing to do with it .
Parsing [sent. 12254 len. 38]: `` Now , when you mention responsibility , '' he resumed , `` I am disposed to say that I never had the happiness of knowing any one whom I should consider so refreshingly responsible as yourself .
Parsing [sent. 12255 len. 12]: You appear to me to be the very touchstone of responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 12256 len. 51]: When I see you , my dear Miss Summerson , intent upon the perfect working of the whole little orderly system of which you are the centre , I feel inclined to say to myself -- in fact I do say to myself very often -- THAT 'S responsibility ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12257 len. 41]: It was difficult , after this , to explain what I meant ; but I persisted so far as to say that we all hoped he would check and not confirm Richard in the sanguine views he entertained just then .
Parsing [sent. 12258 len. 13]: `` Most willingly , '' he retorted , `` if I could .
Parsing [sent. 12259 len. 15]: But , my dear Miss Summerson , I have no art , no disguise .
Parsing [sent. 12260 len. 24]: If he takes me by the hand and leads me through Westminster Hall in an airy procession after fortune , I must go .
Parsing [sent. 12261 len. 12]: If he says , ` Skimpole , join the dance ! '
Parsing [sent. 12262 len. 5]: I must join it .
Parsing [sent. 12263 len. 16]: Common sense would n't , I know , but I have NO common sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 12264 len. 10]: It was very unfortunate for Richard , I said .
Parsing [sent. 12265 len. 7]: `` Do you think so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12266 len. 4]: returned Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 12267 len. 11]: `` Do n't say that , do n't say that .
Parsing [sent. 12268 len. 47]: Let us suppose him keeping company with Common Sense -- an excellent man -- a good deal wrinkled -- dreadfully practical -- change for a ten-pound note in every pocket -- ruled account-book in his hand -- say , upon the whole , resembling a tax-gatherer .
Parsing [sent. 12269 len. 64]: Our dear Richard , sanguine , ardent , overleaping obstacles , bursting with poetry like a young bud , says to this highly respectable companion , ' I see a golden prospect before me ; it 's very bright , it 's very beautiful , it 's very joyous ; here I go , bounding over the landscape to come at it ! '
Parsing [sent. 12270 len. 44]: The respectable companion instantly knocks him down with the ruled account-book ; tells him in a literal , prosaic way that he sees no such thing ; shows him it 's nothing but fees , fraud , horsehair wigs , and black gowns .
Parsing [sent. 12271 len. 23]: Now you know that 's a painful change -- sensible in the last degree , I have no doubt , but disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 12272 len. 6]: I ca n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 12273 len. 34]: I have n't got the ruled account-book , I have none of the tax-gatherlng elements in my composition , I am not at all respectable , and I do n't want to be .
Parsing [sent. 12274 len. 9]: Odd perhaps , but so it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12275 len. 34]: It was idle to say more , so I proposed that we should join Ada and Richard , who were a little in advance , and I gave up Mr. Skimpole in despair .
Parsing [sent. 12276 len. 22]: He had been over the Hall in the course of the morning and whimsically described the family pictures as we walked .
Parsing [sent. 12277 len. 28]: There were such portentous shepherdesses among the Ladies Dedlock dead and gone , he told us , that peaceful crooks became weapons of assault in their hands .
Parsing [sent. 12278 len. 30]: They tended their flocks severely in buckram and powder and put their sticking-plaster patches on to terrify commoners as the chiefs of some other tribes put on their war-paint .
Parsing [sent. 12279 len. 58]: There was a Sir Somebody Dedlock , with a battle , a sprung-mine , volumes of smoke , flashes of lightning , a town on fire , and a stormed fort , all in full action between his horse 's two hind legs , showing , he supposed , how little a Dedlock made of such trifles .
Parsing [sent. 12280 len. 56]: The whole race he represented as having evidently been , in life , what he called `` stuffed people '' -- a large collection , glassy eyed , set up in the most approved manner on their various twigs and perches , very correct , perfectly free from animation , and always in glass cases .
Parsing [sent. 12281 len. 43]: I was not so easy now during any reference to the name but that I felt it a relief when Richard , with an exclamation of surprise , hurried away to meet a stranger whom he first descried coming slowly towards us .
Parsing [sent. 12282 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12283 len. 4]: said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 12284 len. 4]: `` Vholes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12285 len. 11]: We asked if that were a friend of Richard 's .
Parsing [sent. 12286 len. 11]: `` Friend and legal adviser , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 12287 len. 35]: `` Now , my dear Miss Summerson , if you want common sense , responsibility , and respectability , all united -- if you want an exemplary man -- Vholes is THE man . ''
Parsing [sent. 12288 len. 19]: We had not known , we said , that Richard was assisted by any gentleman of that name .
Parsing [sent. 12289 len. 31]: `` When he emerged from legal infancy , '' returned Mr. Skimpole , `` he parted from our conversational friend Kenge and took up , I believe , with Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12290 len. 15]: Indeed , I know he did , because I introduced him to Vholes . ''
Parsing [sent. 12291 len. 8]: `` Had you known him long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12292 len. 3]: asked Ada .
Parsing [sent. 12293 len. 3]: `` Vholes ?
Parsing [sent. 12294 len. 25]: My dear Miss Clare , I had had that kind of acquaintance with him which I have had with several gentlemen of his profession .
Parsing [sent. 12295 len. 34]: He had done something or other in a very agreeable , civil manner -- taken proceedings , I think , is the expression -- which ended in the proceeding of his taking ME .
Parsing [sent. 12296 len. 61]: Somebody was so good as to step in and pay the money -- something and fourpence was the amount ; I forget the pounds and shillings , but I know it ended with fourpence , because it struck me at the time as being so odd that I could owe anybody fourpence -- and after that I brought them together .
Parsing [sent. 12297 len. 12]: Vholes asked me for the introduction , and I gave it .
Parsing [sent. 12298 len. 31]: Now I come to think of it , '' he looked inquiringly at us with his frankest smile as he made the discovery , `` Vholes bribed me , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 12299 len. 9]: He gave me something and called it commission .
Parsing [sent. 12300 len. 6]: Was it a five-pound note ?
Parsing [sent. 12301 len. 15]: Do you know , I think it MUST have been a five-pound note ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12302 len. 64]: His further consideration of the point was prevented by Richard 's coming back to us in an excited state and hastily representing Mr. Vholes -- a sallow man with pinched lips that looked as if they were cold , a red eruption here and there upon his face , tall and thin , about fifty years of age , high-shouldered , and stooping .
Parsing [sent. 12303 len. 36]: Dressed in black , black-gloved , and buttoned to the chin , there was nothing so remarkable in him as a lifeless manner and a slow , fixed way he had of looking at Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12304 len. 32]: `` I hope I do n't disturb you , ladies , '' said Mr. Vholes , and now I observed that he was further remarkable for an inward manner of speaking .
Parsing [sent. 12305 len. 65]: `` I arranged with Mr. Carstone that he should always know when his cause was in the Chancelor 's paper , and being informed by one of my clerks last night after post time that it stood , rather unexpectedly , in the paper for to-morrow , I put myself into the coach early this morning and came down to confer with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 12306 len. 31]: `` Yes , '' said Richard , flushed , and looking triumphantly at Ada and me , `` we do n't do these things in the old slow way now .
Parsing [sent. 12307 len. 5]: We spin along now !
Parsing [sent. 12308 len. 29]: Mr. Vholes , we must hire something to get over to the post town in , and catch the mail to-night , and go up by it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12309 len. 12]: `` Anything you please , sir , '' returned Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12310 len. 9]: `` I am quite at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 12311 len. 14]: `` Let me see , '' said Richard , looking at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 12312 len. 41]: `` If I run down to the Dedlock , and get my portmanteau fastened up , and order a gig , or a chaise , or whatever 's to be got , we shall have an hour then before starting .
Parsing [sent. 12313 len. 7]: I 'll come back to tea .
Parsing [sent. 12314 len. 18]: Cousin Ada , will you and Esther take care of Mr. Vholes when I am gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12315 len. 21]: He was away directly , in his heat and hurry , and was soon lost in the dusk of evening .
Parsing [sent. 12316 len. 10]: We who were left walked on towards the house .
Parsing [sent. 12317 len. 12]: `` Is Mr. Carstone 's presence necessary to-morrow , Sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12318 len. 10]: said I. `` Can it do any good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12319 len. 10]: `` No , miss , '' Mr. Vholes replied .
Parsing [sent. 12320 len. 10]: `` I am not aware that it can . ''
Parsing [sent. 12321 len. 19]: Both Ada and I expressed our regret that he should go , then , only to be disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 12322 len. 45]: `` Mr. Carstone has laid down the principle of watching his own interests , '' said Mr. Vholes , `` and when a client lays down his own principle , and it is not immoral , it devolves upon me to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 12323 len. 10]: I wish in business to be exact and open .
Parsing [sent. 12324 len. 34]: I am a widower with three daughters -- Emma , Jane , and Caroline -- and my desire is so to discharge the duties of life as to leave them a good name .
Parsing [sent. 12325 len. 11]: This appears to be a pleasant spot , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 12326 len. 25]: The remark being made to me in consequence of my being next him as we walked , I assented and enumerated its chief attractions .
Parsing [sent. 12327 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12328 len. 4]: said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12329 len. 28]: `` I have the privilege of supporting an aged father in the Vale of Taunton -- his native place -- and I admire that country very much .
Parsing [sent. 12330 len. 12]: I had no idea there was anything so attractive here . ''
Parsing [sent. 12331 len. 21]: To keep up the conversation , I asked Mr. Vholes if he would like to live altogether in the country .
Parsing [sent. 12332 len. 18]: `` There , miss , '' said he , `` you touch me on a tender string .
Parsing [sent. 12333 len. 65]: My health is not good -LRB- my digestion being much impaired -RRB- , and if I had only myself to consider , I should take refuge in rural habits , especially as the cares of business have prevented me from ever coming much into contact with general society , and particularly with ladies ' society , which I have most wished to mix in .
Parsing [sent. 12334 len. 26]: But with my three daughters , Emma , Jane , and Caroline -- and my aged father -- I can not afford to be selfish .
Parsing [sent. 12335 len. 37]: It is true I have no longer to maintain a dear grandmother who died in her hundred and second year , but enough remains to render it indispensable that the mill should be always going . ''
Parsing [sent. 12336 len. 18]: It required some attention to hear him on account of his inward speaking and his lifeless manner .
Parsing [sent. 12337 len. 14]: `` You will excuse my having mentioned my daughters , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 12338 len. 7]: `` They are my weak point .
Parsing [sent. 12339 len. 19]: I wish to leave the poor girls some little independence , as well as a good name . ''
Parsing [sent. 12340 len. 20]: We now arrived at Mr. Boythorn 's house , where the tea-table , all prepared , was awaiting us .
Parsing [sent. 12341 len. 23]: Richard came in restless and hurried shortly afterwards , and leaning over Mr. Vholes 's chair , whispered something in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 12342 len. 30]: Mr. Vholes replied aloud -- or as nearly aloud I suppose as he had ever replied to anything -- `` You will drive me , will you , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 12343 len. 10]: It is all the same to me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12344 len. 4]: Anything you please .
Parsing [sent. 12345 len. 8]: I am quite at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 12346 len. 27]: We understood from what followed that Mr. Skimpole was to be left until the morning to occupy the two places which had been already paid for .
Parsing [sent. 12347 len. 47]: As Ada and I were both in low spirits concerning Richard and very sorry so to part with him , we made it as plain as we politely could that we should leave Mr. Skimpole to the Dedlock Arms and retire when the night-travellers were gone .
Parsing [sent. 12348 len. 57]: Richard 's high spirits carrying everything before them , we all went out together to the top of the hill above the village , where he had ordered a gig to wait and where we found a man with a lantern standing at the head of the gaunt pale horse that had been harnessed to it .
Parsing [sent. 12349 len. 57]: I never shall forget those two seated side by side in the lantern 's light , Richard all flush and fire and laughter , with the reins in his hand ; Mr. Vholes quite still , black-gloved , and buttoned up , looking at him as if he were looking at his prey and charming it .
Parsing [sent. 12350 len. 51]: I have before me the whole picture of the warm dark night , the summer lightning , the dusty track of road closed in by hedgerows and high trees , the gaunt pale horse with his ears pricked up , and the driving away at speed to Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12351 len. 94]: My dear girl told me that night how Richard 's being thereafter prosperous or ruined , befriended or deserted , could only make this difference to her , that the more he needed love from one unchanging heart , the more love that unchanging heart would have to give him ; how he thought of her through his present errors , and she would think of him at all times -- never of herself if she could devote herself to him , never of her own delights if she could minister to his .
Parsing [sent. 12352 len. 6]: And she kept her word ?
Parsing [sent. 12353 len. 50]: I look along the road before me , where the distance already shortens and the journey 's end is growing visible ; and true and good above the dead sea of the Chancery suit and all the ashy fruit it cast ashore , I think I see my darling .
Parsing [sent. 12354 len. 30]: Chapter XXXVIII -- A Struggle When our time came for returning to Bleak House again , we were punctual to the day and were received with an overpowering welcome .
Parsing [sent. 12355 len. 40]: I was perfectly restored to health and strength , and finding my housekeeping keys laid ready for me in my room , rang myself in as if I had been a new year , with a merry little peal .
Parsing [sent. 12356 len. 41]: `` Once more , duty , duty , Esther , '' said I ; `` and if you are not overjoyed to do it , more than cheerfully and contentedly , through anything and everything , you ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 12357 len. 14]: That 's all I have to say to you , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12358 len. 62]: The first few mornings were mornings of so much bustle and business , devoted to such settlements of accounts , such repeated journeys to and fro between the growlery and all other parts of the house , so many rearrangements of drawers and presses , and such a general new beginning altogether , that I had not a moment 's leisure .
Parsing [sent. 12359 len. 45]: But when these arrangements were completed and everything was in order , I paid a visit of a few hours to London , which something in the letter I had destroyed at Chesney Wold had induced me to decide upon in my own mind .
Parsing [sent. 12360 len. 44]: I made Caddy Jellyby -- her maiden name was so natural to me that I always called her by it -- the pretext for this visit and wrote her a note previously asking the favour of her company on a little business expedition .
Parsing [sent. 12361 len. 30]: Leaving home very early in the morning , I got to London by stage-coach in such good time that I got to Newman Street with the day before me .
Parsing [sent. 12362 len. 31]: Caddy , who had not seen me since her wedding-day , was so glad and so affectionate that I was half inclined to fear I should make her husband jealous .
Parsing [sent. 12363 len. 38]: But he was , in his way , just as bad -- I mean as good ; and in short it was the old story , and nobody would leave me any possibility of doing anything meritorious .
Parsing [sent. 12364 len. 49]: The elder Mr. Turveydrop was in bed , I found , and Caddy was milling his chocolate , which a melancholy little boy who was an apprentice -- it seemed such a curious thing to be apprenticed to the trade of dancing -- was waiting to carry upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 12365 len. 19]: Her father-in-law was extremely kind and considerate , Caddy told me , and they lived most happily together .
Parsing [sent. 12366 len. 49]: -LRB- When she spoke of their living together , she meant that the old gentleman had all the good things and all the good lodging , while she and her husband had what they could get , and were poked into two corner rooms over the Mews . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 12367 len. 10]: `` And how is your mama , Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12368 len. 28]: said I. `` Why , I hear of her , Esther , '' replied Caddy , `` through Pa , but I see very little of her .
Parsing [sent. 12369 len. 37]: We are good friends , I am glad to say , but Ma thinks there is something absurd in my having married a dancing-master , and she is rather afraid of its extending to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 12370 len. 51]: It struck me that if Mrs. Jellyby had discharged her own natural duties and obligations before she swept the horizon with a telescope in search of others , she would have taken the best precautions against becoming absurd , but I need scarcely observe that I kept this to myself .
Parsing [sent. 12371 len. 8]: `` And your papa , Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12372 len. 32]: `` He comes here every evening , '' returned Caddy , `` and is so fond of sitting in the corner there that it 's a treat to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 12373 len. 19]: Looking at the corner , I plainly perceived the mark of Mr. Jellyby 's head against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 12374 len. 15]: It was consolatory to know that he had found such a resting-place for it .
Parsing [sent. 12375 len. 22]: `` And you , Caddy , '' said I , `` you are always busy , I 'll be bound ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12376 len. 31]: `` Well , my dear , '' returned Caddy , `` I am indeed , for to tell you a grand secret , I am qualifying myself to give lessons .
Parsing [sent. 12377 len. 17]: Prince 's health is not strong , and I want to be able to assist him .
Parsing [sent. 12378 len. 28]: What with schools , and classes here , and private pupils , AND the apprentices , he really has too much to do , poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12379 len. 22]: The notion of the apprentices was still so odd to me that I asked Caddy if there were many of them .
Parsing [sent. 12380 len. 7]: `` Four , '' said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 12381 len. 8]: `` One in-door , and three out .
Parsing [sent. 12382 len. 24]: They are very good children ; only when they get together they WILL play -- children-like -- instead of attending to their work .
Parsing [sent. 12383 len. 31]: So the little boy you saw just now waltzes by himself in the empty kitchen , and we distribute the others over the house as well as we can . ''
Parsing [sent. 12384 len. 12]: `` That is only for their steps , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12385 len. 12]: said I. `` Only for their steps , '' said Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 12386 len. 22]: `` In that way they practise , so many hours at a time , whatever steps they happen to be upon .
Parsing [sent. 12387 len. 21]: They dance in the academy , and at this time of year we do figures at five every morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 12388 len. 9]: `` Why , what a laborious life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12389 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 12390 len. 72]: `` I assure you , my dear , '' returned Caddy , smiling , `` when the out-door apprentices ring us up in the morning -LRB- the bell rings into our room , not to disturb old Mr. Turveydrop -RRB- , and when I put up the window and see them standing on the door-step with their little pumps under their arms , I am actually reminded of the Sweeps . ''
Parsing [sent. 12391 len. 16]: All this presented the art to me in a singular light , to be sure .
Parsing [sent. 12392 len. 17]: Caddy enjoyed the effect of her communication and cheerfully recounted the particulars of her own studies .
Parsing [sent. 12393 len. 48]: `` You see , my dear , to save expense I ought to know something of the piano , and I ought to know something of the kit too , and consequently I have to practise those two instruments as well as the details of our profession .
Parsing [sent. 12394 len. 20]: If Ma had been like anybody else , I might have had some little musical knowledge to begin upon .
Parsing [sent. 12395 len. 26]: However , I had n't any ; and that part of the work is , at first , a little discouraging , I must allow .
Parsing [sent. 12396 len. 48]: But I have a very good ear , and I am used to drudgery -- I have to thank Ma for that , at all events -- and where there 's a will there 's a way , you know , Esther , the world over . ''
Parsing [sent. 12397 len. 24]: Saying these words , Caddy laughingly sat down at a little jingling square piano and really rattled off a quadrille with great spirit .
Parsing [sent. 12398 len. 34]: Then she good-humouredly and blushingly got up again , and while she still laughed herself , said , `` Do n't laugh at me , please ; that 's a dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12399 len. 11]: I would sooner have cried , but I did neither .
Parsing [sent. 12400 len. 11]: I encouraged her and praised her with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 12401 len. 48]: For I conscientiously believed , dancing-master 's wife though she was , and dancing-mistress though in her limited ambition she aspired to be , she had struck out a natural , wholesome , loving course of industry and perseverance that was quite as good as a mission .
Parsing [sent. 12402 len. 20]: `` My dear , '' said Caddy , delighted , `` you ca n't think how you cheer me .
Parsing [sent. 12403 len. 12]: I shall owe you , you do n't know how much .
Parsing [sent. 12404 len. 11]: What changes , Esther , even in my small world !
Parsing [sent. 12405 len. 14]: You recollect that first night , when I was so unpolite and inky ?
Parsing [sent. 12406 len. 23]: Who would have thought , then , of my ever teaching people to dance , of all other possibilities and impossibilities ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12407 len. 36]: Her husband , who had left us while we had this chat , now coming back , preparatory to exercising the apprentices in the ball-room , Caddy informed me she was quite at my disposal .
Parsing [sent. 12408 len. 27]: But it was not my time yet , I was glad to tell her , for I should have been vexed to take her away then .
Parsing [sent. 12409 len. 17]: Therefore we three adjourned to the apprentices together , and I made one in the dance .
Parsing [sent. 12410 len. 8]: The apprentices were the queerest little people .
Parsing [sent. 12411 len. 39]: Besides the melancholy boy , who , I hoped , had not been made so by waltzing alone in the empty kitchen , there were two other boys and one dirty little limp girl in a gauzy dress .
Parsing [sent. 12412 len. 35]: Such a precocious little girl , with such a dowdy bonnet on -LRB- that , too , of a gauzy texture -RRB- , who brought her sandalled shoes in an old threadbare velvet reticule .
Parsing [sent. 12413 len. 35]: Such mean little boys , when they were not dancing , with string , and marbles , and cramp-bones in their pockets , and the most untidy legs and feet -- and heels particularly .
Parsing [sent. 12414 len. 14]: I asked Caddy what had made their parents choose this profession for them .
Parsing [sent. 12415 len. 19]: Caddy said she did n't know ; perhaps they were designed for teachers , perhaps for the stage .
Parsing [sent. 12416 len. 19]: They were all people in humble circumstances , and the melancholy boy 's mother kept a ginger-beer shop .
Parsing [sent. 12417 len. 37]: We danced for an hour with great gravity , the melancholy child doing wonders with his lower extremities , in which there appeared to be some sense of enjoyment though it never rose above his waist .
Parsing [sent. 12418 len. 40]: Caddy , while she was observant of her husband and was evidently founded upon him , had acquired a grace and self-possession of her own , which , united to her pretty face and figure , was uncommonly agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 12419 len. 35]: She already relieved him of much of the instruction of these young people , and he seldom interfered except to walk his part in the figure if he had anything to do in it .
Parsing [sent. 12420 len. 6]: He always played the tune .
Parsing [sent. 12421 len. 18]: The affectation of the gauzy child , and her condescension to the boys , was a sight .
Parsing [sent. 12422 len. 10]: And thus we danced an hour by the clock .
Parsing [sent. 12423 len. 34]: When the practice was concluded , Caddy 's husband made himself ready to go out of town to a school , and Caddy ran away to get ready to go out with me .
Parsing [sent. 12424 len. 13]: I sat in the ball-room in the interval , contemplating the apprentices .
Parsing [sent. 12425 len. 31]: The two out-door boys went upon the staircase to put on their half-boots and pull the in-door boy 's hair , as I judged from the nature of his objections .
Parsing [sent. 12426 len. 31]: Returning with their jackets buttoned and their pumps stuck in them , they then produced packets of cold bread and meat and bivouacked under a painted lyre on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 12427 len. 60]: The little gauzy child , having whisked her sandals into the reticule and put on a trodden-down pair of shoes , shook her head into the dowdy bonnet at one shake , and answering my inquiry whether she liked dancing by replying , `` Not with boys , '' tied it across her chin , and went home contemptuous .
Parsing [sent. 12428 len. 33]: `` Old Mr. Turveydrop is so sorry , '' said Caddy , `` that he has not finished dressing yet and can not have the pleasure of seeing you before you go .
Parsing [sent. 12429 len. 11]: You are such a favourite of his , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 12430 len. 24]: I expressed myself much obliged to him , but did not think it necessary to add that I readily dispensed with this attention .
Parsing [sent. 12431 len. 37]: `` It takes him a long time to dress , '' said Caddy , `` because he is very much looked up to in such things , you know , and has a reputation to support .
Parsing [sent. 12432 len. 11]: You ca n't think how kind he is to Pa. .
Parsing [sent. 12433 len. 21]: He talks to Pa of an evening about the Prince Regent , and I never saw Pa so interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 12434 len. 21]: There was something in the picture of Mr. Turveydrop bestowing his deportment on Mr. Jellyby that quite took my fancy .
Parsing [sent. 12435 len. 11]: I asked Caddy if he brought her papa out much .
Parsing [sent. 12436 len. 36]: `` No , '' said Caddy , `` I do n't know that he does that , but he talks to Pa , and Pa greatly admires him , and listens , and likes it .
Parsing [sent. 12437 len. 21]: Of course I am aware that Pa has hardly any claims to deportment , but they get on together delightfully .
Parsing [sent. 12438 len. 10]: You ca n't think what good companions they make .
Parsing [sent. 12439 len. 40]: I never saw Pa take snuff before in my life , but he takes one pinch out of Mr. Turveydrop 's box regularly and keeps putting it to his nose and taking it away again all the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 12440 len. 39]: That old Mr. Turveydrop should ever , in the chances and changes of life , have come to the rescue of Mr. Jellyby from Borrioboola -- Gha appeared to me to be one of the pleasantest of oddities .
Parsing [sent. 12441 len. 52]: `` As to Peepy , '' said Caddy with a little hesitation , `` whom I was most afraid of -- next to having any family of my own , Esther -- as an inconvenience to Mr. Turveydrop , the kindness of the old gentleman to that child is beyond everything .
Parsing [sent. 12442 len. 9]: He asks to see him , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 12443 len. 43]: He lets him take the newspaper up to him in bed ; he gives him the crusts of his toast to eat ; he sends him on little errands about the house ; he tells him to come to me for sixpences .
Parsing [sent. 12444 len. 27]: In short , '' said Caddy cheerily , `` and not to prose , I am a very fortunate girl and ought to be very grateful .
Parsing [sent. 12445 len. 8]: Where are we going , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12446 len. 51]: `` To the Old Street Road , '' said I , `` where I have a few words to say to the solicitor 's clerk who was sent to meet me at the coach-office on the very day when I came to London and first saw you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 12447 len. 16]: Now I think of it , the gentleman who brought us to your house . ''
Parsing [sent. 12448 len. 21]: `` Then , indeed , I seem to be naturally the person to go with you , '' returned Caddy .
Parsing [sent. 12449 len. 19]: To the Old Street Road we went and there inquired at Mrs. Guppy 's residence for Mrs. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12450 len. 42]: Mrs. Guppy , occupying the parlours and having indeed been visibly in danger of cracking herself like a nut in the front-parlour door by peeping out before she was asked for , immediately presented herself and requested us to walk in .
Parsing [sent. 12451 len. 26]: She was an old lady in a large cap , with rather a red nose and rather an unsteady eye , but smiling all over .
Parsing [sent. 12452 len. 52]: Her close little sitting-room was prepared for a visit , and there was a portrait of her son in it which , I had almost written here , was more like than life : it insisted upon him with such obstinacy , and was so determined not to let him off .
Parsing [sent. 12453 len. 15]: Not only was the portrait there , but we found the original there too .
Parsing [sent. 12454 len. 23]: He was dressed in a great many colours and was discovered at a table reading law-papers with his forefinger to his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 12455 len. 18]: `` Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Guppy , rising , `` this is indeed an oasis .
Parsing [sent. 12456 len. 24]: Mother , will you be so good as to put a chair for the other lady and get out of the gangway . ''
Parsing [sent. 12457 len. 42]: Mrs. Guppy , whose incessant smiling gave her quite a waggish appearance , did as her son requested and then sat down in a corner , holding her pocket handkerchief to her chest , like a fomentation , with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 12458 len. 18]: I presented Caddy , and Mr. Guppy said that any friend of mine was more than welcome .
Parsing [sent. 12459 len. 10]: I then proceeded to the object of my visit .
Parsing [sent. 12460 len. 17]: `` I took the liberty of sending you a note , sir , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 12461 len. 29]: Mr. Guppy acknowledged the receipt by taking it out of his breast-pocket , putting it to his lips , and returning it to his pocket with a bow .
Parsing [sent. 12462 len. 26]: Mr. Guppy 's mother was so diverted that she rolled her head as she smiled and made a silent appeal to Caddy with her elbow .
Parsing [sent. 12463 len. 12]: `` Could I speak to you alone for a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12464 len. 20]: said I. Anything like the jocoseness of Mr. Guppy 's mother just now , I think I never saw .
Parsing [sent. 12465 len. 66]: She made no sound of laughter , but she rolled her head , and shook it , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and appealed to Caddy with her elbow , and her hand , and her shoulder , and was so unspeakably entertained altogether that it was with some difficulty she could marshal Caddy through the little folding-door into her bedroom adjoining .
Parsing [sent. 12466 len. 26]: `` Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` you will excuse the waywardness of a parent ever mindful of a son 's appiness .
Parsing [sent. 12467 len. 17]: My mother , though highly exasperating to the feelings , is actuated by maternal dictates . ''
Parsing [sent. 12468 len. 31]: I could hardly have believed that anybody could in a moment have turned so red or changed so much as Mr. Guppy did when I now put up my veil .
Parsing [sent. 12469 len. 58]: `` I asked the favour of seeing you for a few moments here , '' said I , `` in preference to calling at Mr. Kenge 's because , remembering what you said on an occasion when you spoke to me in confidence , I feared I might otherwise cause you some embarrassment , Mr. Guppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 12470 len. 13]: I caused him embarrassment enough as it was , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 12471 len. 14]: I never saw such faltering , such confusion , such amazement and apprehension .
Parsing [sent. 12472 len. 34]: `` Miss Summerson , '' stammered Mr. Guppy , `` I -- I -- beg your pardon , but in our profession -- we -- we -- find it necessary to be explicit .
Parsing [sent. 12473 len. 39]: You have referred to an occasion , miss , when I -- when I did myself the honour of making a declaration which -- '' Something seemed to rise in his throat that he could not possibly swallow .
Parsing [sent. 12474 len. 35]: He put his hand there , coughed , made faces , tried again to swallow it , coughed again , made faces again , looked all round the room , and fluttered his papers .
Parsing [sent. 12475 len. 24]: `` A kind of giddy sensation has come upon me , miss , '' he explained , `` which rather knocks me over .
Parsing [sent. 12476 len. 19]: I -- er -- a little subject to this sort of thing -- er -- by George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12477 len. 9]: I gave him a little time to recover .
Parsing [sent. 12478 len. 27]: He consumed it in putting his hand to his forehead and taking it away again , and in backing his chair into the corner behind him .
Parsing [sent. 12479 len. 26]: `` My intention was to remark , miss , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` dear me -- something bronchial , I think -- hem !
Parsing [sent. 12480 len. 19]: -- to remark that you was so good on that occasion as to repel and repudiate that declaration .
Parsing [sent. 12481 len. 11]: You -- you would n't perhaps object to admit that ?
Parsing [sent. 12482 len. 27]: Though no witnesses are present , it might be a satisfaction to -- to your mind -- if you was to put in that admission . ''
Parsing [sent. 12483 len. 28]: `` There can be no doubt , '' said I , `` that I declined your proposal without any reservation or qualification whatever , Mr. Guppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 12484 len. 18]: `` Thank you , miss , '' he returned , measuring the table with his troubled hands .
Parsing [sent. 12485 len. 13]: `` So far that 's satisfactory , and it does you credit .
Parsing [sent. 12486 len. 7]: Er -- this is certainly bronchial !
Parsing [sent. 12487 len. 61]: -- must be in the tubes -- er -- you would n't perhaps be offended if I was to mention -- not that it 's necessary , for your own good sense or any person 's sense must show 'em that -- if I was to mention that such declaration on my part was final , and there terminated ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12488 len. 44]: `` I quite understand that , '' said I. `` Perhaps -- er -- it may not be worth the form , but it might be a satisfaction to your mind -- perhaps you would n't object to admit that , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12489 len. 4]: said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12490 len. 21]: `` I admit it most fully and freely , '' said I. `` Thank you , '' returned Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12491 len. 8]: `` Very honourable , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 12492 len. 60]: I regret that my arrangements in life , combined with circumstances over which I have no control , will put it out of my power ever to fall back upon that offer or to renew it in any shape or form whatever , but it will ever be a retrospect entwined -- er -- with friendship 's bowers . ''
Parsing [sent. 12493 len. 16]: Mr. Guppy 's bronchitis came to his relief and stopped his measurement of the table .
Parsing [sent. 12494 len. 15]: `` I may now perhaps mention what I wished to say to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12495 len. 3]: I began .
Parsing [sent. 12496 len. 15]: `` I shall be honoured , I am sure , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12497 len. 49]: `` I am so persuaded that your own good sense and right feeling , miss , will -- will keep you as square as possible -- that I can have nothing but pleasure , I am sure , in hearing any observations you may wish to offer . ''
Parsing [sent. 12498 len. 39]: `` You were so good as to imply , on that occasion -- '' `` Excuse me , miss , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` but we had better not travel out of the record into implication .
Parsing [sent. 12499 len. 10]: I can not admit that I implied anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 12500 len. 38]: `` You said on that occasion , '' I recommenced , `` that you might possibly have the means of advancing my interests and promoting my fortunes by making discoveries of which I should be the subject .
Parsing [sent. 12501 len. 28]: I presume that you founded that belief upon your general knowledge of my being an orphan girl , indebted for everything to the benevolence of Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12502 len. 36]: Now , the beginning and the end of what I have come to beg of you is , Mr. Guppy , that you will have the kindness to relinquish all idea of so serving me .
Parsing [sent. 12503 len. 22]: I have thought of this sometimes , and I have thought of it most lately -- since I have been ill .
Parsing [sent. 12504 len. 37]: At length I have decided , in case you should at any time recall that purpose and act upon it in any way , to come to you and assure you that you are altogether mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 12505 len. 23]: You could make no discovery in reference to me that would do me the least service or give me the least pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 12506 len. 29]: I am acquainted with my personal history , and I have it in my power to assure you that you never can advance my welfare by such means .
Parsing [sent. 12507 len. 13]: You may , perhaps , have abandoned this project a long time .
Parsing [sent. 12508 len. 10]: If so , excuse my giving you unnecessary trouble .
Parsing [sent. 12509 len. 21]: If not , I entreat you , on the assurance I have given you , henceforth to lay it aside .
Parsing [sent. 12510 len. 12]: I beg you to do this , for my peace . ''
Parsing [sent. 12511 len. 34]: `` I am bound to confess , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` that you express yourself , miss , with that good sense and right feeling for which I gave you credit .
Parsing [sent. 12512 len. 31]: Nothing can be more satisfactory than such right feeling , and if I mistook any intentions on your part just now , I am prepared to tender a full apology .
Parsing [sent. 12513 len. 39]: I should wish to be understood , miss , as hereby offering that apology -- limiting it , as your own good sense and right feeling will point out the necessity of , to the present proceedings . ''
Parsing [sent. 12514 len. 19]: I must say for Mr. Guppy that the snuffling manner he had had upon him improved very much .
Parsing [sent. 12515 len. 18]: He seemed truly glad to be able to do something I asked , and he looked ashamed .
Parsing [sent. 12516 len. 46]: `` If you will allow me to finish what I have to say at once so that I may have no occasion to resume , '' I went on , seeing him about to speak , `` you will do me a kindness , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12517 len. 39]: I come to you as privately as possible because you announced this impression of yours to me in a confidence which I have really wished to respect -- and which I always have respected , as you remember .
Parsing [sent. 12518 len. 6]: I have mentioned my illness .
Parsing [sent. 12519 len. 34]: There really is no reason why I should hesitate to say that I know very well that any little delicacy I might have had in making a request to you is quite removed .
Parsing [sent. 12520 len. 26]: Therefore I make the entreaty I have now preferred , and I hope you will have sufficient consideration for me to accede to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 12521 len. 69]: I must do Mr. Guppy the further justice of saying that he had looked more and more ashamed and that he looked most ashamed and very earnest when he now replied with a burning face , `` Upon my word and honour , upon my life , upon my soul , Miss Summerson , as I am a living man , I 'll act according to your wish !
Parsing [sent. 12522 len. 11]: I 'll never go another step in opposition to it .
Parsing [sent. 12523 len. 16]: I 'll take my oath to it if it will be any satisfaction to you .
Parsing [sent. 12524 len. 74]: In what I promise at this present time touching the matters now in question , '' continued Mr. Guppy rapidly , as if he were repeating a familiar form of words , `` I speak the truth , the whole truth , and nothing but the truth , so -- '' `` I am quite satisfied , '' said I , rising at this point , `` and I thank you very much .
Parsing [sent. 12525 len. 10]: Caddy , my dear , I am ready ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12526 len. 28]: Mr. Guppy 's mother returned with Caddy -LRB- now making me the recipient of her silent laughter and her nudges -RRB- , and we took our leave .
Parsing [sent. 12527 len. 31]: Mr. Guppy saw us to the door with the air of one who was either imperfectly awake or walking in his sleep ; and we left him there , staring .
Parsing [sent. 12528 len. 48]: But in a minute he came after us down the street without any hat , and with his long hair all blown about , and stopped us , saying fervently , `` Miss Summerson , upon my honour and soul , you may depend upon me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12529 len. 13]: `` I do , '' said I , `` quite confidently . ''
Parsing [sent. 12530 len. 61]: `` I beg your pardon , miss , '' said Mr. Guppy , going with one leg and staying with the other , `` but this lady being present -- your own witness -- it might be a satisfaction to your mind -LRB- which I should wish to set at rest -RRB- if you was to repeat those admissions . ''
Parsing [sent. 12531 len. 51]: `` Well , Caddy , '' said I , turning to her , `` perhaps you will not be surprised when I tell you , my dear , that there never has been any engagement -- '' `` No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever , '' suggested Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12532 len. 39]: `` No proposal or promise of marriage whatsoever , '' said I , `` between this gentleman -- '' `` William Guppy , of Penton Place , Pentonville , in the county of Middlesex , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 12533 len. 25]: `` Between this gentleman , Mr. William Guppy , of Penton Place , Pentonville , in the county of Middlesex , and myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 12534 len. 11]: `` Thank you , miss , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12535 len. 19]: `` Very full -- er -- excuse me -- lady 's name , Christian and surname both ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12536 len. 4]: I gave them .
Parsing [sent. 12537 len. 8]: `` Married woman , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12538 len. 4]: said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12539 len. 4]: `` Married woman .
Parsing [sent. 12540 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 12541 len. 28]: Formerly Caroline Jellyby , spinster , then of Thavies Inn , within the city of London , but extra-parochial ; now of Newman Street , Oxford Street .
Parsing [sent. 12542 len. 4]: Much obliged . ''
Parsing [sent. 12543 len. 9]: He ran home and came running back again .
Parsing [sent. 12544 len. 61]: `` Touching that matter , you know , I really and truly am very sorry that my arrangements in life , combined with circumstances over which I have no control , should prevent a renewal of what was wholly terminated some time back , '' said Mr. Guppy to me forlornly and despondently , `` but it could n't be .
Parsing [sent. 12545 len. 7]: Now COULD it , you know !
Parsing [sent. 12546 len. 8]: I only put it to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 12547 len. 7]: I replied it certainly could not .
Parsing [sent. 12548 len. 9]: The subject did not admit of a doubt .
Parsing [sent. 12549 len. 15]: He thanked me and ran to his mother 's again -- and back again .
Parsing [sent. 12550 len. 19]: `` It 's very honourable of you , miss , I am sure , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12551 len. 36]: `` If an altar could be erected in the bowers of friendship -- but , upon my soul , you may rely upon me in every respect save and except the tender passion only ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12552 len. 42]: The struggle in Mr. Guppy 's breast and the numerous oscillations it occasioned him between his mother 's door and us were sufficiently conspicuous in the windy street -LRB- particularly as his hair wanted cutting -RRB- to make us hurry away .
Parsing [sent. 12553 len. 28]: I did so with a lightened heart ; but when we last looked back , Mr. Guppy was still oscillating in the same troubled state of mind .
Parsing [sent. 12554 len. 53]: Chapter XXXIX -- Attorney and Client The name of Mr. Vholes , preceded by the legend Ground -- Floor , is inscribed upon a door-post in Symond 's Inn , Chancery Lane -- a little , pale , wall-eyed , woebegone inn like a large dust-binn of two compartments and a sifter .
Parsing [sent. 12555 len. 46]: It looks as if Symond were a sparing man in his way and constructed his inn of old building materials which took kindly to the dry rot and to dirt and all things decaying and dismal , and perpetuated Symond 's memory with congenial shabbiness .
Parsing [sent. 12556 len. 16]: Quartered in this dingy hatchment commemorative of Symond are the legal bearings of Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12557 len. 26]: Mr. Vholes 's office , in disposition retiring and in situation retired , is squeezed up in a corner and blinks at a dead wall .
Parsing [sent. 12558 len. 44]: Three feet of knotty-floored dark passage bring the client to Mr. Vholes 's jet-black door , in an angle profoundly dark on the brightest midsummer morning and encumbered by a black bulk-head of cellarage staircase against which belated civilians generally strike their brows .
Parsing [sent. 12559 len. 41]: Mr. Vholes 's chambers are on so small a scale that one clerk can open the door without getting off his stool , while the other who elbows him at the same desk has equal facilities for poking the fire .
Parsing [sent. 12560 len. 43]: A smell as of unwholesome sheep blending with the smell of must and dust is referable to the nightly -LRB- and often daily -RRB- consumption of mutton fat in candles and to the fretting of parchment forms and skins in greasy drawers .
Parsing [sent. 12561 len. 8]: The atmosphere is otherwise stale and close .
Parsing [sent. 12562 len. 62]: The place was last painted or whitewashed beyond the memory of man , and the two chimneys smoke , and there is a loose outer surface of soot evervwhere , and the dull cracked windows in their heavy frames have but one piece of character in them , which is a determination to be always dirty and always shut unless coerced .
Parsing [sent. 12563 len. 25]: This accounts for the phenomenon of the weaker of the two usually having a bundle of firewood thrust between its jaws in hot weather .
Parsing [sent. 12564 len. 8]: Mr. Vholes is a very respectable man .
Parsing [sent. 12565 len. 15]: He has not a large business , but he is a very respectable man .
Parsing [sent. 12566 len. 23]: He is allowed by the greater attorneys who have made good fortunes or are making them to be a most respectable man .
Parsing [sent. 12567 len. 16]: He never misses a chance in his practice , which is a mark of respectability .
Parsing [sent. 12568 len. 13]: He never takes any pleasure , which is another mark of respectability .
Parsing [sent. 12569 len. 13]: He is reserved and serious , which is another mark of respectability .
Parsing [sent. 12570 len. 10]: His digestion is impaired , which is highly respectable .
Parsing [sent. 12571 len. 17]: And he is making hay of the grass which is flesh , for his three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 12572 len. 13]: And his father is dependent on him in the Vale of Taunton .
Parsing [sent. 12573 len. 15]: The one great principle of the English law is to make business for itself .
Parsing [sent. 12574 len. 18]: There is no other principle distinctly , certainly , and consistently maintained through all its narrow turnings .
Parsing [sent. 12575 len. 22]: Viewed by this light it becomes a coherent scheme and not the monstrous maze the laity are apt to think it .
Parsing [sent. 12576 len. 28]: Let them but once clearly perceive that its grand principle is to make business for itself at their expense , and surely they will cease to grumble .
Parsing [sent. 12577 len. 37]: But not perceiving this quite plainly -- only seeing it by halves in a confused way -- the laity sometimes suffer in peace and pocket , with a bad grace , and DO grumble very much .
Parsing [sent. 12578 len. 14]: Then this respectability of Mr. Vholes is brought into powerful play against them .
Parsing [sent. 12579 len. 10]: `` Repeal this statute , my good sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12580 len. 8]: says Mr. Kenge to a smarting client .
Parsing [sent. 12581 len. 8]: `` Repeal it , my dear sir ?
Parsing [sent. 12582 len. 6]: Never , with my consent .
Parsing [sent. 12583 len. 43]: Alter this law , sir , and what will be the effect of your rash proceeding on a class of practitioners very worthily represented , allow me to say to you , by the opposite attorney in the case , Mr. Vholes ?
Parsing [sent. 12584 len. 16]: Sir , that class of practitioners would be swept from the face of the earth .
Parsing [sent. 12585 len. 27]: Now you can not afford -- I will say , the social system can not afford -- to lose an order of men like Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12586 len. 10]: Diligent , persevering , steady , acute in business .
Parsing [sent. 12587 len. 48]: My dear sir , I understand your present feelings against the existing state of things , which I grant to be a little hard in your case ; but I can never raise my voice for the demolition of a class of men like Mr. Vholes . ''
Parsing [sent. 12588 len. 29]: The respectability of Mr. Vholes has even been cited with crushing effect before Parliamentary committees , as in the following blue minutes of a distinguished attorney 's evidence .
Parsing [sent. 12589 len. 28]: `` Question -LRB- number five hundred and seventeen thousand eight hundred and sixty-nine -RRB- : If I understand you , these forms of practice indisputably occasion delay ?
Parsing [sent. 12590 len. 7]: Answer : Yes , some delay .
Parsing [sent. 12591 len. 6]: Question : And great expense ?
Parsing [sent. 12592 len. 13]: Answer : Most assuredly they can not be gone through for nothing .
Parsing [sent. 12593 len. 6]: Question : And unspeakable vexation ?
Parsing [sent. 12594 len. 10]: Answer : I am not prepared to say that .
Parsing [sent. 12595 len. 12]: They have never given ME any vexation ; quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 12596 len. 15]: Question : But you think that their abolition would damage a class of practitioners ?
Parsing [sent. 12597 len. 9]: Answer : I have no doubt of it .
Parsing [sent. 12598 len. 11]: Question : Can you instance any type of that class ?
Parsing [sent. 12599 len. 4]: Answer : Yes .
Parsing [sent. 12600 len. 7]: I would unhesitatingly mention Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12601 len. 5]: He would be ruined .
Parsing [sent. 12602 len. 15]: Question : Mr. Vholes is considered , in the profession , a respectable man ?
Parsing [sent. 12603 len. 30]: Answer : '' -- which proved fatal to the inquiry for ten years -- `` Mr. Vholes is considered , in the profession , a MOST respectable man . ''
Parsing [sent. 12604 len. 70]: So in familiar conversation , private authorities no less disinterested will remark that they do n't know what this age is coming to , that we are plunging down precipices , that now here is something else gone , that these changes are death to people like Vholes -- a man of undoubted respectability , with a father in the Vale of Taunton , and three daughters at home .
Parsing [sent. 12605 len. 22]: Take a few steps more in this direction , say they , and what is to become of Vholes 's father ?
Parsing [sent. 12606 len. 5]: Is he to perish ?
Parsing [sent. 12607 len. 6]: And of Vholes 's daughters ?
Parsing [sent. 12608 len. 9]: Are they to be shirt-makers , or governesses ?
Parsing [sent. 12609 len. 39]: As though , Mr. Vholes and his relations being minor cannibal chiefs and it being proposed to abolish cannibalism , indignant champions were to put the case thus : Make man-eating unlawful , and you starve the Vholeses !
Parsing [sent. 12610 len. 46]: In a word , Mr. Vholes , with his three daughters and his father in the Vale of Taunton , is continually doing duty , like a piece of timber , to shore up some decayed foundation that has become a pitfall and a nuisance .
Parsing [sent. 12611 len. 49]: And with a great many people in a great many instances , the question is never one of a change from wrong to right -LRB- which is quite an extraneous consideration -RRB- , but is always one of injury or advantage to that eminently respectable legion , Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12612 len. 17]: The Chancellor is , within these ten minutes , `` up '' for the long vacation .
Parsing [sent. 12613 len. 41]: Mr. Vholes , and his young client , and several blue bags hastily stuffed out of all regularity of form , as the larger sort of serpents are in their first gorged state , have returned to the official den .
Parsing [sent. 12614 len. 51]: Mr. Vholes , quiet and unmoved , as a man of so much respectability ought to be , takes off his close black gloves as if he were skinning his hands , lifts off his tight hat as if he were scalping himself , and sits down at his desk .
Parsing [sent. 12615 len. 52]: The client throws his hat and gloves upon the ground -- tosses them anywhere , without looking after them or caring where they go ; flings himself into a chair , half sighing and half groaning ; rests his aching head upon his hand and looks the portrait of young despair .
Parsing [sent. 12616 len. 6]: `` Again nothing done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12617 len. 3]: says Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12618 len. 7]: `` Nothing , nothing done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12619 len. 15]: `` Do n't say nothing done , sir , '' returns the placid Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12620 len. 12]: `` That is scarcely fair , sir , scarcely fair ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12621 len. 8]: `` Why , what IS done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12622 len. 8]: says Richard , turning gloomily upon him .
Parsing [sent. 12623 len. 29]: `` That may not be the whole question , '' returns Vholes , `` The question may branch off into what is doing , what is doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12624 len. 7]: `` And what is doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12625 len. 5]: asks the moody client .
Parsing [sent. 12626 len. 55]: Vholes , sitting with his arms on the desk , quietly bringing the tips of his five right fingers to meet the tips of his five left fingers , and quietly separating them again , and fixedly and slowly looking at his client , replies , `` A good deal is doing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12627 len. 20]: We have put our shoulders to the wheel , Mr. Carstone , and the wheel is going round . ''
Parsing [sent. 12628 len. 8]: `` Yes , with Ixion on it .
Parsing [sent. 12629 len. 15]: How am I to get through the next four or five accursed months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12630 len. 15]: exclaims the young man , rising from his chair and walking about the room .
Parsing [sent. 12631 len. 34]: `` Mr. C. , '' returns Vholes , following him close with his eyes wherever he goes , `` your spirits are hasty , and I am sorry for it on your account .
Parsing [sent. 12632 len. 25]: Excuse me if I recommend you not to chafe so much , not to be so impetuous , not to wear yourself out so .
Parsing [sent. 12633 len. 6]: You should have more patience .
Parsing [sent. 12634 len. 7]: You should sustain yourself better . ''
Parsing [sent. 12635 len. 14]: `` I ought to imitate you , in fact , Mr. Vholes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12636 len. 24]: says Richard , sitting down again with an impatient laugh and beating the devil 's tattoo with his boot on the patternless carpet .
Parsing [sent. 12637 len. 33]: `` Sir , '' returns Vholes , always looking at the client as if he were making a lingering meal of him with his eyes as well as with his professional appetite .
Parsing [sent. 12638 len. 39]: `` Sir , '' returns Vholes with his inward manner of speech and his bloodless quietude , `` I should not have had the presumption to propose myself as a model for your imitation or any man 's .
Parsing [sent. 12639 len. 25]: Let me but leave the good name to my three daughters , and that is enough for me ; I am not a self-seeker .
Parsing [sent. 12640 len. 55]: But since you mention me so pointedly , I will acknowledge that I should like to impart to you a little of my -- come , sir , you are disposed to call it insensibility , and I am sure I have no objection -- say insensibility -- a little of my insensibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 12641 len. 24]: `` Mr. Vholes , '' explains the client , somewhat abashed , `` I had no intention to accuse you of insensibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 12642 len. 18]: `` I think you had , sir , without knowing it , '' returns the equable Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12643 len. 4]: `` Very naturally .
Parsing [sent. 12644 len. 37]: It is my duty to attend to your interests with a cool head , and I can quite understand that to your excited feelings I may appear , at such times as the present , insensible .
Parsing [sent. 12645 len. 15]: My daughters may know me better ; my aged father may know me better .
Parsing [sent. 12646 len. 25]: But they have known me much longer than you have , and the confiding eye of affection is not the distrustful eye of business .
Parsing [sent. 12647 len. 19]: Not that I complain , sir , of the eye of business being distrustful ; quite the contrary .
Parsing [sent. 12648 len. 29]: In attending to your interests , I wish to have all possible checks upon me ; it is right that I should have them ; I court inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 12649 len. 33]: But your interests demand that I should be cool and methodical , Mr. Carstone ; and I can not be otherwise -- no , sir , not even to please you . ''
Parsing [sent. 12650 len. 69]: Mr. Vholes , after glancing at the official cat who is patiently watching a mouse 's hole , fixes his charmed gaze again on his young client and proceeds in his buttoned-up , half-audible voice as if there were an unclean spirit in him that will neither come out nor speak out , `` What are you to do , sir , you inquire , during the vacation .
Parsing [sent. 12651 len. 23]: I should hope you gentlemen of the army may find many means of amusing yourselves if you give your minds to it .
Parsing [sent. 12652 len. 22]: If you had asked me what I was to do during the vacation , I could have answered you more readily .
Parsing [sent. 12653 len. 8]: I am to attend to your interests .
Parsing [sent. 12654 len. 16]: I am to be found here , day by day , attending to your interests .
Parsing [sent. 12655 len. 18]: That is my duty , Mr. C. , and term-time or vacation makes no difference to me .
Parsing [sent. 12656 len. 21]: If you wish to consult me as to your interests , you will find me here at all times alike .
Parsing [sent. 12657 len. 8]: Other professional men go out of town .
Parsing [sent. 12658 len. 4]: I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 12659 len. 16]: Not that I blame them for going ; I merely say I do n't go .
Parsing [sent. 12660 len. 9]: This desk is your rock , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12661 len. 16]: Mr. Vholes gives it a rap , and it sounds as hollow as a coffin .
Parsing [sent. 12662 len. 6]: Not to Richard , though .
Parsing [sent. 12663 len. 9]: There is encouragement in the sound to him .
Parsing [sent. 12664 len. 7]: Perhaps Mr. Vholes knows there is .
Parsing [sent. 12665 len. 54]: `` I am perfectly aware , Mr. Vholes , '' says Richard , more familiarly and good-humouredly , `` that you are the most reliable fellow in the world and that to have to do with you is to have to do with a man of business who is not to be hoodwinked .
Parsing [sent. 12666 len. 65]: But put yourself in my case , dragging on this dislocated life , sinking deeper and deeper into difficulty every day , continually hoping and continually disappointed , conscious of change upon change for the worse in myself , and of no change for the better in anything else , and you will find it a dark-looking case sometimes , as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 12667 len. 18]: `` You know , '' says Mr. Vholes , `` that I never give hopes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12668 len. 16]: I told you from the first , Mr. C. , that I never give hopes .
Parsing [sent. 12669 len. 34]: Particularly in a case like this , where the greater part of the costs comes out of the estate , I should not be considerate of my good name if I gave hopes .
Parsing [sent. 12670 len. 10]: It might seem as if costs were my object .
Parsing [sent. 12671 len. 27]: Still , when you say there is no change for the better , I must , as a bare matter of fact , deny that . ''
Parsing [sent. 12672 len. 4]: `` Aye ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12673 len. 5]: returns Richard , brightening .
Parsing [sent. 12674 len. 10]: `` But how do you make it out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12675 len. 20]: `` Mr. Carstone , you are represented by -- '' `` You said just now -- a rock . ''
Parsing [sent. 12676 len. 40]: `` Yes , sir , '' says Mr. Vholes , gently shaking his head and rapping the hollow desk , with a sound as if ashes were falling on ashes , and dust on dust , `` a rock .
Parsing [sent. 12677 len. 4]: That 's something .
Parsing [sent. 12678 len. 17]: You are separately represented , and no longer hidden and lost in the interests of others .
Parsing [sent. 12679 len. 4]: THAT 'S something .
Parsing [sent. 12680 len. 20]: The suit does not sleep ; we wake it up , we air it , we walk it about .
Parsing [sent. 12681 len. 4]: THAT 'S something .
Parsing [sent. 12682 len. 14]: It 's not all Jarndyce , in fact as well as in name .
Parsing [sent. 12683 len. 4]: THAT 'S something .
Parsing [sent. 12684 len. 11]: Nobody has it all his own way now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12685 len. 8]: And THAT 'S something , surely . ''
Parsing [sent. 12686 len. 15]: Richard , his face flushing suddenly , strikes the desk with his clenched hand .
Parsing [sent. 12687 len. 4]: `` Mr. Vholes !
Parsing [sent. 12688 len. 60]: If any man had told me when I first went to John Jarndyce 's house that he was anything but the disinterested friend he seemed -- that he was what he has gradually turned out to be -- I could have found no words strong enough to repel the slander ; I could not have defended him too ardently .
Parsing [sent. 12689 len. 9]: So little did I know of the world !
Parsing [sent. 12690 len. 66]: Whereas now I do declare to you that he becomes to me the embodiment of the suit ; that in place of its being an abstraction , it is John Jarndyce ; that the more I suffer , the more indignant I am with him ; that every new delay and every new disappointment is only a new injury from John Jarndyce 's hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 12691 len. 9]: `` No , no , '' says vholes .
Parsing [sent. 12692 len. 6]: `` Do n't say so .
Parsing [sent. 12693 len. 10]: We ought to have patience , all of us .
Parsing [sent. 12694 len. 8]: Besides , I never disparage , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12695 len. 5]: I never disparage . ''
Parsing [sent. 12696 len. 10]: `` Mr. Vholes , '' returns the angry client .
Parsing [sent. 12697 len. 19]: `` You know as well as I that he would have strangled the suit if he could . ''
Parsing [sent. 12698 len. 18]: `` He was not active in it , '' Mr. Vholes admits with an appearance of reluctance .
Parsing [sent. 12699 len. 9]: `` He certainly was not active in it .
Parsing [sent. 12700 len. 13]: But however , but however , he might have had amiable intentions .
Parsing [sent. 12701 len. 10]: Who can read the heart , Mr. C. ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12702 len. 8]: `` You can , '' returns Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12703 len. 7]: `` I , Mr. C. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12704 len. 10]: `` Well enough to know what his intentions were .
Parsing [sent. 12705 len. 8]: Are or are not our interests conflicting ?
Parsing [sent. 12706 len. 7]: Tell -- me -- that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12707 len. 17]: says Richard , accompanying his last three words with three raps on his rock of trust .
Parsing [sent. 12708 len. 56]: `` Mr. C. , '' returns Vholes , immovable in attitude and never winking his hungry eyes , `` I should be wanting in my duty as your professional adviser , I should be departing from my fidelity to your interests , if I represented those interests as identical with the interests of Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 12709 len. 8]: They are no such thing , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12710 len. 19]: I never impute motives ; I both have and am a father , and I never impute motives .
Parsing [sent. 12711 len. 18]: But I must not shrink from a professional duty , even if it sows dissensions in families .
Parsing [sent. 12712 len. 14]: I understand you to be now consulting me professionally as to your interests ?
Parsing [sent. 12713 len. 4]: You are so ?
Parsing [sent. 12714 len. 16]: I reply , then , they are not identical with those of Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 12715 len. 8]: `` Of course they are not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12716 len. 3]: cries Richard .
Parsing [sent. 12717 len. 9]: `` You found that out long ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 12718 len. 23]: `` Mr. C. , '' returns Vholes , `` I wish to say no more of any third party than is necessary .
Parsing [sent. 12719 len. 35]: I wish to leave my good name unsullied , together with any little property of which I may become possessed through industry and perseverance , to my daughters Emma , Jane , and Caroline .
Parsing [sent. 12720 len. 12]: I also desire to live in amity with my professional brethren .
Parsing [sent. 12721 len. 62]: When Mr. Skimpole did me the honour , sir -- I will not say the very high honour , for I never stoop to flattery -- of bringing us together in this room , I mentioned to you that I could offer no opinion or advice as to your interests while those interests were entrusted to another member of the profession .
Parsing [sent. 12722 len. 23]: And I spoke in such terms as I was bound to speak of Kenge and Carboy 's office , which stands high .
Parsing [sent. 12723 len. 21]: You , sir , thought fit to withdraw your interests from that keeping nevertheless and to offer them to me .
Parsing [sent. 12724 len. 17]: You brought them with clean hands , sir , and I accepted them with clean hands .
Parsing [sent. 12725 len. 9]: Those interests are now paramount in this office .
Parsing [sent. 12726 len. 39]: My digestive functions , as you may have heard me mention , are not in a good state , and rest might improve them ; but I shall not rest , sir , while I am your representative .
Parsing [sent. 12727 len. 11]: Whenever you want me , you will find me here .
Parsing [sent. 12728 len. 9]: Summon me anywhere , and I will come .
Parsing [sent. 12729 len. 132]: During the long vacation , sir , I shall devote my leisure to studying your interests more and more closely and to making arrangements for moving heaven and earth -LRB- including , of course , the Chancellor -RRB- after Michaelmas term ; and when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , '' says Mr. Vholes with the severity of a determined man , `` when I ultimately congratulate you , sir , with all my heart , on your accession to fortune -- which , but that I never give hopes , I might say something further about -- you will owe me nothing beyond whatever little balance may be then outstanding of the costs as between solicitor and client not included in the taxed costs allowed out of the estate .
Parsing [sent. 12730 len. 40]: I pretend to no claim upon you , Mr. C. , but for the zealous and active discharge -- not the languid and routine discharge , sir : that much credit I stipulate for -- of my professional duty .
Parsing [sent. 12731 len. 12]: My duty prosperously ended , all between us is ended . ''
Parsing [sent. 12732 len. 44]: Vholes finally adds , by way of rider to this declaration of his principles , that as Mr. Carstone is about to rejoin his regiment , perhaps Mr. C. will favour him with an order on his agent for twenty pounds on account .
Parsing [sent. 12733 len. 46]: `` For there have been many little consultations and attendances of late , sir , '' observes Vholes , turning over the leaves of his diary , `` and these things mount up , and I do n't profess to be a man of capital .
Parsing [sent. 12734 len. 59]: When we first entered on our present relations I stated to you openly -- it is a principle of mine that there never can be too much openness between solicitor and client -- that I was not a man of capital and that if capital was your object you had better leave your papers in Kenge 's office .
Parsing [sent. 12735 len. 20]: No , Mr. C. , you will find none of the advantages or disadvantages of capital here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12736 len. 25]: This , '' Vholes gives the desk one hollow blow again , `` is your rock ; it pretends to be nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 12737 len. 45]: The client , with his dejection insensibly relieved and his vague hopes rekindled , takes pen and ink and writes the draft , not without perplexed consideration and calculation of the date it may bear , implying scant effects in the agent 's hands .
Parsing [sent. 12738 len. 18]: All the while , Vholes , buttoned up in body and mind , looks at him attentively .
Parsing [sent. 12739 len. 14]: All the while , Vholes 's official cat watches the mouse 's hole .
Parsing [sent. 12740 len. 36]: Lastly , the client , shaking hands , beseeches Mr. Vholes , for heaven 's sake and earth 's sake , to do his utmost to `` pull him through '' the Court of Chancery .
Parsing [sent. 12741 len. 28]: Mr. Vholes , who never gives hopes , lays his palm upon the client 's shoulder and answers with a smile , `` Always here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12742 len. 23]: Personally , or by letter , you will always find me here , sir , with my shoulder to the wheel . ''
Parsing [sent. 12743 len. 35]: Thus they part , and Vholes , left alone , employs himself in carrying sundry little matters out of his diary into his draft bill book for the ultimate behoof of his three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 12744 len. 56]: So might an industrious fox or bear make up his account of chickens or stray travellers with an eye to his cubs , not to disparage by that word the three raw-visaged , lank , and buttoned-up maidens who dwell with the parent Vholes in an earthy cottage situated in a damp garden at Kennington .
Parsing [sent. 12745 len. 50]: Richard , emerging from the heavy shade of Symond 's Inn into the sunshine of Chancery Lane -- for there happens to be sunshine there to-day -- walks thoughtfully on , and turns into Lincoln 's Inn , and passes under the shadow of the Lincoln 's Inn trees .
Parsing [sent. 12746 len. 49]: On many such loungers have the speckled shadows of those trees often fallen ; on the like bent head , the bitten nail , the lowering eye , the lingering step , the purposeless and dreamy air , the good consuming and consumed , the life turned sour .
Parsing [sent. 12747 len. 12]: This lounger is not shabby yet , but that may come .
Parsing [sent. 12748 len. 27]: Chancery , which knows no wisdom but in precedent , is very rich in such precedents ; and why should one be different from ten thousand ?
Parsing [sent. 12749 len. 47]: Yet the time is so short since his depreciation began that as he saunters away , reluctant to leave the spot for some long months together , though he hates it , Richard himself may feel his own case as if it were a startling one .
Parsing [sent. 12750 len. 47]: While his heart is heavy with corroding care , suspense , distrust , and doubt , it may have room for some sorrowful wonder when he recalls how different his first visit there , how different he , how different all the colours of his mind .
Parsing [sent. 12751 len. 72]: But injustice breeds injustice ; the fighting with shadows and being defeated by them necessitates the setting up of substances to combat ; from the impalpable suit which no man alive can understand , the time for that being long gone by , it has become a gloomy relief to turn to the palpable figure of the friend who would have saved him from this ruin and make HIM his enemy .
Parsing [sent. 12752 len. 7]: Richard has told Vholes the truth .
Parsing [sent. 12753 len. 71]: Is he in a hardened or a softened mood , he still lays his injuries equally at that door ; he was thwarted , in that quarter , of a set purpose , and that purpose could only originate in the one subject that is resolving his existence into itself ; besides , it is a justification to him in his own eyes to have an embodied antagonist and oppressor .
Parsing [sent. 12754 len. 30]: Is Richard a monster in all this , or would Chancery be found rich in such precedents too if they could be got for citation from the Recording Angel ?
Parsing [sent. 12755 len. 37]: Two pairs of eyes not unused to such people look after him , as , biting his nails and brooding , he crosses the square and is swallowed up by the shadow of the southern gateway .
Parsing [sent. 12756 len. 28]: Mr. Guppy and Mr. Weevle are the possessors of those eyes , and they have been leaning in conversation against the low stone parapet under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 12757 len. 12]: He passes close by them , seeing nothing but the ground .
Parsing [sent. 12758 len. 20]: `` William , '' says Mr. Weevle , adjusting his whiskers , `` there 's combustion going on there !
Parsing [sent. 12759 len. 17]: It 's not a case of spontaneous , but it 's smouldering combustion it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 12760 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12761 len. 4]: says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 12762 len. 21]: `` He would n't keep out of Jarndyce , and I suppose he 's over head and ears in debt .
Parsing [sent. 12763 len. 7]: I never knew much of him .
Parsing [sent. 12764 len. 16]: He was as high as the monument when he was on trial at our place .
Parsing [sent. 12765 len. 12]: A good riddance to me , whether as clerk or client !
Parsing [sent. 12766 len. 17]: Well , Tony , that as I was mentioning is what they 're up to . ''
Parsing [sent. 12767 len. 20]: Mr. Guppy , refolding his arms , resettles himself against the parapet , as resuming a conversation of interest .
Parsing [sent. 12768 len. 34]: `` They are still up to it , sir , '' says Mr. Guppy , `` still taking stock , still examining papers , still going over the heaps and heaps of rubbish .
Parsing [sent. 12769 len. 13]: At this rate they 'll be at it these seven years . ''
Parsing [sent. 12770 len. 7]: `` And Small is helping ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12771 len. 10]: `` Small left us at a week 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 12772 len. 22]: Told Kenge his grandfather 's business was too much for the old gentleman and he could better himself by undertaking it .
Parsing [sent. 12773 len. 17]: There had been a coolness between myself and Small on account of his being so close .
Parsing [sent. 12774 len. 29]: But he said you and I began it , and as he had me there -- for we did -- I put our acquaintance on the old footing .
Parsing [sent. 12775 len. 14]: That 's how I come to know what they 're up to . ''
Parsing [sent. 12776 len. 10]: `` You have n't looked in at all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12777 len. 52]: `` Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy , a little disconcerted , `` to be unreserved with you , I do n't greatly relish the house , except in your company , and therefore I have not ; and therefore I proposed this little appointment for our fetching away your things .
Parsing [sent. 12778 len. 8]: There goes the hour by the clock !
Parsing [sent. 12779 len. 57]: Tony '' -- Mr. Guppy becomes mysteriously and tenderly eloquent -- `` it is necessary that I should impress upon your mind once more that circumstances over which I have no control have made a melancholy alteration in my most cherished plans and in that unrequited image which I formerly mentioned to you as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 12780 len. 12]: That image is shattered , and that idol is laid low .
Parsing [sent. 12781 len. 37]: My only wish now in connexion with the objects which I had an idea of carrying out in the court with your aid as a friend is to let 'em alone and bury 'em in oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 12782 len. 84]: Do you think it possible , do you think it at all likely -LRB- I put it to you , Tony , as a friend -RRB- , from your knowledge of that capricious and deep old character who fell a prey to the -- spontaneous element , do you , Tony , think it at all likely that on second thoughts he put those letters away anywhere , after you saw him alive , and that they were not destroyed that night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12783 len. 7]: Mr. Weevle reflects for some time .
Parsing [sent. 12784 len. 4]: Shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 12785 len. 4]: Decidedly thinks not .
Parsing [sent. 12786 len. 24]: `` Tony , '' says Mr. Guppy as they walk towards the court , `` once again understand me , as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 12787 len. 15]: Without entering into further explanations , I may repeat that the idol is down .
Parsing [sent. 12788 len. 12]: I have no purpose to serve now but burial in oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 12789 len. 7]: To that I have pledged myself .
Parsing [sent. 12790 len. 27]: I owe it to myself , and I owe it to the shattered image , as also to the circumstances over which I have no control .
Parsing [sent. 12791 len. 53]: If you was to express to me by a gesture , by a wink , that you saw lying anywhere in your late lodgings any papers that so much as looked like the papers in question , I would pitch them into the fire , sir , on my own responsibility . ''
Parsing [sent. 12792 len. 4]: Mr. Weevle nods .
Parsing [sent. 12793 len. 64]: Mr. Guppy , much elevated in his own opinion by having delivered these observations , with an air in part forensic and in part romantic -- this gentleman having a passion for conducting anything in the form of an examination , or delivering anything in the form of a summing up or a speech -- accompanies his friend with dignity to the court .
Parsing [sent. 12794 len. 28]: Never since it has been a court has it had such a Fortunatus ' purse of gossip as in the proceedings at the rag and bottle shop .
Parsing [sent. 12795 len. 81]: Regularly , every morning at eight , is the elder Mr. Smallweed brought down to the corner and carried in , accompanied by Mrs. Smallweed , Judy , and Bart ; and regularly , all day , do they all remain there until nine at night , solaced by gipsy dinners , not abundant in quantity , from the cook 's shop , rummaging and searching , digging , delving , and diving among the treasures of the late lamented .
Parsing [sent. 12796 len. 14]: What those treasures are they keep so secret that the court is maddened .
Parsing [sent. 12797 len. 26]: In its delirium it imagines guineas pouring out of tea-pots , crown-pieces overflowing punch-bowls , old chairs and mattresses stuffed with Bank of England notes .
Parsing [sent. 12798 len. 44]: It possesses itself of the sixpenny history -LRB- with highly coloured folding frontispiece -RRB- of Mr. Daniel Dancer and his sister , and also of Mr. Elwes , of Suffolk , and transfers all the facts from those authentic narratives to Mr. Krook .
Parsing [sent. 12799 len. 36]: Twice when the dustman is called in to carry off a cartload of old paper , ashes , and broken bottles , the whole court assembles and pries into the baskets as they come forth .
Parsing [sent. 12800 len. 33]: Many times the two gentlemen who write with the ravenous little pens on the tissue-paper are seen prowling in the neighbourhood -- shy of each other , their late partnership being dissolved .
Parsing [sent. 12801 len. 15]: The Sol skilfully carries a vein of the prevailing interest through the Harmonic nights .
Parsing [sent. 12802 len. 39]: Little Swills , in what are professionally known as `` patter '' allusions to the subject , is received with loud applause ; and the same vocalist `` gags '' in the regular business like a man inspired .
Parsing [sent. 12803 len. 75]: Even Miss M. Melvilleson , in the revived Caledonian melody of `` We 're a -- Nodding , '' points the sentiment that `` the dogs love broo '' -LRB- whatever the nature of that refreshment may be -RRB- with such archness and such a turn of the head towards next door that she is immediately understood to mean Mr. Smallweed loves to find money , and is nightly honoured with a double encore .
Parsing [sent. 12804 len. 45]: For all this , the court discovers nothing ; and as Mrs. Piper and Mrs. Perkins now communicate to the late lodger whose appearance is the signal for a general rally , it is in one continual ferment to discover everything , and more .
Parsing [sent. 12805 len. 36]: Mr. Weevle and Mr. Guppy , with every eye in the court 's head upon them , knock at the closed door of the late lamented 's house , in a high state of popularity .
Parsing [sent. 12806 len. 22]: But being contrary to the court 's expectation admitted , they immediately become unpopular and are considered to mean no good .
Parsing [sent. 12807 len. 22]: The shutters are more or less closed all over the house , and the ground-floor is sufficiently dark to require candles .
Parsing [sent. 12808 len. 106]: Introduced into the back shop by Mr. Smallweed the younger , they , fresh from the sunlight , can at first see nothing save darkness and shadows ; but they gradually discern the elder Mr. Smallweed seated in his chair upon the brink of a well or grave of waste-paper , the virtuous Judy groping therein like a female sexton , and Mrs. Smallweed on the level ground in the vicinity snowed up in a heap of paper fragments , print , and manuscript which would appear to be the accumulated compliments that have been sent flying at her in the course of the day .
Parsing [sent. 12809 len. 28]: The whole party , Small included , are blackened with dust and dirt and present a fiendish appearance not relieved by the general aspect of the room .
Parsing [sent. 12810 len. 40]: There is more litter and lumber in it than of old , and it is dirtier if possible ; likewise , it is ghostly with traces of its dead inhabitant and even with his chalked writing on the wall .
Parsing [sent. 12811 len. 20]: On the entrance of visitors , Mr. Smallweed and Judy simultaneously fold their arms and stop in their researches .
Parsing [sent. 12812 len. 4]: `` Aha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12813 len. 5]: croaks the old gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 12814 len. 11]: `` How de do , gentlemen , how de do !
Parsing [sent. 12815 len. 9]: Come to fetch your property , Mr. Weevle ?
Parsing [sent. 12816 len. 8]: That 's well , that 's well .
Parsing [sent. 12817 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 12818 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 12819 len. 26]: We should have been forced to sell you up , sir , to pay your warehouse room if you had left it here much longer .
Parsing [sent. 12820 len. 12]: You feel quite at home here again , I dare say ?
Parsing [sent. 12821 len. 11]: Glad to see you , glad to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12822 len. 11]: Mr. Weevle , thanking him , casts an eye about .
Parsing [sent. 12823 len. 10]: Mr. Guppy 's eye follows Mr. Weevle 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 12824 len. 13]: Mr. Weevle 's eye comes back without any new intelligence in it .
Parsing [sent. 12825 len. 13]: Mr. Guppy 's eye comes back and meets Mr. Smallweed 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 12826 len. 59]: That engaging old gentleman is still murmuring , like some wound-up instrument running down , `` How de do , sir -- how de -- how -- '' And then having run down , he lapses into grinning silence , as Mr. Guppy starts at seeing Mr. Tulkinghorn standing in the darkness opposite with his hands behind him .
Parsing [sent. 12827 len. 16]: `` Gentleman so kind as to act as my solicitor , '' says Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 12828 len. 22]: `` I am not the sort of client for a gentleman of such note , but he is so good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12829 len. 28]: Mr. Guppy , slightly nudging his friend to take another look , makes a shuffling bow to Mr. Tulkinghorn , who returns it with an easy nod .
Parsing [sent. 12830 len. 21]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is looking on as if he had nothing else to do and were rather amused by the novelty .
Parsing [sent. 12831 len. 22]: `` A good deal of property here , sir , I should say , '' Mr. Guppy observes to Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 12832 len. 10]: `` Principally rags and rubbish , my dear friend !
Parsing [sent. 12833 len. 4]: Rags and rubbish !
Parsing [sent. 12834 len. 22]: Me and Bart and my granddaughter Judy are endeavouring to make out an inventory of what 's worth anything to sell .
Parsing [sent. 12835 len. 22]: But we have n't come to much as yet ; we -- have n't -- come -- to -- hah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12836 len. 30]: Mr. Smallweed has run down again , while Mr. Weevle 's eye , attended by Mr. Guppy 's eye , has again gone round the room and come back .
Parsing [sent. 12837 len. 10]: `` Well , sir , '' says Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 12838 len. 17]: `` We wo n't intrude any longer if you 'll allow us to go upstairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 12839 len. 9]: `` Anywhere , my dear sir , anywhere !
Parsing [sent. 12840 len. 5]: You 're at home .
Parsing [sent. 12841 len. 7]: Make yourself so , pray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12842 len. 16]: As they go upstairs , Mr. Guppy lifts his eyebrows inquiringly and looks at Tony .
Parsing [sent. 12843 len. 5]: Tony shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 12844 len. 29]: They find the old room very dull and dismal , with the ashes of the fire that was burning on that memorable night yet in the discoloured grate .
Parsing [sent. 12845 len. 19]: They have a great disinclination to touch any object , and carefully blow the dust from it first .
Parsing [sent. 12846 len. 24]: Nor are they desirous to prolong their visit , packing the few movables with all possible speed and never speaking above a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 12847 len. 10]: `` Look here , '' says Tony , recoiling .
Parsing [sent. 12848 len. 10]: `` Here 's that horrible cat coming in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12849 len. 7]: Mr. Guppy retreats behind a chair .
Parsing [sent. 12850 len. 7]: `` Small told me of her .
Parsing [sent. 12851 len. 40]: She went leaping and bounding and tearing about that night like a dragon , and got out on the house-top , and roamed about up there for a fortnight , and then came tumbling down the chimney very thin .
Parsing [sent. 12852 len. 8]: Did you ever see such a brute ?
Parsing [sent. 12853 len. 13]: Looks as if she knew all about it , do n't she ?
Parsing [sent. 12854 len. 8]: Almost looks as if she was Krook .
Parsing [sent. 12855 len. 2]: Shoohoo !
Parsing [sent. 12856 len. 7]: Get out , you goblin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12857 len. 52]: Lady Jane , in the doorway , with her tiger snarl from ear to ear and her club of a tail , shows no intention of obeying ; but Mr. Tulkinghorn stumbling over her , she spits at his rusty legs , and swearing wrathfully , takes her arched back upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 12858 len. 12]: Possibly to roam the house-tops again and return by the chimney .
Parsing [sent. 12859 len. 19]: `` Mr. Guppy , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` could I have a word with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12860 len. 27]: Mr. Guppy is engaged in collecting the Galaxy Gallery of British Beauty from the wall and depositing those works of art in their old ignoble band-box .
Parsing [sent. 12861 len. 53]: `` Sir , '' he returns , reddening , `` I wish to act with courtesy towards every member of the profession , and especially , I am sure , towards a member of it so well known as yourself -- I will truly add , sir , so distinguished as yourself .
Parsing [sent. 12862 len. 31]: Still , Mr. Tulkinghorn , sir , I must stipulate that if you have any word with me , that word is spoken in the presence of my friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 12863 len. 6]: `` Oh , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12864 len. 4]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 12865 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 12866 len. 20]: My reasons are not of a personal nature at all , but they are amply sufficient for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 12867 len. 8]: `` No doubt , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 12868 len. 15]: Mr. Tulkinghorn is as imperturbable as the hearthstone to which he has quietly walked .
Parsing [sent. 12869 len. 25]: `` The matter is not of that consequence that I need put you to the trouble of making any conditions , Mr. Guppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 12870 len. 18]: He pauses here to smile , and his smile is as dull and rusty as his pantaloons .
Parsing [sent. 12871 len. 20]: `` You are to be congratulated , Mr. Guppy ; you are a fortunate young man , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 12872 len. 14]: `` Pretty well so , Mr. Tulkinghorn ; I do n't complain . ''
Parsing [sent. 12873 len. 3]: `` Complain ?
Parsing [sent. 12874 len. 15]: High friends , free admission to great houses , and access to elegant ladies !
Parsing [sent. 12875 len. 20]: Why , Mr. Guppy , there are people in London who would give their ears to be you . ''
Parsing [sent. 12876 len. 75]: Mr. Guppy , looking as if he would give his own reddening and still reddening ears to be one of those people at present instead of himself , replies , `` Sir , if I attend to my profession and do what is right by Kenge and Carboy , my friends and acquaintances are of no consequence to them nor to any member of the profession , not excepting Mr. Tulkinghorn of the Fields .
Parsing [sent. 12877 len. 38]: I am not under any obligation to explain myself further ; and with all respect for you , sir , and without offence -- I repeat , without offence -- '' `` Oh , certainly ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 12878 len. 10]: -- I do n't intend to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 12879 len. 13]: `` Quite so , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a calm nod .
Parsing [sent. 12880 len. 23]: `` Very good ; I see by these portraits that you take a strong interest in the fashionable great , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12881 len. 14]: He addresses this to the astounded Tony , who admits the soft impeachment .
Parsing [sent. 12882 len. 15]: `` A virtue in which few Englishmen are deficient , '' observes Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 12883 len. 26]: He has been standing on the hearthstone with his back to the smoked chimney-piece , and now turns round with his glasses to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 12884 len. 5]: `` Who is this ?
Parsing [sent. 12885 len. 5]: ` Lady Dedlock . '
Parsing [sent. 12886 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 12887 len. 15]: A very good likeness in its way , but it wants force of character .
Parsing [sent. 12888 len. 11]: Good day to you , gentlemen ; good day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12889 len. 34]: When he has walked out , Mr. Guppy , in a great perspiration , nerves himself to the hasty completion of the taking down of the Galaxy Gallery , concluding with Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 12890 len. 30]: `` Tony , '' he says hurriedly to his astonished companion , `` let us be quick in putting the things together and in getting out of this place .
Parsing [sent. 12891 len. 40]: It were in vain longer to conceal from you , Tony , that between myself and one of the members of a swan-like aristocracy whom I now hold in my hand , there has been undivulged communication and association .
Parsing [sent. 12892 len. 14]: The time might have been when I might have revealed it to you .
Parsing [sent. 12893 len. 6]: It never will be more .
Parsing [sent. 12894 len. 37]: It is due alike to the oath I have taken , alike to the shattered idol , and alike to circumstances over which I have no control , that the whole should be buried in oblivion .
Parsing [sent. 12895 len. 46]: I charge you as a friend , by the interest you have ever testified in the fashionable intelligence , and by any little advances with which I may have been able to accommodate you , so to bury it without a word of inquiry ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12896 len. 34]: This charge Mr. Guppy delivers in a state little short of forensic lunacy , while his friend shows a dazed mind in his whole head of hair and even in his cultivated whiskers .
Parsing [sent. 12897 len. 17]: Chapter XL -- National and Domestic England has been in a dreadful state for some weeks .
Parsing [sent. 12898 len. 37]: Lord Coodle would go out , Sir Thomas Doodle would n't come in , and there being nobody in Great Britain -LRB- to speak of -RRB- except Coodle and Doodle , there has been no government .
Parsing [sent. 12899 len. 74]: It is a mercy that the hostile meeting between those two great men , which at one time seemed inevitable , did not come off , because if both pistols had taken effect , and Coodle and Doodle had killed each other , it is to be presumed that England must have waited to be governed until young Coodle and young Doodle , now in frocks and long stockings , were grown up .
Parsing [sent. 12900 len. 103]: This stupendous national calamity , however , was averted by Lord Coodle 's making the timely discovery that if in the heat of debate he had said that he scorned and despised the whole ignoble career of Sir Thomas Doodle , he had merely meant to say that party differences should never induce him to withhold from it the tribute of his warmest admiration ; while it as opportunely turned out , on the other hand , that Sir Thomas Doodle had in his own bosom expressly booked Lord Coodle to go down to posterity as the mirror of virtue and honour .
Parsing [sent. 12901 len. 74]: Still England has been some weeks in the dismal strait of having no pilot -LRB- as was well observed by Sir Leicester Dedlock -RRB- to weather the storm ; and the marvellous part of the matter is that England has not appeared to care very much about it , but has gone on eating and drinking and marrying and giving in marriage as the old world did in the days before the flood .
Parsing [sent. 12902 len. 27]: But Coodle knew the danger , and Doodle knew the danger , and all their followers and hangers-on had the clearest possible perception of the danger .
Parsing [sent. 12903 len. 37]: At last Sir Thomas Doodle has not only condescended to come in , but has done it handsomely , bringing in with him all his nephews , all his male cousins , and all his brothers-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 12904 len. 10]: So there is hope for the old ship yet .
Parsing [sent. 12905 len. 21]: Doodle has found that he must throw himself upon the country , chiefly in the form of sovereigns and beer .
Parsing [sent. 12906 len. 28]: In this metamorphosed state he is available in a good many places simultaneously and can throw himself upon a considerable portion of the country at one time .
Parsing [sent. 12907 len. 69]: Britannia being much occupied in pocketing Doodle in the form of sovereigns , and swallowing Doodle in the form of beer , and in swearing herself black in the face that she does neither -- plainly to the advancement of her glory and morality -- the London season comes to a sudden end , through all the Doodleites and Coodleites dispersing to assist Britannia in those religious exercises .
Parsing [sent. 12908 len. 48]: Hence Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper at Chesney Wold , foresees , though no instructions have yet come down , that the family may shortly be expected , together with a pretty large accession of cousins and others who can in any way assist the great Constitutional work .
Parsing [sent. 12909 len. 79]: And hence the stately old dame , taking Time by the forelock , leads him up and down the staircases , and along the galleries and passages , and through the rooms , to witness before he grows any older that everything is ready , that floors are rubbed bright , carpets spread , curtains shaken out , beds puffed and patted , still-room and kitchen cleared for action -- all things prepared as beseems the Dedlock dignity .
Parsing [sent. 12910 len. 16]: This present summer evening , as the sun goes down , the preparations are complete .
Parsing [sent. 12911 len. 26]: Dreary and solemn the old house looks , with so many appliances of habitation and with no inhabitants except the pictured forms upon the walls .
Parsing [sent. 12912 len. 104]: So did these come and go , a Dedlock in possession might have ruminated passing along ; so did they see this gallery hushed and quiet , as I see it now ; so think , as I think , of the gap that they would make in this domain when they were gone ; so find it , as I find it , difficult to believe that it could be without them ; so pass from my world , as I pass from theirs , now closing the reverberating door ; so leave no blank to miss them , and so die .
Parsing [sent. 12913 len. 51]: Through some of the fiery windows beautiful from without , and set , at this sunset hour , not in dull-grey stone but in a glorious house of gold , the light excluded at other windows pours in rich , lavish , overflowing like the summer plenty in the land .
Parsing [sent. 12914 len. 7]: Then do the frozen Dedlocks thaw .
Parsing [sent. 12915 len. 14]: Strange movements come upon their features as the shadows of leaves play there .
Parsing [sent. 12916 len. 12]: A dense justice in a corner is beguiled into a wink .
Parsing [sent. 12917 len. 15]: A staring baronet , with a truncheon , gets a dimple in his chin .
Parsing [sent. 12918 len. 27]: Down into the bosom of a stony shepherdess there steals a fleck of light and warmth that would have done it good a hundred years ago .
Parsing [sent. 12919 len. 36]: One ancestress of Volumnia , in high-heeled shoes , very like her -- casting the shadow of that virgin event before her full two centuries -- shoots out into a halo and becomes a saint .
Parsing [sent. 12920 len. 38]: A maid of honour of the court of Charles the Second , with large round eyes -LRB- and other charms to correspond -RRB- , seems to bathe in glowing water , and it ripples as it glows .
Parsing [sent. 12921 len. 9]: But the fire of the sun is dying .
Parsing [sent. 12922 len. 23]: Even now the floor is dusky , and shadow slowly mounts the walls , bringing the Dedlocks down like age and death .
Parsing [sent. 12923 len. 53]: And now , upon my Lady 's picture over the great chimney-piece , a weird shade falls from some old tree , that turns it pale , and flutters it , and looks as if a great arm held a veil or hood , watching an opportunity to draw it over her .
Parsing [sent. 12924 len. 23]: Higher and darker rises shadow on the wall -- now a red gloom on the ceiling -- now the fire is out .
Parsing [sent. 12925 len. 42]: All that prospect , which from the terrace looked so near , has moved solemnly away and changed -- not the first nor the last of beautiful things that look so near and will so change -- into a distant phantom .
Parsing [sent. 12926 len. 23]: Light mists arise , and the dew falls , and all the sweet scents in the garden are heavv in the air .
Parsing [sent. 12927 len. 16]: Now the woods settle into great masses as if they were each one profound tree .
Parsing [sent. 12928 len. 38]: And now the moon rises to separate them , and to glimmer here and there in horizontal lines behind their stems , and to make the avenue a pavement of light among high cathedral arches fantastically broken .
Parsing [sent. 12929 len. 24]: Now the moon is high ; and the great house , needing habitation more than ever , is like a body without life .
Parsing [sent. 12930 len. 31]: Now it is even awful , stealing through it , to think of the live people who have slept in the solitary bedrooms , to say nothing of the dead .
Parsing [sent. 12931 len. 81]: Now is the time for shadow , when every corner is a cavern and every downward step a pit , when the stained glass is reflected in pale and faded hues upon the floors , when anything and everything can be made of the heavy staircase beams excepting their own proper shapes , when the armour has dull lights upon it not easily to be distinguished from stealthy movement , and when barred helmets are frightfully suggestive of heads inside .
Parsing [sent. 12932 len. 32]: But of all the shadows in Chesney Wold , the shadow in the long drawing-room upon my Lady 's picture is the first to come , the last to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 12933 len. 25]: At this hour and by this light it changes into threatening hands raised up and menacing the handsome face with every breath that stirs .
Parsing [sent. 12934 len. 18]: `` She is not well , ma'am , '' says a groom in Mrs. Rouncewell 's audience-chamber .
Parsing [sent. 12935 len. 6]: `` My Lady not well !
Parsing [sent. 12936 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12937 len. 40]: `` Why , my Lady has been but poorly , ma'am , since she was last here -- I do n't mean with the family , ma'am , but when she was here as a bird of passage like .
Parsing [sent. 12938 len. 19]: My Lady has not been out much for her and has kept her room a good deal . ''
Parsing [sent. 12939 len. 21]: `` Chesney Wold , Thomas , '' rejoins the housekeeper with proud complacency , `` will set my Lady up !
Parsing [sent. 12940 len. 14]: There is no finer air and no healthier soil in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12941 len. 54]: Thomas may have his own personal opinions on this subject , probably hints them in his manner of smoothing his sleek head from the nape of his neck to his temples , but he forbears to express them further and retires to the servants ' hall to regale on cold meat-pie and ale .
Parsing [sent. 12942 len. 10]: This groom is the pilot-fish before the nobler shark .
Parsing [sent. 12943 len. 30]: Next evening , down come Sir Leicester and my Lady with their largest retinue , and down come the cousins and others from all the points of the compass .
Parsing [sent. 12944 len. 54]: Thenceforth for some weeks backward and forward rush mysterious men with no names , who fly about all those particular parts of the country on which Doodle is at present throwing himself in an auriferous and malty shower , but who are merely persons of a restless disposition and never do anything anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 12945 len. 11]: On these national occasions Sir Leicester finds the cousins useful .
Parsing [sent. 12946 len. 21]: A better man than the Honourable Bob Stables to meet the Hunt at dinner , there could not possibly be .
Parsing [sent. 12947 len. 35]: Better got up gentlemen than the other cousins to ride over to polling-booths and hustings here and there , and show themselves on the side of England , it would be hard to find .
Parsing [sent. 12948 len. 64]: Volumnia is a little dim , but she is of the true descent ; and there are many who appreciate her sprightly conversation , her French conundrums so old as to have become in the cycles of time almost new again , the honour of taking the fair Dedlock in to dinner , or even the privilege of her hand in the dance .
Parsing [sent. 12949 len. 28]: On these national occasions dancing may be a patriotic service , and Volumnia is constantly seen hopping about for the good of an ungrateful and unpensioning country .
Parsing [sent. 12950 len. 25]: My Lady takes no great pains to entertain the numerous guests , and being still unwell , rarely appears until late in the day .
Parsing [sent. 12951 len. 25]: But at all the dismal dinners , leaden lunches , basilisk balls , and other melancholy pageants , her mere appearance is a relief .
Parsing [sent. 12952 len. 53]: As to Sir Leicester , he conceives it utterly impossible that anything can be wanting , in any direction , by any one who has the good fortune to be received under that roof ; and in a state of sublime satisfaction , he moves among the company , a magnificent refrigerator .
Parsing [sent. 12953 len. 50]: Daily the cousins trot through dust and canter over roadside turf , away to hustings and polling-booths -LRB- with leather gloves and hunting-whips for the counties and kid gloves and riding-canes for the boroughs -RRB- , and daily bring back reports on which Sir Leicester holds forth after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 12954 len. 18]: Daily the restless men who have no occupation in life present the appearance of being rather busy .
Parsing [sent. 12955 len. 38]: Daily Volumnia has a little cousinly talk with Sir Leicester on the state of the nation , from which Sir Leicester is disposed to conclude that Volumnia is a more reflecting woman than he had thought her .
Parsing [sent. 12956 len. 8]: `` How are we getting on ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12957 len. 8]: says Miss Volumnia , clasping her hands .
Parsing [sent. 12958 len. 6]: `` ARE we safe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12959 len. 24]: The mighty business is nearly over by this time , and Doodle will throw himself off the country in a few days more .
Parsing [sent. 12960 len. 22]: Sir Leicester has just appeared in the long drawing-room after dinner , a bright particular star surrounded by clouds of cousins .
Parsing [sent. 12961 len. 23]: `` Volumnia , '' replies Sir Leicester , who has a list in his hand , `` we are doing tolerably . ''
Parsing [sent. 12962 len. 5]: `` Only tolerably ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12963 len. 18]: Although it is summer weather , Sir Leicester always has his own particular fire in the evening .
Parsing [sent. 12964 len. 55]: He takes his usual screened seat near it and repeats with much firmness and a little displeasure , as who should say , I am not a common man , and when I say tolerably , it must not be understood as a common expression , `` Volumnia , we are doing tolerably . ''
Parsing [sent. 12965 len. 16]: `` At least there is no opposition to YOU , '' Volumnia asserts with confidence .
Parsing [sent. 12966 len. 5]: `` No , Volumnia .
Parsing [sent. 12967 len. 28]: This distracted country has lost its senses in many respects , I grieve to say , but -- '' `` It is not so mad as that .
Parsing [sent. 12968 len. 8]: I am glad to hear it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12969 len. 10]: Volumnia 's finishing the sentence restores her to favour .
Parsing [sent. 12970 len. 32]: Sir Leicester , with a gracious inclination of his head , seems to say to himself , `` A sensible woman this , on the whole , though occasionally precipitate . ''
Parsing [sent. 12971 len. 42]: In fact , as to this question of opposition , the fair Dedlock 's observation was superfluous , Sir Leicester on these occasions always delivering in his own candidateship , as a kind of handsome wholesale order to be promptly executed .
Parsing [sent. 12972 len. 52]: Two other little seats that belong to him he treats as retail orders of less importance , merely sending down the men and signifying to the tradespeople , `` You will have the goodness to make these materials into two members of Parliament and to send them home when done . ''
Parsing [sent. 12973 len. 39]: `` I regret to say , Volumnia , that in many places the people have shown a bad spirit , and that this opposition to the government has been of a most determined and most implacable description . ''
Parsing [sent. 12974 len. 4]: `` W-r-retches ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12975 len. 3]: says Volumnia .
Parsing [sent. 12976 len. 77]: `` Even , '' proceeds Sir Leicester , glancing at the circumjacent cousins on sofas and ottomans , `` even in many -- in fact , in most -- of those places in which the government has carried it against a faction -- '' -LRB- Note , by the way , that the Coodleites are always a faction with the Doodleites , and that the Doodleites occupy exactly the same position towards the Coodleites . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 12977 len. 34]: -- Even in them I am shocked , for the credit of Englishmen , to be constrained to inform you that the party has not triumphed without being put to an enormous expense .
Parsing [sent. 12978 len. 25]: Hundreds , '' says Sir Leicester , eyeing the cousins with increasing dignity and swelling indignation , `` hundreds of thousands of pounds ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12979 len. 44]: If Volumnia have a fault , it is the fault of being a trifle too innocent , seeing that the innocence which would go extremely well with a sash and tucker is a little out of keeping with the rouge and pearl necklace .
Parsing [sent. 12980 len. 14]: Howbeit , impelled by innocence , she asks , `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 12981 len. 12]: `` Volumnia , '' remonstrates Sir Leicester with his utmost severity .
Parsing [sent. 12982 len. 4]: `` Volumnia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12983 len. 21]: `` No , no , I do n't mean what for , '' cries Volumnia with her favourite little scream .
Parsing [sent. 12984 len. 6]: `` How stupid I am !
Parsing [sent. 12985 len. 7]: I mean what a pity ! ''
Parsing [sent. 12986 len. 20]: `` I am glad , '' returns Sir Leicester , `` that you do mean what a pity . ''
Parsing [sent. 12987 len. 23]: Volumnia hastens to express her opinion that the shocking people ought to be tried as traitors and made to support the party .
Parsing [sent. 12988 len. 27]: `` I am glad , Volumnia , '' repeats Sir Leicester , unmindful of these mollifying sentiments , `` that you do mean what a pity .
Parsing [sent. 12989 len. 7]: It is disgraceful to the electors .
Parsing [sent. 12990 len. 21]: But as you , though inadvertently and without intending so unreasonable a question , asked me ` what for ? '
Parsing [sent. 12991 len. 6]: let me reply to you .
Parsing [sent. 12992 len. 4]: For necessary expenses .
Parsing [sent. 12993 len. 21]: And I trust to your good sense , Volumnia , not to pursue the subject , here or elsewhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 12994 len. 90]: Sir Leicester feels it incumbent on him to observe a crushing aspect towards Volumnia because it is whispered abroad that these necessary expenses will , in some two hundred election petitions , be unpleasantly connected with the word bribery , and because some graceless jokers have consequently suggested the omission from the Church service of the ordinary supplication in behalf of the High Court of Parliament and have recommended instead that the prayers of the congregation be requested for six hundred and fifty-eight gentlemen in a very unhealthy state .
Parsing [sent. 12995 len. 34]: `` I suppose , '' observes Volumnia , having taken a little time to recover her spirits after her late castigation , `` I suppose Mr. Tulkinghorn has been worked to death . ''
Parsing [sent. 12996 len. 25]: `` I do n't know , '' says Sir Leicester , opening his eyes , `` why Mr. Tulkinghorn should be worked to death .
Parsing [sent. 12997 len. 12]: I do n't know what Mr. Tulkinghorn 's engagements may be .
Parsing [sent. 12998 len. 7]: He is not a candidate . ''
Parsing [sent. 12999 len. 9]: Volumnia had thought he might have been employed .
Parsing [sent. 13000 len. 13]: Sir Leicester could desire to know by whom , and what for .
Parsing [sent. 13001 len. 16]: Volumnia , abashed again , suggests , by somebody -- to advise and make arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 13002 len. 19]: Sir Leicester is not aware that any client of Mr. Tulkinghorn has been in need of his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 13003 len. 39]: Lady Dedlock , seated at an open window with her arm upon its cushioned ledge and looking out at the evening shadows falling on the park , has seemed to attend since the lawyer 's name was mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 13004 len. 72]: A languid cousin with a moustache in a state of extreme debility now observes from his couch that man told him ya'as ` dy that Tulkinghorn had gone down t ' that iron place t ' give legal ` pinion ` bout something , and that contest being over t ' day , ` twould be highly jawlly thing if Tulkinghorn should ` pear with news that Coodle man was floored .
Parsing [sent. 13005 len. 21]: Mercury in attendance with coffee informs Sir Leicester , hereupon , that Mr. Tulkinghorn has arrived and is taking dinner .
Parsing [sent. 13006 len. 17]: My Lady turns her head inward for the moment , then looks out again as before .
Parsing [sent. 13007 len. 11]: Volumnia is charmed to hear that her delight is come .
Parsing [sent. 13008 len. 25]: He is so original , such a stolid creature , such an immense being for knowing all sorts of things and never telling them !
Parsing [sent. 13009 len. 10]: Volumnia is persuaded that he must be a Freemason .
Parsing [sent. 13010 len. 28]: Is sure he is at the head of a lodge , and wears short aprons , and is made a perfect idol of with candlesticks and trowels .
Parsing [sent. 13011 len. 17]: These lively remarks the fair Dedlock delivers in her youthful manner , while making a purse .
Parsing [sent. 13012 len. 17]: `` He has not been here once , '' she adds , `` since I came .
Parsing [sent. 13013 len. 14]: I really had some thoughts of breaking my heart for the inconstant creature .
Parsing [sent. 13014 len. 13]: I had almost made up my mind that he was dead . ''
Parsing [sent. 13015 len. 41]: It may be the gathering gloom of evening , or it may be the darker gloom within herself , but a shade is on my Lady 's face , as if she thought , `` I would he were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13016 len. 21]: `` Mr. Tulkinghorn , '' says Sir Leicester , `` is always welcome here and always discreet wheresoever he is .
Parsing [sent. 13017 len. 10]: A very valuable person , and deservedly respected . ''
Parsing [sent. 13018 len. 13]: The debilitated cousin supposes he is '' ` normously rich fler . ''
Parsing [sent. 13019 len. 20]: `` He has a stake in the country , '' says Sir Leicester , `` I have no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 13020 len. 24]: He is , of course , handsomely paid , and he associates almost on a footing of equality with the highest society . ''
Parsing [sent. 13021 len. 3]: Everybody starts .
Parsing [sent. 13022 len. 8]: For a gun is fired close by .
Parsing [sent. 13023 len. 9]: `` Good gracious , what 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13024 len. 8]: cries Volumnia with her little withered scream .
Parsing [sent. 13025 len. 9]: `` A rat , '' says my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 13026 len. 8]: `` And they have shot him . ''
Parsing [sent. 13027 len. 12]: Enter Mr. Tulkinghorn , followed by Mercuries with lamps and candles .
Parsing [sent. 13028 len. 15]: `` No , no , '' says Sir Leicester , `` I think not .
Parsing [sent. 13029 len. 11]: My Lady , do you object to the twilight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13030 len. 9]: On the contrary , my Lady prefers it .
Parsing [sent. 13031 len. 4]: `` Volumnia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13032 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13033 len. 15]: Nothing is so delicious to Volumnia as to sit and talk in the dark .
Parsing [sent. 13034 len. 11]: `` Then take them away , '' says Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 13035 len. 8]: `` Tulkinghorn , I beg your pardon .
Parsing [sent. 13036 len. 6]: How do you do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13037 len. 49]: Mr. Tulkinghorn with his usual leisurely ease advances , renders his passing homage to my Lady , shakes Sir Leicester 's hand , and subsides into the chair proper to him when he has anything to communicate , on the opposite side of the Baronet 's little newspaper-table .
Parsing [sent. 13038 len. 21]: Sir Leicester is apprehensive that my Lady , not being very well , will take cold at that open window .
Parsing [sent. 13039 len. 16]: My Lady is obliged to him , but would rather sit there for the air .
Parsing [sent. 13040 len. 16]: Sir Leicester rises , adjusts her scarf about her , and returns to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 13041 len. 11]: Mr. Tulkinghorn in the meanwhile takes a pinch of snuff .
Parsing [sent. 13042 len. 8]: `` Now , '' says Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 13043 len. 8]: `` How has that contest gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13044 len. 8]: `` Oh , hollow from the beginning .
Parsing [sent. 13045 len. 4]: Not a chance .
Parsing [sent. 13046 len. 8]: They have brought in both their people .
Parsing [sent. 13047 len. 8]: You are beaten out of all reason .
Parsing [sent. 13048 len. 5]: Three to one . ''
Parsing [sent. 13049 len. 22]: It is a part of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's policy and mastery to have no political opinions ; indeed , NO opinions .
Parsing [sent. 13050 len. 15]: Therefore he says `` you '' are beaten , and not `` we . ''
Parsing [sent. 13051 len. 6]: Sir Leicester is majestically wroth .
Parsing [sent. 13052 len. 8]: Volumnia never heard of such a thing .
Parsing [sent. 13053 len. 23]: ` The debilitated cousin holds that it 's sort of thing that 's sure tapn slongs votes -- giv 'n -- Mob .
Parsing [sent. 13054 len. 39]: `` It 's the place , you know , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn goes on to say in the fast-increasing darkness when there is silence again , `` where they wanted to put up Mrs. Rouncewell 's son . ''
Parsing [sent. 13055 len. 31]: `` A proposal which , as you correctly informed me at the time , he had the becoming taste and perception , '' observes Sir Leicester , `` to decline .
Parsing [sent. 13056 len. 46]: I can not say that I by any means approve of the sentiments expressed by Mr. Rouncewell when he was here for some half-hour in this room , but there was a sense of propriety in his decision which I am glad to acknowledge . ''
Parsing [sent. 13057 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13058 len. 4]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 13059 len. 17]: `` It did not prevent him from being very active in this election , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 13060 len. 10]: Sir Leicester is distinctly heard to gasp before speaking .
Parsing [sent. 13061 len. 6]: `` Did I understand you ?
Parsing [sent. 13062 len. 15]: Did you say that Mr. Rouncewell had been very active in this election ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13063 len. 5]: `` Uncommonly active . ''
Parsing [sent. 13064 len. 13]: `` Against -- '' `` Oh , dear yes , against you .
Parsing [sent. 13065 len. 7]: He is a very good speaker .
Parsing [sent. 13066 len. 4]: Plain and emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 13067 len. 11]: He made a damaging effect , and has great influence .
Parsing [sent. 13068 len. 14]: In the business part of the proceedings he carried all before him . ''
Parsing [sent. 13069 len. 21]: It is evident to the whole company , though nobody can see him , that Sir Leicester is staring majestically .
Parsing [sent. 13070 len. 21]: `` And he was much assisted , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn as a wind-up , `` by his son . ''
Parsing [sent. 13071 len. 8]: `` By his son , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13072 len. 7]: repeats Sir Leicester with awful politeness .
Parsing [sent. 13073 len. 6]: `` By his son . ''
Parsing [sent. 13074 len. 17]: `` The son who wished to marry the young woman in my Lady 's service ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13075 len. 4]: `` That son .
Parsing [sent. 13076 len. 6]: He has but one . ''
Parsing [sent. 13077 len. 75]: `` Then upon my honour , '' says Sir Leicester after a terrific pause during which he has been heard to snort and felt to stare , `` then upon my honour , upon my life , upon my reputation and principles , the floodgates of society are burst open , and the waters have -- a -- obliterated the landmarks of the framework of the cohesion by which things are held together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13078 len. 6]: General burst of cousinly indignation .
Parsing [sent. 13079 len. 23]: Volumnia thinks it is really high time , you know , for somebody in power to step in and do something strong .
Parsing [sent. 13080 len. 13]: Debilitated cousin thinks -- country 's going -- Dayvle -- steeple-chase pace .
Parsing [sent. 13081 len. 24]: `` I beg , '' says Sir Leicester in a breathless condition , `` that we may not comment further on this circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 13082 len. 4]: Comment is superfluous .
Parsing [sent. 13083 len. 41]: My Lady , let me suggest in reference to that young woman -- '' `` I have no intention , '' observes my Lady from her window in a low but decided tone , `` of parting with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 13084 len. 12]: `` That was not my meaning , '' returns Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 13085 len. 10]: `` I am glad to hear you say so .
Parsing [sent. 13086 len. 26]: I would suggest that as you think her worthy of your patronage , you should exert your influence to keep her from these dangerous hands .
Parsing [sent. 13087 len. 28]: You might show her what violence would be done in such association to her duties and principles , and you might preserve her for a better fate .
Parsing [sent. 13088 len. 49]: You might point out to her that she probably would , in good time , find a husband at Chesney Wold by whom she would not be -- '' Sir Leicester adds , after a moment 's consideration , `` dragged from the altars of her forefathers . ''
Parsing [sent. 13089 len. 18]: These remarks he offers with his unvarying politeness and deference when he addresses himself to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 13090 len. 8]: She merely moves her head in reply .
Parsing [sent. 13091 len. 26]: The moon is rising , and where she sits there is a little stream of cold pale light , in which her head is seen .
Parsing [sent. 13092 len. 28]: `` It is worthy of remark , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` however , that these people are , in their way , very proud . ''
Parsing [sent. 13093 len. 4]: `` Proud ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13094 len. 6]: Sir Leicester doubts his hearing .
Parsing [sent. 13095 len. 37]: `` I should not be surprised if they all voluntarily abandoned the girl -- yes , lover and all -- instead of her abandoning them , supposing she remained at Chesney Wold under such circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 13096 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13097 len. 5]: says Sir Leicester tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 13098 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 13099 len. 7]: You should know , Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 13100 len. 7]: You have been among them . ''
Parsing [sent. 13101 len. 17]: `` Really , Sir Leicester , '' returns the lawyer , `` I state the fact .
Parsing [sent. 13102 len. 16]: Why , I could tell you a story -- with Lady Dedlock 's permission . ''
Parsing [sent. 13103 len. 10]: Her head concedes it , and Volumnia is enchanted .
Parsing [sent. 13104 len. 3]: A story !
Parsing [sent. 13105 len. 11]: Oh , he is going to tell something at last !
Parsing [sent. 13106 len. 8]: A ghost in it , Volumnia hopes ?
Parsing [sent. 13107 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 13108 len. 6]: Real flesh and blood . ''
Parsing [sent. 13109 len. 27]: Mr. Tulkinghorn stops for an instant and repeats with some little emphasis grafted upon his usual monotony , `` Real flesh and blood , Miss Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13110 len. 13]: Sir Leicester , these particulars have only lately become known to me .
Parsing [sent. 13111 len. 5]: They are very brief .
Parsing [sent. 13112 len. 7]: They exemplify what I have said .
Parsing [sent. 13113 len. 7]: I suppress names for the present .
Parsing [sent. 13114 len. 12]: Lady Dedlock will not think me ill-bred , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13115 len. 20]: By the light of the fire , which is low , he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 13116 len. 15]: By the light of the moon Lady Dedlock can be seen , perfecfly still .
Parsing [sent. 13117 len. 36]: `` A townsman of this Mrs. Rouncewell , a man in exactly parallel circumstances as I am told , had the good fortune to have a daughter who attracted the notice of a great lady .
Parsing [sent. 13118 len. 27]: I speak of really a great lady , not merely great to him , but married to a gentleman of your condition , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 13119 len. 32]: Sir Leicester condescendingly says , `` Yes , Mr. Tulkinghorn , '' implying that then she must have appeared of very considerable moral dimensions indeed in the eyes of an iron-master .
Parsing [sent. 13120 len. 30]: `` The lady was wealthy and beautiful , and had a liking for the girl , and treated her with great kindness , and kept her always near her .
Parsing [sent. 13121 len. 19]: Now this lady preserved a secret under all her greatness , which she had preserved for many years .
Parsing [sent. 13122 len. 33]: In fact , she had in early life been engaged to marry a young rake -- he was a captain in the army -- nothing connected with whom came to any good .
Parsing [sent. 13123 len. 21]: She never did marry him , but she gave birth to a child of which he was the father . ''
Parsing [sent. 13124 len. 15]: By the light of the fire he can be seen looking towards the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 13125 len. 15]: By the moonlight , Lady Dedlock can be seen in profile , perfectly still .
Parsing [sent. 13126 len. 30]: `` The captain in the army being dead , she believed herself safe ; but a train of circumstances with which I need not trouble you led to discovery .
Parsing [sent. 13127 len. 46]: As I received the story , they began in an imprudence on her own part one day when she was taken by surprise , which shows how difficult it is for the firmest of us -LRB- she was very firm -RRB- to be always guarded .
Parsing [sent. 13128 len. 26]: There was great domestic trouble and amazement , you may suppose ; I leave you to imagine , Sir Leicester , the husband 's grief .
Parsing [sent. 13129 len. 8]: But that is not the present point .
Parsing [sent. 13130 len. 35]: When Mr. Rouncewell 's townsman heard of the disclosure , he no more allowed the girl to be patronized and honoured than he would have suffered her to be trodden underfoot before his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13131 len. 19]: Such was his pride , that he indignantly took her away , as if from reproach and disgrace .
Parsing [sent. 13132 len. 22]: He had no sense of the honour done him and his daughter by the lady 's condescension ; not the least .
Parsing [sent. 13133 len. 18]: He resented the girl 's position , as if the lady had been the commonest of commoners .
Parsing [sent. 13134 len. 5]: That is the story .
Parsing [sent. 13135 len. 11]: I hope Lady Dedlock will excuse its painful nature . ''
Parsing [sent. 13136 len. 16]: There are various opinions on the merits , more or less conflicting with Volumnia 's .
Parsing [sent. 13137 len. 22]: That fair young creature can not believe there ever was any such lady and rejects the whole history on the threshold .
Parsing [sent. 13138 len. 26]: The majority incline to the debilitated cousin 's sentiment , which is in few words -- `` no business -- Rouncewell 's fernal townsman . ''
Parsing [sent. 13139 len. 24]: Sir Leicester generally refers back in his mind to Wat Tyler and arranges a sequence of events on a plan of his own .
Parsing [sent. 13140 len. 40]: There is not much conversation in all , for late hours have been kept at Chesney Wold since the necessary expenses elsewhere began , and this is the first night in many on which the family have been alone .
Parsing [sent. 13141 len. 15]: It is past ten when Sir Leicester begs Mr. Tulkinghorn to ring for candles .
Parsing [sent. 13142 len. 36]: Then the stream of moonlight has swelled into a lake , and then Lady Dedlock for the first time moves , and rises , and comes forward to a table for a glass of water .
Parsing [sent. 13143 len. 75]: Winking cousins , bat-like in the candle glare , crowd round to give it ; Volumnia -LRB- always ready for something better if procurable -RRB- takes another , a very mild sip of which contents her ; Lady Dedlock , graceful , self-possessed , looked after by admiring eyes , passes away slowly down the long perspective by the side of that nymph , not at all improving her as a question of contrast .
Parsing [sent. 13144 len. 26]: Chapter XLI -- In Mr. Tulkinghorn 's Room Mr. Tulkinghorn arrives in his turret-room a little breathed by the journey up , though leisurely performed .
Parsing [sent. 13145 len. 28]: There is an expression on his face as if he had discharged his mind of some grave matter and were , in his close way , satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 13146 len. 37]: To say of a man so severely and strictly self-repressed that he is triumphant would be to do him as great an injustice as to suppose him troubled with love or sentiment or any romantic weakness .
Parsing [sent. 13147 len. 5]: He is sedately satisfied .
Parsing [sent. 13148 len. 36]: Perhaps there is a rather increased sense of power upon him as he loosely grasps one of his veinous wrists with his other hand and holding it behind his back walks noiselessly up and down .
Parsing [sent. 13149 len. 18]: There is a capacious writing-table in the room on which is a pretty large accumulation of papers .
Parsing [sent. 13150 len. 47]: The green lamp is lighted , his reading-glasses lie upon the desk , the easy-chair is wheeled up to it , and it would seem as though he had intended to bestow an hour or so upon these claims on his attention before going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 13151 len. 11]: But he happens not to be in a business mind .
Parsing [sent. 13152 len. 45]: After a glance at the documents awaiting his notice -- with his head bent low over the table , the old man 's sight for print or writing being defective at night -- he opens the French window and steps out upon the leads .
Parsing [sent. 13153 len. 35]: There he again walks slowly up and down in the same attitude , subsiding , if a man so cool may have any need to subside , from the story he has related downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 13154 len. 30]: The time was once when men as knowing as Mr. Tulkinghorn would walk on turret-tops in the starlight and look up into the sky to read their fortunes there .
Parsing [sent. 13155 len. 19]: Hosts of stars are visible to-night , though their brilliancy is eclipsed by the splendour of the moon .
Parsing [sent. 13156 len. 31]: If he be seeking his own star as he methodically turns and turns upon the leads , it should be but a pale one to be so rustily represented below .
Parsing [sent. 13157 len. 20]: If he be tracing out his destiny , that may be written in other characters nearer to his hand .
Parsing [sent. 13158 len. 39]: As he paces the leads with his eyes most probably as high above his thoughts as they are high above the earth , he is suddenly stopped in passing the window by two eyes that meet his own .
Parsing [sent. 13159 len. 27]: The ceiling of his room is rather low ; and the upper part of the door , which is opposite the window , is of glass .
Parsing [sent. 13160 len. 24]: There is an inner baize door , too , but the night being warm he did not close it when he came upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 13161 len. 17]: These eyes that meet his own are looking in through the glass from the corridor outside .
Parsing [sent. 13162 len. 5]: He knows them well .
Parsing [sent. 13163 len. 24]: The blood has not flushed into his face so suddenly and redly for many a long year as when he recognizes Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13164 len. 19]: He steps into the room , and she comes in too , closing both the doors behind her .
Parsing [sent. 13165 len. 12]: There is a wild disturbance -- is it fear or anger ?
Parsing [sent. 13166 len. 5]: -- in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13167 len. 16]: In her carriage and all else she looks as she looked downstairs two hours ago .
Parsing [sent. 13168 len. 9]: Is it fear or is it anger now ?
Parsing [sent. 13169 len. 6]: He can not be sure .
Parsing [sent. 13170 len. 10]: Both might be as pale , both as intent .
Parsing [sent. 13171 len. 5]: `` Lady Dedlock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13172 len. 21]: She does not speak at first , nor even when she has slowly dropped into the easy-chair by the table .
Parsing [sent. 13173 len. 10]: They look at each other , like two pictures .
Parsing [sent. 13174 len. 13]: `` Why have you told my story to so many persons ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13175 len. 18]: `` Lady Dedlock , it was necessary for me to inform you that I knew it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13176 len. 9]: `` How long have you known it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13177 len. 17]: `` I have suspected it a long while -- fully known it a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 13178 len. 4]: `` Months ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13179 len. 4]: `` Days . ''
Parsing [sent. 13180 len. 34]: He stands before her with one hand on a chair-back and the other in his old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill , exactly as he has stood before her at any time since her marriage .
Parsing [sent. 13181 len. 37]: The same formal politeness , the same composed deference that might as well be defiance ; the whole man the same dark , cold object , at the same distance , which nothing has ever diminished .
Parsing [sent. 13182 len. 10]: `` Is this true concerning the poor girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13183 len. 14]: He slightly inclines and advances his head as not quite understanding the question .
Parsing [sent. 13184 len. 7]: `` You know what you related .
Parsing [sent. 13185 len. 4]: Is it true ?
Parsing [sent. 13186 len. 8]: Do her friends know my story also ?
Parsing [sent. 13187 len. 6]: Is it the town-talk yet ?
Parsing [sent. 13188 len. 13]: Is it chalked upon the walls and cried in the streets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13189 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 13190 len. 8]: Anger , and fear , and shame .
Parsing [sent. 13191 len. 4]: All three contending .
Parsing [sent. 13192 len. 12]: What power this woman has to keep these raging passions down !
Parsing [sent. 13193 len. 30]: Mr. Tulkinghorn 's thoughts take such form as he looks at her , with his ragged grey eyebrows a hair 's breadth more contracted than usual under her gaze .
Parsing [sent. 13194 len. 6]: `` No , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13195 len. 22]: That was a hypothetical case , arising out of Sir Leicester 's unconsciously carrying the matter with so high a hand .
Parsing [sent. 13196 len. 16]: But it would be a real case if they knew -- what we know . ''
Parsing [sent. 13197 len. 10]: `` Then they do not know it yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13198 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 13199 len. 15]: `` Can I save the poor girl from injury before they know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13200 len. 24]: `` Really , Lady Dedlock , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn replies , `` I can not give a satisfactory opinion on that point . ''
Parsing [sent. 13201 len. 32]: And he thinks , with the interest of attentive curiosity , as he watches the struggle in her breast , `` The power and force of this woman are astonishing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13202 len. 35]: `` Sir , '' she says , for the moment obliged to set her lips with all the energy she has , that she may speak distinctly , `` I will make it plainer .
Parsing [sent. 13203 len. 8]: I do not dispute your hypothetical case .
Parsing [sent. 13204 len. 22]: I anticipated it , and felt its truth as strongly as you can do , when I saw Mr. Rouncewell here .
Parsing [sent. 13205 len. 46]: I knew very well that if he could have had the power of seeing me as I was , he would consider the poor girl tarnished by having for a moment been , although most innocently , the subject of my great and distinguished patronage .
Parsing [sent. 13206 len. 53]: But I have an interest in her , or I should rather say -- no longer belonging to this place -- I had , and if you can find so much consideration for the woman under your foot as to remember that , she will be very sensible of your mercy . ''
Parsing [sent. 13207 len. 22]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , profoundly attentive , throws this off with a shrug of self-depreciation and contracts his eyebrows a little more .
Parsing [sent. 13208 len. 17]: `` You have prepared me for my exposure , and I thank you for that too .
Parsing [sent. 13209 len. 9]: Is there anything that you require of me ?
Parsing [sent. 13210 len. 32]: Is there any claim that I can release or any charge or trouble that I can spare my husband in obtaining HIS release by certifying to the exactness of your discovery ?
Parsing [sent. 13211 len. 14]: I will write anything , here and now , that you will dictate .
Parsing [sent. 13212 len. 8]: I am ready to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13213 len. 22]: And she would do it , thinks the lawver , watchful of the firm hand with which she takes the pen !
Parsing [sent. 13214 len. 10]: `` I will not trouble you , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13215 len. 5]: Pray spare yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 13216 len. 11]: `` I have long expected this , as you know .
Parsing [sent. 13217 len. 11]: I neither wish to spare myself nor to be spared .
Parsing [sent. 13218 len. 12]: You can do nothing worse to me than you have done .
Parsing [sent. 13219 len. 6]: Do what remains now . ''
Parsing [sent. 13220 len. 11]: `` Lady Dedlock , there is nothing to be done .
Parsing [sent. 13221 len. 15]: I will take leave to say a few words when you have finished . ''
Parsing [sent. 13222 len. 30]: Their need for watching one another should be over now , but they do it all this time , and the stars watch them both through the opened window .
Parsing [sent. 13223 len. 23]: Away in the moonlight lie the woodland fields at rest , and the wide house is as quiet as the narrow one .
Parsing [sent. 13224 len. 4]: The narrow one !
Parsing [sent. 13225 len. 28]: Where are the digger and the spade , this peaceful night , destined to add the last great secret to the many secrets of the Tulkinghorn existence ?
Parsing [sent. 13226 len. 12]: Is the man born yet , is the spade wrought yet ?
Parsing [sent. 13227 len. 21]: Curious questions to consider , more curious perhaps not to consider , under the watching stars upon a summer night .
Parsing [sent. 13228 len. 24]: `` Of repentance or remorse or any feeling of mine , '' Lady Dedlock presently proceeds , `` I say not a word .
Parsing [sent. 13229 len. 11]: If I were not dumb , you would be deaf .
Parsing [sent. 13230 len. 5]: Let that go by .
Parsing [sent. 13231 len. 8]: It is not for your ears . ''
Parsing [sent. 13232 len. 19]: He makes a feint of offering a protest , but she sweeps it away with her disdainful hand .
Parsing [sent. 13233 len. 14]: `` Of other and very different things I come to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 13234 len. 11]: My jewels are all in their proper places of keeping .
Parsing [sent. 13235 len. 6]: They will be found there .
Parsing [sent. 13236 len. 5]: So , my dresses .
Parsing [sent. 13237 len. 8]: So , all the valuables I have .
Parsing [sent. 13238 len. 17]: Some ready money I had with me , please to say , but no large amount .
Parsing [sent. 13239 len. 16]: I did not wear my own dress , in order that I might avoid observation .
Parsing [sent. 13240 len. 7]: I went to be henceforward lost .
Parsing [sent. 13241 len. 4]: Make this known .
Parsing [sent. 13242 len. 9]: I leave no other charge with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 13243 len. 15]: `` Excuse me , Lady Dedlock , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , quite unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 13244 len. 10]: `` I am not sure that I understand you .
Parsing [sent. 13245 len. 12]: You want -- '' `` To be lost to all here .
Parsing [sent. 13246 len. 6]: I leave Chesney Wold to-night .
Parsing [sent. 13247 len. 6]: I go this hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 13248 len. 6]: Mr. Tulkinghorn shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 13249 len. 22]: She rises , but he , without moving hand from chair-back or from old-fashioned waistcoat and shirt-frill , shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 13250 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 13251 len. 8]: Not go as I have said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13252 len. 12]: `` No , Lady Dedlock , '' he very calmly replies .
Parsing [sent. 13253 len. 12]: `` Do you know the relief that my disappearance will be ?
Parsing [sent. 13254 len. 22]: Have you forgotten the stain and blot upon this place , and where it is , and who it is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13255 len. 12]: `` No , Lady Dedlock , not by any means . ''
Parsing [sent. 13256 len. 63]: Without deigning to rejoin , she moves to the inner door and has it in her hand when he says to her , without himself stirring hand or foot or raising his voice , `` Lady Dedlock , have the goodness to stop and hear me , or before you reach the staircase I shall ring the alarm-bell and rouse the house .
Parsing [sent. 13257 len. 21]: And then I must speak out before every guest and servant , every man and woman , in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13258 len. 5]: He has conquered her .
Parsing [sent. 13259 len. 14]: She falters , trembles , and puts her hand confusedly to her head .
Parsing [sent. 13260 len. 34]: Slight tokens these in any one else , but when so practised an eye as Mr. Tulkinghorn 's sees indecision for a moment in such a subject , he thoroughly knows its value .
Parsing [sent. 13261 len. 28]: He promptly says again , `` Have the goodness to hear me , Lady Dedlock , '' and motions to the chair from which she has risen .
Parsing [sent. 13262 len. 13]: She hesitates , but he motions again , and she sits down .
Parsing [sent. 13263 len. 30]: `` The relations between us are of an unfortunate description , Lady Dedlock ; but as they are not of my making , I will not apologize for them .
Parsing [sent. 13264 len. 39]: The position I hold in reference to Sir Leicester is so well known to you that I can hardly imagine but that I must long have appeared in your eyes the natural person to make this discovery . ''
Parsing [sent. 13265 len. 27]: `` Sir , '' she returns without looking up from the ground on which her eyes are now fixed , `` I had better have gone .
Parsing [sent. 13266 len. 12]: It would have been far better not to have detained me .
Parsing [sent. 13267 len. 8]: I have no more to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 13268 len. 17]: `` Excuse me , Lady Dedlock , if I add a little more to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 13269 len. 12]: `` I wish to hear it at the window , then .
Parsing [sent. 13270 len. 9]: I ca n't breathe where I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 13271 len. 41]: His jealous glance as she walks that way betrays an instant 's misgiving that she may have it in her thoughts to leap over , and dashing against ledge and cornice , strike her life out upon the terrace below .
Parsing [sent. 13272 len. 40]: But a moment 's observation of her figure as she stands in the window without any support , looking out at the stars -- not up-gloomily out at those stars which are low in the heavens , reassures him .
Parsing [sent. 13273 len. 15]: By facing round as she has moved , he stands a little behind her .
Parsing [sent. 13274 len. 24]: `` Lady Dedlock , I have not yet been able to come to a decision satisfactory to myself on the course before me .
Parsing [sent. 13275 len. 13]: I am not clear what to do or how to act next .
Parsing [sent. 13276 len. 31]: I must request you , in the meantime , to keep your secret as you have kept it so long and not to wonder that I keep it too . ''
Parsing [sent. 13277 len. 9]: He pauses , but she makes no reply .
Parsing [sent. 13278 len. 7]: `` Pardon me , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13279 len. 6]: This is an important subject .
Parsing [sent. 13280 len. 9]: You are honouring me with your attention ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13281 len. 6]: `` I am . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 13282 len. 4]: ` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 13283 len. 16]: I might have known it from what I have seen of your strength of character .
Parsing [sent. 13284 len. 30]: I ought not to have asked the question , but I have the habit of making sure of my ground , step by step , as I go on .
Parsing [sent. 13285 len. 13]: The sole consideration in this unhappy case is Sir Leicester . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 13286 len. 32]: ` Then why , '' she asks in a low voice and without removing her gloomy look from those distant stars , `` do you detain me in his house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13287 len. 7]: `` Because he IS the consideration .
Parsing [sent. 13288 len. 54]: Lady Dedlock , I have no occasion to tell you that Sir Leicester is a very proud man , that his reliance upon you is implicit , that the fall of that moon out of the sky would not amaze him more than your fall from your high position as his wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 13289 len. 25]: She breathes quickly and heavily , but she stands as unflinchingly as ever he has seen her in the midst of her grandest company .
Parsing [sent. 13290 len. 63]: `` I declare to you , Lady Dedlock , that with anything short of this case that I have , I would as soon have hoped to root up by means of my own strength and my own hands the oldest tree on this estate as to shake your hold upon Sir Leicester and Sir Leicester 's trust and confidence in you .
Parsing [sent. 13291 len. 11]: And even now , with this case , I hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 13292 len. 27]: Not that he could doubt -LRB- that , even with him , is impossible -RRB- , but that nothing can prepare him for the blow . ''
Parsing [sent. 13293 len. 6]: `` Not my flight ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13294 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 13295 len. 7]: `` Think of it again . ''
Parsing [sent. 13296 len. 25]: `` Your flight , Lady Dedlock , would spread the whole truth , and a hundred times the whole truth , far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 13297 len. 13]: It would be impossible to save the family credit for a day .
Parsing [sent. 13298 len. 9]: It is not to be thought of . ''
Parsing [sent. 13299 len. 14]: There is a quiet decision in his reply which admits of no remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 13300 len. 20]: `` When I speak of Sir Leicester being the sole consideration , he and the family credit are one .
Parsing [sent. 13301 len. 44]: Sir Leicester and the baronetcy , Sir Leicester and Chesney Wold , Sir Leicester and his ancestors and his patrimony '' -- Mr. Tulkinghorn very dry here -- `` are , I need not say to you , Lady Dedlock , inseparable . ''
Parsing [sent. 13302 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13303 len. 23]: `` Therefore , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , pursuing his case in his jog-trot style , `` I have much to consider .
Parsing [sent. 13304 len. 11]: This is to be hushed up if it can be .
Parsing [sent. 13305 len. 20]: How can it be , if Sir Leicester is driven out of his wits or laid upon a death-bed ?
Parsing [sent. 13306 len. 21]: If I inflicted this shock upon him to-morrow morning , how could the immediate change in him be accounted for ?
Parsing [sent. 13307 len. 6]: What could have caused it ?
Parsing [sent. 13308 len. 6]: What could have divided you ?
Parsing [sent. 13309 len. 48]: Lady Dedlock , the wall-chalking and the street-crying would come on directly , and you are to remember that it would not affect you merely -LRB- whom I can not at all consider in this business -RRB- but your husband , Lady Dedlock , your husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 13310 len. 17]: He gets plainer as he gets on , but not an atom more emphatic or animated .
Parsing [sent. 13311 len. 20]: `` There is another point of view , '' he continues , `` in which the case presents itself .
Parsing [sent. 13312 len. 10]: Sir Leicester is devoted to you almost to infatuation .
Parsing [sent. 13313 len. 16]: He might not be able to overcome that infatuation , even knowing what we know .
Parsing [sent. 13314 len. 13]: I am putting an extreme case , but it might be so .
Parsing [sent. 13315 len. 11]: If so , it were better that he knew nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13316 len. 13]: Better for common sense , better for him , better for me .
Parsing [sent. 13317 len. 19]: I must take all this into account , and it combines to render a decision very difficult . ''
Parsing [sent. 13318 len. 12]: She stands looking out at the same stars without a word .
Parsing [sent. 13319 len. 16]: They are beginning to pale , and she looks as if their coldness froze her .
Parsing [sent. 13320 len. 37]: `` My experience teaches me , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , who has by this time got his hands in his pockets and is going on in his business consideration of the matter like a machine .
Parsing [sent. 13321 len. 25]: `` My experience teaches me , Lady Dedlock , that most of the people I know would do far better to leave marriage alone .
Parsing [sent. 13322 len. 12]: It is at the bottom of three fourths of their troubles .
Parsing [sent. 13323 len. 16]: So I thought when Sir Leicester married , and so I always have thought since .
Parsing [sent. 13324 len. 5]: No more about that .
Parsing [sent. 13325 len. 8]: I must now be guided by circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 13326 len. 20]: In the meanwhile I must beg you to keep your own counsel , and I will keep mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 13327 len. 22]: `` I am to drag my present life on , holding its pains at your pleasure , day by day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13328 len. 10]: she asks , still looking at the distant sky .
Parsing [sent. 13329 len. 12]: `` Yes , I am afraid so , Lady Dedlock . ''
Parsing [sent. 13330 len. 19]: `` It is necessary , you think , that I should be so tied to the stake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13331 len. 12]: `` I am sure that what I recommend is necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 13332 len. 34]: `` I am to remain on this gaudy platforna on which my miserable deception has been so long acted , and it is to fall beneath me when you give the signal ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13333 len. 4]: she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 13334 len. 8]: `` Not without notice , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13335 len. 10]: I shall take no step without forewarning you . ''
Parsing [sent. 13336 len. 21]: She asks all her questions as if she were repeating them from memory or calling them over in her sleep .
Parsing [sent. 13337 len. 9]: `` We are to meet as usual ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13338 len. 10]: `` Precisely as usual , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 13339 len. 18]: `` And I am to hide my guilt , as I have done so many years ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13340 len. 9]: `` As you have done so many years .
Parsing [sent. 13341 len. 42]: I should not have made that reference myself , Lady Dedlock , but I may now remind you that your secret can be no heavier to you than it was , and is no worse and no better than it was .
Parsing [sent. 13342 len. 17]: I know it certainly , but I believe we have never wholly trusted each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 13343 len. 26]: She stands absorbed in the same frozen way for some little time before asking , `` Is there anything more to be sald to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13344 len. 33]: `` Why , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn returns methodically as he softly rubs his hands , `` I should like to be assured of your acquiescence in my arrangements , Lady Dedlock . ''
Parsing [sent. 13345 len. 9]: `` You may be assured of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13346 len. 3]: `` Good .
Parsing [sent. 13347 len. 56]: And I would wish in conclusion to remind you , as a business precaution , in case it should be necessary to recall the fact in any communication with Sir Leicester , that throughout our interview I have expressly stated my sole consideration to be Sir Leicester 's feelings and honour and the family reputation .
Parsing [sent. 13348 len. 31]: I should have been happy to have made Lady Dedlock a prominent consideration , too , if the case had admitted of it ; but unfortunately it does not . ''
Parsing [sent. 13349 len. 10]: `` I can attest your fidelity , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 13350 len. 30]: Both before and after saving it she remains absorbed , but at length moves , and turns , unshaken in her natural and acquired presence , towards the door .
Parsing [sent. 13351 len. 34]: Mr. Tulkinghorn opens both the doors exactly as he would have done yesterday , or as he would have done ten years ago , and makes his old-fashioned bow as she passes out .
Parsing [sent. 13352 len. 39]: It is not an ordinary look that he receives from the handsome face as it goes into the darkness , and it is not an ordinary movement , though a very slight one , that acknowledges his courtesy .
Parsing [sent. 13353 len. 21]: But as he reflects when he is left alone , the woman has been putting no common constraint upon herself .
Parsing [sent. 13354 len. 41]: He would know it all the better if he saw the woman pacing her own rooms with her hair wildly thrown from her flung-back face , her hands clasped behind her head , her figure twisted as if by pain .
Parsing [sent. 13355 len. 37]: He would think so all the more if he saw the woman thus hurrying up and down for hours , without fatigue , without intermission , followed by the faithful step upon the Ghost 's Walk .
Parsing [sent. 13356 len. 21]: But he shuts out the now chilled air , draws the window-curtain , goes to bed , and falls asleep .
Parsing [sent. 13357 len. 40]: And truly when the stars go out and the wan day peeps into the turret-chamber , finding him at his oldest , he looks as if the digger and the spade were both commissioned and would soon be digging .
Parsing [sent. 13358 len. 79]: The same wan day peeps in at Sir Leicester pardoning the repentant country in a majestically condescending dream ; and at the cousins entering on various public employments , principally receipt of salary ; and at the chaste Volumnia , bestowing a dower of fifty thousand pounds upon a hideous old general with a mouth of false teeth like a pianoforte too full of keys , long the admiration of Bath and the terror of every other commuuity .
Parsing [sent. 13359 len. 39]: Also into rooms high in the roof , and into offices in court-yards , and over stables , where humbler ambition dreams of bliss , in keepers ' lodges , and in holy matrimony with Will or Sally .
Parsing [sent. 13360 len. 71]: Up comes the bright sun , drawing everything up with it -- the Wills and Sallys , the latent vapour in the earth , the drooping leaves and flowers , the birds and beasts and creeping things , the gardeners to sweep the dewy turf and unfold emerald velvet where the roller passes , the smoke of the great kitchen fire wreathing itself straight and high into the lightsome air .
Parsing [sent. 13361 len. 36]: Lastly , up comes the flag over Mr. Tulkinghorn 's unconscious head cheerfully proclaiming that Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock are in their happy home and that there is hospitality at the place in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 13362 len. 34]: Chapter XLII -- In Mr. Tulkinghorn 's Chambers From the verdant undulations and the spreading oaks of the Dedlock property , Mr. Tulkinghorn transfers himself to the stale heat and dust of London .
Parsing [sent. 13363 len. 16]: His manner of coming and going between the two places is one of his impenetrabilities .
Parsing [sent. 13364 len. 32]: He walks into Chesney Wold as if it were next door to his chambers and returns to his chambers as if he had never been out of Lincoln 's Inn Fields .
Parsing [sent. 13365 len. 14]: He neither changes his dress before the journey nor talks of it afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 13366 len. 25]: He melted out of his turret-room this morning , just as now , in the late twilight , he melts into his own square .
Parsing [sent. 13367 len. 88]: Like a dingy London bird among the birds at roost in these pleasant fields , where the sheep are all made into parchment , the goats into wigs , and the pasture into chaff , the lawyer , smoke-dried and faded , dwelling among mankind but not consorting with them , aged without experience of genial youth , and so long used to make his cramped nest in holes and corners of human nature that he has forgotten its broader and better range , comes sauntering home .
Parsing [sent. 13368 len. 35]: In the oven made by the hot pavements and hot buildings , he has baked himself dryer than usual ; and he has in his thirsty mind his mellowed port-wine half a century old .
Parsing [sent. 13369 len. 30]: The lamplighter is skipping up and down his ladder on Mr. Tulkinghorn 's side of the Fields when that high-priest of noble mysteries arrives at his own dull court-yard .
Parsing [sent. 13370 len. 27]: He ascends the door-steps and is gliding into the dusky hall when he encounters , on the top step , a bowing and propitiatory little man .
Parsing [sent. 13371 len. 6]: `` Is that Snagsby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13372 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13373 len. 8]: I hope you are well , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13374 len. 14]: I was just giving you up , sir , and going home . ''
Parsing [sent. 13375 len. 3]: `` Aye ?
Parsing [sent. 13376 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 13377 len. 8]: What do you want with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13378 len. 41]: `` Well , sir , '' says Mr. Snagsby , holding his hat at the side of his head in his deference towards his best customer , `` I was wishful to say a word to you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 13379 len. 8]: `` Can you say it here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13380 len. 6]: `` Perfectly , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 13381 len. 6]: `` Say it then . ''
Parsing [sent. 13382 len. 27]: The lawyer turns , leans his arms on the iron railing at the top of the steps , and looks at the lamplighter lighting the court-yard .
Parsing [sent. 13383 len. 37]: `` It is relating , '' says Mr. Snagsby in a mysterious low voice , `` it is relating -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- to the foreigner , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13384 len. 8]: Mr. Tulkinghorn eyes him with some surprise .
Parsing [sent. 13385 len. 5]: `` What foreigner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13386 len. 7]: `` The foreign female , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13387 len. 8]: French , if I do n't mistake ?
Parsing [sent. 13388 len. 28]: I am not acquainted with that language myself , but I should judge from her manners and appearance that she was French ; anyways , certainly foreign .
Parsing [sent. 13389 len. 26]: Her that was upstairs , sir , when Mr. Bucket and me had the honour of waiting upon you with the sweeping-boy that night . ''
Parsing [sent. 13390 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13391 len. 4]: Yes , yes .
Parsing [sent. 13392 len. 4]: Mademoiselle Hortense . ''
Parsing [sent. 13393 len. 6]: `` Indeed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13394 len. 11]: Mr. Snagsby coughs his cough of submission behind his hat .
Parsing [sent. 13395 len. 25]: `` I am not acquainted myself with the names of foreigners in general , but I have no doubt it WOULD be that . ''
Parsing [sent. 13396 len. 28]: Mr. Snagsby appears to have set out in this reply with some desperate design of repeating the name , but on reflection coughs again to excuse himself .
Parsing [sent. 13397 len. 21]: `` And what can you have to say , Snagsby , '' demands Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` about her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13398 len. 26]: `` Well , sir , '' returns the stationer , shading his communication with his hat , `` it falls a little hard upon me .
Parsing [sent. 13399 len. 33]: My domestic happiness is very great -- at least , it 's as great as can be expected , I 'm sure -- but my little woman is rather given to jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 13400 len. 18]: Not to put too fine a point upon it , she is very much given to jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 13401 len. 56]: And you see , a foreign female of that genteel appearance coming into the shop , and hovering -- I should be the last to make use of a strong expression if I could avoid it , but hovering , sir -- in the court -- you know it is -- now ai n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 13402 len. 9]: I only put it to yourself , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13403 len. 26]: Mr. Snagsby , having said this in a very plaintive manner , throws in a cough of general application to fill up all the blanks .
Parsing [sent. 13404 len. 9]: `` Why , what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13405 len. 4]: asks Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 13406 len. 39]: `` Just so , sir , '' returns Mr. Snagsby ; `` I was sure you would feel it yourself and would excuse the reasonableness of MY feelings when coupled with the known excitableness of my little woman .
Parsing [sent. 13407 len. 49]: You see , the foreign female -- which you mentioned her name just now , with quite a native sound I am sure -- caught up the word Snagsby that night , being uncommon quick , and made inquiry , and got the direction and come at dinner-time .
Parsing [sent. 13408 len. 95]: Now Guster , our young woman , is timid and has fits , and she , taking fright at the foreigner 's looks -- which are fierce -- and at a grinding manner that she has of speaking -- which is calculated to alarm a weak mind -- gave way to it , instead of bearing up against it , and tumbled down the kitchen stairs out of one into another , such fits as I do sometimes think are never gone into , or come out of , in any house but ours .
Parsing [sent. 13409 len. 21]: Consequently there was by good fortune ample occupation for my little woman , and only me to answer the shop .
Parsing [sent. 13410 len. 54]: When she DID say that Mr. Tulkinghorn , being always denied to her by his employer -LRB- which I had no doubt at the time was a foreign mode of viewing a clerk -RRB- , she would do herself the pleasure of continually calling at my place until she was let in here .
Parsing [sent. 13411 len. 33]: Since then she has been , as I began by saying , hovering , hovering , sir '' -- Mr. Snagsby repeats the word with pathetic emphasis -- `` in the court .
Parsing [sent. 13412 len. 11]: The effects of which movement it is impossible to calculate .
Parsing [sent. 13413 len. 36]: I should n't wonder if it might have already given rise to the painfullest mistakes even in the neighbours ' minds , not mentioning -LRB- if such a thing was possible -RRB- my little woman .
Parsing [sent. 13414 len. 50]: Whereas , goodness knows , '' says Mr. Snagsby , shaking his head , `` I never had an idea of a foreign female , except as being formerly connected with a bunch of brooms and a baby , or at the present time with a tambourine and earrings .
Parsing [sent. 13415 len. 12]: I never had , I do assure you , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13416 len. 28]: Mr. Tulkinghorn had listened gravely to this complaint and inquires when the stationer has finished , `` And that 's all , is it , Snagsby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13417 len. 34]: `` Why yes , sir , that 's all , '' says Mr. Snagsby , ending with a cough that plainly adds , `` and it 's enough too -- for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 13418 len. 23]: `` I do n't know what Mademoiselle Hortense may want or mean , unless she is mad , '' says the lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 13419 len. 42]: `` Even if she was , you know , sir , '' Mr. Snagsby pleads , `` it would n't be a consolation to have some weapon or another in the form of a foreign dagger planted in the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 13420 len. 8]: `` No , '' says the other .
Parsing [sent. 13421 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 13422 len. 5]: This shall be stopped .
Parsing [sent. 13423 len. 8]: I am sorry you have been inconvenienced .
Parsing [sent. 13424 len. 10]: If she comes again , send her here . ''
Parsing [sent. 13425 len. 19]: Mr. Snagsby , with much bowing and short apologetic coughing , takes his leave , lightened in heart .
Parsing [sent. 13426 len. 22]: Mr. Tulkinghorn goes upstairs , saying to himself , `` These women were created to give trouble the whole earth over .
Parsing [sent. 13427 len. 15]: The mistress not being enough to deal with , here 's the maid now !
Parsing [sent. 13428 len. 12]: But I will be short with THIS jade at least ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13429 len. 25]: So saying , he unlocks his door , gropes his way into his murky rooms , lights his candles , and looks about him .
Parsing [sent. 13430 len. 38]: It is too dark to see much of the Allegory over-head there , but that importunate Roman , who is for ever toppling out of the clouds and pointing , is at his old work pretty distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 13431 len. 57]: Not honouring him with much attention , Mr. Tulkinghorn takes a small key from his pocket , unlocks a drawer in which there is another key , which unlocks a chest in which there is another , and so comes to the cellar-key , with which he prepares to descend to the regions of old wine .
Parsing [sent. 13432 len. 17]: He is going towards the door with a candle in his hand when a knock comes .
Parsing [sent. 13433 len. 5]: `` Who 's this ?
Parsing [sent. 13434 len. 13]: Aye , aye , mistress , it 's you , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 13435 len. 7]: You appear at a good time .
Parsing [sent. 13436 len. 8]: I have just been hearing of you .
Parsing [sent. 13437 len. 2]: Now !
Parsing [sent. 13438 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13439 len. 31]: He stands the candle on the chimney-piece in the clerk 's hall and taps his dry cheek with the key as he addresses these words of welcome to Mademoiselle Hortense .
Parsing [sent. 13440 len. 25]: That feline personage , with her lips tightly shut and her eyes looking out at him sideways , softly closes the door before replying .
Parsing [sent. 13441 len. 15]: `` I have had great deal of trouble to find you , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 13442 len. 5]: `` HAVE you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13443 len. 10]: `` I have been here very often , sir .
Parsing [sent. 13444 len. 31]: It has always been said to me , he is not at home , he is engage , he is this and that , he is not for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 13445 len. 9]: `` Quite right , and quite true . ''
Parsing [sent. 13446 len. 4]: `` Not true .
Parsing [sent. 13447 len. 3]: Lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13448 len. 31]: At times there is a suddenness in the manner of Mademoiselle Hortense so like a bodily spring upon the subject of it that such subject involuntarily starts and fails back .
Parsing [sent. 13449 len. 36]: It is Mr. Tulkinghorn 's case at present , though Mademoiselle Hortense , with her eyes almost shut up -LRB- but still looking out sideways -RRB- , is only smiling contemptuously and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 13450 len. 18]: `` Now , mistress , '' says the lawyer , tapping the key hastily upon the chimney-piece .
Parsing [sent. 13451 len. 15]: `` If you have anything to say , say it , say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13452 len. 10]: `` Sir , you have not use me well .
Parsing [sent. 13453 len. 8]: You have been mean and shabby . ''
Parsing [sent. 13454 len. 8]: `` Mean and shabby , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13455 len. 11]: returns the lawyer , rubbing his nose with the key .
Parsing [sent. 13456 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 13457 len. 8]: What is it that I tell you ?
Parsing [sent. 13458 len. 5]: You know you have .
Parsing [sent. 13459 len. 46]: You have attrapped me -- catched me -- to give you information ; you have asked me to show you the dress of mine my Lady must have wore that night , you have prayed me to come in it here to meet that boy .
Parsing [sent. 13460 len. 2]: Say !
Parsing [sent. 13461 len. 5]: Is it not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13462 len. 6]: Mademoiselle Hortense makes another spring .
Parsing [sent. 13463 len. 10]: `` You are a vixen , a vixen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13464 len. 23]: Mr. Tulkinghorn seems to meditate as he looks distrustfully at her , then he replies , `` Well , wench , well .
Parsing [sent. 13465 len. 5]: I paid you . ''
Parsing [sent. 13466 len. 6]: `` You paid me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13467 len. 6]: she repeats with fierce disdain .
Parsing [sent. 13468 len. 4]: `` Two sovereign !
Parsing [sent. 13469 len. 21]: I have not change them , I re-fuse them , I des-pise them , I throw them from me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13470 len. 46]: Which she literally does , taking them out of her bosom as she speaks and flinging them with such violence on the floor that they jerk up again into the light before they roll away into corners and slowly settle down there after spinning vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 13471 len. 4]: `` Now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13472 len. 10]: says Mademoiselle Hortense , darkening her large eyes again .
Parsing [sent. 13473 len. 6]: `` You have paid me ?
Parsing [sent. 13474 len. 9]: Eh , my God , oh yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13475 len. 17]: Mr. Tulkinghorn rubs his head with the key while she entertains herself with a sarcastic laugh .
Parsing [sent. 13476 len. 25]: `` You must be rich , my fair friend , '' he composedly observes , `` to throw money about in that way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13477 len. 9]: `` I AM rich , '' she returns .
Parsing [sent. 13478 len. 8]: `` I am very rich in hate .
Parsing [sent. 13479 len. 10]: I hate my Lady , of all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 13480 len. 5]: You know that . ''
Parsing [sent. 13481 len. 4]: `` Know it ?
Parsing [sent. 13482 len. 7]: How should I know it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13483 len. 17]: `` Because you have known it perfectly before you prayed me to give you that information .
Parsing [sent. 13484 len. 11]: Because you have known perfectly that I was en-r-r-r-raged ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13485 len. 35]: It appears impossible for mademoiselle to roll the letter `` r '' sufficiently in this word , notwithstanding that she assists her energetic delivery by clenching both her hands and setting all her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 13486 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13487 len. 8]: I knew that , did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13488 len. 11]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn , examining the wards of the key .
Parsing [sent. 13489 len. 6]: `` Yes , without doubt .
Parsing [sent. 13490 len. 5]: I am not blind .
Parsing [sent. 13491 len. 11]: You have made sure of me because you knew that .
Parsing [sent. 13492 len. 4]: You had reason !
Parsing [sent. 13493 len. 5]: I det-est her . ''
Parsing [sent. 13494 len. 17]: Mademoiselle folds her arms and throws this last remark at him over one of her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 13495 len. 15]: `` Having said this , have you anything else to say , mademoiselle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13496 len. 7]: `` I am not yet placed .
Parsing [sent. 13497 len. 4]: Place me well .
Parsing [sent. 13498 len. 6]: Find me a good condition !
Parsing [sent. 13499 len. 30]: If you can not , or do not choose to do that , employ me to pursue her , to chase her , to disgrace and to dishonour her .
Parsing [sent. 13500 len. 12]: I will help you well , and with a good will .
Parsing [sent. 13501 len. 6]: It is what YOU do .
Parsing [sent. 13502 len. 7]: Do I not know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13503 len. 14]: `` You appear to know a good deal , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn retorts .
Parsing [sent. 13504 len. 5]: `` Do I not ?
Parsing [sent. 13505 len. 36]: Is it that I am so weak as to believe , like a child , that I come here in that dress to rec-cive that boy only to decide a little bet , a wager ?
Parsing [sent. 13506 len. 9]: Eh , my God , oh yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13507 len. 51]: In this reply , down to the word `` wager '' inclusive , mademoiselle has been ironically polite and tender , then as suddenly dashed into the bitterest and most defiant scorn , with her black eyes in one and the same moment very nearly shut and staringly wide open .
Parsing [sent. 13508 len. 31]: `` Now , let us see , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , tapping his chin with the key and looking imperturbably at her , `` how this matter stands . ''
Parsing [sent. 13509 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 13510 len. 18]: Let us see , '' mademoiselle assents , with many angry and tight nods of her head .
Parsing [sent. 13511 len. 29]: `` You come here to make a remarkably modest demand , which you have just stated , and it not being conceded , you will come again . ''
Parsing [sent. 13512 len. 14]: `` And again , '' says mademoiselle with more tight and angry nods .
Parsing [sent. 13513 len. 5]: `` And yet again .
Parsing [sent. 13514 len. 4]: And yet again .
Parsing [sent. 13515 len. 5]: And many times again .
Parsing [sent. 13516 len. 7]: In effect , for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13517 len. 19]: `` And not only here , but you will go to Mr , Snagsby 's too , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 13518 len. 13]: That visit not succeeding either , you will go again perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13519 len. 12]: `` And again , '' repeats mademoiselle , cataleptic with determination .
Parsing [sent. 13520 len. 5]: `` And yet again .
Parsing [sent. 13521 len. 4]: And yet again .
Parsing [sent. 13522 len. 5]: And many times again .
Parsing [sent. 13523 len. 7]: In effect , for ever ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13524 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 13525 len. 21]: Now , Mademoiselle Hortense , let me recommend you to take the candle and pick up that money of yours .
Parsing [sent. 13526 len. 17]: I think you will find it behind the clerk 's partition in the corner yonder . ''
Parsing [sent. 13527 len. 16]: She merely throws a laugh over her shoulder and stands her ground with folded arms .
Parsing [sent. 13528 len. 8]: `` You will not , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13529 len. 8]: `` No , I will not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13530 len. 13]: `` So much the poorer you ; so much the richer I !
Parsing [sent. 13531 len. 12]: Look , mistress , this is the key of my wine-cellar .
Parsing [sent. 13532 len. 14]: It is a large key , but the keys of prisons are larger .
Parsing [sent. 13533 len. 35]: In this city there are houses of correction -LRB- where the treadmills are , for women -RRB- , the gates of which are very strong and heavy , and no doubt the keys too .
Parsing [sent. 13534 len. 30]: I am afraid a lady of your spirit and activity would find it an inconvenience to have one of those keys turned upon her for any length of time .
Parsing [sent. 13535 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13536 len. 27]: `` I think , '' mademoiselle replies without any action and in a clear , obliging voice , `` that you are a miserable wretch . ''
Parsing [sent. 13537 len. 13]: `` Probably , '' returns Mr. Tulkinghorn , quietly blowing his nose .
Parsing [sent. 13538 len. 22]: `` But I do n't ask what you think of myself ; I ask what you think of the prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 13539 len. 3]: `` Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 13540 len. 8]: What does it matter to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13541 len. 57]: `` Why , it matters this much , mistress , '' says the lawyer , deliberately putting away his handkerchief and adjusting his frill ; `` the law is so despotic here that it interferes to prevent any of our good English citizens from being troubled , even by a lady 's visits against his desire .
Parsing [sent. 13542 len. 27]: And on his complaining that he is so troubled , it takes hold of the troublesome lady and shuts her up in prison under hard discipline .
Parsing [sent. 13543 len. 9]: Turns the key upon her , mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 13544 len. 5]: Illustrating with the cellar-key .
Parsing [sent. 13545 len. 4]: `` Truly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13546 len. 8]: returns mademoiselle in the same pleasant voice .
Parsing [sent. 13547 len. 5]: `` That is droll !
Parsing [sent. 13548 len. 5]: But -- my faith !
Parsing [sent. 13549 len. 10]: -- still what does it matter to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13550 len. 28]: `` My fair friend , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` make another visit here , or at Mr. Snagsby 's , and you shall learn . ''
Parsing [sent. 13551 len. 15]: `` In that case you will send me to the prison , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13552 len. 4]: `` Perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 13553 len. 38]: It would be contradictory for one in mademoiselle 's state of agreeable jocularity to foam at the mouth , otherwise a tigerish expansion thereabouts might look as if a very little more would make her do it .
Parsing [sent. 13554 len. 43]: `` In a word , mistress , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , `` I am sorry to be unpolite , but if you ever present yourself uninvited here -- or there -- again , I will give you over to the police .
Parsing [sent. 13555 len. 29]: Their gallantry is great , but they carry troublesome people through the streets in an ignominious manner , strapped down on a board , my good wench . ''
Parsing [sent. 13556 len. 27]: `` I will prove you , '' whispers mademoiselle , stretching out her hand , `` I will try if you dare to do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13557 len. 41]: `` And if , '' pursues the lawyer without minding her , `` I place you in that good condition of being locked up in jail , it will be some time before you find yourself at liberty again . ''
Parsing [sent. 13558 len. 14]: `` I will prove you , '' repeats mademoiselle in her former whisper .
Parsing [sent. 13559 len. 20]: `` And now , '' proceeds the lawyer , still without minding her , `` you had better go .
Parsing [sent. 13560 len. 9]: Think twice before you come here again . ''
Parsing [sent. 13561 len. 15]: `` Think you , '' she answers , `` twice two hundred times ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13562 len. 33]: `` You were dismissed by your lady , you know , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn observes , following her out upon the staircase , `` as the most implacable and unmanageable of women .
Parsing [sent. 13563 len. 16]: Now turn over a new leaf and take warning by what I say to you .
Parsing [sent. 13564 len. 20]: For what I say , I mean ; and what I threaten , I will do , mistress . ''
Parsing [sent. 13565 len. 10]: She goes down without answering or looking behind her .
Parsing [sent. 13566 len. 52]: When she is gone , he goes down too , and returning with his cobweb-covered bottle , devotes himself to a leisurely enjoyment of its contents , now and then , as he throws his head back in his chair , catching sight of the pertinacious Roman pointing from the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 13567 len. 28]: Chapter XLIII -- Esther 's Narrative It matters little now how much I thought of my living mother who had told me evermore to consider her dead .
Parsing [sent. 13568 len. 39]: I could not venture to approach her or to communicate with her in writing , for my sense of the peril in which her life was passed was only to be equalled by my fears of increasing it .
Parsing [sent. 13569 len. 37]: Knowing that my mere existence as a living creature was an unforeseen danger in her way , I could not always conquer that terror of myself which had seized me when I first knew the secret .
Parsing [sent. 13570 len. 11]: At no time did I dare to utter her name .
Parsing [sent. 13571 len. 13]: I felt as if I did not even dare to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 13572 len. 43]: If the conversation anywhere , when I was present , took that direction , as it sometimes naturally did , I tried not to hear : I mentally counted , repeated something that I knew , or went out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 13573 len. 49]: I am conscious now that I often did these things when there can have been no danger of her being spoken of , but I did them in the dread I had of hearing anything that might lead to her betrayal , and to her betrayal through me .
Parsing [sent. 13574 len. 48]: It matters little now how often I recalled the tones of my mother 's voice , wondered whether I should ever hear it again as I so longed to do , and thought how strange and desolate it was that it should be so new to me .
Parsing [sent. 13575 len. 80]: It matters little that I watched for every public mention of my mother 's name ; that I passed and repassed the door of her house in town , loving it , but afraid to look at it ; that I once sat in the theatre when my mother was there and saw me , and when we were so wide asunder before the great company of all degrees that any link or confidence between us seemed a dream .
Parsing [sent. 13576 len. 7]: It is all , all over .
Parsing [sent. 13577 len. 25]: My lot has been so blest that I can relate little of myself which is not a story of goodness and generosity in others .
Parsing [sent. 13578 len. 10]: I may well pass that little and go on .
Parsing [sent. 13579 len. 24]: When we were settled at home again , Ada and I had many conversations with my guardian of which Richard was the theme .
Parsing [sent. 13580 len. 36]: My dear girl was deeply grieved that he should do their kind cousin so much wrong , but she was so faithful to Richard that she could not bear to blame him even for that .
Parsing [sent. 13581 len. 18]: My guardian was assured of it , and never coupled his name with a word of reproof .
Parsing [sent. 13582 len. 15]: `` Rick is mistaken , my dear , '' he would say to her .
Parsing [sent. 13583 len. 5]: `` Well , well !
Parsing [sent. 13584 len. 10]: We have all been mistaken over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 13585 len. 13]: We must trust to you and time to set him right . ''
Parsing [sent. 13586 len. 26]: We knew afterwards what we suspected then , that he did not trust to time until he had often tried to open Richard 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13587 len. 26]: That he had written to him , gone to him , talked with him , tried every gentle and persuasive art his kindness could devise .
Parsing [sent. 13588 len. 11]: Our poor devoted Richard was deaf and blind to all .
Parsing [sent. 13589 len. 16]: If he were wrong , he would make amends when the Chancery suit was over .
Parsing [sent. 13590 len. 31]: If he were groping in the dark , he could not do better than do his utmost to clear away those clouds in which so much was confused and obscured .
Parsing [sent. 13591 len. 10]: Suspicion and misunderstanding were the fault of the suit ?
Parsing [sent. 13592 len. 16]: Then let him work the suit out and come through it to his right mind .
Parsing [sent. 13593 len. 6]: This was his unvarying reply .
Parsing [sent. 13594 len. 46]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce had obtained such possession of his whole nature that it was impossible to place any consideration before him which he did not , with a distorted kind of reason , make a new argument in favour of his doing what he did .
Parsing [sent. 13595 len. 32]: `` So that it is even more mischievous , '' said my guardian once to me , `` to remonstrate with the poor dear fellow than to leave him alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 13596 len. 20]: I took one of these opportunities of mentioning my doubts of Mr. Skimpole as a good adviser for Richard .
Parsing [sent. 13597 len. 4]: `` Adviser ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13598 len. 17]: returned my guardian , laughing , `` My dear , who would advise with Skimpole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13599 len. 17]: `` Encourager would perhaps have been a better word , '' said I. `` Encourager ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13600 len. 5]: returned my guardian again .
Parsing [sent. 13601 len. 9]: `` Who could be encouraged by Skimpole ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13602 len. 5]: `` Not Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13603 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 13604 len. 7]: `` No , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 13605 len. 18]: `` Such an unworldly , uncalculating , gossamer creature is a relief to him and an amusement .
Parsing [sent. 13606 len. 32]: But as to advising or encouraging or occupying a serious station towards anybody or anything , it is simply not to be thought of in such a child as Skimpole . ''
Parsing [sent. 13607 len. 31]: `` Pray , cousin John , '' said Ada , who had just joined us and now looked over my shoulder , `` what made him such a child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13608 len. 9]: `` What made him such a child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13609 len. 14]: inquired my guardian , rubbing his head , a little at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 13610 len. 7]: `` Yes , cousin John . ''
Parsing [sent. 13611 len. 36]: `` Why , '' he slowly replied , roughening his head more and more , `` he is all sentiment , and -- and susceptibility , and -- and sensibility , and -- and imagination .
Parsing [sent. 13612 len. 11]: And these qualities are not regulated in him , somehow .
Parsing [sent. 13613 len. 40]: I suppose the people who admired him for them in his youth attached too much importance to them and too little to any training that would have balanced and adjusted them , and so he became what he is .
Parsing [sent. 13614 len. 3]: Hey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13615 len. 12]: said my guardian , stopping short and looking at us hopefully .
Parsing [sent. 13616 len. 10]: `` What do you think , you two ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13617 len. 21]: Ada , glancing at me , said she thought it was a pity he should be an expense to Richard .
Parsing [sent. 13618 len. 15]: `` So it is , so it is , '' returned my guardian hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 13619 len. 6]: `` That must not be .
Parsing [sent. 13620 len. 5]: We must arrange that .
Parsing [sent. 13621 len. 5]: I must prevent it .
Parsing [sent. 13622 len. 6]: That will never do . ''
Parsing [sent. 13623 len. 26]: And I said I thought it was to be regretted that he had ever introduced Richard to Mr. Vholes for a present of five pounds .
Parsing [sent. 13624 len. 5]: `` Did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13625 len. 13]: said my guardian with a passing shade of vexation on his face .
Parsing [sent. 13626 len. 8]: `` But there you have the man .
Parsing [sent. 13627 len. 6]: There you have the man !
Parsing [sent. 13628 len. 9]: There is nothing mercenary in that with him .
Parsing [sent. 13629 len. 10]: He has no idea of the value of money .
Parsing [sent. 13630 len. 20]: He introduces Rick , and then he is good friends with Mr. Vholes and borrows five pounds of him .
Parsing [sent. 13631 len. 11]: He means nothing by it and thinks nothing of it .
Parsing [sent. 13632 len. 14]: He told you himself , I 'll be bound , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13633 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13634 len. 6]: said I. `` Exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13635 len. 7]: cried my guardian , quite triumphant .
Parsing [sent. 13636 len. 7]: `` There you have the man !
Parsing [sent. 13637 len. 23]: If he had meant any harm by it or was conscious of any harm in it , he would n't tell it .
Parsing [sent. 13638 len. 11]: He tells it as he does it in mere simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 13639 len. 18]: But you shall see him in his own home , and then you 'll understand him better .
Parsing [sent. 13640 len. 15]: We must pay a visit to Harold Skimpole and caution him on these points .
Parsing [sent. 13641 len. 14]: Lord bless you , my dears , an infant , an infant ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13642 len. 23]: In pursuance of this plan , we went into London on an early day and presented ourselves at Mr. Skimpole 's door .
Parsing [sent. 13643 len. 35]: He lived in a place called the Polygon , in Somers Town , where there were at that time a number of poor Spanish refugees walking about in cloaks , smoking little paper cigars .
Parsing [sent. 13644 len. 55]: Whether he was a better tenant than one might have supposed , in consequence of his friend Somebody always paying his rent at last , or whether his inaptitude for business rendered it particularly difficult to turn him out , I do n't know ; but he had occupied the same house some years .
Parsing [sent. 13645 len. 13]: It was in a state of dilapidation quite equal to our expectation .
Parsing [sent. 13646 len. 54]: Two or three of the area railings were gone , the water-butt was broken , the knocker was loose , the bell-handle had been pulled off a long time to judge from the rusty state of the wire , and dirty footprints on the steps were the only signs of its being inhabited .
Parsing [sent. 13647 len. 46]: A slatternly full-blown girl who seemed to be bursting out at the rents in her gown and the cracks in her shoes like an over-ripe berry answered our knock by opening the door a very little way and stopping up the gap with her figure .
Parsing [sent. 13648 len. 35]: As she knew Mr. Jarndyce -LRB- indeed Ada and I both thought that she evidently associated him with the receipt of her wages -RRB- , she immediately relented and allowed us to pass in .
Parsing [sent. 13649 len. 37]: The lock of the door being in a disabled condition , she then applied herself to securing it with the chain , which was not in good action either , and said would we go upstairs ?
Parsing [sent. 13650 len. 18]: We went upstairs to the first floor , still seeing no other furniture than the dirty footprints .
Parsing [sent. 13651 len. 14]: Mr. Jarndyce without further ceremony entered a room there , and we followed .
Parsing [sent. 13652 len. 60]: It was dingy enough and not at all clean , but furnished with an odd kind of shabby luxury , with a large footstool , a sofa , and plenty of cushions , an easy-chair , and plenty of pillows , a piano , books , drawing materials , music , newspapers , and a few sketches and pictures .
Parsing [sent. 13653 len. 51]: A broken pane of glass in one of the dirty windows was papered and wafered over , but there was a little plate of hothouse nectarines on the table , and there was another of grapes , and another of sponge-cakes , and there was a bottle of light wine .
Parsing [sent. 13654 len. 38]: Mr. Skimpole himself reclined upon the sofa in a dressing-gown , drinking some fragrant coffee from an old china cup -- it was then about mid-day -- and looking at a collection of wallflowers in the balcony .
Parsing [sent. 13655 len. 22]: He was not in the least disconcerted by our appearance , but rose and received us in his usual airy manner .
Parsing [sent. 13656 len. 9]: `` Here I am , you see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13657 len. 22]: he said when we were seated , not without some little difficulty , the greater part of the chairs being broken .
Parsing [sent. 13658 len. 5]: `` Here I am !
Parsing [sent. 13659 len. 6]: This is my frugal breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 13660 len. 15]: Some men want legs of beef and mutton for breakfast ; I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 13661 len. 18]: Give me my peach , my cup of coffee , and my claret ; I am content .
Parsing [sent. 13662 len. 16]: I do n't want them for themselves , but they remind me of the sun .
Parsing [sent. 13663 len. 11]: There 's nothing solar about legs of beef and mutton .
Parsing [sent. 13664 len. 5]: Mere animal satisfaction ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13665 len. 31]: `` This is our friend 's consulting-room -LRB- or would be , if he ever prescribed -RRB- , his sanctum , his studio , '' said my guardian to us .
Parsing [sent. 13666 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' said Mr. Skimpole , turning his bright face about , `` this is the bird 's cage .
Parsing [sent. 13667 len. 9]: This is where the bird lives and sings .
Parsing [sent. 13668 len. 20]: They pluck his feathers now and then and clip his wings , but he sings , he sings ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13669 len. 16]: He handed us the grapes , repeating in his radiant way , `` He sings !
Parsing [sent. 13670 len. 11]: Not an ambitious note , but still he sings . ''
Parsing [sent. 13671 len. 11]: `` These are very fine , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 13672 len. 5]: `` A present ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13673 len. 7]: `` No , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 13674 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 13675 len. 6]: Some amiable gardener sells them .
Parsing [sent. 13676 len. 21]: His man wanted to know , when he brought them last evening , whether he should wait for the money .
Parsing [sent. 13677 len. 26]: ` Really , my friend , ' I said , ' I think not -- if your time is of any value to you . '
Parsing [sent. 13678 len. 11]: I suppose it was , for he went away . ''
Parsing [sent. 13679 len. 27]: My guardian looked at us with a smile , as though he asked us , `` Is it possible to be worldly with this baby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13680 len. 28]: `` This is a day , '' said Mr. Skimpole , gaily taking a little claret in a tumbler , `` that will ever be remembered here .
Parsing [sent. 13681 len. 11]: We shall call it Saint Clare and Saint Summerson day .
Parsing [sent. 13682 len. 6]: You must see my daughters .
Parsing [sent. 13683 len. 24]: I have a blue-eyed daughter who is my Beauty daughter , I have a Sentiment daughter , and I have a Comedy daughter .
Parsing [sent. 13684 len. 6]: You must see them all .
Parsing [sent. 13685 len. 6]: They 'll be enchanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 13686 len. 29]: He was going to summon them when my guardian interposed and asked him to pause a moment , as he wished to say a word to him first .
Parsing [sent. 13687 len. 24]: `` My dear Jarndyce , '' he cheerfully replied , going back to his sofa , `` as many moments as you please .
Parsing [sent. 13688 len. 6]: Time is no object here .
Parsing [sent. 13689 len. 13]: We never know what o'clock it is , and we never care .
Parsing [sent. 13690 len. 14]: Not the way to get on in life , you 'll tell me ?
Parsing [sent. 13691 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 13692 len. 9]: But we DO N'T get on in life .
Parsing [sent. 13693 len. 9]: We do n't pretend to do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13694 len. 16]: My guardian looked at us again , plainly saying , `` You hear him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13695 len. 21]: `` Now , Harold , '' he began , `` the word I have to say relates to Rick . ''
Parsing [sent. 13696 len. 8]: `` The dearest friend I have ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13697 len. 5]: returned Mr. Skimpole cordially .
Parsing [sent. 13698 len. 21]: `` I suppose he ought not to be my dearest friend , as he is not on terms with you .
Parsing [sent. 13699 len. 22]: But he is , I ca n't help it ; he is full of youthful poetry , and I love him .
Parsing [sent. 13700 len. 13]: If you do n't like it , I ca n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 13701 len. 5]: I love him . ''
Parsing [sent. 13702 len. 29]: The engaging frankness with which he made this declaration really had a disinterested appearance and captivated my guardian , if not , for the moment , Ada too .
Parsing [sent. 13703 len. 29]: `` You are welcome to love him as much as you like , '' returned Mr. Jarndyce , `` but we must save his pocket , Harold . ''
Parsing [sent. 13704 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13705 len. 4]: said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 13706 len. 4]: `` His pocket ?
Parsing [sent. 13707 len. 12]: Now you are coming to what I do n't understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 13708 len. 37]: Taking a little more claret and dipping one of the cakes in it , he shook his head and smiled at Ada and me with an ingenuous foreboding that he never could be made to understand .
Parsing [sent. 13709 len. 27]: `` If you go with him here or there , '' said my guardian plainly , `` you must not let him pay for both . ''
Parsing [sent. 13710 len. 28]: `` My dear Jarndyce , '' returned Mr. Skimpole , his genial face irradiated by the comicality of this idea , `` what am I to do ?
Parsing [sent. 13711 len. 10]: If he takes me anywhere , I must go .
Parsing [sent. 13712 len. 6]: And how can I pay ?
Parsing [sent. 13713 len. 6]: I never have any money .
Parsing [sent. 13714 len. 14]: If I had any money , I do n't know anything about it .
Parsing [sent. 13715 len. 10]: Suppose I say to a man , how much ?
Parsing [sent. 13716 len. 10]: Suppose the man says to me seven and sixpence ?
Parsing [sent. 13717 len. 8]: I know nothing about seven and sixpence .
Parsing [sent. 13718 len. 16]: It is impossible for me to pursue the subject with any consideration for the man .
Parsing [sent. 13719 len. 22]: I do n't go about asking busy people what seven and sixpence is in Moorish -- which I do n't understand .
Parsing [sent. 13720 len. 22]: Why should I go about asking them what seven and sixpence is in Money -- which I do n't understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13721 len. 55]: `` Well , '' said my guardian , by no means displeased with this artless reply , `` if you come to any kind of journeying with Rick , you must borrow the money of me -LRB- never breathing the least allusion to that circumstance -RRB- , and leave the calculation to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 13722 len. 30]: `` My dear Jarndyce , '' returned Mr. Skimpole , `` I will do anything to give you pleasure , but it seems an idle form -- a superstition .
Parsing [sent. 13723 len. 24]: Besides , I give you my word , Miss Clare and my dear Miss Summerson , I thought Mr. Carstone was immensely rich .
Parsing [sent. 13724 len. 46]: I thought he had only to make over something , or to sign a bond , or a draft , or a cheque , or a bill , or to put something on a file somewhere , to bring down a shower of money . ''
Parsing [sent. 13725 len. 13]: `` Indeed it is not so , sir , '' said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 13726 len. 6]: `` He is poor . ''
Parsing [sent. 13727 len. 6]: `` No , really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13728 len. 8]: returned Mr. Skimpole with his bright smile .
Parsing [sent. 13729 len. 5]: `` You surprise me .
Parsing [sent. 13730 len. 47]: `` And not being the richer for trusting in a rotten reed , '' said my guardian , laying his hand emphatically on the sleeve of Mr. Skimpole 's dressing-gown , `` be you very careful not to encourage him in that reliance , Harold . ''
Parsing [sent. 13731 len. 30]: `` My dear good friend , '' returned Mr. Skimpole , `` and my dear Miss Siunmerson , and my dear Miss Clare , how can I do that ?
Parsing [sent. 13732 len. 11]: It 's business , and I do n't know business .
Parsing [sent. 13733 len. 7]: It is he who encourages me .
Parsing [sent. 13734 len. 26]: He emerges from great feats of business , presents the brightest prospects before me as their result , and calls upon me to admire them .
Parsing [sent. 13735 len. 9]: I do admire them -- as bright prospects .
Parsing [sent. 13736 len. 15]: But I know no more about them , and I tell him so . ''
Parsing [sent. 13737 len. 62]: The helpless kind of candour with which he presented this before us , the light-hearted manner in which he was amused by his innocence , the fantastic way in which he took himself under his own protection and argued about that curious person , combined with the delightful ease of everything he said exactly to make out my guardian 's case .
Parsing [sent. 13738 len. 66]: The more I saw of him , the more unlikely it seemed to me , when he was present , that he could design , conceal , or influence anything ; and yet the less likely that appeared when he was not present , and the less agreeable it was to think of his having anything to do with any one for whom I cared .
Parsing [sent. 13739 len. 55]: Hearing that his examination -LRB- as he called it -RRB- was now over , Mr. Skimpole left the room with a radiant face to fetch his daughters -LRB- his sons had run away at various times -RRB- , leaving my guardian quite delighted by the manner in which he had vindicated his childish character .
Parsing [sent. 13740 len. 36]: He soon came back , bringing with him the three young ladies and Mrs. Skimpole , who had once been a beauty but was now a delicate high-nosed invalid suffering under a complication of disorders .
Parsing [sent. 13741 len. 26]: `` This , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` is my Beauty daughter , Arethusa -- plays and sings odds and ends like her father .
Parsing [sent. 13742 len. 16]: This is my Sentiment daughter , Laura -- plays a little but do n't sing .
Parsing [sent. 13743 len. 16]: This is my Comedy daughter , Kitty -- sings a little but do n't play .
Parsing [sent. 13744 len. 23]: We all draw a little and compose a little , and none of us have any idea of time or money . ''
Parsing [sent. 13745 len. 24]: Mrs. Skimpole sighed , I thought , as if she would have been glad to strike out this item in the family attainments .
Parsing [sent. 13746 len. 23]: I also thought that she rather impressed her sigh upon my guardian and that she took every opportunity of throwing in another .
Parsing [sent. 13747 len. 34]: `` It is pleasant , '' said Mr. Skimpole , turning his sprightly eyes from one to the other of us , `` and it is whimsically interesting to trace peculiarities in families .
Parsing [sent. 13748 len. 15]: In this family we are all children , and I am the youngest . ''
Parsing [sent. 13749 len. 24]: The daughters , who appeared to be very fond of him , were amused by this droll fact , particularly the Comedy daughter .
Parsing [sent. 13750 len. 18]: `` My dears , it is true , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` is it not ?
Parsing [sent. 13751 len. 26]: So it is , and so it must be , because like the dogs in the hymn , ` it is our nature to . '
Parsing [sent. 13752 len. 19]: Now , here is Miss Summerson with a fine administrative capacity and a knowledge of details perfectly surprising .
Parsing [sent. 13753 len. 25]: It will sound very strange in Miss Summerson 's ears , I dare say , that we know nothing about chops in this house .
Parsing [sent. 13754 len. 9]: But we do n't , not the least .
Parsing [sent. 13755 len. 7]: We ca n't cook anything whatever .
Parsing [sent. 13756 len. 12]: A needle and thread we do n't know how to use .
Parsing [sent. 13757 len. 20]: We admire the people who possess the practical wisdom we want , but we do n't quarrel with them .
Parsing [sent. 13758 len. 8]: Then why should they quarrel with us ?
Parsing [sent. 13759 len. 10]: Live and let live , we say to them .
Parsing [sent. 13760 len. 14]: Live upon your practical wisdom , and let us live upon you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13761 len. 17]: He laughed , but as usual seemed quite candid and really to mean what he said .
Parsing [sent. 13762 len. 18]: `` We have sympathy , my roses , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` sympathy for everything .
Parsing [sent. 13763 len. 5]: Have we not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13764 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13765 len. 5]: cried the three daughters .
Parsing [sent. 13766 len. 22]: `` In fact , that is our family department , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` in this hurly-burly of life .
Parsing [sent. 13767 len. 22]: We are capable of looking on and of being interested , and we DO look on , and we ARE interested .
Parsing [sent. 13768 len. 6]: What more can we do ?
Parsing [sent. 13769 len. 11]: Here is my Beauty daughter , married these three years .
Parsing [sent. 13770 len. 29]: Now I dare say her marrying another child , and having two more , was all wrong in point of political economy , but it was very agreeable .
Parsing [sent. 13771 len. 13]: We had our little festivities on those occasions and exchanged social ideas .
Parsing [sent. 13772 len. 20]: She brought her young husband home one day , and they and their young fledglings have their nest upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 13773 len. 23]: I dare say at some time or other Sentiment and Comedy will bring THEIR husbands home and have THEIR nests upstairs too .
Parsing [sent. 13774 len. 15]: So we get on , we do n't know how , but somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 13775 len. 24]: She looked very young indeed to be the mother of two children , and I could not help pitying both her and them .
Parsing [sent. 13776 len. 35]: It was evident that the three daughters had grown up as they could and had had just as little haphazard instruction as qualified them to be their father 's playthings in his idlest hours .
Parsing [sent. 13777 len. 63]: His pictorial tastes were consulted , I observed , in their respective styles of wearing their hair , the Beauty daughter being in the classic manner , the Sentiment daughter luxuriant and flowing , and the Comedy daughter in the arch style , with a good deal of sprightly forehead , and vivacious little curls dotted about the corners of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 13778 len. 15]: They were dressed to correspond , though in a most untidy and negligent way .
Parsing [sent. 13779 len. 16]: Ada and I conversed with these young ladies and found them wonderfully like their father .
Parsing [sent. 13780 len. 45]: In the meanwhile Mr. Jarndyce -LRB- who had been rubbing his head to a great extent , and hinted at a change in the wind -RRB- talked with Mrs. Skimpole in a corner , where we could not help hearing the chink of money .
Parsing [sent. 13781 len. 20]: Mr. Skimpole had previously volunteered to go home with us and had withdrawn to dress himself for the purpose .
Parsing [sent. 13782 len. 18]: `` My roses , '' he said when he came back , `` take care of mama .
Parsing [sent. 13783 len. 5]: She is poorly to-day .
Parsing [sent. 13784 len. 23]: By going home with Mr. Jarndyce for a day or two , I shall hear the larks sing and preserve my amiability .
Parsing [sent. 13785 len. 20]: It has been tried , you know , and would be tried again if I remained at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 13786 len. 6]: `` That bad man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13787 len. 5]: said the Comedy daughter .
Parsing [sent. 13788 len. 26]: `` At the very time when he knew papa was lying ill by his wallflowers , looking at the blue sky , '' Laura complained .
Parsing [sent. 13789 len. 13]: `` And when the smell of hay was in the air ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13790 len. 3]: said Arethusa .
Parsing [sent. 13791 len. 22]: `` It showed a want of poetry in the man , '' Mr. Skimpole assented , but with perfect good humour .
Parsing [sent. 13792 len. 5]: `` It was coarse .
Parsing [sent. 13793 len. 13]: There was an absence of the finer touches of humanity in it !
Parsing [sent. 13794 len. 26]: My daughters have taken great offence , '' he explained to us , `` at an honest man -- '' `` Not honest , papa .
Parsing [sent. 13795 len. 3]: Impossible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13796 len. 5]: they all three protested .
Parsing [sent. 13797 len. 39]: `` At a rough kind of fellow -- a sort of human hedgehog rolled up , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` who is a baker in this neighbourhood and from whom we borrowed a couple of armchairs .
Parsing [sent. 13798 len. 32]: We wanted a couple of arm-chairs , and we had n't got them , and therefore of course we looked to a man who HAD got them , to lend them .
Parsing [sent. 13799 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 13800 len. 12]: This morose person lent them , and we wore them out .
Parsing [sent. 13801 len. 11]: When they were worn out , he wanted them back .
Parsing [sent. 13802 len. 5]: He had them back .
Parsing [sent. 13803 len. 8]: He was contented , you will say .
Parsing [sent. 13804 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 13805 len. 7]: He objected to their being worn .
Parsing [sent. 13806 len. 11]: I reasoned with him , and pointed out his mistake .
Parsing [sent. 13807 len. 38]: I said , ` Can you , at your time of life , be so headstrong , my friend , as to persist that an arm-chair is a thing to put upon a shelf and look at ?
Parsing [sent. 13808 len. 22]: That it is an object to contemplate , to survey from a distance , to consider from a point of sight ?
Parsing [sent. 13809 len. 15]: Do n't you KNOW that these arm-chairs were borrowed to be sat upon ? '
Parsing [sent. 13810 len. 10]: He was unreasonable and unpersuadable and used intemperate language .
Parsing [sent. 13811 len. 17]: Being as patient as I am at this minute , I addressed another appeal to him .
Parsing [sent. 13812 len. 28]: I said , ` Now , my good man , however our business capacities may vary , we are all children of one great mother , Nature .
Parsing [sent. 13813 len. 43]: On this blooming summer morning here you see me ' -LRB- I was on the sofa -RRB- ` with flowers before me , fruit upon the table , the cloudless sky above me , the air full of fragrance , contemplating Nature .
Parsing [sent. 13814 len. 29]: I entreat you , by our common brotherhood , not to interpose between me and a subject so sublime , the absurd figure of an angry baker ! '
Parsing [sent. 13815 len. 34]: But he did , '' said Mr. Skimpole , raising his laughing eyes in playful astonishinent ; `` he did interpose that ridiculous figure , and he does , and he will again .
Parsing [sent. 13816 len. 22]: And therefore I am very glad to get out of his way and to go home with my friend Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 13817 len. 39]: It seemed to escape his consideration that Mrs. Skimpole and the daughters remained behind to encounter the baker , but this was so old a story to all of them that it had become a matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 13818 len. 33]: He took leave of his family with a tenderness as airy and graceful as any other aspect in which he showed himself and rode away with us in perfect harmony of mind .
Parsing [sent. 13819 len. 30]: We had an opportunity of seeing through some open doors , as we went downstairs , that his own apartment was a palace to the rest of the house .
Parsing [sent. 13820 len. 41]: I could have no anticipation , and I had none , that something very startling to me at the moment , and ever memorable to me in what ensued from it , was to happen before this day was out .
Parsing [sent. 13821 len. 39]: Our guest was in such spirits on the way home that I could do nothing but listen to him and wonder at him ; nor was I alone in this , for Ada yielded to the same fascination .
Parsing [sent. 13822 len. 36]: As to my guardian , the wind , which had threatened to become fixed in the east when we left Somers Town , veered completely round before we were a couple of miles from it .
Parsing [sent. 13823 len. 24]: Whether of questionable childishness or not in any other matters , Mr. Skimpole had a child 's enjoyment of change and bright weather .
Parsing [sent. 13824 len. 53]: In no way wearied by his sallies on the road , he was in the drawing-room before any of us ; and I heard him at the piano while I was yet looking after my housekeeping , singing refrains of barcaroles and drinking songs , Italian and German , by the score .
Parsing [sent. 13825 len. 80]: We were all assembled shortly before dinner , and he was still at the piano idly picking out in his luxurious way little strains of music , and talking between whiles of finishing some sketches of the ruined old Verulam wall to-morrow , which he had begun a year or two ago and had got tired of , when a card was brought in and my guardian read aloud in a surprised voice , `` Sir Leicester Dedlock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13826 len. 23]: The visitor was in the room while it was yet turning round with me and before I had the power to stir .
Parsing [sent. 13827 len. 12]: If I had had it , I should have hurried away .
Parsing [sent. 13828 len. 34]: I had not even the presence of mind , in my giddiness , to retire to Ada in the window , or to see the window , or to know where it was .
Parsing [sent. 13829 len. 20]: I heard my name and found that my guardian was presenting me before I could move to a chair .
Parsing [sent. 13830 len. 9]: `` Pray be seated , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 13831 len. 39]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , '' said Sir Leicester in reply as he bowed and seated himself , `` I do myself the honour of calling here -- '' `` You do ME the honour , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 13832 len. 92]: `` Thank you -- of calling here on my road from Lincolnshire to express my regret that any cause of complaint , however strong , that I may have against a gentleman who -- who is known to you and has been your host , and to whom therefore I will make no farther reference , should have prevented you , still more ladies under your escort and charge , from seeing whatever little there may be to gratify a polite and refined taste at my house , Chesney Wold . ''
Parsing [sent. 13833 len. 31]: `` You are exceedingly obliging , Sir Leicester , and on behalf of those ladies -LRB- who are present -RRB- and for myself , I thank you very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 13834 len. 95]: `` It is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that the gentleman to whom , for the reasons I have mentioned , I refrain from making further allusion -- it is possible , Mr. Jarndyce , that that gentleman may have done me the honour so far to misapprehend my character as to induce you to believe that you would not have been received by my local establishment in Lincolnshire with that urbanity , that courtesy , which its members are instructed to show to all ladies and gentlemen who present themselves at that house .
Parsing [sent. 13835 len. 16]: I merely beg to observe , sir , that the fact is the reverse . ''
Parsing [sent. 13836 len. 12]: My guardian delicately dismissed this remark without making any verbal answer .
Parsing [sent. 13837 len. 16]: `` It has given me pain , Mr. Jarndyce , '' Sir Leicester weightily proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 13838 len. 94]: `` I assure you , sir , it has given -- me -- pain -- to learn from the housekeeper at Chesney Wold that a gentleman who was in your company in that part of the county , and who would appear to possess a cultivated taste for the fine arts , was likewise deterred by some such cause from examining the family pictures with that leisure , that attention , that care , which he might have desired to bestow upon them and which some of them might possibly have repaid . ''
Parsing [sent. 13839 len. 40]: Here he produced a card and read , with much gravity and a little trouble , through his eye-glass , `` Mr. Hirrold -- Herald -- Harold -- Skampling -- Skumpling -- I beg your pardon -- Skimpole . ''
Parsing [sent. 13840 len. 15]: `` This is Mr. Harold Skimpole , '' said my guardian , evidently surprised .
Parsing [sent. 13841 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13842 len. 23]: exclaimed Sir Leicester , `` I am happy to meet Mr. Skimpole and to have the opportunity of tendering my personal regrets .
Parsing [sent. 13843 len. 29]: I hope , sir , that when you again find yourself in my part of the county , you will be under no similar sense of restraint . ''
Parsing [sent. 13844 len. 10]: `` You are very obliging , Sir Leicester Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13845 len. 20]: So encouraged , I shall certainly give myself the pleasure and advantage of another visit to your beautiful house .
Parsing [sent. 13846 len. 26]: The owners of such places as Chesney Wold , '' said Mr. Skimpole with his usual happy and easy air , `` are public benefactors .
Parsing [sent. 13847 len. 42]: They are good enough to maintain a number of delightful objects for the admiration and pleasure of us poor men ; and not to reap all the admiration and pleasure that they yield is to be ungrateful to our benefactors . ''
Parsing [sent. 13848 len. 10]: Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this sentiment highly .
Parsing [sent. 13849 len. 7]: `` An artist , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13850 len. 8]: `` No , '' returned Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 13851 len. 6]: `` A perfectly idle man .
Parsing [sent. 13852 len. 5]: A mere amateur . ''
Parsing [sent. 13853 len. 10]: Sir Leicester seemed to approve of this even more .
Parsing [sent. 13854 len. 22]: He hoped he might have the good fortune to be at Chesney Wold when Mr. Skimpole next came down into Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 13855 len. 9]: Mr. Skimpole professed himself much flattered and honoured .
Parsing [sent. 13856 len. 82]: `` Mr. Skimpole mentioned , '' pursued Sir Leicester , addressing himself again to my guardian , `` mentioned to the house-keeper , who , as he may have observed , is an old and attached retainer of the family -- '' -LRB- `` That is , when I walked through the house the other day , on the occasion of my going down to visit Miss Summerson and Miss Clare , '' Mr. Skimpole airily explained to us . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 13857 len. 17]: -- That the friend with whom he had formerly been staying there was Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 13858 len. 10]: Sir Leicester bowed to the bearer of that name .
Parsing [sent. 13859 len. 17]: `` And hence I became aware of the circumstance for which I have professed my regret .
Parsing [sent. 13860 len. 62]: That this should have occurred to any gentleman , Mr. Jarndyce , but especially a gentleman formerly known to Lady Dedlock , and indeed claiming some distant connexion with her , and for whom -LRB- as I learn from my Lady herself -RRB- she entertains a high respect , does , I assure you , give -- me -- pain . ''
Parsing [sent. 13861 len. 16]: `` Pray say no more about it , Sir Leicester , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 13862 len. 18]: `` I am very sensible , as I am sure we all are , of your consideration .
Parsing [sent. 13863 len. 15]: Indeed the mistake was mine , and I ought to apologize for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 13864 len. 7]: I had not once looked up .
Parsing [sent. 13865 len. 18]: I had not seen the visitor and had not even appeared to myself to hear the conversation .
Parsing [sent. 13866 len. 24]: It surprises me to find that I can recall it , for it seemed to make no impression on me as it passed .
Parsing [sent. 13867 len. 45]: I heard them speaking , but my mind was so confused and my instinctive avoidance of this gentleman made his presence so distressing to me that I thought I understood nothing , through the rushing in my head and the beating of my heart .
Parsing [sent. 13868 len. 53]: `` I mentioned the subject to Lady Dedlock , '' said Sir Leicester , rising , `` and my Lady informed me that she had had the pleasure of exchanging a few words with Mr. Jarndyce and his wards on the occasion of an accidental meeting during their sojourn in the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 13869 len. 26]: Permit me , Mr. Jarndyce , to repeat to yourself , and to these ladies , the assurance I have already tendered to Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 13870 len. 42]: Circumstances undoubtedly prevent my saying that it would afford me any gratification to hear that Mr. Boythorn had favoured my house with his presence , but those circumstances are confined to that gentleman himself and do not extend beyond him . ''
Parsing [sent. 13871 len. 19]: `` You know my old opinion of him , '' said Mr. Skimpole , lightly appealing to us .
Parsing [sent. 13872 len. 14]: `` An amiable bull who is detenined to make every colour scarlet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13873 len. 29]: Sir Leicester Dedlock coughed as if he could not possibly hear another word in reference to such an individual and took his leave with great ceremony and politeness .
Parsing [sent. 13874 len. 20]: I got to my own room with all possible speed and remained there until I had recovered my self-command .
Parsing [sent. 13875 len. 35]: It had been very much disturbed , but I was thankful to find when I went downstairs again that they only rallied me for having been shy and mute before the great Lincolnshire baronet .
Parsing [sent. 13876 len. 24]: By that time I had made up my mind that the period was come when I must tell my guardian what I knew .
Parsing [sent. 13877 len. 56]: The possibility of my being brought into contact with my mother , of my being taken to her house , even of Mr. Skimpole 's , however distantly associated with me , receiving kindnesses and obligations from her husband , was so painful that I felt I could no longer guide myself without his assistance .
Parsing [sent. 13878 len. 37]: When we had retired for the night , and Ada and I had had our usual talk in our pretty room , I went out at my door again and sought my guardian among his books .
Parsing [sent. 13879 len. 27]: I knew he always read at that hour , and as I drew near I saw the light shining out into the passage from his reading-lamp .
Parsing [sent. 13880 len. 9]: `` May I come in , guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13881 len. 6]: `` Surely , little woman .
Parsing [sent. 13882 len. 6]: What 's the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13883 len. 6]: `` Nothing is the matter .
Parsing [sent. 13884 len. 20]: I thought I would like to take this quiet time of saying a word to you about myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 13885 len. 25]: He put a chair for me , shut his book , and put it by , and turned his kind attentive face towards me .
Parsing [sent. 13886 len. 38]: I could not help observing that it wore that curious expression I had observed in it once before -- on that night when he had said that he was in no trouble which I could readily understand .
Parsing [sent. 13887 len. 18]: `` What concerns you , my dear Esther , '' said he , `` concerns us all .
Parsing [sent. 13888 len. 15]: You can not be more ready to speak than I am to hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 13889 len. 7]: `` I know that , guardian .
Parsing [sent. 13890 len. 11]: But I have such need of your advice and support .
Parsing [sent. 13891 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 13892 len. 12]: You do n't know how much need I have to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 13893 len. 15]: He looked unprepared for my being so earnest , and even a little alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 13894 len. 26]: `` Or how anxious I have been to speak to you , '' said I , `` ever since the visitor was here to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 13895 len. 7]: `` The visitor , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 13896 len. 5]: Sir Leicester Dedlock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13897 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 13898 len. 24]: He folded his arms and sat looking at me with an air of the profoundest astonishment , awaiting what I should say next .
Parsing [sent. 13899 len. 9]: I did not know how to prepare him .
Parsing [sent. 13900 len. 35]: `` Why , Esther , '' said he , breaking into a smile , `` our visitor and you are the two last persons on earth I should have thought of connecting together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13901 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes , guardian , I know it .
Parsing [sent. 13902 len. 11]: And I too , but a little while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 13903 len. 14]: The smile passed from his face , and he became graver than before .
Parsing [sent. 13904 len. 26]: He crossed to the door to see that it was shut -LRB- but I had seen to that -RRB- and resumed his seat before me .
Parsing [sent. 13905 len. 31]: `` Guardian , '' said I , `` do you remensher , when we were overtaken by the thunder-storm , Lady Dedlock 's speaking to you of her sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13906 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 13907 len. 6]: Of course I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 13908 len. 19]: `` And reminding you that she and her sister had differed , had gone their several ways ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13909 len. 5]: `` Of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 13910 len. 9]: `` Why did they separate , guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13911 len. 10]: His face quite altered as he looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 13912 len. 9]: `` My child , what questions are these !
Parsing [sent. 13913 len. 4]: I never knew .
Parsing [sent. 13914 len. 11]: No one but themselves ever did know , I believe .
Parsing [sent. 13915 len. 15]: Who could tell what the secrets of those two handsome and proud women were !
Parsing [sent. 13916 len. 6]: You have seen Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 13917 len. 23]: If you had ever seen her sister , you would know her to have been as resolute and haughty as she . ''
Parsing [sent. 13918 len. 16]: `` Oh , guardian , I have seen her many and many a time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13919 len. 5]: `` Seen her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13920 len. 9]: He paused a little , biting his lip .
Parsing [sent. 13921 len. 68]: `` Then , Esther , when you spoke to me long ago of Boythorn , and when I told you that he was all but married once , and that the lady did not die , but died to him , and that that time had had its influence on his later life -- did you know it all , and know who the lady was ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13922 len. 19]: `` No , guardian , '' I returned , fearful of the light that dimly broke upon me .
Parsing [sent. 13923 len. 8]: `` Nor do I know yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 13924 len. 7]: `` Lady Dedlock 's sister . ''
Parsing [sent. 13925 len. 25]: `` And why , '' I could scarcely ask him , `` why , guardian , pray tell me why were THEY parted ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13926 len. 16]: `` It was her act , and she kept its motives in her inflexible heart .
Parsing [sent. 13927 len. 87]: He afterwards did conjecture -LRB- but it was mere conjecture -RRB- that some injury which her haughty spirit had received in her cause of quarrel with her sister had wounded her beyond all reason , but she wrote him that from the date of that letter she died to him -- as in literal truth she did -- and that the resolution was exacted from her by her knowledge of his proud temper and his strained sense of honour , which were both her nature too .
Parsing [sent. 13928 len. 36]: In consideration for those master points in him , and even in consideration for them in herself , she made the sacrifice , she said , and would live in it and die in it .
Parsing [sent. 13929 len. 21]: She did both , I fear ; certainly he never saw her , never heard of her from that hour .
Parsing [sent. 13930 len. 6]: Nor did any one . ''
Parsing [sent. 13931 len. 11]: `` Oh , guardian , what have I done ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13932 len. 18]: I cried , giving way to my grief ; `` what sorrow have I innocently caused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13933 len. 7]: `` You caused , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13934 len. 5]: `` Yes , guardian .
Parsing [sent. 13935 len. 6]: Innocently , but most surely .
Parsing [sent. 13936 len. 9]: That secluded sister is my first remembrance . ''
Parsing [sent. 13937 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13938 len. 5]: he cried , starting .
Parsing [sent. 13939 len. 7]: `` Yes , guardian , yes !
Parsing [sent. 13940 len. 8]: And HER sister is my mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13941 len. 19]: I would have told him all my mother 's letter , but he would not hear it then .
Parsing [sent. 13942 len. 73]: He spoke so tenderly and wisely to me , and he put so plainly before me all I had myself imperfectly thought and hoped in my better state of mind , that , penetrated as I had been with fervent gratitude towards him through so many years , I believed I had never loved him so dearly , never thanked him in my heart so fully , as I did that night .
Parsing [sent. 13943 len. 82]: And when he had taken me to my room and kissed me at the door , and when at last I lay down to sleep , my thought was how could I ever be busy enough , how could I ever be good enough , how in my little way could I ever hope to be forgetful enough of myself , devoted enough to him , and useful enough to others , to show him how I blessed and honoured him .
Parsing [sent. 13944 len. 33]: Chapter XLIV -- The Letter and the Answer My guardian called me into his room next morning , and then I told him what had been left untold on the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 13945 len. 26]: There was nothing to be done , he said , but to keep the secret and to avoid another such encounter as that of yesterday .
Parsing [sent. 13946 len. 9]: He understood my feeling and entirely shared it .
Parsing [sent. 13947 len. 13]: He charged himself even with restraining Mr. Skimpole from improving his opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 13948 len. 22]: One person whom he need not name to me , it was not now possible for him to advise or help .
Parsing [sent. 13949 len. 12]: He wished it were , but no such thing could be .
Parsing [sent. 13950 len. 24]: If her mistrust of the lawyer whom she had mentioned were well -- founded , which he scarcely doubted , he dreaded discovery .
Parsing [sent. 13951 len. 24]: He knew something of him , both by sight and by reputation , and it was certain that he was a dangerous man .
Parsing [sent. 13952 len. 27]: Whatever happened , he repeatedly impressed upon me with anxious affection and kindness , I was as innocent of as himself and as unable to influence .
Parsing [sent. 13953 len. 21]: `` Nor do I understand , '' said he , `` that any doubts tend towards you , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 13954 len. 9]: Much suspicion may exist without that connexion . ''
Parsing [sent. 13955 len. 9]: `` With the lawyer , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 13956 len. 16]: `` But two other persons have come into my mind since I have been anxious .
Parsing [sent. 13957 len. 38]: Then I told him all about Mr. Guppy , who I feared might have had his vague surmises when I little understood his meaning , but in whose silence after our last interview I expressed perfect confidence .
Parsing [sent. 13958 len. 8]: `` Well , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 13959 len. 10]: `` Then we may dismiss him for the present .
Parsing [sent. 13960 len. 6]: Who is the other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13961 len. 20]: I called to his recollection the French maid and the eager offer of herself she had made to me .
Parsing [sent. 13962 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13963 len. 4]: he returned thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 13964 len. 11]: `` That is a more alarming person than the clerk .
Parsing [sent. 13965 len. 16]: But after all , my dear , it was but seeking for a new service .
Parsing [sent. 13966 len. 23]: She had seen you and Ada a little while before , and it was natural that you should come into her head .
Parsing [sent. 13967 len. 11]: She merely proposed herself for your maid , you know .
Parsing [sent. 13968 len. 6]: She did nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 13969 len. 44]: `` Her manner was strange , '' said I. `` Yes , and her manner was strange when she took her shoes off and showed that cool relish for a walk that might have ended in her death-bed , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 13970 len. 16]: `` It would be useless self-distress and torment to reckon up such chances and possibilities .
Parsing [sent. 13971 len. 18]: There are very few harmless circumstances that would not seem full of perilous meaning , so considered .
Parsing [sent. 13972 len. 6]: Be hopeful , little woman .
Parsing [sent. 13973 len. 23]: You can be nothing better than yourself ; be that , through this knowledge , as you were before you had it .
Parsing [sent. 13974 len. 12]: It is the best you can do for everybody 's sake .
Parsing [sent. 13975 len. 45]: I , sharing the secret with you -- '' `` And lightening it , guardian , so much , '' said I. '' -- will be attentive to what passes in that family , so far as I can observe it from my distance .
Parsing [sent. 13976 len. 45]: And if the time should come when I can stretch out a hand to render the least service to one whom it is better not to name even here , I will not fail to do it for her dear daughter 's sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 13977 len. 8]: I thanked him with my whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 13978 len. 9]: What could I ever do but thank him !
Parsing [sent. 13979 len. 16]: I was going out at the door when he asked me to stay a moment .
Parsing [sent. 13980 len. 40]: Quickly turning round , I saw that same expression on his face again ; and all at once , I do n't know how , it flashed upon me as a new and far-off possibility that I understood it .
Parsing [sent. 13981 len. 29]: `` My dear Esther , '' said my guardian , `` I have long had something in my thoughts that I have wished to say to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 13982 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13983 len. 15]: `` I have had some difficulty in approaching it , and I still have .
Parsing [sent. 13984 len. 15]: I should wish it to be so deliberately said , and so deliberately considered .
Parsing [sent. 13985 len. 9]: Would you object to my writing it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13986 len. 18]: `` Dear guardian , how could I object to your writing anything for ME to read ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13987 len. 46]: `` Then see , my love , '' said he with his cheery smile , `` am I at this moment quite as plain and easy -- do I seem as open , as honest and old-fashioned -- as I am at any time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13988 len. 10]: I answered in all earnestness , `` Quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 13989 len. 33]: With the strictest truth , for his momentary hesitation was gone -LRB- it had not lasted a minute -RRB- , and his fine , sensible , cordial , sterling manner was restored .
Parsing [sent. 13990 len. 28]: `` Do I look as if I suppressed anything , meant anything but what I said , had any reservation at all , no matter what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13991 len. 10]: said he with his bright clear eyes on mine .
Parsing [sent. 13992 len. 9]: I answered , most assuredly he did not .
Parsing [sent. 13993 len. 18]: `` Can you fully trust me , and thoroughly rely on what I profess , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13994 len. 12]: `` Most thoroughly , '' said I with my whole heart .
Parsing [sent. 13995 len. 17]: `` My dear girl , '' returned my guardian , `` give me your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 13996 len. 65]: He took it in his , holding me lightly with his arm , and looking down into my face with the same genuine freshness and faithfulness of manner -- the old protecting manner which had made that house my home in a moment -- said , `` You have wrought changes in me , little woman , since the winter day in the stage-coach .
Parsing [sent. 13997 len. 16]: First and last you have done me a world of good since that time . ''
Parsing [sent. 13998 len. 16]: `` Ah , guardian , what have you done for me since that time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 13999 len. 17]: `` But , '' said he , `` that is not to be remembered now . ''
Parsing [sent. 14000 len. 8]: `` It never can be forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 14001 len. 28]: `` Yes , Esther , '' said he with a gentle seriousness , `` it is to be forgotten now , to be forgotten for a while .
Parsing [sent. 14002 len. 16]: You are only to remember now that nothing can change me as you know me .
Parsing [sent. 14003 len. 12]: Can you feel quite assured of that , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14004 len. 12]: `` I can , and I do , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 14005 len. 9]: `` That 's much , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 14006 len. 5]: `` That 's everything .
Parsing [sent. 14007 len. 10]: But I must not take that at a word .
Parsing [sent. 14008 len. 26]: I will not write this something in my thoughts until you have quite resolved within yourself that nothing can change me as you know me .
Parsing [sent. 14009 len. 15]: If you doubt that in the least degree , I will never write it .
Parsing [sent. 14010 len. 25]: If you are sure of that , on good consideration , send Charley to me this night week -- ` for the letter . '
Parsing [sent. 14011 len. 11]: But if you are not quite certain , never send .
Parsing [sent. 14012 len. 15]: Mind , I trust to your truth , in this thing as in everything .
Parsing [sent. 14013 len. 15]: If you are not quite certain on that one point , never send ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14014 len. 30]: `` Guardian , '' said I , `` I am already certain , I can no more be changed in that conviction than you can be changed towards me .
Parsing [sent. 14015 len. 9]: I shall send Charley for the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 14016 len. 9]: He shook my hand and said no more .
Parsing [sent. 14017 len. 22]: Nor was any more said in reference to this conversation , either by him or me , through the whole week .
Parsing [sent. 14018 len. 44]: When the appointed night came , I said to Charley as soon as I was alone , `` Go and knock at Mr. Jarndyce 's door , Charley , and say you have come from me -- ` for the letter . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 14019 len. 57]: Charley went up the stairs , and down the stairs , and along the passages -- the zig-zag way about the old-fashioned house seemed very long in my listening ears that night -- and so came back , along the passages , and down the stairs , and up the stairs , and brought the letter .
Parsing [sent. 14020 len. 13]: `` Lay it on the table , Charley , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 14021 len. 28]: So Charley laid it on the table and went to bed , and I sat looking at it without taking it up , thinking of many things .
Parsing [sent. 14022 len. 59]: I began with my overshadowed childhood , and passed through those timid days to the heavy time when my aunt lay dead , with her resolute face so cold and set , and when I was more solitary with Mrs. Rachael than if I had had no one in the world to speak to or to look at .
Parsing [sent. 14023 len. 25]: I passed to the altered days when I was so blest as to find friends in all around me , and to be beloved .
Parsing [sent. 14024 len. 29]: I came to the time when I first saw my dear girl and was received into that sisterly affection which was the grace and beauty of my life .
Parsing [sent. 14025 len. 32]: I recalled the first bright gleam of welcome which had shone out of those very windows upon our expectant faces on that cold bright night , and which had never paled .
Parsing [sent. 14026 len. 54]: I lived my happy life there over again , I went through my illness and recovery , I thought of myself so altered and of those around me so unchanged ; and all this happiness shone like a light from one central figure , represented before me by the letter on the table .
Parsing [sent. 14027 len. 7]: I opened it and read it .
Parsing [sent. 14028 len. 44]: It was so impressive in its love for me , and in the unselfish caution it gave me , and the consideration it showed for me in every word , that my eyes were too often blinded to read much at a time .
Parsing [sent. 14029 len. 13]: But I read it through three times before I laid it down .
Parsing [sent. 14030 len. 14]: I had thought beforehand that I knew its purport , and I did .
Parsing [sent. 14031 len. 13]: It asked me , would I be the mistress of Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 14032 len. 29]: It was not a love letter , though it expressed so much love , but was written just as he would at any time have spoken to me .
Parsing [sent. 14033 len. 23]: I saw his face , and heard his voice , and felt the influence of his kind protecting manner in every line .
Parsing [sent. 14034 len. 28]: It addressed me as if our places were reversed , as if all the good deeds had been mine and all the feelings they had awakened his .
Parsing [sent. 14035 len. 57]: It dwelt on my being young , and he past the prime of life ; on his having attained a ripe age , while I was a child ; on his writing to me with a silvered head , and knowing all this so well as to set it in full before me for mature deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 14036 len. 47]: It told me that I would gain nothing by such a marriage and lose nothing by rejecting it , for no new relation could enhance the tenderness in which he held me , and whatever my decision was , he was certain it would be right .
Parsing [sent. 14037 len. 45]: But he had considered this step anew since our late confidence and had decided on taking it , if it only served to show me through one poor instance that the whole world would readily unite to falsify the stern prediction of my childhood .
Parsing [sent. 14038 len. 45]: I was the last to know what happiness I could bestow upon him , but of that he said no more , for I was always to remember that I owed him nothing and that he was my debtor , and for very much .
Parsing [sent. 14039 len. 58]: He had often thought of our future , and foreseeing that the time must come , and fearing that it might come soon , when Ada -LRB- now very nearly of age -RRB- would leave us , and when our present mode of life must be broken up , had become accustomed to reflect on this proposal .
Parsing [sent. 14040 len. 5]: Thus he made it .
Parsing [sent. 14041 len. 80]: If I felt that I could ever give him the best right he could have to be my protector , and if I felt that I could happily and justly become the dear companion of his remaining life , superior to all lighter chances and changes than death , even then he could not have me bind myself irrevocably while this letter was yet so new to me , but even then I must have ample time for reconsideration .
Parsing [sent. 14042 len. 34]: In that case , or in the opposite case , let him be unchanged in his old relation , in his old manner , in the old name by which I called him .
Parsing [sent. 14043 len. 21]: And as to his bright Dame Durden and little housekeeper , she would ever be the same , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 14044 len. 42]: This was the substance of the letter , written throughout with a justice and a dignity as if he were indeed my responsible guardian impartially representing the proposal of a friend against whom in his integrity he stated the full case .
Parsing [sent. 14045 len. 29]: But he did not hint to me that when I had been better looking he had had this same proceeding in his thoughts and had refrained from it .
Parsing [sent. 14046 len. 29]: That when my old face was gone from me , and I had no attractions , he could love me just as well as in my fairer days .
Parsing [sent. 14047 len. 11]: That the discovery of my birth gave him no shock .
Parsing [sent. 14048 len. 13]: That his generosity rose above my disfigurement and my inheritance of shame .
Parsing [sent. 14049 len. 23]: That the more I stood in need of such fidelity , the more firmly I might trust in him to the last .
Parsing [sent. 14050 len. 11]: But I knew it , I knew it well now .
Parsing [sent. 14051 len. 28]: It came upon me as the close of the benignant history I had been pursuing , and I felt that I had but one thing to do .
Parsing [sent. 14052 len. 30]: To devote my life to his happiness was to thank him poorly , and what had I wished for the other night but some new means of thanking him ?
Parsing [sent. 14053 len. 58]: Still I cried very much , not only in the fullness of my heart after reading the letter , not only in the strangeness of the prospect -- for it was strange though I had expected the contents -- but as if something for which there was no name or distinct idea were indefinitely lost to me .
Parsing [sent. 14054 len. 17]: I was very happy , very thankful , very hopeful ; but I cried very much .
Parsing [sent. 14055 len. 10]: By and by I went to my old glass .
Parsing [sent. 14056 len. 24]: My eyes were red and swollen , and I said , `` Oh , Esther , Esther , can that be you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14057 len. 30]: I am afraid the face in the glass was going to cry again at this reproach , but I held up my finger at it , and it stopped .
Parsing [sent. 14058 len. 25]: `` That is more like the composed look you comforted me with , my dear , when you showed me such a change ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14059 len. 10]: said I , beginning to let down my hair .
Parsing [sent. 14060 len. 19]: `` When you are mistress of Bleak House , you are to be as cheerful as a bird .
Parsing [sent. 14061 len. 21]: In fact , you are always to be cheerful ; so let us begin for once and for all . ''
Parsing [sent. 14062 len. 11]: I went on with my hair now , quite comfortably .
Parsing [sent. 14063 len. 22]: I sobbed a little still , but that was because I had been crying , not because I was crying then .
Parsing [sent. 14064 len. 14]: `` And so Esther , my dear , you are happy for life .
Parsing [sent. 14065 len. 37]: Happy with your best friends , happy in your old home , happy in the power of doing a great deal of good , and happy in the undeserved love of the best of men . ''
Parsing [sent. 14066 len. 29]: I thought , all at once , if my guardian had married some one else , how should I have felt , and what should I have done !
Parsing [sent. 14067 len. 8]: That would have been a change indeed .
Parsing [sent. 14068 len. 32]: It presented my life in such a new and blank form that I rang my housekeeping keys and gave them a kiss before I laid them down in their basket again .
Parsing [sent. 14069 len. 63]: Then I went on to think , as I dressed my hair before the glass , how often had I considered within myself that the deep traces of my illness and the circumstances of my birth were only new reasons why I should be busy , busy , busy -- useful , amiable , serviceable , in all honest , unpretending ways .
Parsing [sent. 14070 len. 17]: This was a good time , to be sure , to sit down morbidly and cry !
Parsing [sent. 14071 len. 44]: As to its seeming at all strange to me at first -LRB- if that were any excuse for crying , which it was not -RRB- that I was one day to be the mistress of Bleak House , why should it seem strange ?
Parsing [sent. 14072 len. 13]: Other people had thought of such things , if I had not .
Parsing [sent. 14073 len. 44]: `` Do n't you remember , my plain dear , '' I asked myself , looking at the glass , `` what Mrs. Woodcourt said before those scars were there about your marrying -- '' Perhaps the name brought them to my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 14074 len. 7]: The dried remains of the flowers .
Parsing [sent. 14075 len. 10]: It would be better not to keep them now .
Parsing [sent. 14076 len. 25]: They had only been preserved in memory of something wholly past and gone , but it would be better not to keep them now .
Parsing [sent. 14077 len. 26]: They were in a book , and it happened to be in the next room -- our sitting-room , dividing Ada 's chamber from mine .
Parsing [sent. 14078 len. 15]: I took a candle and went softly in to fetch it from its shelf .
Parsing [sent. 14079 len. 30]: After I had it in my hand , I saw my beautiful darling , through the open door , lying asleep , and I stole in to kiss her .
Parsing [sent. 14080 len. 34]: It was weak in me , I know , and I could have no reason for crying ; but I dropped a tear upon her dear face , and another , and another .
Parsing [sent. 14081 len. 20]: Weaker than that , I took the withered flowers out and put them for a moment to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 14082 len. 21]: I thought about her love for Richard , though , indeed , the flowers had nothing to do with that .
Parsing [sent. 14083 len. 23]: Then I took them into my own room and burned them at the candle , and they were dust in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 14084 len. 25]: On entering the breakfast-room next morning , I found my guardian just as usual , quite as frank , as open , and free .
Parsing [sent. 14085 len. 24]: There being not the least constraint in his manner , there was none -LRB- or I think there was none -RRB- in mine .
Parsing [sent. 14086 len. 48]: I was with him several times in the course of the morning , in and out , when there was no one there , and I thought it not unlikely that he might speak to me about the letter , but he did not say a word .
Parsing [sent. 14087 len. 27]: So , on the next morning , and the next , and for at least a week , over which time Mr. Skimpole prolonged his stay .
Parsing [sent. 14088 len. 22]: I expected , every day , that my guardian might speak to me about the letter , but he never did .
Parsing [sent. 14089 len. 15]: I thought then , growing uneasy , that I ought to write an answer .
Parsing [sent. 14090 len. 41]: I tried over and over again in my own room at night , but I could not write an answer that at all began like a good answer , so I thought each night I would wait one more day .
Parsing [sent. 14091 len. 14]: And I waited seven more days , and he never said a word .
Parsing [sent. 14092 len. 49]: At last , Mr. Skimpole having departed , we three were one afternoon going out for a ride ; and I , being dressed before Ada and going down , came upon my guardian , with his back towards me , standing at the drawing-room window looking out .
Parsing [sent. 14093 len. 25]: He turned on my coming in and said , smiling , `` Aye , it 's you , little woman , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14094 len. 5]: and looked out again .
Parsing [sent. 14095 len. 12]: I had made up my mind to speak to him now .
Parsing [sent. 14096 len. 10]: In short , I had come down on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 14097 len. 29]: `` Guardian , '' I said , rather hesitating and trembling , `` when would you like to have the answer to the letter Charley came for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14098 len. 13]: `` When it 's ready , my dear , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 14099 len. 18]: `` I think it is ready , '' said I. `` Is Charley to bring it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14100 len. 4]: he asked pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 14101 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 14102 len. 12]: I have brought it myself , guardian , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 14103 len. 53]: I put my two arms round his neck and kissed him , and he said was this the mistress of Bleak House , and I said yes ; and it made no difference presently , and we all went out together , and I said nothing to my precious pet about it .
Parsing [sent. 14104 len. 54]: Chapter XLV -- In Trust One morning when I had done jingling about with my baskets of keys , as my beauty and I were walking round and round the garden I happened to turn my eyes towards the house and saw a long thin shadow going in which looked like Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 14105 len. 50]: Ada had been telling me only that morning of her hopes that Richard might exhaust his ardour in the Chancery suit by being so very earnest in it ; and therefore , not to damp my dear girl 's spirits , I said nothing about Mr. Vholes 's shadow .
Parsing [sent. 14106 len. 51]: Presently came Charley , lightly winding among the bushes and tripping along the paths , as rosy and pretty as one of Flora 's attendants instead of my maid , saying , `` Oh , if you please , miss , would you step and speak to Mr. Jarndyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14107 len. 39]: It was one of Charley 's peculiarities that whenever she was charged with a message she always began to deliver it as soon as she beheld , at any distance , the person for whom it was intended .
Parsing [sent. 14108 len. 27]: Therefore I saw Charley asking me in her usual form of words to `` step and speak '' to Mr. Jarndyce long before I heard her .
Parsing [sent. 14109 len. 20]: And when I did hear her , she had said it so often that she was out of breath .
Parsing [sent. 14110 len. 26]: I told Ada I would make haste back and inquired of Charley as we went in whether there was not a gentleman with Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 14111 len. 29]: To which Charley , whose grammar , I confess to my shame , never did any credit to my educational powers , replied , `` Yes , miss .
Parsing [sent. 14112 len. 12]: Him as come down in the country with Mr. Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 14113 len. 17]: A more complete contrast than my guardian and Mr. Vholes I suppose there could not be .
Parsing [sent. 14114 len. 77]: I found them looking at one another across a table , the one so open and the other so close , the one so broad and upright and the other so narrow and stooping , the one giving out what he had to say in such a rich ringing voice and the other keeping it in in such a cold-blooded , gasping , fish-like manner that I thought I never had seen two people so unmatched .
Parsing [sent. 14115 len. 14]: `` You know Mr. Vholes , my dear , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 14116 len. 10]: Not with the greatest urbanity , I must say .
Parsing [sent. 14117 len. 28]: Mr. Vholes rose , gloved and buttoned up as usual , and seated himself again , just as he had seated himself beside Richard in the gig .
Parsing [sent. 14118 len. 13]: Not having Richard to look at , he looked straight before him .
Parsing [sent. 14119 len. 36]: `` Mr. Vholes , '' said my guardian , eyeing his black figure as if he were a bird of ill omen , `` has brought an ugly report of our most unfortunate Rick . ''
Parsing [sent. 14120 len. 23]: Laying a marked emphasis on `` most unfortunate '' as if the words were rather descriptive of his connexion with Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 14121 len. 31]: I sat down between them ; Mr. Vholes remained immovable , except that he secretly picked at one of the red pimples on his yellow face with his black glove .
Parsing [sent. 14122 len. 30]: `` And as Rick and you are happily good friends , I should like to know , '' said my guardian , `` what you think , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 14123 len. 17]: Would you be so good as to -- as to speak up , Mr. Vholes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14124 len. 46]: Doing anything but that , Mr. Vholes observed , `` I have been saying that I have reason to know , Miss Summerson , as Mr. C. 's professional adviser , that Mr. C. 's circumstances are at the present moment in an embarrassed state .
Parsing [sent. 14125 len. 33]: Not so much in point of amount as owing to the peculiar and pressing nature of liabilities Mr. C. has incurred and the means he has of liquidating or meeting the same .
Parsing [sent. 14126 len. 26]: I have staved off many little matters for Mr. C. , but there is a limit to staving off , and we have reached it .
Parsing [sent. 14127 len. 60]: I have made some advances out of pocket to accommodate these unpleasantnesses , but I necessarily look to being repaid , for I do not pretend to be a man of capital , and I have a father to support in the Vale of Taunton , besides striving to realize some little independence for three dear girls at home .
Parsing [sent. 14128 len. 40]: My apprehension is , Mr. C. 's circumstances being such , lest it should end in his obtaining leave to part with his commission , which at all events is desirable to be made known to his connexions . ''
Parsing [sent. 14129 len. 37]: Mr. Vholes , who had looked at me while speaking , here emerged into the silence he could hardly be said to have broken , so stifled was his tone , and looked before him again .
Parsing [sent. 14130 len. 18]: `` Imagine the poor fellow without even his present resource , '' said my guardian to me .
Parsing [sent. 14131 len. 7]: `` Yet what can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 14132 len. 6]: You know him , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 14133 len. 10]: He would never accept of help from me now .
Parsing [sent. 14134 len. 22]: To offer it or hint at it would be to drive him to an extremity , if nothing else did . ''
Parsing [sent. 14135 len. 7]: Mr. Vholes hereupon addressed me again .
Parsing [sent. 14136 len. 19]: `` What Mr. Jarndyce remarks , miss , is no doubt the case , and is the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 14137 len. 22]: I do not see that anything is to be done , I do not say that anything is to be done .
Parsing [sent. 14138 len. 4]: Far from it .
Parsing [sent. 14139 len. 38]: I merely come down here under the seal of confidence and mention it in order that everything may be openly carried on and that it may not be said afterwards that everything was not openly carried on .
Parsing [sent. 14140 len. 11]: My wish is that everything should be openly carried on .
Parsing [sent. 14141 len. 10]: I desire to leave a good name behind me .
Parsing [sent. 14142 len. 17]: If I consulted merely my own interests with Mr. C. , I should not be here .
Parsing [sent. 14143 len. 14]: So insurmountable , as you must well know , would be his objections .
Parsing [sent. 14144 len. 7]: This is not a professional attendance .
Parsing [sent. 14145 len. 7]: This can he charged to nobody .
Parsing [sent. 14146 len. 32]: I have no interest in it except as a member of society and a father -- AND a son , '' said Mr. Vholes , who had nearly forgotten that point .
Parsing [sent. 14147 len. 36]: It appeared to us that Mr. Vholes said neither more nor less than the truth in intimating that he sought to divide the responsibility , such as it was , of knowing Richard 's situation .
Parsing [sent. 14148 len. 33]: I could only suggest that I should go down to Deal , where Richard was then stationed , and see him , and try if it were possible to avert the worst .
Parsing [sent. 14149 len. 31]: Without consulting Mr. Vholes on this point , I took my guardian aside to propose it , while Mr. Vholes gauntly stalked to the fire and warmed his funeral gloves .
Parsing [sent. 14150 len. 39]: The fatigue of the journey formed an immediate objection on my guardian 's part , but as I saw he had no other , and as I was only too happy to go , I got his consent .
Parsing [sent. 14151 len. 10]: We had then merely to dispose of Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 14152 len. 32]: `` Well , sir , '' said Mr. Jarndyce , `` Miss Summerson will communicate with Mr. Carstone , and you can only hope that his position may be yet retrievable .
Parsing [sent. 14153 len. 15]: You will allow me to order you lunch after your journey , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14154 len. 31]: `` I thank you , Mr. Jarndyce , '' said Mr. Vholes , putting out his long black sleeve to check the ringing of the bell , `` not any .
Parsing [sent. 14155 len. 10]: I thank you , no , not a morsel .
Parsing [sent. 14156 len. 19]: My digestion is much impaired , and I am but a poor knife and fork at any time .
Parsing [sent. 14157 len. 25]: If I was to partake of solid food at this period of the day , I do n't know what the consequences might be .
Parsing [sent. 14158 len. 20]: Everything having been openly carried on , sir , I will now with your permission take my leave . ''
Parsing [sent. 14159 len. 37]: `` And I would that you could take your leave , and we could all take our leave , Mr. Vholes , '' returned my guardian bitterly , `` of a cause you know of . ''
Parsing [sent. 14160 len. 44]: Mr. Vholes , whose black dye was so deep from head to foot that it had quite steamed before the fire , diffusing a very unpleasant perfume , made a short one-sided inclination of his head from the neck and slowly shook it .
Parsing [sent. 14161 len. 28]: `` We whose ambition it is to be looked upon in the light of respectable practitioners , sir , can but put our shoulders to the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 14162 len. 6]: We do it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14163 len. 23]: At least , I do it myself ; and I wish to think well of my professional brethren , one and all .
Parsing [sent. 14164 len. 21]: You are sensible of an obligation not to refer to me , miss , in communicating with Mr. C. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14165 len. 11]: I said I would be careful not to do it .
Parsing [sent. 14166 len. 6]: `` Just so , miss .
Parsing [sent. 14167 len. 3]: Good morning .
Parsing [sent. 14168 len. 9]: Mr. Jarndyce , good morning , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14169 len. 37]: Mr. Vholes put his dead glove , which scarcely seemed to have any hand in it , on my fingers , and then on my guardian 's fingers , and took his long thin shadow away .
Parsing [sent. 14170 len. 33]: I thought of it on the outside of the coach , passing over all the sunny landscape between us and London , chilling the seed in the ground as it glided along .
Parsing [sent. 14171 len. 27]: Of course it became necessary to tell Ada where I was going and why I was going , and of course she was anxious and distressed .
Parsing [sent. 14172 len. 32]: But she was too true to Richard to say anything but words of pity and words of excuse , and in a more loving spirit still -- my dear devoted girl !
Parsing [sent. 14173 len. 14]: -- she wrote him a long letter , of which I took charge .
Parsing [sent. 14174 len. 24]: Charley was to be my travelling companion , though I am sure I wanted none and would willingly have left her at home .
Parsing [sent. 14175 len. 19]: We all went to London that afternoon , and finding two places in the mail , secured them .
Parsing [sent. 14176 len. 17]: At our usual bed-time , Charley and I were rolling away seaward with the Kentish letters .
Parsing [sent. 14177 len. 27]: It was a night 's journey in those coach times , but we had the mail to ourselves and did not find the night very tedious .
Parsing [sent. 14178 len. 16]: It passed with me as I suppose it would with most people under such circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 14179 len. 13]: At one while my journey looked hopeful , and at another hopeless .
Parsing [sent. 14180 len. 21]: Now I thought I should do some good , and now I wondered how I could ever have supposed so .
Parsing [sent. 14181 len. 26]: Now it seemed one of the most reasonable things in the world that I should have come , and now one of the most unreasonable .
Parsing [sent. 14182 len. 62]: In what state I should find Richard , what I should say to him , and what he would say to me occupied my mind by turns with these two states of feeling ; and the wheels seemed to play one tune -LRB- to which the burden of my guardian 's letter set itself -RRB- over and over again all night .
Parsing [sent. 14183 len. 22]: At last we came into the narrow streets of Deal , and very gloomy they were upon a raw misty morning .
Parsing [sent. 14184 len. 60]: The long flat beach , with its little irregular houses , wooden and brick , and its litter of capstans , and great boats , and sheds , and bare upright poles with tackle and blocks , and loose gravelly waste places overgrown with grass and weeds , wore as dull an appearance as any place I ever saw .
Parsing [sent. 14185 len. 50]: The sea was heaving under a thick white fog ; and nothing else was moving but a few early ropemakers , who , with the yarn twisted round their bodies , looked as if , tired of their present state of existence , they were spinning themselves into cordage .
Parsing [sent. 14186 len. 46]: But when we got into a warm room in an excellent hotel and sat down , comfortably washed and dressed , to an early breakfast -LRB- for it was too late to think of going to bed -RRB- , Deal began to look more cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 14187 len. 17]: Our little room was like a ship 's cabin , and that delighted Charley very much .
Parsing [sent. 14188 len. 24]: Then the fog began to rise like a curtain , and numbers of ships that we had had no idea were near appeared .
Parsing [sent. 14189 len. 18]: I do n't know how many sail the waiter told us were then lying in the downs .
Parsing [sent. 14190 len. 85]: Some of these vessels were of grand size -- one was a large Indiaman just come home ; and when the sun shone through the clouds , maktng silvery pools in the dark sea , the way in which these ships brightened , and shadowed , and changed , amid a bustle of boats pulling off from the shore to them and from them to the shore , and a general life and motion in themselves and everything around them , was most beautiful .
Parsing [sent. 14191 len. 18]: The large Indiaman was our great attraction because she had come into the downs in the night .
Parsing [sent. 14192 len. 23]: She was surrounded by boats , and we said how glad the people on board of her must be to come ashore .
Parsing [sent. 14193 len. 46]: Charley was curious , too , about the voyage , and about the heat in India , and the serpents and the tigers ; and as she picked up such information much faster than grammar , I told her what I knew on those points .
Parsing [sent. 14194 len. 32]: I told her , too , how people in such voyages were sometimes wrecked and cast on rocks , where they were saved by the intrepidity and humanity of one man .
Parsing [sent. 14195 len. 21]: And Charley asking how that could be , I told her how we knew at home of such a case .
Parsing [sent. 14196 len. 26]: I had thought of sending Richard a note saying I was there , but it seemed so much better to go to him without preparation .
Parsing [sent. 14197 len. 22]: As he lived in barracks I was a little doubtful whether this was feasible , but we went out to reconnoitre .
Parsing [sent. 14198 len. 34]: Peeping in at the gate of the barrack-yard , we found everything very quiet at that time in the morning , and I asked a sergeant standing on the guardhouse-steps where he lived .
Parsing [sent. 14199 len. 29]: He sent a man before to show me , who went up some bare stairs , and knocked with his knuckles at a door , and left us .
Parsing [sent. 14200 len. 5]: `` Now then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14201 len. 5]: cried Richard from within .
Parsing [sent. 14202 len. 27]: So I left Charley in the little passage , and going on to the half-open door , said , `` Can I come in , Richard ?
Parsing [sent. 14203 len. 7]: It 's only Dame Durden . ''
Parsing [sent. 14204 len. 31]: He was writing at a table , with a great confusion of clothes , tin cases , books , boots , brushes , and portmanteaus strewn all about the floor .
Parsing [sent. 14205 len. 32]: He was only half dressed -- in plain clothes , I observed , not in uniform -- and his hair was unbrushed , and he looked as wild as his room .
Parsing [sent. 14206 len. 34]: All this I saw after he had heartily welcomed me and I was seated near him , for he started upon hearing my voice and caught me in his arms in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 14207 len. 3]: Dear Richard !
Parsing [sent. 14208 len. 8]: He was ever the same to me .
Parsing [sent. 14209 len. 9]: Down to -- ah , poor poor fellow !
Parsing [sent. 14210 len. 19]: -- to the end , he never received me but with something of his old merry boyish manner .
Parsing [sent. 14211 len. 20]: `` Good heaven , my dear little woman , '' said he , `` how do you come here ?
Parsing [sent. 14212 len. 8]: Who could have thought of seeing you !
Parsing [sent. 14213 len. 4]: Nothing the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 14214 len. 5]: Ada is well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14215 len. 4]: `` Quite well .
Parsing [sent. 14216 len. 7]: Lovelier than ever , Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14217 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14218 len. 9]: he said , lenning back in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 14219 len. 5]: `` My poor cousin !
Parsing [sent. 14220 len. 9]: I was writing to you , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 14221 len. 34]: So worn and haggard as he looked , even in the fullness of his handsome youth , leaning back in his chair and crushing the closely written sheet of paper in his hand !
Parsing [sent. 14222 len. 23]: `` Have you been at the trouble of writing all that , and am I not to read it after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14223 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 14224 len. 14]: `` Oh , my dear , '' he returned with a hopeless gesture .
Parsing [sent. 14225 len. 10]: `` You may read it in the whole room .
Parsing [sent. 14226 len. 7]: It is all over here . ''
Parsing [sent. 14227 len. 9]: I mildly entreated him not to be despondent .
Parsing [sent. 14228 len. 27]: I told him that I had heard by chance of his being in difficulty and had come to consult with him what could best be done .
Parsing [sent. 14229 len. 16]: `` Like you , Esther , but useless , and so NOT like you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14230 len. 7]: said he with a melancholy smile .
Parsing [sent. 14231 len. 30]: `` I am away on leave this day -- should have been gone in another hour -- and that is to smooth it over , for my selling out .
Parsing [sent. 14232 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 14233 len. 5]: Let bygones be bygones .
Parsing [sent. 14234 len. 7]: So this calling follows the rest .
Parsing [sent. 14235 len. 20]: I only want to have been in the church to have made the round of all the professions . ''
Parsing [sent. 14236 len. 17]: `` Richard , '' I urged , `` it is not so hopeless as that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14237 len. 12]: `` Esther , '' he returned , `` it is indeed .
Parsing [sent. 14238 len. 32]: I am just so near disgrace as that those who are put in authority over me -LRB- as the catechism goes -RRB- would far rather be without me than with me .
Parsing [sent. 14239 len. 5]: And they are right .
Parsing [sent. 14240 len. 19]: Apart from debts and duns and all such drawbacks , I am not fit even for this employment .
Parsing [sent. 14241 len. 19]: I have no care , no mind , no heart , no soul , but for one thing .
Parsing [sent. 14242 len. 39]: Why , if this bubble had n't broken now , '' he said , tearing the letter he had written into fragments and moodily casting them away , by driblets , `` how could I have gone abroad ?
Parsing [sent. 14243 len. 14]: I must have been ordered abroad , but how could I have gone ?
Parsing [sent. 14244 len. 22]: How could I , with my experience of that thing , trust even Vholes unless I was at his back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14245 len. 39]: I suppose he knew by my face what I was about to say , but he caught the hand I had laid upon his arm and touched my own lips with it to prevent me from going on .
Parsing [sent. 14246 len. 6]: `` No , Dame Durden !
Parsing [sent. 14247 len. 8]: Two subjects I forbid -- must forbid .
Parsing [sent. 14248 len. 6]: The first is John Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 14249 len. 7]: The second , you know what .
Parsing [sent. 14250 len. 21]: Call it madness , and I tell you I ca n't help it now , and ca n't be sane .
Parsing [sent. 14251 len. 17]: But it is no such thing ; it is the one object I have to pursue .
Parsing [sent. 14252 len. 19]: It is a pity I ever was prevailed upon to turn out of my road for any other .
Parsing [sent. 14253 len. 24]: It would be wisdom to abandon it now , after all the time , anxiety , and pains I have bestowed upon it !
Parsing [sent. 14254 len. 7]: Oh , yes , true wisdom .
Parsing [sent. 14255 len. 18]: It would be very agreeable , too , to some people ; but I never will . ''
Parsing [sent. 14256 len. 27]: He was in that mood in which I thought it best not to increase his determination -LRB- if anything could increase it -RRB- by opposing him .
Parsing [sent. 14257 len. 13]: I took out Ada 's letter and put it in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 14258 len. 9]: `` Am I to read it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14259 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 14260 len. 23]: As I told him yes , he laid it on the table , and resting his head upon his hand , began .
Parsing [sent. 14261 len. 22]: He had not read far when he rested his head upon his two hands -- to hide his face from me .
Parsing [sent. 14262 len. 18]: In a little while he rose as if the light were bad and went to the window .
Parsing [sent. 14263 len. 35]: He finished reading it there , with his back towards me , and after he had finished and had folded it up , stood there for some minutes with the letter in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 14264 len. 15]: When he came back to his chair , I saw tears in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14265 len. 14]: `` Of course , Esther , you know what she says here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14266 len. 15]: He spoke in a softened voice and kissed the letter as he asked me .
Parsing [sent. 14267 len. 6]: `` Yes , Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 14268 len. 60]: `` Offers me , '' he went on , tapping his foot upon the floor , `` the little inheritance she is certain of so soon -- just as little and as much as I have wasted -- and begs and prays me to take it , set myself right with it , and remain in the service . ''
Parsing [sent. 14269 len. 34]: `` I know your welfare to be the dearest wish of her heart , '' said I. `` And , oh , my dear Richard , Ada 's is a noble heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 14270 len. 7]: `` I am sure it is .
Parsing [sent. 14271 len. 9]: I -- I wish I was dead ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14272 len. 22]: He went back to the window , and laying his arm across it , leaned his head down on his arm .
Parsing [sent. 14273 len. 23]: It greatly affected me to see him so , but I hoped he might become more yielding , and I remained silent .
Parsing [sent. 14274 len. 27]: My experience was very limited ; I was not at all prepared for his rousing himself out of this emotion to a new sense of injury .
Parsing [sent. 14275 len. 34]: `` And this is the heart that the same John Jarndyce , who is not otherwise to be mentioned between us , stepped in to estrange from me , '' said he indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 14276 len. 45]: `` And the dear girl makes me this generous offer from under the same John Jarndyce 's roof , and with the same John Jarndyce 's gracious consent and connivance , I dare say , as a new means of buying me off . ''
Parsing [sent. 14277 len. 4]: `` Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14278 len. 7]: I cried out , rising hastily .
Parsing [sent. 14279 len. 12]: `` I will not hear you say such shameful words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14280 len. 23]: I was very angry with him indeed , for the first time in my life , but it only lasted a moment .
Parsing [sent. 14281 len. 45]: When I saw his worn young face looking at me as if he were sorry , I put my hand on his shoulder and said , `` If you please , my dear Richard , do not speak in such a tone to me .
Parsing [sent. 14282 len. 3]: Consider ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14283 len. 28]: He blamed himself exceedingly and told me in the most generous manner that he had been very wrong and that he begged my pardon a thousand times .
Parsing [sent. 14284 len. 21]: At that I laughed , but trembled a little too , for I was rather fluttered after being so fiery .
Parsing [sent. 14285 len. 55]: `` To accept this offer , my dear Esther , '' said he , sitting down beside me and resuming our conversation , '' -- once more , pray , pray forgive me ; I am deeply grieved -- to accept my dearest cousin 's offer is , I need not say , impossible .
Parsing [sent. 14286 len. 22]: Besides , I have letters and papers that I could show you which would convince you it is all over here .
Parsing [sent. 14287 len. 11]: I have done with the red coat , believe me .
Parsing [sent. 14288 len. 29]: But it is some satisfaction , in the midst of my troubles and perplexities , to know that I am pressing Ada 's interests in pressing my own .
Parsing [sent. 14289 len. 28]: Vholes has his shoulder to the wheel , and he can not help urging it on as much for her as for me , thank God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14290 len. 28]: His sanguine hopes were rising within him and lighting up his features , but they made his face more sad to me than it had been before .
Parsing [sent. 14291 len. 6]: `` No , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14292 len. 4]: cried Richard exultingly .
Parsing [sent. 14293 len. 41]: `` If every farthing of Ada 's little fortune were mine , no part of it should be spent in retaining me in what I am not fit for , can take no interest in , and am weary of .
Parsing [sent. 14294 len. 22]: It should be devoted to what promises a better return , and should be used where she has a larger stake .
Parsing [sent. 14295 len. 7]: Do n't be uneasy for me !
Parsing [sent. 14296 len. 19]: I shall now have only one thing on my mind , and Vholes and I will work it .
Parsing [sent. 14297 len. 7]: I shall not be without means .
Parsing [sent. 14298 len. 29]: Free of my commission , I shall be able to compound with some small usurers who will hear of nothing but their bond now -- Vholes says so .
Parsing [sent. 14299 len. 16]: I should have a balance in my favour anyway , but that would swell it .
Parsing [sent. 14300 len. 4]: Come , come !
Parsing [sent. 14301 len. 39]: You shall carry a letter to Ada from me , Esther , and you must both of you be more hopeful of me and not believe that I am quite cast away just yet , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 14302 len. 10]: I will not repeat what I said to Richard .
Parsing [sent. 14303 len. 21]: I know it was tiresome , and nobody is to suppose for a moment that it was at all wise .
Parsing [sent. 14304 len. 7]: It only came from my heart .
Parsing [sent. 14305 len. 30]: He heard it patiently and feelingly , but I saw that on the two subjects he had reserved it was at present hopeless to make any representation to him .
Parsing [sent. 14306 len. 38]: I saw too , and had experienced in this very interview , the sense of my guardian 's remark that it was even more mischievous to use persuasion with him than to leave him as he was .
Parsing [sent. 14307 len. 37]: Therefore I was driven at last to asking Richard if he would mind convincing me that it really was all over there , as he had said , and that it was not his mere impression .
Parsing [sent. 14308 len. 17]: He showed me without hesitation a correspondence making it quite plain that his retirement was arranged .
Parsing [sent. 14309 len. 26]: I found , from what he told me , that Mr. Vholes had copies of these papers and had been in consultation with him throughout .
Parsing [sent. 14310 len. 40]: Beyond ascertaining this , and having been the bearer of Ada 's letter , and being -LRB- as I was going to be -RRB- Richard 's companion back to London , I had done no good by coming down .
Parsing [sent. 14311 len. 50]: Admitting this to myself with a reluctant heart , I said I would return to the hotel and wait until he joined me there , so he threw a cloak over his shoulders and saw me to the gate , and Charley and I went back along the beach .
Parsing [sent. 14312 len. 29]: There was a concourse of people in one spot , surrounding some naval officers who were landing from a boat , and pressing about them with unusual interest .
Parsing [sent. 14313 len. 22]: I said to Charley this would be one of the great Indiaman 's boats now , and we stopped to look .
Parsing [sent. 14314 len. 34]: The gentlemen came slowly up from the waterside , speaking good-humouredly to each other and to the people around and glancing about them as if they were glad to be in England again .
Parsing [sent. 14315 len. 14]: `` Charley , Charley , '' said I , `` come away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14316 len. 13]: And I hurried on so swiftly that my little maid was surprised .
Parsing [sent. 14317 len. 31]: It was not until we were shut up in our cabin-room and I had had time to take breath that I began to think why I had made such haste .
Parsing [sent. 14318 len. 23]: In one of the sunburnt faces I had recognized Mr. Allan Woodcourt , and I had been afraid of his recognizing me .
Parsing [sent. 14319 len. 12]: I had been unwilling that he should see my altered looks .
Parsing [sent. 14320 len. 15]: I had been taken by surprise , and my courage had quite failed me .
Parsing [sent. 14321 len. 49]: But I knew this would not do , and I now said to myself , `` My dear , there is no reason -- there is and there can be no reason at all -- why it should be worse for you now than it ever has been .
Parsing [sent. 14322 len. 20]: What you were last month , you are to-day ; you are no worse , you are no better .
Parsing [sent. 14323 len. 17]: This is not your resolution ; call it up , Esther , call it up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14324 len. 34]: I was in a great tremble -- with running -- and at first was quite unable to calm myself ; but I got better , and I was very glad to know it .
Parsing [sent. 14325 len. 7]: The party came to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 14326 len. 8]: I heard them speaking on the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 14327 len. 23]: I was sure it was the same gentlemen because I knew their voices again -- I mean I knew Mr. Woodcourt 's .
Parsing [sent. 14328 len. 28]: It would still have been a great relief to me to have gone away without making myself known , but I was determined not to do so .
Parsing [sent. 14329 len. 8]: `` No , my dear , no .
Parsing [sent. 14330 len. 7]: No , no , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14331 len. 51]: I untied my bonnet and put my veil half up -- I think I mean half down , but it matters very little -- and wrote on one of my cards that I happened to be there with Mr. Richard Carstone , and I sent it in to Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 14332 len. 4]: He came immediately .
Parsing [sent. 14333 len. 20]: I told him I was rejoiced to be by chance among the first to welcome him home to England .
Parsing [sent. 14334 len. 11]: And I saw that he was very sorry for me .
Parsing [sent. 14335 len. 40]: `` You have been in shipwreck and peril since you left us , Mr. Woodcourt , '' said I , `` but we can hardly call that a misfortune which enabled you to be so useful and so brave .
Parsing [sent. 14336 len. 9]: We read of it with the truest interest .
Parsing [sent. 14337 len. 25]: It first came to my knowledge through your old patient , poor Miss Flite , when I was recovering from my severe illness . ''
Parsing [sent. 14338 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14339 len. 5]: Little Miss Flite ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14340 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 14341 len. 9]: `` She lives the same life yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14342 len. 6]: `` Just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 14343 len. 22]: I was so comfortable with myself now as not to mind the veil and to be able to put it aside .
Parsing [sent. 14344 len. 12]: `` Her gratitude to you , Mr. Woodcourt , is delightful .
Parsing [sent. 14345 len. 15]: She is a most affectionate creature , as I have reason to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 14346 len. 10]: `` You -- you have found her so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14347 len. 3]: he returned .
Parsing [sent. 14348 len. 10]: `` I -- I am glad of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 14349 len. 13]: He was so very sorry for me that he could scarcely speak .
Parsing [sent. 14350 len. 29]: `` I assure you , '' said I , `` that I was deeply touched by her sympathy and pleasure at the time I have referred to . ''
Parsing [sent. 14351 len. 14]: `` I was grieved to hear that you had been very ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 14352 len. 7]: `` I was very ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 14353 len. 8]: `` But you have quite recovered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14354 len. 47]: `` I have quite recovered my health and my cheerfulness , '' said I. `` You know how good my guardian is and what a happy life we lead , and I have everything to be thankful for and nothing in the world to desire . ''
Parsing [sent. 14355 len. 18]: I felt as if he had greater commiseration for me than I had ever had for myself .
Parsing [sent. 14356 len. 24]: It inspired me with new fortitude and new calmness to find that it was I who was under the necessity of reassuring him .
Parsing [sent. 14357 len. 25]: I spoke to him of his voyage out and home , and of his future plans , and of his probable return to India .
Parsing [sent. 14358 len. 7]: He said that was very doubtful .
Parsing [sent. 14359 len. 13]: He had not found himself more favoured by fortune there than here .
Parsing [sent. 14360 len. 16]: He had gone out a poor ship 's surgeon and had come home nothing better .
Parsing [sent. 14361 len. 38]: While we were talking , and when I was glad to believe that I had alleviated -LRB- if I may use such a term -RRB- the shock he had had in seeing me , Richard came in .
Parsing [sent. 14362 len. 16]: He had heard downstairs who was with me , and they met with cordial pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 14363 len. 33]: I saw that after their first greetings were over , and when they spoke of Richard 's career , Mr. Woodcourt had a perception that all was not going well with him .
Parsing [sent. 14364 len. 40]: He frequently glanced at his face as if there were something in it that gave him pain , and more than once he looked towards me as though he sought to ascertain whether I knew what the truth was .
Parsing [sent. 14365 len. 29]: Yet Richard was in one of his sanguine states and in good spirits and was thoroughly pleased to see Mr. Woodcourt again , whom he had always liked .
Parsing [sent. 14366 len. 30]: Richard proposed that we all should go to London together ; but Mr. Woodcourt , having to remain by his ship a little longer , could not join us .
Parsing [sent. 14367 len. 41]: He dined with us , however , at an early hour , and became so much more like what he used to be that I was still more at peace to think I had been able to soften his regrets .
Parsing [sent. 14368 len. 9]: Yet his mind was not relieved of Richard .
Parsing [sent. 14369 len. 23]: When the coach was almost ready and Richard ran down to look after his luggage , he spoke to me about him .
Parsing [sent. 14370 len. 40]: I was not sure that I had a right to lay his whole story open , but I referred in a few words to his estrangement from Mr Jarndyce and to his being entangled in the ill-fated Chancery suit .
Parsing [sent. 14371 len. 10]: Mr. Woodcourt listened with interest and expressed his regret .
Parsing [sent. 14372 len. 22]: `` I saw you observe him rather closely , '' said I , `` Do you think him so changed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14373 len. 13]: `` He is changed , '' he returned , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 14374 len. 21]: I felt the blood rush into my face for the first time , but it was only an instantaneous emotion .
Parsing [sent. 14375 len. 11]: I turned my head aside , and it was gone .
Parsing [sent. 14376 len. 40]: `` It is not , '' said Mr. Woodcourt , `` his being so much younger or older , or thinner or fatter , or paler or ruddier , as there being upon his face such a singular expression .
Parsing [sent. 14377 len. 12]: I never saw so remarkable a look in a young person .
Parsing [sent. 14378 len. 24]: One can not say that it is all anxiety or all weariness ; yet it is both , and like ungrown despair . ''
Parsing [sent. 14379 len. 10]: `` You do not think he is ill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14380 len. 4]: said I. No .
Parsing [sent. 14381 len. 6]: He looked robust in body .
Parsing [sent. 14382 len. 23]: `` That he can not be at peace in mind , we have too much reason to know , '' I proceeded .
Parsing [sent. 14383 len. 11]: `` Mr. Woodcourt , you are going to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14384 len. 8]: `` To-morrow or the next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 14385 len. 12]: `` There is nothing Richard wants so much as a friend .
Parsing [sent. 14386 len. 5]: He always liked you .
Parsing [sent. 14387 len. 8]: Pray see him when you get there .
Parsing [sent. 14388 len. 11]: Pray help him sometimes with your companionship if you can .
Parsing [sent. 14389 len. 11]: You do not know of what service it might be .
Parsing [sent. 14390 len. 26]: You can not think how Ada , and Mr. Jarndyce , and even I -- how we should all thank you , Mr. Woodcourt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14391 len. 31]: `` Miss Summerson , '' he said , more moved than he had been from the first , `` before heaven , I will be a true friend to him !
Parsing [sent. 14392 len. 17]: I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14393 len. 6]: `` God bless you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14394 len. 22]: said I , with my eyes filling fast ; but I thought they might , when it was not for myself .
Parsing [sent. 14395 len. 19]: `` Ada loves him -- we all love him , but Ada loves him as we can not .
Parsing [sent. 14396 len. 8]: I will tell her what you say .
Parsing [sent. 14397 len. 13]: Thank you , and God bless you , in her name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14398 len. 22]: Richard came back as we finished exchanging these hurried words and gave me his arm to take me to the coach .
Parsing [sent. 14399 len. 21]: `` Woodcourt , '' he said , unconscious with what application , `` pray let us meet in London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14400 len. 4]: `` Meet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14401 len. 4]: returned the other .
Parsing [sent. 14402 len. 11]: `` I have scarcely a friend there now but you .
Parsing [sent. 14403 len. 7]: Where shall I find you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14404 len. 18]: `` Why , I must get a lodging of some sort , '' said Richard , pondering .
Parsing [sent. 14405 len. 11]: `` Say at Vholes 's , Symond 's Inn . ''
Parsing [sent. 14406 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 14407 len. 6]: Without loss of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 14408 len. 5]: They shook hands heartily .
Parsing [sent. 14409 len. 31]: When I was seated in the coach and Richard was yet standing in the street , Mr. Woodcourt laid his friendly hand on Richard 's shoulder and looked at me .
Parsing [sent. 14410 len. 9]: I understood him and waved mine in thanks .
Parsing [sent. 14411 len. 20]: And in his last look as we drove away , I saw that he was very sorry for me .
Parsing [sent. 14412 len. 7]: I was glad to see it .
Parsing [sent. 14413 len. 18]: I felt for my old self as the dead may feel if they ever revisit these scenes .
Parsing [sent. 14414 len. 19]: I was glad to be tenderly remembered , to be gently pitied , not to be quite forgotten .
Parsing [sent. 14415 len. 6]: Chapter XLVI -- Stop Him !
Parsing [sent. 14416 len. 10]: Darkness rests upon Tom -- All -- Alone 's .
Parsing [sent. 14417 len. 24]: Dilating and dilating since the sun went down last night , it has gradually swelled until it fills every void in the place .
Parsing [sent. 14418 len. 52]: For a time there were some dungeon lights burning , as the lamp of life hums in Tom-all -- Alone 's , heavily , heavily , in the nauseous air , and winking -- as that lamp , too , winks in Tom-all -- Alone 's -- at many horrible things .
Parsing [sent. 14419 len. 6]: But they are blotted out .
Parsing [sent. 14420 len. 40]: The moon has eyed Tom with a dull cold stare , as admitting some puny emulation of herself in his desert region unfit for life and blasted by volcanic fires ; but she has passed on and is gone .
Parsing [sent. 14421 len. 20]: The blackest nightmare in the infernal stables grazes on Tom-all -- Alone 's , and Tom is fast asleep .
Parsing [sent. 14422 len. 28]: Much mighty speech-making there has been , both in and out of Parliament , concerning Tom , and much wrathful disputation how Tom shall be got right .
Parsing [sent. 14423 len. 76]: Whether he shall be put into the main road by constables , or by beadles , or by bell-ringing , or by force of figures , or by correct principles of taste , or by high church , or by low church , or by no church ; whether he shall be set to splitting trusses of polemical straws with the crooked knife of his mind or whether he shall be put to stone-breaking instead .
Parsing [sent. 14424 len. 43]: In the midst of which dust and noise there is but one thing perfectly clear , to wit , that Tom only may and can , or shall and will , be reclaimed according to somebody 's theory but nobody 's practice .
Parsing [sent. 14425 len. 18]: And in the hopeful meantime , Tom goes to perdition head foremost in his old determined spirit .
Parsing [sent. 14426 len. 6]: But he has his revenge .
Parsing [sent. 14427 len. 17]: Even the winds are his messengers , and they serve him in these hours of darkness .
Parsing [sent. 14428 len. 17]: There is not a drop of Tom 's corrupted blood but propagates infection and contagion somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 14429 len. 43]: It shall pollute , this very night , the choice stream -LRB- in which chemists on analysis would find the genuine nobility -RRB- of a Norman house , and his Grace shall not be able to say nay to the infamous alliance .
Parsing [sent. 14430 len. 71]: There is not an atom of Tom 's slime , not a cubic inch of any pestilential gas in which he lives , not one obscenity or degradation about him , not an ignorance , not a wickedness , not a brutality of his committing , but shall work its retribution through every order of society up to the proudest of the proud and to the highest of the high .
Parsing [sent. 14431 len. 16]: Verily , what with tainting , plundering , and spoiling , Tom has his revenge .
Parsing [sent. 14432 len. 64]: It is a moot point whether Tom-all -- Alone 's be uglier by day or by night , but on the argument that the more that is seen of it the more shocking it must be , and that no part of it left to the imagination is at all likely to be made so bad as the reality , day carries it .
Parsing [sent. 14433 len. 43]: The day begins to break now ; and in truth it might be better for the national glory even that the sun should sometimes set upon the British dominions than that it should ever rise upon so vile a wonder as Tom .
Parsing [sent. 14434 len. 33]: A brown sunburnt gentleman , who appears in some inaptitude for sleep to be wandering abroad rather than counting the hours on a restless pillow , strolls hitherward at this quiet time .
Parsing [sent. 14435 len. 19]: Attracted by curiosity , he often pauses and looks about him , up and down the miserable by-ways .
Parsing [sent. 14436 len. 38]: Nor is he merely curious , for in his bright dark eye there is compassionate interest ; and as he looks here and there , he seems to understand such wretchedness and to have studied it before .
Parsing [sent. 14437 len. 35]: On the banks of the stagnant channel of mud which is the main street of Tom-all -- Alone 's , nothing is to be seen but the crazy houses , shut up and silent .
Parsing [sent. 14438 len. 25]: No waking creature save himself appears except in one direction , where he sees the solitary figure of a woman sitting on a door-step .
Parsing [sent. 14439 len. 5]: He walks that way .
Parsing [sent. 14440 len. 17]: Approaching , he observes that she has journeyed a long distance and is footsore and travel-stained .
Parsing [sent. 14441 len. 27]: She sits on the door-step in the manner of one who is waiting , with her elbow on her knee and her head upon her hand .
Parsing [sent. 14442 len. 14]: Beside her is a canvas bag , or bundle , she has carried .
Parsing [sent. 14443 len. 19]: She is dozing probably , for she gives no heed to his steps as he comes toward her .
Parsing [sent. 14444 len. 28]: The broken footway is so narrow that when Allan Woodcourt comes to where the woman sits , he has to turn into the road to pass her .
Parsing [sent. 14445 len. 15]: Looking down at her face , his eye meets hers , and he stops .
Parsing [sent. 14446 len. 7]: `` What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14447 len. 6]: `` Nothing , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14448 len. 8]: `` Ca n't you make them hear ?
Parsing [sent. 14449 len. 9]: Do you want to be let in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14450 len. 24]: `` I 'm walting till they get up at another house -- a lodging-house -- not here , '' the woman patiently returns .
Parsing [sent. 14451 len. 17]: `` I 'm waiting here because there will be sun here presently to warm me . ''
Parsing [sent. 14452 len. 8]: `` I am afraid you are tired .
Parsing [sent. 14453 len. 12]: I am sorry to see you sitting in the street . ''
Parsing [sent. 14454 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14455 len. 6]: It do n't matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 14456 len. 51]: A habit in him of speaking to the poor and of avoiding patronage or condescension or childishness -LRB- which is the favourite device , many people deeming it quite a subtlety to talk to them like little spelling books -RRB- has put him on good terms with the woman easily .
Parsing [sent. 14457 len. 15]: `` Let me look at your forehead , '' he says , bending down .
Parsing [sent. 14458 len. 6]: `` I am a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 14459 len. 5]: Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 14460 len. 10]: I would n't hurt you for the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 14461 len. 20]: He knows that by touching her with his skilful and accustomed hand he can soothe her yet more readily .
Parsing [sent. 14462 len. 34]: She makes a slight objection , saying , `` It 's nothing '' ; but he has scarcely laid his fingers on the wounded place when she lifts it up to the light .
Parsing [sent. 14463 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 14464 len. 10]: A bad bruise , and the skin sadly broken .
Parsing [sent. 14465 len. 7]: This must be very sore . ''
Parsing [sent. 14466 len. 21]: `` It do ache a little , sir , '' returns the woman with a started tear upon her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 14467 len. 10]: `` Let me try to make it more comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 14468 len. 8]: My handkerchief wo n't hurt you . ''
Parsing [sent. 14469 len. 15]: `` Oh , dear no , sir , I 'm sure of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14470 len. 41]: He cleanses the injured place and dries it , and having carefully examined it and gently pressed it with the palm of his hand , takes a small case from his pocket , dresses it , and binds it up .
Parsing [sent. 14471 len. 30]: While he is thus employed , he says , after laughing at his establishing a surgery in the street , `` And so your husband is a brickmaker ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14472 len. 10]: `` How do you know that , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14473 len. 6]: asks the woman , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 14474 len. 20]: `` Why , I suppose so from the colour of the clay upon your bag and on your dress .
Parsing [sent. 14475 len. 13]: And I know brickmakers go about working at piecework in different places .
Parsing [sent. 14476 len. 17]: And I am sorry to say I have known them cruel to their wives too . ''
Parsing [sent. 14477 len. 22]: The woman hastily lifts up her eyes as if she would deny that her injury is referable to such a cause .
Parsing [sent. 14478 len. 22]: But feeling the hand upon her forehead , and seeing his busy and composed face , she quietly drops them again .
Parsing [sent. 14479 len. 7]: `` Where is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14480 len. 4]: asks the surgeon .
Parsing [sent. 14481 len. 21]: `` He got into trouble last night , sir ; but he 'll look for me at the lodging-house . ''
Parsing [sent. 14482 len. 23]: `` He will get into worse trouble if he often misuses his large and heavy hand as he has misused it here .
Parsing [sent. 14483 len. 26]: But you forgive him , brutal as he is , and I say no more of him , except that I wish he deserved it .
Parsing [sent. 14484 len. 7]: You have no young child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14485 len. 6]: The woman shakes her head .
Parsing [sent. 14486 len. 16]: `` One as I calls mine , sir , but it 's Liz 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 14487 len. 6]: `` Your own is dead .
Parsing [sent. 14488 len. 3]: I see !
Parsing [sent. 14489 len. 5]: Poor little thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14490 len. 13]: By this time he has finished and is putting up his case .
Parsing [sent. 14491 len. 9]: `` I suppose you have some settled home .
Parsing [sent. 14492 len. 7]: Is it far from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14493 len. 18]: he asks , good-humouredly making light of what he has done as she gets up and curtsys .
Parsing [sent. 14494 len. 16]: `` It 's a good two or three and twenty mile from here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14495 len. 4]: At Saint Albans .
Parsing [sent. 14496 len. 7]: You know Saint Albans , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 14497 len. 14]: I thought you gave a start like , as if you did . ''
Parsing [sent. 14498 len. 9]: `` Yes , I know something of it .
Parsing [sent. 14499 len. 11]: And now I will ask you a question in return .
Parsing [sent. 14500 len. 8]: Have you money for your lodging ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14501 len. 15]: `` Yes , sir , '' she says , `` really and truly . ''
Parsing [sent. 14502 len. 5]: And she shows it .
Parsing [sent. 14503 len. 27]: He tells her , in acknowledgment of her many subdued thanks , that she is very welcome , gives her good day , and walks away .
Parsing [sent. 14504 len. 13]: Tom-all -- Alone 's is still asleep , and nothing is astir .
Parsing [sent. 14505 len. 5]: Yes , something is !
Parsing [sent. 14506 len. 56]: As he retraces his way to the point from which he descried the woman at a distance sitting on the step , he sees a ragged figure coming very cautiously along , crouching close to the soiled walls -- which the wretchedest figure might as well avoid -- and furtively thrusting a hand before it .
Parsing [sent. 14507 len. 19]: It is the figure of a youth whose face is hollow and whose eyes have an emaciated glare .
Parsing [sent. 14508 len. 26]: He is so intent on getting along unseen that even the apparition of a stranger in whole garments does not tempt him to look back .
Parsing [sent. 14509 len. 39]: He shades his face with his ragged elbow as he passes on the other side of the way , and goes shrinking and creeping on with his anxious hand before him and his shapeless clothes hanging in shreds .
Parsing [sent. 14510 len. 18]: Clothes made for what purpose , or of what material , it would be impossible to say .
Parsing [sent. 14511 len. 23]: They look , in colour and in substance , like a bundle of rank leaves of swampy growth that rotted long ago .
Parsing [sent. 14512 len. 24]: Allan Woodcourt pauses to look after him and note all this , with a shadowy belief that he has seen the boy before .
Parsing [sent. 14513 len. 21]: He can not recall how or where , but there is some association in his mind with such a form .
Parsing [sent. 14514 len. 31]: He imagines that he must have seen it in some hospital or refuge , still , can not make out why it comes with any special force on his remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 14515 len. 45]: He is gradually emerging from Tom-all -- Alone 's in the morning light , thinking about it , when he hears running feet behind him , and looking round , sees the boy scouring towards him at great speed , followed by the woman .
Parsing [sent. 14516 len. 8]: `` Stop him , stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14517 len. 8]: cries the woman , almost breath less .
Parsing [sent. 14518 len. 7]: `` Stop him , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14519 len. 42]: He darts across the road into the boy 's path , but the boy is quicker than he , makes a curve , ducks , dives under his hands , comes up half-a-dozen yards beyond him , and scours away again .
Parsing [sent. 14520 len. 18]: Still the woman follows , crying , `` Stop him , sir , pray stop him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14521 len. 51]: Allan , not knowing but that he has just robbed her of her money , follows in chase and runs so hard that he runs the boy down a dozen times , but each time he repeats the curve , the duck , the dive , and scours away again .
Parsing [sent. 14522 len. 35]: To strike at him on any of these occasions would be to fell and disable him , but the pursuer can not resolve to do that , and so the grimly ridiculous pursuit continues .
Parsing [sent. 14523 len. 20]: At last the fugitive , hard-pressed , takes to a narrow passage and a court which has no thoroughfare .
Parsing [sent. 14524 len. 36]: Here , against a hoarding of decaying timber , he is brought to bay and tumbles down , lying gasping at his pursuer , who stands and gasps at him until the woman comes up .
Parsing [sent. 14525 len. 8]: `` Oh , you , Jo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14526 len. 4]: cries the woman .
Parsing [sent. 14527 len. 3]: `` What ?
Parsing [sent. 14528 len. 8]: I have found you at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14529 len. 16]: `` Jo , '' repeats Allan , looking at him with attention , `` Jo !
Parsing [sent. 14530 len. 2]: Stay .
Parsing [sent. 14531 len. 4]: To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 14532 len. 14]: I recollect this lad some time ago being brought before the coroner . ''
Parsing [sent. 14533 len. 16]: `` Yes , I see you once afore at the inkwhich , '' whimpers Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14534 len. 5]: `` What of that ?
Parsing [sent. 14535 len. 12]: Ca n't you never let such an unfortnet as me alone ?
Parsing [sent. 14536 len. 9]: A n't I unfortnet enough for you yet ?
Parsing [sent. 14537 len. 10]: How unfortnet do you want me fur to be ?
Parsing [sent. 14538 len. 28]: I 've been a-chivied and a-chivied , fust by one on you and nixt by another on you , till I 'm worritted to skins and bones .
Parsing [sent. 14539 len. 7]: The inkwhich war n't MY fault .
Parsing [sent. 14540 len. 4]: I done nothink .
Parsing [sent. 14541 len. 28]: He wos wery good to me , he wos ; he wos the only one I knowed to speak to , as ever come across my crossing .
Parsing [sent. 14542 len. 13]: It ai n't wery likely I should want him to be inkwhiched .
Parsing [sent. 14543 len. 8]: I only wish I wos , myself .
Parsing [sent. 14544 len. 25]: I do n't know why I do n't go and make a hole in the water , I 'm sure I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 14545 len. 52]: He says it with such a pitiable air , and his grimy tears appear so real , and he lies in the corner up against the hoarding so like a growth of fungus or any unwholesome excrescence produced there in neglect and impurity , that Allan Woodcourt is softened towards him .
Parsing [sent. 14546 len. 16]: He says to the woman , `` Miserable creature , what has he done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14547 len. 27]: To which she only replies , shaking her head at the prostrate figure more amazedly than angrily , `` Oh , you Jo , you Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14548 len. 8]: I have found you at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14549 len. 7]: `` What has he done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14550 len. 3]: says Allan .
Parsing [sent. 14551 len. 7]: `` Has he robbed you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14552 len. 7]: `` No , sir , no .
Parsing [sent. 14553 len. 3]: Robbed me ?
Parsing [sent. 14554 len. 19]: He did nothing but what was kind-hearted by me , and that 's the wonder of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 14555 len. 25]: Allan looks from Jo to the woman , and from the woman to Jo , waiting for one of them to unravel the riddle .
Parsing [sent. 14556 len. 15]: `` But he was along with me , sir , '' says the woman .
Parsing [sent. 14557 len. 6]: `` Oh , you Jo !
Parsing [sent. 14558 len. 55]: He was along with me , sir , down at Saint Albans , ill , and a young lady , Lord bless her for a good friend to me , took pity on him when I durst n't , and took him home -- '' Allan shrinks back from him with a sudden horror .
Parsing [sent. 14559 len. 7]: `` Yes , sir , yes .
Parsing [sent. 14560 len. 38]: Took him home , and made him comfortable , and like a thankless monster he ran away in the night and never has been seen or heard of since till I set eyes on him just now .
Parsing [sent. 14561 len. 50]: And that young lady that was such a pretty dear caught his illness , lost her beautiful looks , and would n't hardly be known for the same young lady now if it was n't for her angel temper , and her pretty shape , and her sweet voice .
Parsing [sent. 14562 len. 5]: Do you know it ?
Parsing [sent. 14563 len. 22]: You ungrateful wretch , do you know that this is all along of you and of her goodness to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14564 len. 19]: demands the woman , beginning to rage at him as she recalls it and breaking into passionate tears .
Parsing [sent. 14565 len. 47]: The boy , in rough sort stunned by what he hears , falls to smearing his dirty forehead with his dirty palm , and to staring at the ground , and to shaking from head to foot until the crazy hoarding against which he leans rattles .
Parsing [sent. 14566 len. 14]: Allan restrains the woman , merely by a quiet gesture , but effectually .
Parsing [sent. 14567 len. 9]: `` Richard told me -- '' He falters .
Parsing [sent. 14568 len. 24]: `` I mean , I have heard of this -- do n't mind me for a moment , I will speak presently . ''
Parsing [sent. 14569 len. 15]: He turns away and stands for a while looking out at the covered passage .
Parsing [sent. 14570 len. 35]: When he comes back , he has recovered his composure , except that he contends against an avoidance of the boy , which is so very remarkable that it absorbs the woman 's attention .
Parsing [sent. 14571 len. 7]: `` You hear what she says .
Parsing [sent. 14572 len. 8]: But get up , get up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14573 len. 51]: Jo , shaking and chattering , slowly rises and stands , after the manner of his tribe in a difficulty , sideways against the hoarding , resting one of his high shoulders against it and covertly rubbing his right hand over his left and his left foot over his right .
Parsing [sent. 14574 len. 14]: `` You hear what she says , and I know it 's true .
Parsing [sent. 14575 len. 8]: Have you been here ever since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14576 len. 19]: `` Wishermaydie if I seen Tom-all -- Alone 's till this blessed morning , '' replies Jo hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 14577 len. 9]: `` Why have you come here now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14578 len. 41]: Jo looks all round the confined court , looks at his questioner no higher than the knees , and finally answers , `` I do n't know how to do nothink , and I ca n't get nothink to do .
Parsing [sent. 14579 len. 47]: I 'm wery poor and ill , and I thought I 'd come back here when there war n't nobody about , and lay down and hide somewheres as I knows on till arter dark , and then go and beg a trifle of Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 14580 len. 27]: He wos allus willin fur to give me somethink he wos , though Mrs. Snagsby she was allus a-chivying on me -- like everybody everywheres . ''
Parsing [sent. 14581 len. 8]: `` Where have you come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14582 len. 31]: Jo looks all round the court again , looks at his questioner 's knees again , and concludes by laying his profile against the hoarding in a sort of resignation .
Parsing [sent. 14583 len. 14]: `` Did you hear me ask you where you have come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14584 len. 8]: `` Tramp then , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14585 len. 65]: `` Now tell me , '' proceeds Allan , making a strong effort to overcome his repugnance , going very near to him , and leaning over him with an expression of confidence , `` tell me how it came about that you left that house when the good young lady had been so unfortunate as to pity you and take you home . ''
Parsing [sent. 14586 len. 79]: Jo suddenly comes out of his resignation and excitedly declares , addressing the woman , that he never known about the young lady , that he never heern about it , that he never went fur to hurt her , that he would sooner have hurt his own self , that he 'd sooner have had his unfortnet ed chopped off than ever gone a-nigh her , and that she wos wery good to him , she wos .
Parsing [sent. 14587 len. 23]: Conducting himself throughout as if in his poor fashion he really meant it , and winding up with some very miserable sobs .
Parsing [sent. 14588 len. 10]: Allan Woodcourt sees that this is not a sham .
Parsing [sent. 14589 len. 7]: He constrains himself to touch him .
Parsing [sent. 14590 len. 5]: `` Come , Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14591 len. 4]: Tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 14592 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 14593 len. 14]: I dust n't , '' says Jo , relapsing into the profile state .
Parsing [sent. 14594 len. 10]: `` I dust n't , or I would . ''
Parsing [sent. 14595 len. 16]: `` But I must know , '' returns the other , `` all the same .
Parsing [sent. 14596 len. 5]: Come , Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 14597 len. 36]: After two or three such adjurations , Jo lifts up his head again , looks round the court again , and says in a low voice , `` Well , I 'll tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 14598 len. 5]: I was took away .
Parsing [sent. 14599 len. 3]: There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14600 len. 4]: `` Took away ?
Parsing [sent. 14601 len. 5]: In the night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14602 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14603 len. 46]: Very apprehensive of being overheard , Jo looks about him and even glances up some ten feet at the top of the hoarding and through the cracks in it lest the object of his distrust should be looking over or hidden on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 14604 len. 7]: `` Who took you away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14605 len. 11]: `` I dust n't name him , '' says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14606 len. 9]: `` I dust n't do it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14607 len. 15]: `` But I want , in the young lady 's name , to know .
Parsing [sent. 14608 len. 5]: You may trust me .
Parsing [sent. 14609 len. 7]: No one else shall hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 14610 len. 26]: `` Ah , but I do n't know , '' replies Jo , shaking his head fearfulty , `` as he DO N'T hear . ''
Parsing [sent. 14611 len. 11]: `` Why , he is not in this place . ''
Parsing [sent. 14612 len. 9]: `` Oh , ai n't he though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14613 len. 3]: says Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14614 len. 14]: `` He 's in all manner of places , all at wanst . ''
Parsing [sent. 14615 len. 23]: Allan looks at him in perplexity , but discovers some real meaning and good faith at the bottom of this bewildering reply .
Parsing [sent. 14616 len. 30]: He patiently awaits an explicit answer ; and Jo , more baffled by his patience than by anything else , at last desperately whispers a name in his ear .
Parsing [sent. 14617 len. 4]: `` Aye ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14618 len. 3]: says Allan .
Parsing [sent. 14619 len. 10]: `` Why , what had you been doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14620 len. 5]: `` Nothink , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14621 len. 20]: Never done nothink to get myself into no trouble , ` sept in not moving on and the inkwhich .
Parsing [sent. 14622 len. 7]: But I 'm a-moving on now .
Parsing [sent. 14623 len. 20]: I 'm a-moving on to the berryin ground -- that 's the move as I 'm up to . ''
Parsing [sent. 14624 len. 12]: `` No , no , we will try to prevent that .
Parsing [sent. 14625 len. 9]: But what did he do with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14626 len. 41]: `` Put me in a horsepittle , '' replied Jo , whispering , `` till I was discharged , then giv me a little money -- four half-bulls , wot you may call half-crowns -- and ses ` Hook it !
Parsing [sent. 14627 len. 9]: Nobody wants you here , ' he ses .
Parsing [sent. 14628 len. 5]: ` You hook it .
Parsing [sent. 14629 len. 9]: You go and tramp , ' he ses .
Parsing [sent. 14630 len. 9]: ` You move on , ' he ses .
Parsing [sent. 14631 len. 22]: ` Do n't let me ever see you nowheres within forty mile of London , or you 'll repent it . '
Parsing [sent. 14632 len. 35]: So I shall , if ever he doos see me , and he 'll see me if I 'm above ground , '' concludes Jo , nervously repeating all his former precautions and investigations .
Parsing [sent. 14633 len. 30]: Allan considers a little , then remarks , turning to the woman but keeping an encouraging eye on Jo , `` He is not so ungrateful as you supposed .
Parsing [sent. 14634 len. 16]: He had a reason for going away , though it was an insufficient one . ''
Parsing [sent. 14635 len. 8]: `` Thankee , sir , thankee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14636 len. 3]: exclaims Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14637 len. 4]: `` There now !
Parsing [sent. 14638 len. 8]: See how hard you wos upon me .
Parsing [sent. 14639 len. 18]: But ony you tell the young lady wot the genlmn ses , and it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 14640 len. 15]: For YOU wos wery good to me too , and I knows it . ''
Parsing [sent. 14641 len. 36]: `` Now , Jo , '' says Allan , keeping his eye upon him , `` come with me and I will find you a better place than this to lie down and hide in .
Parsing [sent. 14642 len. 35]: If I take one side of the way and you the other to avoid observation , you will not run away , I know very well , if you make me a promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 14643 len. 17]: `` I wo n't , not unless I wos to see HIM a-coming , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14644 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 14645 len. 5]: I take your word .
Parsing [sent. 14646 len. 22]: Half the town is getting up by this time , and the whole town will be broad awake in another hour .
Parsing [sent. 14647 len. 3]: Come along .
Parsing [sent. 14648 len. 9]: Good day again , my good woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 14649 len. 17]: `` Good day again , sir , and I thank you kindly many times again . ''
Parsing [sent. 14650 len. 19]: She has been sitting on her bag , deeply attentive , and now rises and takes it up .
Parsing [sent. 14651 len. 26]: Jo , repeating , `` Ony you tell the young lady as I never went fur to hurt her and wot the genlmn ses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14652 len. 45]: nods and shambles and shivers , and smears and blinks , and half laughs and half cries , a farewell to her , and takes his creeping way along after Allan Woodcourt , close to the houses on the opposite side of the street .
Parsing [sent. 14653 len. 26]: In this order , the two come up out of Tom-all -- Alone 's into the broad rays of the sunlight and the purer air .
Parsing [sent. 14654 len. 55]: Chapter XLVII -- Jo 's Will As Allan Woodcourt and Jo proceed along the streets where the high church spires and the distances are so near and clear in the morning light that the city itself seems renewed by rest , Allan revolves in his mind how and where he shall bestow his companion .
Parsing [sent. 14655 len. 39]: `` It surely is a strange fact , '' he considers , `` that in the heart of a civilized world this creature in human form should be more difficult to dispose of than an unowned dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 14656 len. 18]: But it is none the less a fact because of its strangeness , and the difficulty remains .
Parsing [sent. 14657 len. 17]: At first he looks behind him often to assure himself that Jo is still really following .
Parsing [sent. 14658 len. 47]: But look where he will , he still beholds him close to the opposite houses , making his way with his wary hand from brick to brick and from door to door , and often , as he creeps along , glancing over at him watchfully .
Parsing [sent. 14659 len. 31]: Soon satisfied that the last thing in his thoughts is to give him the slip , Allan goes on , considering with a less divided attention what he shall do .
Parsing [sent. 14660 len. 13]: A breakfast-stall at a street-corner suggests the first thing to be done .
Parsing [sent. 14661 len. 11]: He stops there , looks round , and beckons Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14662 len. 37]: Jo crosses and comes halting and shuffling up , slowly scooping the knuckles of his right hand round and round in the hollowed palm of his left , kneading dirt with a natural pestle and mortar .
Parsing [sent. 14663 len. 46]: What is a dainty repast to Jo is then set before him , and he begins to gulp the coffee and to gnaw the bread and butter , looking anxiously about him in all directions as he eats and drinks , like a scared animal .
Parsing [sent. 14664 len. 14]: But he is so sick and miserable that even hunger has abandoned him .
Parsing [sent. 14665 len. 32]: `` I thought I was amost a-starvin , sir , '' says Jo , soon putting down his food , `` but I do n't know nothink -- not even that .
Parsing [sent. 14666 len. 15]: I do n't care for eating wittles nor yet for drinking on 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 14667 len. 11]: And Jo stands shivering and looking at the breakfast wonderingly .
Parsing [sent. 14668 len. 13]: Allan Woodcourt lays his hand upon his pulse and on his chest .
Parsing [sent. 14669 len. 7]: `` Draw breath , Jo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14670 len. 16]: `` It draws , '' says Jo , `` as heavy as a cart . ''
Parsing [sent. 14671 len. 27]: He might add , `` And rattles like it , '' but he only mutters , `` I 'm a -- moving on , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14672 len. 9]: Allan looks about for an apothecary 's shop .
Parsing [sent. 14673 len. 15]: There is none at hand , but a tavern does as well or better .
Parsing [sent. 14674 len. 18]: He obtains a little measure of wine and gives the lad a portion of it very carefully .
Parsing [sent. 14675 len. 13]: He begins to revive almost as soon as it passes his lips .
Parsing [sent. 14676 len. 20]: `` We may repeat that dose , Jo , '' observes Allan after watching him with his attentive face .
Parsing [sent. 14677 len. 3]: `` So !
Parsing [sent. 14678 len. 16]: Now we will take five minutes ' rest , and then go on again . ''
Parsing [sent. 14679 len. 42]: Leaving the boy sitting on the bench of the breakfast-stall , with his back against an iron railing , Allan Woodcourt paces up and down in the early sunshine , casting an occasional look towards him without appearing to watch him .
Parsing [sent. 14680 len. 13]: It requires no discernment to perceive that he is warmed and refreshed .
Parsing [sent. 14681 len. 31]: If a face so shaded can brighten , his face brightens somewhat ; and by little and little he eats the slice of bread he had so hopelessly laid down .
Parsing [sent. 14682 len. 33]: Observant of these signs of improvement , Allan engages him in conversation and elicits to his no small wonder the adventure of the lady in the veil , with all its consequences .
Parsing [sent. 14683 len. 9]: Jo slowly munches as he slowly tells it .
Parsing [sent. 14684 len. 15]: When he has finished his story and his bread , they go on again .
Parsing [sent. 14685 len. 39]: Intending to refer his difficulty in finding a temporary place of refuge for the boy to his old patient , zealous little Miss Flite , Allan leads the way to the court where he and Jo first foregathered .
Parsing [sent. 14686 len. 58]: But all is changed at the rag and bottle shop ; Miss Flite no longer lodges there ; it is shut up ; and a hard-featured female , much obscured by dust , whose age is a problem , but who is indeed no other than the interesting Judy , is tart and spare in her replies .
Parsing [sent. 14687 len. 70]: These sufficing , however , to inform the visitor that Miss Flite and her birds are domiciled with a Mrs. Blinder , in Bell Yard , he repairs to that neighbouring place , where Miss Flite -LRB- who rises early that she may be punctual at the divan of justice held by her excellent friend the Chancellor -RRB- comes running downstairs with tears of welcome and with open arms .
Parsing [sent. 14688 len. 6]: `` My dear physician ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14689 len. 4]: cries Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 14690 len. 10]: `` My meritorious , distinguished , honourable officer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14691 len. 27]: She uses some odd expressions , but is as cordial and full of heart as sanity itself can be -- more so than it often is .
Parsing [sent. 14692 len. 35]: Allan , very patient with her , waits until she has no more raptures to express , then points out Jo , trembling in a doorway , and tells her how he comes there .
Parsing [sent. 14693 len. 11]: `` Where can I lodge him hereabouts for the present ?
Parsing [sent. 14694 len. 16]: Now , you have a fund of knowledge and good sense and can advise me .
Parsing [sent. 14695 len. 26]: Miss Flite , mighty proud of the compliment , sets herself to consider ; but it is long before a bright thought occurs to her .
Parsing [sent. 14696 len. 15]: Mrs. Blinder is entirely let , and she herself occupies poor Gridley 's room .
Parsing [sent. 14697 len. 4]: `` Gridley ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14698 len. 15]: exclaims Miss Flite , clapping her hands after a twentieth repetition of this remark .
Parsing [sent. 14699 len. 3]: `` Gridley !
Parsing [sent. 14700 len. 4]: To be sure !
Parsing [sent. 14701 len. 3]: Of course !
Parsing [sent. 14702 len. 4]: My dear physician !
Parsing [sent. 14703 len. 8]: General George will help us out . ''
Parsing [sent. 14704 len. 45]: It is hopeless to ask for any information about General George , and would be , though Miss Flite had not akeady run upstairs to put on her pinched bonnet and her poor little shawl and to arm herself with her reticule of documents .
Parsing [sent. 14705 len. 56]: But as she informs her physician in her disjointed manner on coming down in full array that General George , whom she often calls upon , knows her dear Fitz Jarndyce and takes a great interest in all connected with her , Allan is induced to think that they may be in the right way .
Parsing [sent. 14706 len. 27]: So he tells Jo , for his encouragement , that this walking about will soon be over now ; and they repair to the general 's .
Parsing [sent. 14707 len. 6]: Fortunately it is not far .
Parsing [sent. 14708 len. 26]: From the exterior of George 's Shooting Gallery , and the long entry , and the bare perspective beyond it , Allan Woodcourt augurs well .
Parsing [sent. 14709 len. 49]: He also descries promise in the figure of Mr. George himself , striding towards them in his mornmg exercise with his pipe in his mouth , no stock on , and his muscular arms , developed by broadsword and dumbbell , weightily asserting themselves through his light shirt-sleeves .
Parsing [sent. 14710 len. 15]: `` Your servant , sir , '' says Mr. George with a military salute .
Parsing [sent. 14711 len. 39]: Good-humouredly smiling all over his broad forehead up into his crisp hair , he then defers to Miss Flite , as , with great stateliness , and at some length , she performs the courtly ceremony of presentation .
Parsing [sent. 14712 len. 13]: He winds it up with another `` Your servant , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14713 len. 4]: and another salute .
Parsing [sent. 14714 len. 6]: `` Excuse me , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14715 len. 7]: A sailor , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14716 len. 4]: says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 14717 len. 27]: `` I am proud to find I have the air of one , '' returns Allan ; `` but I am only a sea-going doctor . ''
Parsing [sent. 14718 len. 5]: `` Indeed , sir !
Parsing [sent. 14719 len. 12]: I should have thought you was a regular blue-jacket myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 14720 len. 40]: Allan hopes Mr. George will forgive his intrusion the more readily on that account , and particularly that he will not lay aside his pipe , which , in his politeness , he has testifled some intention of doing .
Parsing [sent. 14721 len. 13]: `` You are very good , sir , '' returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 14722 len. 37]: `` As I know by experience that it 's not disagreeable to Miss Flite , and since it 's equally agreeable to yourself -- '' and finishes the sentence by putting it between his lips again .
Parsing [sent. 14723 len. 21]: Allan proceeds to tell him all he knows about Jo , unto which the trooper listens with a grave face .
Parsing [sent. 14724 len. 13]: `` And that 's the lad , sir , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14725 len. 30]: he inquires , looking along the entry to where Jo stands staring up at the great letters on the whitewashed front , which have no meaning in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 14726 len. 9]: `` That 's he , '' says Allan .
Parsing [sent. 14727 len. 14]: `` And , Mr. George , I am in this difficulty about him .
Parsing [sent. 14728 len. 40]: I am unwilling to place him in a hospital , even if I could procure him immediate admission , because I foresee that he would not stay there many hours if he could be so much as got there .
Parsing [sent. 14729 len. 47]: The same objection applies to a workhouse , supposing I had the patience to be evaded and shirked , and handed about from post to pillar in trying to get him into one , which is a system that I do n't take kindly to . ''
Parsing [sent. 14730 len. 12]: `` No man does , sir , '' returns Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 14731 len. 52]: `` I am convinced that he would not remain in either place , because he is possessed by an extraordinary terror of this person who ordered him to keep out of the way ; in his ignorance , he believes this person to be everywhere , and cognizant of everything . ''
Parsing [sent. 14732 len. 13]: `` I ask your pardon , sir , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 14733 len. 11]: `` But you have not mentioned that party 's name .
Parsing [sent. 14734 len. 8]: Is it a secret , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14735 len. 7]: `` The boy makes it one .
Parsing [sent. 14736 len. 7]: But his name is Bucket . ''
Parsing [sent. 14737 len. 8]: `` Bucket the detective , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14738 len. 6]: `` The same man . ''
Parsing [sent. 14739 len. 44]: `` The man is known to me , sir , '' returns the trooper after blowing out a cloud of smoke and squaring his chest , `` and the boy is so far correct that he undoubtedly is a -- rum customer . ''
Parsing [sent. 14740 len. 16]: Mr. George smokes with a profound meaning after this and surveys Miss Flite in silence .
Parsing [sent. 14741 len. 47]: `` Now , I wish Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson at least to know that this Jo , who tells so strange a story , has reappeared , and to have it in their power to speak with him if they should desire to do so .
Parsing [sent. 14742 len. 26]: Therefore I want to get him , for the present moment , into any poor lodging kept by decent people where he would be admitted .
Parsing [sent. 14743 len. 35]: Decent people and Jo , Mr. George , '' says Allan , following the direction of the trooper 's eyes along the entry , `` have not been much acquainted , as you see .
Parsing [sent. 14744 len. 4]: Hence the difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 14745 len. 25]: Do you happen to know any one in this neighbourhood who would receive him for a while on my paying for him beforehand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14746 len. 38]: As he puts the question , he becomes aware of a dirty-faced little man standing at the trooper 's elbow and looking up , with an oddly twisted figure and countenance , into the trooper 's face .
Parsing [sent. 14747 len. 29]: After a few more puffs at his pipe , the trooper looks down askant at the little man , and the little man winks up at the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 14748 len. 56]: `` Well , sir , '' says Mr. George , `` I can assure you that I would willingiy be knocked on the head at any time if it would be at all agreeable to Miss Summerson , and consequently I esteem it a privilege to do that young lady any service , however small .
Parsing [sent. 14749 len. 16]: We are naturally in the vagabond way here , sir , both myself and Phil .
Parsing [sent. 14750 len. 7]: You see what the place is .
Parsing [sent. 14751 len. 20]: You are welcome to a quiet corner of it for the boy if the same would meet your views .
Parsing [sent. 14752 len. 8]: No charge made , except for rations .
Parsing [sent. 14753 len. 13]: We are not in a flourishing state of circumstances here , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14754 len. 16]: We are liable to be tumbled out neck and crop at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 14755 len. 25]: However , sir , such as the place is , and so long as it lasts , here it is at your service . ''
Parsing [sent. 14756 len. 20]: With a comprehensive wave of his pipe , Mr. George places the whole building at his visitor 's disposal .
Parsing [sent. 14757 len. 34]: `` I take it for granted , sir , '' he adds , `` you being one of the medical staff , that there is no present infection about this unfortunate subject ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14758 len. 7]: Allan is quite sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 14759 len. 24]: `` Because , sir , '' says Mr. George , shaking his head sorrowfully , `` we have had enough of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 14760 len. 12]: His tone is no less sorrowfully echoed by his new acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 14761 len. 48]: ` Still I am bound to tell you , '' observes Allan after repeating his former assurance , `` that the boy is deplorably low and reduced and that he may be -- I do not say that he is -- too far gone to recover . ''
Parsing [sent. 14762 len. 12]: `` Do you consider him in present danger , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14763 len. 4]: inquires the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 14764 len. 8]: `` Yes , I fear so . ''
Parsing [sent. 14765 len. 41]: `` Then , sir , '' returns the trooper in a decisive manner , `` it appears to me -- being naturally in the vagabond way myself -- that the sooner he comes out of the street , the better .
Parsing [sent. 14766 len. 4]: You , Phil !
Parsing [sent. 14767 len. 5]: Bring him in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14768 len. 30]: Mr. Squod tacks out , all on one side , to execute the word of command ; and the trooper , having smoked his pipe , lays it by .
Parsing [sent. 14769 len. 5]: Jo is brought in .
Parsing [sent. 14770 len. 53]: He is not one of Mrs. Pardiggle 's Tockahoopo Indians ; he is not one of Mrs. Jellyby 's lambs , being wholly unconnected with Borrioboola -- Gha ; he is not softened by distance and unfamiliarity ; he is not a genuine foreign-grown savage ; he is the ordinary home-made article .
Parsing [sent. 14771 len. 26]: Dirty , ugly , disagreeable to all the senses , in body a common creature of the common streets , only in soul a heathen .
Parsing [sent. 14772 len. 44]: Homely filth begrimes him , homely parasites devour him , homely sores are in him , homely rags are on him ; native ignorance , the growth of English soil and climate , sinks his immortal nature lower than the beasts that perish .
Parsing [sent. 14773 len. 9]: Stand forth , Jo , in uncompromising colours !
Parsing [sent. 14774 len. 20]: From the sole of thy foot to the crown of thy head , there is nothing interesting about thee .
Parsing [sent. 14775 len. 22]: He shuffles slowly into Mr. George 's gallery and stands huddled together in a bundle , looking all about the floor .
Parsing [sent. 14776 len. 27]: He seems to know that they have an inclination to shrink from him , partly for what he is and partly for what he has caused .
Parsing [sent. 14777 len. 8]: He , too , shrinks from them .
Parsing [sent. 14778 len. 18]: He is not of the same order of things , not of the same place in creation .
Parsing [sent. 14779 len. 17]: He is of no order and no place , neither of the beasts nor of humanity .
Parsing [sent. 14780 len. 7]: `` Look here , Jo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14781 len. 3]: says Allan .
Parsing [sent. 14782 len. 7]: `` This is Mr. George . ''
Parsing [sent. 14783 len. 21]: Jo searches the floor for some time longer , then looks up for a moment , and then down again .
Parsing [sent. 14784 len. 21]: `` He is a kind friend to you , for he is going to give you lodging room here . ''
Parsing [sent. 14785 len. 16]: Jo makes a scoop with one hand , which is supposed to be a bow .
Parsing [sent. 14786 len. 28]: After a little more consideration and some backing and changing of the foot on which he rests , he mutters that he is `` wery thankful . ''
Parsing [sent. 14787 len. 7]: `` You are quite safe here .
Parsing [sent. 14788 len. 16]: All you have to do at present is to be obedient and to get strong .
Parsing [sent. 14789 len. 16]: And mind you tell us the truth here , whatever you do , Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 14790 len. 19]: `` Wishermaydie if I do n't , sir , '' says Jo , reverting to his favourite declaration .
Parsing [sent. 14791 len. 20]: `` I never done nothink yit , but wot you knows on , to get myself into no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 14792 len. 22]: I never was in no other trouble at all , sir , ` sept not knowin ' nothink and starwation . ''
Parsing [sent. 14793 len. 11]: `` I believe it , now attend to Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 14794 len. 11]: I see he is going to speak to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 14795 len. 38]: `` My intention merely was , sir , '' observes Mr. George , amazingly broad and upright , `` to point out to him where he can lie down and get a thorough good dose of sleep .
Parsing [sent. 14796 len. 6]: Now , look here . ''
Parsing [sent. 14797 len. 23]: As the trooper speaks , he conducts them to the other end of the gallery and opens one of the little cabins .
Parsing [sent. 14798 len. 8]: `` There you are , you see !
Parsing [sent. 14799 len. 44]: Here is a mattress , and here you may rest , on good behaviour , as long as Mr. , I ask your pardon , sir '' -- he refers apologetically to the card Allan has given him -- `` Mr. Woodcourt pleases .
Parsing [sent. 14800 len. 22]: Do n't you be alarmed if you hear shots ; they 'll be aimed at the target , and not you .
Parsing [sent. 14801 len. 22]: Now , there 's another thing I would recommend , sir , '' says the trooper , turning to his visitor .
Parsing [sent. 14802 len. 7]: `` Phil , come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14803 len. 11]: Phil bears down upon them according to his usual tactics .
Parsing [sent. 14804 len. 20]: `` Here is a man , sir , who was found , when a baby , in the gutter .
Parsing [sent. 14805 len. 18]: Consequently , it is to be expected that he takes a natural interest in this poor creature .
Parsing [sent. 14806 len. 10]: You do , do n't you , Phil ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14807 len. 17]: `` Certainly and surely I do , guv ` ner , '' is Phil 's reply .
Parsing [sent. 14808 len. 94]: `` Now I was thinking , sir , '' says Mr. George in a martial sort of confidence , as if he were giving his opinion in a council of war at a drum-head , `` that if this man was to take him to a bath and was to lay out a few shillings in getting him one or two coarse articles -- '' `` Mr. George , my considerate friend , '' returns Allan , taking out his purse , `` it is the very favour I would have asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 14809 len. 14]: Phil Squod and Jo are sent out immediately on this work of improvement .
Parsing [sent. 14810 len. 72]: Miss Flite , quite enraptured by her success , makes the best of her way to court , having great fears that otherwise her friend the Chancellor may be uneasy about her or may give the judgment she has so long expected in her absence , and observing `` which you know , my dear physician , and general , after so many years , would be too absurdly unfortunate ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14811 len. 43]: Allan takes the opportunity of going out to procure some restorative medicines , and obtaining them near at hand , soon returns to find the trooper walking up and down the gallery , and to fall into step and walk with him .
Parsing [sent. 14812 len. 22]: `` I take it , sir , '' says Mr. George , `` that you know Miss Summerson pretty well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14813 len. 5]: Yes , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 14814 len. 9]: `` Not related to her , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14815 len. 5]: No , it appears .
Parsing [sent. 14816 len. 11]: `` Excuse the apparent curiosity , '' says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 14817 len. 30]: `` It seemed to me probable that you might take more than a common interest in this poor creature because Miss Summerson had taken that unfortunate interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 14818 len. 12]: 'T is MY case , sir , I assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 14819 len. 8]: `` And mine , Mr. George . ''
Parsing [sent. 14820 len. 28]: The trooper looks sideways at Allan 's sunburnt cheek and bright dark eye , rapidly measures his height and build , and seems to approve of him .
Parsing [sent. 14821 len. 36]: `` Since you have been out , sir , I have been thinking that I unquestionably know the rooms in Lincoln 's Inn Fields , where Bucket took the lad , according to his account .
Parsing [sent. 14822 len. 16]: Though he is not acquainted with the name , I can help you to it .
Parsing [sent. 14823 len. 4]: It 's Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 14824 len. 7]: That 's what it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 14825 len. 10]: Allan looks at him inquiringly , repeating the name .
Parsing [sent. 14826 len. 3]: `` Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 14827 len. 7]: That 's the name , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14828 len. 27]: I know the man , and know him to have been in communication with Bucket before , respecting a deceased person who had given him offence .
Parsing [sent. 14829 len. 7]: I know the man , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14830 len. 5]: To my sorrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 14831 len. 10]: Allan naturally asks what kind of man he is .
Parsing [sent. 14832 len. 6]: `` What kind of man !
Parsing [sent. 14833 len. 8]: Do you mean to look at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14834 len. 10]: `` I think I know that much of him .
Parsing [sent. 14835 len. 6]: I mean to deal with .
Parsing [sent. 14836 len. 8]: Generally , what kind of man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14837 len. 47]: `` Why , then I 'll tell you , sir , '' returns the trooper , stopping short and folding his arms on his square chest so angrily that his face fires and flushes all over ; `` he is a confoundedly bad kind of man .
Parsing [sent. 14838 len. 8]: He is a slow-torturing kind of man .
Parsing [sent. 14839 len. 15]: He is no more like flesh and blood than a rusty old carbine is .
Parsing [sent. 14840 len. 10]: He is a kind of man -- by George !
Parsing [sent. 14841 len. 24]: -- that has caused me more restlessness , and more uneasiness , and more dissatisfaction with myself than all other men put together .
Parsing [sent. 14842 len. 11]: That 's the kind of man Mr. Tulkinghorn is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14843 len. 19]: `` I am sorry , '' says Allan , `` to have touched so sore a place . ''
Parsing [sent. 14844 len. 4]: `` Sore ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14845 len. 25]: The trooper plants his legs wider apart , wets the palm of his broad right hand , and lays it on the imaginary moustache .
Parsing [sent. 14846 len. 15]: `` It 's no fault of yours , sir ; but you shall judge .
Parsing [sent. 14847 len. 8]: He has got a power over me .
Parsing [sent. 14848 len. 23]: He is the man I spoke of just now as being able to tumble me out of this place neck and crop .
Parsing [sent. 14849 len. 8]: He keeps me on a constant see-saw .
Parsing [sent. 14850 len. 13]: He wo n't hold off , and he wo n't come on .
Parsing [sent. 14851 len. 79]: If I have a payment to make him , or time to ask him for , or anything to go to him about , he do n't see me , do n't hear me -- passes me on to Melchisedech 's in Clifford 's Inn , Melchisedech 's in Clifford 's Inn passes me back again to him -- he keeps me prowling and dangling about him as if I was made of the same stone as himself .
Parsing [sent. 14852 len. 19]: Why , I spend half my life now , pretty well , loitering and dodging about his door .
Parsing [sent. 14853 len. 5]: What does he care ?
Parsing [sent. 14854 len. 2]: Nothing .
Parsing [sent. 14855 len. 14]: Just as much as the rusty old carbine I have compared him to .
Parsing [sent. 14856 len. 9]: He chafes and goads me till -- Bah !
Parsing [sent. 14857 len. 2]: Nonsense !
Parsing [sent. 14858 len. 5]: I am forgetting myself .
Parsing [sent. 14859 len. 47]: Mr. Woodcourt , '' the trooper resumes his march , `` all I say is , he is an old man ; but I am glad I shall never have the chance of setting spurs to my horse and riding at him in a fair field .
Parsing [sent. 14860 len. 25]: For if I had that chance , in one of the humours he drives me into -- he 'd go down , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14861 len. 19]: Mr. George has been so excited that he finds it necessary to wipe his forehead on his shirt-sleeve .
Parsing [sent. 14862 len. 59]: Even while he whistles his impetuosity away with the national anthem , some involuntary shakings of his head and heavings of his chest still linger behind , not to mention an occasional hasty adjustment with both hands of his open shirt-collar , as if it were scarcely open enough to prevent his being troubled by a choking sensation .
Parsing [sent. 14863 len. 22]: In short , Allan Woodcourt has not much doubt about the going down of Mr. Tulkinghorn on the field referred to .
Parsing [sent. 14864 len. 40]: Jo and his conductor presently return , and Jo is assisted to his mattress by the careful Phil , to whom , after due administration of medicine by his own hands , Allan confides all needful means and instructions .
Parsing [sent. 14865 len. 10]: The morning is by this time getting on apace .
Parsing [sent. 14866 len. 27]: He repairs to his lodgings to dress and breakfast , and then , without seeking rest , goes away to Mr. Jarndyce to communicate his discovery .
Parsing [sent. 14867 len. 29]: With him Mr. Jarndyce returns alone , confidentially telling him that there are reasons for keeping this matter very quiet indeed and showing a serious interest in it .
Parsing [sent. 14868 len. 20]: To Mr. Jarndyce , Jo repeats in substance what he said in the morning , without any material variation .
Parsing [sent. 14869 len. 17]: Only that cart of his is heavier to draw , and draws with a hollower sound .
Parsing [sent. 14870 len. 66]: `` Let me lay here quiet and not be chivied no more , '' falters Jo , `` and be so kind any person as is a-passin nigh where I used fur to sleep , as jist to say to Mr. Sangsby that Jo , wot he known once , is a-moving on right forards with his duty , and I 'll be wery thankful .
Parsing [sent. 14871 len. 23]: I 'd be more thankful than I am aready if it wos any ways possible for an unfortnet to be it . ''
Parsing [sent. 14872 len. 48]: He makes so many of these references to the law-stationer in the course of a day or two that Allan , after conferring with Mr. Jarndyce , good-naturedly resolves to call in Cook 's Court , the rather , as the cart seems to be breaking down .
Parsing [sent. 14873 len. 10]: To Cook 's Court , therefore , he repairs .
Parsing [sent. 14874 len. 60]: Mr. Snagsby is behind his counter in his grey coat and sleeves , inspecting an indenture of several skins which has just come in from the engrosser 's , an immense desert of law-hand and parchment , with here and there a resting-place of a few large letters to break the awful monotony and save the traveller from despair .
Parsing [sent. 14875 len. 23]: Mr Snagsby puts up at one of these inky wells and greets the stranger with his cough of general preparation for business .
Parsing [sent. 14876 len. 11]: `` You do n't remember me , Mr. Snagsby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14877 len. 17]: The stationer 's heart begins to thump heavily , for his old apprehensions have never abated .
Parsing [sent. 14878 len. 23]: It is as much as he can do to answer , `` No , sir , I ca n't say I do .
Parsing [sent. 14879 len. 25]: I should have considered -- not to put too fine a point upon it -- that I never saw you before , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14880 len. 9]: `` Twice before , '' says Allan Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 14881 len. 19]: `` Once at a poor bedside , and once -- '' `` It 's come at last ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14882 len. 11]: thinks the afflicted stationer , as recollection breaks upon him .
Parsing [sent. 14883 len. 15]: `` It 's got to a head now and is going to burst ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14884 len. 21]: But he has sufficient presence of mind to conduct his visitor into the little counting-house and to shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 14885 len. 10]: `` Are you a married man , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14886 len. 8]: `` No , I am not . ''
Parsing [sent. 14887 len. 28]: `` Would you make the attempt , though single , '' says Mr. Snagsby in a melancholy whisper , `` to speak as low as you can ?
Parsing [sent. 14888 len. 20]: For my little woman is a-listening somewheres , or I 'll forfeit the business and five hundred pound ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14889 len. 32]: In deep dejection Mr. Snagsby sits down on his stool , with his back against his desk , protesting , `` I never had a secret of my own , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14890 len. 26]: I ca n't charge my memory with ever having once attempted to deceive my little woman on my own account since she named the day .
Parsing [sent. 14891 len. 9]: I would n't have done it , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14892 len. 24]: Not to put too fine a point upon it , I could n't have done it , I durs n't have done it .
Parsing [sent. 14893 len. 25]: Whereas , and nevertheless , I find myself wrapped round with secrecy and mystery , till my life is a burden to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 14894 len. 16]: His visitor professes his regret to bear it and asks him does he remember Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14895 len. 14]: Mr. Snagsby answers with a suppressed groan , oh , do n't he !
Parsing [sent. 14896 len. 31]: `` You could n't name an individual human being -- except myself -- that my little woman is more set and determined against than Jo , '' says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 14897 len. 4]: Allan asks why .
Parsing [sent. 14898 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14899 len. 21]: repeats Mr. Snagsby , in his desperation clutching at the clump of hair at the back of his bald head .
Parsing [sent. 14900 len. 7]: `` How should 1 know why ?
Parsing [sent. 14901 len. 25]: But you are a single person , sir , and may you long be spared to ask a married person such a question ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14902 len. 25]: With this beneficent wish , Mr. Snagsby coughs a cough of dismal resignation and submits himself to hear what the visitor has to communicate .
Parsing [sent. 14903 len. 5]: `` There again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14904 len. 25]: says Mr. Snagsby , who , between the earnestness of his feelings and the suppressed tones of his voice is discoloured in the face .
Parsing [sent. 14905 len. 10]: `` At it again , in a new direction !
Parsing [sent. 14906 len. 25]: A certain person charges me , in the solemnest way , not to talk of Jo to any one , even my little woman .
Parsing [sent. 14907 len. 36]: Then comes another certain person , in the person of yourself , and charges me , in an equally solemn way , not to mention Jo to that other certain person above all other persons .
Parsing [sent. 14908 len. 8]: Why , this is a private asylum !
Parsing [sent. 14909 len. 19]: Why , not to put too fine a point upon it , this is Bedlam , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14910 len. 4]: says Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 14911 len. 29]: But it is better than he expected after all , being no explosion of the mine below him or deepening of the pit into which he has fallen .
Parsing [sent. 14912 len. 35]: And being tender-hearted and affected by the account he hears of Jo 's condition , he readily engages to `` look round '' as early in the evening as he can manage it quietly .
Parsing [sent. 14913 len. 26]: He looks round very quietly when the evening comes , but it may turn out that Mrs. Snagsby is as quiet a manager as he .
Parsing [sent. 14914 len. 42]: Jo is very glad to see his old friend and says , when they are left alone , that he takes it uncommon kind as Mr. Sangsby should come so far out of his way on accounts of sich as him .
Parsing [sent. 14915 len. 30]: Mr. Snagsby , touched by the spectacle before him , immediately lays upon the table half a crown , that magic balsam of his for all kinds of wounds .
Parsing [sent. 14916 len. 13]: `` And how do you find yourself , my poor lad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14917 len. 9]: inquires the stationer with his cough of sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 14918 len. 24]: `` I am in luck , Mr. Sangsby , I am , '' returns Jo , `` and do n't want for nothink .
Parsing [sent. 14919 len. 10]: I 'm more cumfbler nor you ca n't think .
Parsing [sent. 14920 len. 3]: Mr. Sangsby !
Parsing [sent. 14921 len. 22]: I 'm wery sorry that I done it , but I did n't go fur to do it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14922 len. 21]: The stationer softly lays down another half-crown and asks him what it is that he is sorry for having done .
Parsing [sent. 14923 len. 60]: `` Mr. Sangsby , '' says Jo , `` I went and giv a illness to the lady as wos and yit as war n't the t ` other lady , and none of 'em never says nothink to me for having done it , on accounts of their being ser good and my having been s ` unfortnet .
Parsing [sent. 14924 len. 19]: The lady come herself and see me yesday , and she ses , ` Ah , Jo ! '
Parsing [sent. 14925 len. 3]: she ses .
Parsing [sent. 14926 len. 11]: ` We thought we 'd lost you , Jo ! '
Parsing [sent. 14927 len. 3]: she ses .
Parsing [sent. 14928 len. 42]: And she sits down a-smilin so quiet , and do n't pass a word nor yit a look upon me for having done it , she do n't , and I turns agin the wall , I doos , Mr. Sangsby .
Parsing [sent. 14929 len. 15]: And Mr. Jarnders , I see him a-forced to turn away his own self .
Parsing [sent. 14930 len. 50]: And Mr. Woodcot , he come fur to giv me somethink fur to ease me , wot he 's allus a-doin ' on day and night , and wen he come a-bending over me and a-speakin up so bold , I see his tears a-fallin , Mr. Sangsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 14931 len. 10]: The softened stationer deposits another half-crown on the table .
Parsing [sent. 14932 len. 14]: Nothing less than a repetition of that infallible remedy will relieve his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 14933 len. 31]: `` Wot I was a-thinkin on , Mr. Sangsby , '' proceeds Jo , `` wos , as you wos able to write wery large , p ` raps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14934 len. 13]: `` Yes , Jo , please God , '' returns the stationer .
Parsing [sent. 14935 len. 10]: `` Uncommon precious large , p ` raps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14936 len. 5]: says Jo with eagerness .
Parsing [sent. 14937 len. 8]: `` Yes , my poor boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 14938 len. 5]: Jo laughs with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 14939 len. 124]: `` Wot I wos a-thinking on then , Mr. Sangsby , wos , that when I wos moved on as fur as ever I could go and could n't he moved no furder , whether you might be so good p ` raps as to write out , wery large so that any one could see it anywheres , as that I wos wery truly hearty sorry that I done it and that I never went fur to do it , and that though I did n't know nothink at all , I knowd as Mr. Woodcot once cried over it and wos allus grieved over it , and that I hoped as he 'd be able to forgive me in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 14940 len. 16]: If the writin could be made to say it wery large , he might . ''
Parsing [sent. 14941 len. 8]: `` It shall say it , Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14942 len. 4]: Very large . ''
Parsing [sent. 14943 len. 4]: Jo laughs again .
Parsing [sent. 14944 len. 6]: `` Thankee , Mr. Sangsby .
Parsing [sent. 14945 len. 21]: It 's wery kind of you , sir , and it makes me more cumfbler nor I was afore . ''
Parsing [sent. 14946 len. 37]: The meek little stationer , with a broken and unfinished cough , slips down his fourth half-crown -- he has never been so close to a case requiring so many -- and is fain to depart .
Parsing [sent. 14947 len. 15]: And Jo and he , upon this little earth , shall meet no more .
Parsing [sent. 14948 len. 3]: No more .
Parsing [sent. 14949 len. 19]: For the cart so hard to draw is near its journey 's end and drags over stony ground .
Parsing [sent. 14950 len. 15]: All round the clock it labours up the broken steps , shattered and worn .
Parsing [sent. 14951 len. 16]: Not many times can the sun rise and behold it still upon its weary road .
Parsing [sent. 14952 len. 54]: Phil Squod , with his smoky gunpowder visage , at once acts as nurse and works as armourer at his little table in a corner , often looking round and saying with a nod of his green-baize cap and an encouraging elevation of his one eyebrow , `` Hold up , my boy !
Parsing [sent. 14953 len. 4]: Hold up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14954 len. 38]: There , too , is Mr. Jarndyce many a time , and Allan Woodcourt almost always , both thinking , much , how strangely fate has entangled this rough outcast in the web of very different lives .
Parsing [sent. 14955 len. 51]: There , too , the trooper is a frequent visitor , filling the doorway with his athletic figure and , from his superfluity of life and strength , seeming to shed down temporary vigour upon Jo , who never fails to speak more robustly in answer to his cheerful words .
Parsing [sent. 14956 len. 29]: Jo is in a sleep or in a stupor to-day , and Allan Woodcourt , newly arrived , stands by him , looking down upon his wasted form .
Parsing [sent. 14957 len. 33]: After a while he softly seats himself upon the bedside with his face towards him -- just as he sat in the law-writer 's room -- and touches his chest and heart .
Parsing [sent. 14958 len. 15]: The cart had very nearly given up , but labours on a little more .
Parsing [sent. 14959 len. 11]: The trooper stands in the doorway , still and silent .
Parsing [sent. 14960 len. 17]: Phil has stopped in a low clinking noise , with his little hammer in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 14961 len. 31]: Mr. Woodcourt looks round with that grave professional interest and attention on his face , and glancing significantly at the trooper , signs to Phil to carry his table out .
Parsing [sent. 14962 len. 18]: When the little hammer is next used , there will be a speck of rust upon it .
Parsing [sent. 14963 len. 5]: `` Well , Jo !
Parsing [sent. 14964 len. 5]: What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 14965 len. 6]: Do n't be frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 14966 len. 28]: `` I thought , '' says Jo , who has started and is looking round , `` I thought I was in Tom-all -- Alone 's agin .
Parsing [sent. 14967 len. 12]: Ai n't there nobody here but you , Mr. Woodcot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14968 len. 4]: `` Nobody . ''
Parsing [sent. 14969 len. 13]: `` And I ai n't took back to Tom-all -- Alone 's .
Parsing [sent. 14970 len. 6]: Am I , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14971 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 14972 len. 14]: Jo closes his eyes , muttering , `` I 'm wery thankful . ''
Parsing [sent. 14973 len. 30]: After watching him closely a little while , Allan puts his mouth very near his ear and says to him in a low , distinct voice , `` Jo !
Parsing [sent. 14974 len. 8]: Did you ever know a prayer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14975 len. 8]: `` Never knowd nothink , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 14976 len. 10]: `` Not so much as one short prayer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14977 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 14978 len. 4]: Nothink at all .
Parsing [sent. 14979 len. 31]: Mr. Chadbands he wos a-prayin wunst at Mr. Sangsby 's and I heerd him , but he sounded as if he wos a-speakin to hisself , and not to me .
Parsing [sent. 14980 len. 15]: He prayed a lot , but I could n't make out nothink on it .
Parsing [sent. 14981 len. 56]: Different times there was other genlmen come down Tom-all -- Alone 's a-prayin , but they all mostly sed as the t ` other ` wuns prayed wrong , and all mostly sounded to be a-talking to theirselves , or a-passing blame on the t ` others , and not a -- talkin to us .
Parsing [sent. 14982 len. 5]: WE never knowd nothink .
Parsing [sent. 14983 len. 10]: I never knowd what it wos all about . ''
Parsing [sent. 14984 len. 28]: It takes him a long time to say this , and few but an experienced and attentive listener could hear , or , hearing , understand him .
Parsing [sent. 14985 len. 25]: After a short relapse into sleep or stupor , he makes , of a sudden , a strong effort to get out of bed .
Parsing [sent. 14986 len. 5]: `` Stay , Jo !
Parsing [sent. 14987 len. 4]: What now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14988 len. 24]: `` It 's time for me to go to that there berryin ground , sir , '' he returns with a wild look .
Parsing [sent. 14989 len. 8]: `` Lie down , and tell me .
Parsing [sent. 14990 len. 7]: What burying ground , Jo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 14991 len. 21]: `` Where they laid him as wos wery good to me , wery good to me indeed , he wos .
Parsing [sent. 14992 len. 25]: It 's time fur me to go down to that there berryin ground , sir , and ask to be put along with him .
Parsing [sent. 14993 len. 9]: I wants to go there and be berried .
Parsing [sent. 14994 len. 23]: He used fur to say to me , ' I am as poor as you to-day , Jo , ' he ses .
Parsing [sent. 14995 len. 25]: I wants to tell him that I am as poor as him now and have come there to be laid along with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 14996 len. 7]: `` By and by , Jo .
Parsing [sent. 14997 len. 5]: By and by . ''
Parsing [sent. 14998 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 14999 len. 13]: P'raps they would n't do it if I wos to go myself .
Parsing [sent. 15000 len. 19]: But will you promise to have me took there , sir , and laid along with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15001 len. 7]: `` I will , indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 15002 len. 5]: `` Thankee , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15003 len. 4]: Thankee , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15004 len. 23]: They 'll have to get the key of the gate afore they can take me in , for it 's allus locked .
Parsing [sent. 15005 len. 17]: And there 's a step there , as I used for to clean with my broom .
Parsing [sent. 15006 len. 8]: It 's turned wery dark , sir .
Parsing [sent. 15007 len. 7]: Is there any light a-comin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15008 len. 9]: `` It is coming fast , Jo . ''
Parsing [sent. 15009 len. 2]: Fast .
Parsing [sent. 15010 len. 18]: The cart is shaken all to pieces , and the rugged road is very near its end .
Parsing [sent. 15011 len. 8]: `` Jo , my poor fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15012 len. 27]: `` I hear you , sir , in the dark , but I 'm a-gropin -- a-gropin -- let me catch hold of your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 15013 len. 11]: `` Jo , can you say what I say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15014 len. 19]: `` I 'll say anythink as you say , sir , for I knows it 's good . ''
Parsing [sent. 15015 len. 5]: `` Our Father . ''
Parsing [sent. 15016 len. 4]: `` Our Father !
Parsing [sent. 15017 len. 10]: Yes , that 's wery good , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 15018 len. 7]: `` Which art in heaven . ''
Parsing [sent. 15019 len. 13]: `` Art in heaven -- is the light a-comin , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15020 len. 7]: `` It is close at hand .
Parsing [sent. 15021 len. 6]: Hallowed by thy name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15022 len. 17]: `` Hallowed be -- thy -- '' The light is come upon the dark benighted way .
Parsing [sent. 15023 len. 2]: Dead !
Parsing [sent. 15024 len. 5]: Dead , your Majesty .
Parsing [sent. 15025 len. 7]: Dead , my lords and gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 15026 len. 11]: Dead , right reverends and wrong reverends of every order .
Parsing [sent. 15027 len. 14]: Dead , men and women , born with heavenly compassion in your hearts .
Parsing [sent. 15028 len. 8]: And dying thus around us every day .
Parsing [sent. 15029 len. 24]: Chapter XLVIII -- Closing in The place in Lincolnshire has shut its many eyes again , and the house in town is awake .
Parsing [sent. 15030 len. 29]: In Lincolnshire the Dedlocks of the past doze in their picture-frames , and the low wind murmurs through the long drawing-room as if they were breathing pretty regularly .
Parsing [sent. 15031 len. 53]: In town the Dedlocks of the present rattle in their fire-eyed carriages through the darkness of the night , and the Dedlock Mercuries , with ashes -LRB- or hair-powder -RRB- on their heads , symptomatic of their great humility , loll away the drowsy mornings in the little windows of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 15032 len. 28]: The fashionable world -- tremendous orb , nearly five miles round -- is in full swing , and the solar system works respectfully at its appointed distances .
Parsing [sent. 15033 len. 30]: Where the throng is thickest , where the lights are brightest , where all the senses are ministered to with the greatest delicacy and refinement , Lady Dedlock is .
Parsing [sent. 15034 len. 15]: From the shining heights she has scaled and taken , she is never absent .
Parsing [sent. 15035 len. 63]: Though the belief she of old reposed in herself as one able to reserve whatsoever she would under her mantle of pride is beaten down , though she has no assurance that what she is to those around her she will remain another day , it is not in her nature when envious eyes are looking on to yield or to droop .
Parsing [sent. 15036 len. 15]: They say of her that she has lately grown more handsome and more haughty .
Parsing [sent. 15037 len. 31]: The debilitated cousin says of her that she 's beauty nough -- tsetup shopofwomen -- but rather larming kind -- remindingmanfact -- inconvenient woman -- who WILL getoutofbedandbawthstahlishment -- Shakespeare .
Parsing [sent. 15038 len. 8]: Mr. Tulkinghorn says nothing , looks nothing .
Parsing [sent. 15039 len. 37]: Now , as heretofore , he is to be found in doorways of rooms , with his limp white cravat loosely twisted into its old-fashioned tie , receiving patronage from the peerage and making no sign .
Parsing [sent. 15040 len. 20]: Of all men he is still the last who might be supposed to have any influence upon my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 15041 len. 19]: Of all woman she is still the last who might be supposed to have any dread of him .
Parsing [sent. 15042 len. 19]: One thing has been much on her mind since their late interview in his turret-room at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 15043 len. 12]: She is now decided , and prepared to throw it off .
Parsing [sent. 15044 len. 15]: It is morning in the great world , afternoon according to the little sun .
Parsing [sent. 15045 len. 29]: The Mercuries , exhausted by looking out of window , are reposing in the hall and hang their heavy heads , the gorgeous creatures , like overblown sunflowers .
Parsing [sent. 15046 len. 20]: Like them , too , they seem to run to a deal of seed in their tags and trimmings .
Parsing [sent. 15047 len. 24]: Sir Leicester , in the library , has fallen asleep for the good of the country over the report of a Parliamentary committee .
Parsing [sent. 15048 len. 21]: My Lady sits in the room in which she gave audience to the young man of the name of Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 15049 len. 15]: Rosa is with her and has been writing for her and reading to her .
Parsing [sent. 15050 len. 29]: Rosa is now at work upon embroidery or some such pretty thing , and as she bends her head over it , my Lady watches her in silence .
Parsing [sent. 15051 len. 7]: Not for the first time to-day .
Parsing [sent. 15052 len. 4]: `` Rosa . ''
Parsing [sent. 15053 len. 8]: The pretty village face looks brightly up .
Parsing [sent. 15054 len. 14]: Then , seeing how serious my Lady is , looks puzzled and surprised .
Parsing [sent. 15055 len. 6]: `` See to the door .
Parsing [sent. 15056 len. 5]: Is it shut ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15057 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 15058 len. 13]: She goes to it and returns , and looks yet more surprised .
Parsing [sent. 15059 len. 26]: `` I am about to place confidence in you , child , for I know I may trust your attachment , if not your judgment .
Parsing [sent. 15060 len. 18]: In what I am going to do , I will not disguise myself to you at least .
Parsing [sent. 15061 len. 6]: But I confide in you .
Parsing [sent. 15062 len. 12]: Say nothing to any one of what passes between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 15063 len. 12]: The timid little beauty promises in all earnestness to be trustworthy .
Parsing [sent. 15064 len. 42]: `` Do you know , '' Lady Dedlock asks her , signing to her to bring her chair nearer , `` do you know , Rosa , that I am different to you from what I am to any one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15065 len. 6]: `` Yes , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 15066 len. 3]: Much kinder .
Parsing [sent. 15067 len. 14]: But then I often think I know you as you really are . ''
Parsing [sent. 15068 len. 12]: `` You often think you know me as I really am ?
Parsing [sent. 15069 len. 7]: Poor child , poor child ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15070 len. 23]: She says it with a kind of scorn -- though not of Rosa -- and sits brooding , looking dreamily at her .
Parsing [sent. 15071 len. 16]: `` Do you think , Rosa , you are any relief or comfort to me ?
Parsing [sent. 15072 len. 31]: Do you suppose your being young and natural , and fond of me and grateful to me , makes it any pleasure to me to have you near me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15073 len. 15]: `` I do n't know , my Lady ; I can scarcely hope so .
Parsing [sent. 15074 len. 13]: But with all my heart , I wish it was so . ''
Parsing [sent. 15075 len. 9]: `` It is so , little one . ''
Parsing [sent. 15076 len. 21]: The pretty face is checked in its flush of pleasure by the dark expression on the handsome face before it .
Parsing [sent. 15077 len. 7]: It looks timidly for an explanation .
Parsing [sent. 15078 len. 12]: `` And if I were to say to-day , ` Go !
Parsing [sent. 15079 len. 4]: Leave me ! '
Parsing [sent. 15080 len. 23]: I should say what would give me great pain and disquiet , child , and what would leave me very solitary . ''
Parsing [sent. 15081 len. 4]: `` My Lady !
Parsing [sent. 15082 len. 6]: Have I offended you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15083 len. 4]: `` In nothing .
Parsing [sent. 15084 len. 4]: Come here . ''
Parsing [sent. 15085 len. 12]: Rosa bends down on the footstool at my Lady 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 15086 len. 26]: My Lady , with that motherly touch of the famous ironmaster night , lays her hand upon her dark hair and gently keeps it there .
Parsing [sent. 15087 len. 31]: `` I told you , Rosa , that I wished you to be happy and that I would make you so if I could make anybody happy on this earth .
Parsing [sent. 15088 len. 4]: I can not .
Parsing [sent. 15089 len. 29]: There are reasons now known to me , reasons in which you have no part , rendering it far better for you that you should not remain here .
Parsing [sent. 15090 len. 6]: You must not remain here .
Parsing [sent. 15091 len. 8]: I have determined that you shall not .
Parsing [sent. 15092 len. 17]: I have written to the father of your lover , and he will be here to-day .
Parsing [sent. 15093 len. 10]: All this I have done for your sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 15094 len. 25]: The weeping girl covers her hand with kisses and says what shall she do , what shall she do , when they are separated !
Parsing [sent. 15095 len. 13]: Her mistress kisses her on the cheek and makes no other answer .
Parsing [sent. 15096 len. 12]: `` Now , be happy , child , under better circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 15097 len. 6]: Be beloved and happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15098 len. 24]: `` Ah , my Lady , I have sometimes thought -- forgive my being so free -- that YOU are not happy . ''
Parsing [sent. 15099 len. 4]: `` I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15100 len. 13]: `` Will you be more so when you have sent me away ?
Parsing [sent. 15101 len. 7]: Pray , pray , think again .
Parsing [sent. 15102 len. 8]: Let me stay a little while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15103 len. 23]: `` I have said , my child , that what I do , I do for your sake , not my own .
Parsing [sent. 15104 len. 4]: It is done .
Parsing [sent. 15105 len. 24]: What I am towards you , Rosa , is what I am now -- not what I shall be a little while hence .
Parsing [sent. 15106 len. 8]: Remember this , and keep my confidence .
Parsing [sent. 15107 len. 15]: Do so much for my sake , and thus all ends between us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15108 len. 12]: She detaches herself from her simple-hearted companion and leaves the room .
Parsing [sent. 15109 len. 22]: Late in the afternoon , when she next appears upon the staircase , she is in her haughtiest and coldest state .
Parsing [sent. 15110 len. 34]: As indifferent as if all passion , feeling , and interest had been worn out in the earlier ages of the world and had perished from its surface with its other departed monsters .
Parsing [sent. 15111 len. 14]: Mercury has announced Mr. Rouncewell , which is the cause of her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 15112 len. 15]: Mr. Rouncewell is not in the library , but she repairs to the library .
Parsing [sent. 15113 len. 14]: Sir Leicester is there , and she wishes to speak to him first .
Parsing [sent. 15114 len. 14]: `` Sir Leicester , I am desirous -- but you are engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 15115 len. 5]: Oh , dear no !
Parsing [sent. 15116 len. 4]: Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 15117 len. 4]: Only Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 15118 len. 4]: Always at hand .
Parsing [sent. 15119 len. 4]: Haunting every place .
Parsing [sent. 15120 len. 10]: No relief or security from him for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 15121 len. 9]: `` I beg your pardon , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 15122 len. 8]: Will you allow me to retire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15123 len. 34]: With a look that plainly says , `` You know you have the power to remain if you will , '' she tells him it is not necessary and moves towards a chair .
Parsing [sent. 15124 len. 20]: Mr. Tulkinghorn brings it a little forward for her with his clumsy bow and retires into a window opposite .
Parsing [sent. 15125 len. 28]: Interposed between her and the fading light of day in the now quiet street , his shadow falls upon her , and he darkens all before her .
Parsing [sent. 15126 len. 8]: Even so does he darken her life .
Parsing [sent. 15127 len. 46]: It is a dull street under the best conditions , where the two long rows of houses stare at each other with that severity that half-a-dozen of its greatest mansions seem to have been slowly stared into stone rather than originally built in that material .
Parsing [sent. 15128 len. 61]: It is a street of such dismal grandeur , so determined not to condescend to liveliness , that the doors and windows hold a gloomy state of their own in black paint and dust , and the echoing mews behind have a dry and massive appearance , as if they were reserved to stable the stone chargers of noble statues .
Parsing [sent. 15129 len. 32]: Complicated garnish of iron-work entwines itself over the flights of steps in this awful street , and from these petrified bowers , extinguishers for obsolete flambeaux gasp at the upstart gas .
Parsing [sent. 15130 len. 43]: Here and there a weak little iron hoop , through which bold boys aspire to throw their friends ' caps -LRB- its only present use -RRB- , retains its place among the rusty foliage , sacred to the memory of departed oil .
Parsing [sent. 15131 len. 49]: Nay , even oil itself , yet lingering at long intervals in a little absurd glass pot , with a knob in the bottom like an oyster , blinks and sulks at newer lights every night , like its high and dry master in the House of Lords .
Parsing [sent. 15132 len. 27]: Therefore there is not much that Lady Dedlock , seated in her chair , could wish to see through the window in which Mr. Tulkinghorn stands .
Parsing [sent. 15133 len. 31]: And yet -- and yet -- she sends a look in that direction as if it were her heart 's desire to have that figure moved out of the way .
Parsing [sent. 15134 len. 8]: Sir Leicester begs his Lady 's pardon .
Parsing [sent. 15135 len. 6]: She was about to say ?
Parsing [sent. 15136 len. 30]: `` Only that Mr. Rouncewell is here -LRB- he has called by my appointment -RRB- and that we had better make an end of the question of that girl .
Parsing [sent. 15137 len. 10]: I am tired to death of the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 15138 len. 11]: `` What can I do -- to -- assist ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15139 len. 8]: demands Sir Leicester in some considerable doubt .
Parsing [sent. 15140 len. 12]: `` Let us see him here and have done with it .
Parsing [sent. 15141 len. 10]: Will you tell them to send him up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15142 len. 11]: `` Mr. Tulkinghorn , be so good as to ring .
Parsing [sent. 15143 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15144 len. 27]: Request , '' says Sir Leicester to Mercury , not immediately remembering the business term , `` request the iron gentleman to walk this way . ''
Parsing [sent. 15145 len. 15]: Mercury departs in search of the iron gentleman , finds , and produces him .
Parsing [sent. 15146 len. 8]: Sir Leicester receives that ferruginous person graciously .
Parsing [sent. 15147 len. 10]: `` I hope you are well , Mr. Rouncewell .
Parsing [sent. 15148 len. 3]: Be seated .
Parsing [sent. 15149 len. 8]: -LRB- My solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 15150 len. 30]: My Lady was desirous , Mr. Rouncewell , '' Sir Leicester skilfully transfers him with a solemn wave of his hand , `` was desirous to speak with you .
Parsing [sent. 15151 len. 3]: Hem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15152 len. 31]: `` I shall be very happy , '' returns the iron gentleman , `` to give my best attention to anything Lady Dedlock does me the honour to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 15153 len. 24]: As he turns towards her , he finds that the impression she makes upon him is less agreeable than on the former occasion .
Parsing [sent. 15154 len. 28]: A distant supercilious air makes a cold atmosphere about her , and there is nothing in her bearing , as there was before , to encourage openness .
Parsing [sent. 15155 len. 34]: `` Pray , sir , '' says Lady Dedlock listlessly , `` may I be allowed to inquire whether anything has passed between you and your son respecting your son 's fancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15156 len. 21]: It is almost too troublesome to her languid eyes to bestow a look upon him as she asks this question .
Parsing [sent. 15157 len. 37]: `` If my memory serves me , Lady Dedlock , I said , when I had the pleasure of seeing you before , that I should seriously advise my son to conquer that -- fancy . ''
Parsing [sent. 15158 len. 10]: The ironmaster repeats her expression with a little emphasis .
Parsing [sent. 15159 len. 6]: `` And did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15160 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15161 len. 6]: Of course I did . ''
Parsing [sent. 15162 len. 10]: Sir Leicester gives a nod , approving and confirmatory .
Parsing [sent. 15163 len. 3]: Very proper .
Parsing [sent. 15164 len. 18]: The iron gentleman , having said that he would do it , was bound to do it .
Parsing [sent. 15165 len. 13]: No difference in this respect between the base metals and the precious .
Parsing [sent. 15166 len. 3]: Highly proper .
Parsing [sent. 15167 len. 9]: `` And pray has he done so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15168 len. 15]: `` Really , Lady Dedlock , I can not make you a definite reply .
Parsing [sent. 15169 len. 4]: I fear not .
Parsing [sent. 15170 len. 4]: Probably not yet .
Parsing [sent. 15171 len. 26]: In our condition of life , we sometimes couple an intention with our -- our fancies which renders them not altogether easy to throw off .
Parsing [sent. 15172 len. 13]: I think it is rather our way to be in earnest . ''
Parsing [sent. 15173 len. 23]: Sir Leicester has a misgiving that there may be a hidden Wat Tylerish meaning in this expression , and fumes a little .
Parsing [sent. 15174 len. 21]: Mr. Rouncewell is perfectly good-humoured and polite , but within such limits , evidently adapts his tone to his reception .
Parsing [sent. 15175 len. 24]: `` Because , '' proceeds my Lady , `` I have been thinking of the subject , which is tiresome to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 15176 len. 11]: `` I am very sorry , I am sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 15177 len. 55]: `` And also of what Sir Leicester said upon it , in which I quite concur '' -- Sir Leicester flattered -- `` and if you can not give us the assurance that this fancy is at an end , I have come to the conclusion that the girl had better leave me . ''
Parsing [sent. 15178 len. 11]: `` I can give no such assurance , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 15179 len. 6]: Nothing of the kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 15180 len. 8]: `` Then she had better go . ''
Parsing [sent. 15181 len. 32]: `` Excuse me , my Lady , '' Sir Leicester considerately interposes , `` but perhaps this may be doing an injury to the young woman which she has not merited .
Parsing [sent. 15182 len. 91]: Here is a young woman , '' says Sir Leicester , magnificently laying out the matter with his right hand like a service of plate , `` whose good fortune it is to have attracted the notice and favour of an eminent lady and to live , under the protection of that eminent lady , surrounded by the various advantages which such a position confers , and which are unquestionably very great -- I believe unquestionably very great , sir -- for a young woman in that station of life .
Parsing [sent. 15183 len. 57]: The question then arises , should that young woman be deprived of these many advantages and that good fortune simply because she has '' -- Sir Leicester , with an apologetic but dignified inclination of his head towards the ironmaster , winds up his sentence -- `` has attracted the notice of Mr Rouncewell 's son ?
Parsing [sent. 15184 len. 8]: Now , has she deserved this punishment ?
Parsing [sent. 15185 len. 6]: Is this just towards her ?
Parsing [sent. 15186 len. 7]: Is this our previous understanding ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15187 len. 15]: `` I beg your pardon , '' interposes Mr. Rouncewell 's son 's father .
Parsing [sent. 15188 len. 9]: `` Sir Leicester , will you allow me ?
Parsing [sent. 15189 len. 8]: I think I may shorten the subject .
Parsing [sent. 15190 len. 7]: Pray dismiss that from your consideration .
Parsing [sent. 15191 len. 33]: If you remember anything so unimportant -- which is not to be expected -- you would recollect that my first thought in the affair was directly opposed to her remaining here . ''
Parsing [sent. 15192 len. 7]: Dismiss the Dedlock patronage from consideration ?
Parsing [sent. 15193 len. 2]: Oh !
Parsing [sent. 15194 len. 37]: Sir Leicester is bound to believe a pair of ears that have been handed down to him through such a family , or he really might have mistrusted their report of the iron gentleman 's observations .
Parsing [sent. 15195 len. 33]: `` It is not necessary , '' observes my Lady in her coldest manner before he can do anything but breathe amazedly , `` to enter into these matters on either side .
Parsing [sent. 15196 len. 53]: The girl is a very good girl ; I have nothing whatever to say against her , but she is so far insensible to her many advantages and her good fortune that she is in love -- or supposes she is , poor little fool -- and unable to appreciate them . ''
Parsing [sent. 15197 len. 11]: Sir Leicester begs to observe that wholly alters the case .
Parsing [sent. 15198 len. 20]: He might have been sure that my Lady had the best grounds and reasons in support of her view .
Parsing [sent. 15199 len. 7]: He entirely agrees with my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 15200 len. 7]: The young woman had better go .
Parsing [sent. 15201 len. 36]: `` As Sir Leicester observed , Mr. Rouncewell , on the last occasion when we were fatigued by this business , '' Lady Dedlock languidly proceeds , `` we can not make conditions with you .
Parsing [sent. 15202 len. 19]: Without conditions , and under present circumstances , the girl is quite misplaced here and had better go .
Parsing [sent. 15203 len. 6]: I have told her so .
Parsing [sent. 15204 len. 29]: Would you wish to have her sent back to the village , or would you like to take her with you , or what would you prefer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15205 len. 18]: `` Lady Dedlock , if I may speak plainly -- '' `` By all means . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 15206 len. 24]: -- I should prefer the course which will the soonest relieve you of the incumbrance and remove her from her present position . ''
Parsing [sent. 15207 len. 32]: `` And to speak as plainly , '' she returns with the same studied carelessness , `` so should I. Do I understand that you will take her with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15208 len. 8]: The iron gentleman makes an iron bow .
Parsing [sent. 15209 len. 9]: `` Sir Leicester , will you ring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15210 len. 12]: Mr. Tulkinghorn steps forward from his window and pulls the bell .
Parsing [sent. 15211 len. 6]: `` I had forgotten you .
Parsing [sent. 15212 len. 4]: Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 15213 len. 11]: He makes his usual bow and goes quietly back again .
Parsing [sent. 15214 len. 22]: Mercury , swift-responsive , appears , receives instructions whom to produce , skims away , produces the aforesaid , and departs .
Parsing [sent. 15215 len. 10]: Rosa has been crying and is yet in distress .
Parsing [sent. 15216 len. 28]: On her coming in , the ironmaster leaves his chair , takes her arm in his , and remains with her near the door ready to depart .
Parsing [sent. 15217 len. 27]: `` You are taken charge of , you see , '' says my Lady in her weary manner , `` and are going away well protected .
Parsing [sent. 15218 len. 20]: I have mentioned that you are a very good girl , and you have nothing to cry for . ''
Parsing [sent. 15219 len. 32]: `` She seems after all , '' observes Mr. Tulkinghorn , loitering a little forward with his hands behind him , `` as if she were crying at going away . ''
Parsing [sent. 15220 len. 48]: `` Why , she is not well-bred , you see , '' returns Mr. Rouncewell with some quickness in his manner , as if he were glad to have the lawyer to retort upon , `` and she is an inexperienced little thing and knows no better .
Parsing [sent. 15221 len. 17]: If she had remained here , sir , she would have improved , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 15222 len. 12]: `` No doubt , '' is Mr. Tulkinghorn 's composed reply .
Parsing [sent. 15223 len. 41]: Rosa sobs out that she is very sorry to leave my Lady , and that she was happy at Chesney Wold , and has been happy with my Lady , and that she thanks my Lady over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 15224 len. 9]: `` Out , you silly little puss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15225 len. 15]: says the ironmaster , checking her in a low voice , though not angrily .
Parsing [sent. 15226 len. 13]: `` Have a spirit , if you 're fond of Watt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15227 len. 18]: My Lady merely waves her off with indifference , saying , `` There , there , child !
Parsing [sent. 15228 len. 6]: You are a good girl .
Parsing [sent. 15229 len. 4]: Go away ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15230 len. 19]: Sir Leicester has magnificently disengaged himself from the subject and retired into the sanctuary of his blue coat .
Parsing [sent. 15231 len. 28]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , an indistinct form against the dark street now dotted with lamps , looms in my Lady 's view , bigger and blacker than before .
Parsing [sent. 15232 len. 48]: `` Sir Leicester and Lady Dedlock , '' says Mr. Rouncewell after a pause of a few moments , `` I beg to take my leave , with an apology for having again troubled you , though not of my own act , on this tiresome subject .
Parsing [sent. 15233 len. 23]: I can very well understand , I assure you , how tiresome so small a matter must have become to Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 15234 len. 36]: If I am doubtful of my dealing with it , it is only because I did not at first quietly exert my influence to take my young friend here away without troubling you at all .
Parsing [sent. 15235 len. 37]: But it appeared to me -- I dare say magnifying the importance of the thing -- that it was respectful to explain to you how the matter stood and candid to consult your wishes and convenience .
Parsing [sent. 15236 len. 15]: I hope you will excuse my want of acquaintance with the polite world . ''
Parsing [sent. 15237 len. 13]: Sir Leicester considers himself evoked out of the sanctuary by these remarks .
Parsing [sent. 15238 len. 14]: `` Mr. Rouncewell , '' he returns , `` do not menfion it .
Parsing [sent. 15239 len. 12]: Justifications are unnecessary , I hope , on either side . ''
Parsing [sent. 15240 len. 105]: `` I am glad to hear it , Sir Leicester ; and if I may , by way of a last word , revert to what I said before of my mother 's long connexion with the family and the worth it bespeaks on both sides , I would point out this little instance here on my arm who shows herself so affectionate and faithful in parting and in whom my mother , I dare say , has done something to awaken such feelings -- though of course Lady Dedlock , by her heartfelt interest and her genial condescension , has done much more .
Parsing [sent. 15241 len. 14]: If he mean this ironically , it may be truer than he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 15242 len. 34]: He points it , however , by no deviation from his straightforward manner of speech , though in saying it he turns towards that part of the dim room where my Lady sits .
Parsing [sent. 15243 len. 28]: Sir Leicester stands to return his parting salutation , Mr. Tulkinghorn again rings , Mercury takes another flight , and Mr. Rouncewell and Rosa leave the house .
Parsing [sent. 15244 len. 44]: Then lights are brought in , discovering Mr. Tulkinghorn still standing in his window with his hands behind him and my Lady still sitting with his figure before her , closing up her view of the night as well as of the day .
Parsing [sent. 15245 len. 5]: She is very pale .
Parsing [sent. 15246 len. 19]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , observing it as she rises to retire , thinks , `` Well she may be !
Parsing [sent. 15247 len. 8]: The power of this woman is astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 15248 len. 11]: She has been acting a part the whole time . ''
Parsing [sent. 15249 len. 46]: But he can act a part too -- his one unchanging character -- and as he holds the door open for this woman , fifty pairs of eyes , each fifty times sharper than Sir Leicester 's pair , should find no flaw in him .
Parsing [sent. 15250 len. 10]: Lady Dedlock dines alone in her own room to-day .
Parsing [sent. 15251 len. 20]: Sir Leicester is whipped in to the rescue of the Doodle Party and the discomfiture of the Coodle Faction .
Parsing [sent. 15252 len. 31]: Lady Dedlock asks on sitting down to dinner , still deadly pale -LRB- and quite an illustration of the debilitated cousin 's text -RRB- , whether he is gone out ?
Parsing [sent. 15253 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 15254 len. 7]: Whether Mr. Tulkinghorn is gone yet ?
Parsing [sent. 15255 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 15256 len. 10]: Presently she asks again , is he gone YET ?
Parsing [sent. 15257 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 15258 len. 5]: What is he doing ?
Parsing [sent. 15259 len. 10]: Mercury thinks he is writing letters in the library .
Parsing [sent. 15260 len. 8]: Would my Lady wish to see him ?
Parsing [sent. 15261 len. 4]: Anything but that .
Parsing [sent. 15262 len. 8]: But he wishes to see my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 15263 len. 30]: Within a few more minutes he is reported as sending his respects , and could my Lady please to receive him for a word or two after her dinner ?
Parsing [sent. 15264 len. 7]: My Lady will receive him now .
Parsing [sent. 15265 len. 19]: He comes now , apologizing for intruding , even by her permission , while she is at table .
Parsing [sent. 15266 len. 16]: When they are alone , my Lady waves her hand to dispense with such mockeries .
Parsing [sent. 15267 len. 9]: `` What do you want , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15268 len. 51]: `` Why , Lady Dedlock , '' says the lawyer , taking a chair at a little distance from her and slowly rubbing his rusty legs up and down , up and down , up and down , `` I am rather surprised by the course you have taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 15269 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15270 len. 5]: `` Yes , decidedly .
Parsing [sent. 15271 len. 7]: I was not prepared for it .
Parsing [sent. 15272 len. 12]: I consider it a departure from our agreement and your promise .
Parsing [sent. 15273 len. 11]: It puts us in a new position , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 15274 len. 17]: I feel myself under the necessity of saying that I do n't approve of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 15275 len. 17]: He stops in his rubbing and looks at her , with his hands on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 15276 len. 29]: Imperturbable and unchangeable as he is , there is still an indefinable freedom in his manner which is new and which does not escape this woman 's observation .
Parsing [sent. 15277 len. 9]: `` I do not quite understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 15278 len. 10]: `` Oh , yes you do , I think .
Parsing [sent. 15279 len. 5]: I think you do .
Parsing [sent. 15280 len. 15]: Come , come , Lady Dedlock , we must not fence and parry now .
Parsing [sent. 15281 len. 8]: You know you like this girl . ''
Parsing [sent. 15282 len. 6]: `` Well , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15283 len. 56]: `` And you know -- and I know -- that you have not sent her away for the reasons you have assigned , but for the purpose of separating her as much as possible from -- excuse my mentioning it as a matter of business -- any reproach and exposure that impend over yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 15284 len. 6]: `` Well , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15285 len. 20]: `` Well , Lady Dedlock , '' returns the lawyer , crossing his legs and nursing the uppermost knee .
Parsing [sent. 15286 len. 6]: `` I object to that .
Parsing [sent. 15287 len. 7]: I consider that a dangerous proceeding .
Parsing [sent. 15288 len. 26]: I know it to be unnecessary and calculated to awaken speculation , doubt , rumour , I do n't know what , in the house .
Parsing [sent. 15289 len. 10]: Besides , it is a violation of our agreement .
Parsing [sent. 15290 len. 10]: You were to be exactly what you were before .
Parsing [sent. 15291 len. 29]: Whereas , it must be evident to yourself , as it is to me , that you have been this evening very different from what you were before .
Parsing [sent. 15292 len. 13]: Why , bless my soul , Lady Dedlock , transparenfly so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15293 len. 23]: `` If , sir , '' she begins , `` in my knowledge of my secret -- '' But he interrupts her .
Parsing [sent. 15294 len. 28]: `` Now , Lady Dedlock , this is a matter of business , and in a matter of business the ground can not be kept too clear .
Parsing [sent. 15295 len. 7]: It is no longer your secret .
Parsing [sent. 15296 len. 3]: Excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 15297 len. 6]: That is just the mistake .
Parsing [sent. 15298 len. 14]: It is my secret , in trust for Sir Leicester and the family .
Parsing [sent. 15299 len. 19]: If it were your secret , Lady Dedlock , we should not be here holding this conversation . ''
Parsing [sent. 15300 len. 6]: `` That is very true .
Parsing [sent. 15301 len. 56]: If in my knowledge of THE secret I do what I can to spare an innocent girl -LRB- especially , remembering your own reference to her when you told my story to the assembled guests at Chesney Wold -RRB- from the taint of my impending shame , I act upon a resolution I have taken .
Parsing [sent. 15302 len. 21]: Nothing in the world , and no one in the world , could shake it or could move me . ''
Parsing [sent. 15303 len. 17]: This she says with great deliberation and distinctness and with no more outward passion than himself .
Parsing [sent. 15304 len. 22]: As for him , he methodically discusses his matter of business as if she were any insensible instrument used in business .
Parsing [sent. 15305 len. 3]: `` Really ?
Parsing [sent. 15306 len. 19]: Then you see , Lady Dedlock , '' he returns , `` you are not to be trusted .
Parsing [sent. 15307 len. 32]: You have put the case in a perfecfly plain way , and according to the literal fact ; and that being the case , you are not to be trusted . ''
Parsing [sent. 15308 len. 24]: `` Perhaps you may remember that I expressed some anxiety on this same point when we spoke at night at Chesney Wold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15309 len. 17]: `` Yes , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , coolly getting up and standing on the hearth .
Parsing [sent. 15310 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 15311 len. 46]: I recollect , Lady Dedlock , that you certainly referred to the girl , but that was before we came to our arrangement , and both the letter and the spirit of our arrangement altogether precluded any action on your part founded upon my discovery .
Parsing [sent. 15312 len. 8]: There can be no doubt about that .
Parsing [sent. 15313 len. 14]: As to sparing the girl , of what importance or value is she ?
Parsing [sent. 15314 len. 2]: Spare !
Parsing [sent. 15315 len. 10]: Lady Dedlock , here is a family name compromised .
Parsing [sent. 15316 len. 40]: One might have supposed that the course was straight on -- over everything , neither to the right nor to the left , regardless of all considerations in the way , sparing nothing , treading everything under foot . ''
Parsing [sent. 15317 len. 8]: She has been looking at the table .
Parsing [sent. 15318 len. 10]: She lifts up her eyes and looks at him .
Parsing [sent. 15319 len. 21]: There is a stern expression on her face and a part of her lower lip is compressed under her teeth .
Parsing [sent. 15320 len. 18]: `` This woman understands me , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn thinks as she lets her glance fall again .
Parsing [sent. 15321 len. 7]: `` SHE can not be spared .
Parsing [sent. 15322 len. 7]: Why should she spare others ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15323 len. 8]: For a little while they are silent .
Parsing [sent. 15324 len. 23]: Lady Dedlock has eaten no dinner , but has twice or thrice poured out water with a steady hand and drunk it .
Parsing [sent. 15325 len. 18]: She rises from table , takes a lounging-chair , and reclines in it , shading her face .
Parsing [sent. 15326 len. 13]: There is nothing in her manner to express weakness or excite compassion .
Parsing [sent. 15327 len. 8]: It is thoughtful , gloomy , concentrated .
Parsing [sent. 15328 len. 29]: `` This woman , '' thinks Mr. Tulkinghorn , standing on the hearth , again a dark object closing up her view , `` is a study . ''
Parsing [sent. 15329 len. 13]: He studies her at his leisure , not speaking for a time .
Parsing [sent. 15330 len. 8]: She too studies something at her leisure .
Parsing [sent. 15331 len. 32]: She is not the first to speak , appearing indeed so unlikely to be so , though he stood there until midnight , that even he is driven upon breaking silence .
Parsing [sent. 15332 len. 19]: `` Lady Dedlock , the most disagreeable part of this business interview remains , but it is business .
Parsing [sent. 15333 len. 5]: Our agreement is broken .
Parsing [sent. 15334 len. 25]: A lady of your sense and strength of character will be prepared for my now declaring it void and taking my own course . ''
Parsing [sent. 15335 len. 7]: `` I am quite prepared . ''
Parsing [sent. 15336 len. 6]: Mr. Tulkinghorn inclines his head .
Parsing [sent. 15337 len. 15]: `` That is all I have to trouble you with , Lady Dedlock . ''
Parsing [sent. 15338 len. 24]: She stops him as he is moving out of the room by asking , `` This is the notice I was to receive ?
Parsing [sent. 15339 len. 8]: I wish not to misapprehend you . ''
Parsing [sent. 15340 len. 25]: `` Not exactly the notice you were to receive , Lady Dedlock , because the contemplated notice supposed the agreement to have been observed .
Parsing [sent. 15341 len. 9]: But virtually the same , virtually the same .
Parsing [sent. 15342 len. 11]: The difference is merely in a lawyer 's mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 15343 len. 11]: `` You intend to give me no other notice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15344 len. 5]: `` You are right .
Parsing [sent. 15345 len. 3]: No . ''
Parsing [sent. 15346 len. 10]: `` Do you contemplate undeceiving Sir Leicester to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15347 len. 6]: `` A home question ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15348 len. 17]: says Mr. Tulkinghorn with a slight smile and cautiously shaking his head at the shaded face .
Parsing [sent. 15349 len. 7]: `` No , not to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 15350 len. 4]: `` To-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15351 len. 16]: `` All things considered , I had better decline answering that question , Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 15352 len. 26]: If I were to say I do n't know when , exactly , you would not believe me , and it would answer no purpose .
Parsing [sent. 15353 len. 5]: It may be to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 15354 len. 7]: I would rather say no more .
Parsing [sent. 15355 len. 17]: You are prepared , and I hold out no expectations which circumstances might fail to justify .
Parsing [sent. 15356 len. 7]: I wish you good evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 15357 len. 32]: She removes her hand , turns her pale face towards him as he walks silently to the door , and stops him once again as he is about to open it .
Parsing [sent. 15358 len. 12]: `` Do you intend to remain in the house any time ?
Parsing [sent. 15359 len. 9]: I heard you were writing in the library .
Parsing [sent. 15360 len. 8]: Are you going to return there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15361 len. 6]: `` Only for my hat .
Parsing [sent. 15362 len. 6]: I am going home . ''
Parsing [sent. 15363 len. 21]: She bows her eyes rather than her head , the movement is so slight and curious , and he withdraws .
Parsing [sent. 15364 len. 21]: Clear of the room he looks at his watch but is inclined to doubt it by a minute or thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 15365 len. 22]: There is a splendid clock upon the staircase , famous , as splendid clocks not often are , for its accuracy .
Parsing [sent. 15366 len. 16]: `` And what do YOU say , '' Mr. Tulkinghorn inquires , referring to it .
Parsing [sent. 15367 len. 7]: `` What do you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15368 len. 12]: If it said now , `` Do n't go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15369 len. 46]: What a famous clock , hereafter , if it said to-night of all the nights that it has counted off , to this old man of all the young and old men who have ever stood before it , `` Do n't go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15370 len. 16]: With its sharp clear bell it strikes three quarters after seven and ticks on again .
Parsing [sent. 15371 len. 22]: `` Why , you are worse than I thought you , '' says Mr. Tulkinghorn , muttering reproof to his watch .
Parsing [sent. 15372 len. 5]: `` Two minutes wrong ?
Parsing [sent. 15373 len. 11]: At this rate you wo n't last my time . ''
Parsing [sent. 15374 len. 21]: What a watch to return good for evil if it ticked in answer , `` Do n't go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15375 len. 49]: He passes out into the streets and walks on , with his hands behind him , under the shadow of the lofty houses , many of whose mysteries , difficulties , mortgages , delicate affairs of all kinds , are treasured up within his old black satin waistcoat .
Parsing [sent. 15376 len. 12]: He is in the confidence of the very bricks and mortar .
Parsing [sent. 15377 len. 9]: The high chimney-stacks telegraph family secrets to him .
Parsing [sent. 15378 len. 21]: Yet there is not a voice in a mile of them to whisper , `` Do n't go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15379 len. 68]: Through the stir and motion of the commoner streets ; through the roar and jar of many vehicles , many feet , many voices ; with the blazing shop-lights lighting him on , the west wind blowing him on , and the crowd pressing him on , he is pitilessly urged upon his way , and nothing meets him murmuring , `` Do n't go home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15380 len. 60]: Arrived at last in his dull room to light his candles , and look round and up , and see the Roman pointing from the ceiling , there is no new significance in the Roman 's hand to-night or in the flutter of the attendant groups to give him the late warning , `` Do n't come here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15381 len. 26]: It is a moonlight night , but the moon , being past the full , is only now rising over the great wilderness of London .
Parsing [sent. 15382 len. 14]: The stars are shining as they shone above the turret-leads at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 15383 len. 20]: This woman , as he has of late been so accustomed to call her , looks out upon them .
Parsing [sent. 15384 len. 15]: Her soul is turbulent within her ; she is sick at heart and restless .
Parsing [sent. 15385 len. 9]: The large rooms are too cramped and close .
Parsing [sent. 15386 len. 15]: She can not endure their restraint and will walk alone in a neighbouring garden .
Parsing [sent. 15387 len. 37]: Too capricious and imperious in all she does to be the cause of much surprise in those about her as to anything she does , this woman , loosely muffled , goes out into the moonlight .
Parsing [sent. 15388 len. 6]: Mercury attends with the key .
Parsing [sent. 15389 len. 24]: Having opened the garden-gate , he delivers the key into his Lady 's hands at her request and is bidden to go back .
Parsing [sent. 15390 len. 12]: She will walk there some time to ease her aching head .
Parsing [sent. 15391 len. 11]: She may be an hour , she may be more .
Parsing [sent. 15392 len. 6]: She needs no further escort .
Parsing [sent. 15393 len. 24]: The gate shuts upon its spring with a clash , and he leaves her passing on into the dark shade of some trees .
Parsing [sent. 15394 len. 15]: A fine night , and a bright large moon , and multitudes of stars .
Parsing [sent. 15395 len. 25]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , in repairing to his cellar and in opening and shutting those resounding doors , has to cross a little prison-like yard .
Parsing [sent. 15396 len. 22]: He looks up casually , thinking what a fine night , what a bright large moon , what multitudes of stars !
Parsing [sent. 15397 len. 6]: A quiet night , too .
Parsing [sent. 15398 len. 5]: A very quiet night .
Parsing [sent. 15399 len. 25]: When the moon shines very brilliantly , a solitude and stillness seem to proceed from her that influence even crowded places full of life .
Parsing [sent. 15400 len. 225]: Not only is it a still night on dusty high roads and on hill-summits , whence a wide expanse of country may be seen in repose , quieter and quieter as it spreads away into a fringe of trees against the sky with the grey ghost of a bloom upon them ; not only is it a still night in gardens and in woods , and on the river where the water-meadows are fresh and green , and the stream sparkles on among pleasant islands , murmuring weirs , and whispering rushes ; not only does the stillness attend it as it flows where houses cluster thick , where many bridges are reflected in it , where wharves and shipping make it black and awful , where it winds from these disfigurements through marshes whose grim beacons stand like skeletons washed ashore , where it expands through the bolder region of rising grounds , rich in cornfield wind-mill and steeple , and where it mingles with the ever-heaving sea ; not only is it a still night on the deep , and on the shore where the watcher stands to see the ship with her spread wings cross the path of light that appears to be presented to only him ; but even on this stranger 's wilderness of London there is some rest .
Parsing [sent. 15401 len. 48]: Its steeples and towers and its one great dome grow more ethereal ; its smoky house-tops lose their grossness in the pale effulgence ; the noises that arise from the streets are fewer and are softened , and the footsteps on the pavements pass more tranquilly away .
Parsing [sent. 15402 len. 67]: In these fields of Mr. Tulkinghorn 's inhabiting , where the shepherds play on Chancery pipes that have no stop , and keep their sheep in the fold by hook and by crook until they have shorn them exceeding close , every noise is merged , this moonlight night , into a distant ringing hum , as if the city were a vast glass , vibrating .
Parsing [sent. 15403 len. 4]: What 's that ?
Parsing [sent. 15404 len. 7]: Who fired a gun or pistol ?
Parsing [sent. 15405 len. 4]: Where was it ?
Parsing [sent. 15406 len. 12]: The few foot-passengers start , stop , and stare about them .
Parsing [sent. 15407 len. 14]: Some windows and doors are opened , and people come out to look .
Parsing [sent. 15408 len. 11]: It was a loud report and echoed and rattled heavily .
Parsing [sent. 15409 len. 14]: It shook one house , or so a man says who was passing .
Parsing [sent. 15410 len. 14]: It has aroused all the dogs in the neighbourhood , who bark vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 15411 len. 7]: Terrified cats scamper across the road .
Parsing [sent. 15412 len. 32]: While the dogs are yet barking and howling -- there is one dog howling like a demon -- the church-clocks , as if they were startled too , begin to strike .
Parsing [sent. 15413 len. 15]: The hum from the streets , likewise , seems to swell into a shout .
Parsing [sent. 15414 len. 6]: But it is soon over .
Parsing [sent. 15415 len. 14]: Before the last clock begins to strike ten , there is a lull .
Parsing [sent. 15416 len. 25]: When it has ceased , the fine night , the bright large moon , and multitudes of stars , are left at peace again .
Parsing [sent. 15417 len. 6]: Has Mr. Tulkinghorn been disturbed ?
Parsing [sent. 15418 len. 13]: His windows are dark and quiet , and his door is shut .
Parsing [sent. 15419 len. 14]: It must be something unusual indeed to bring him out of his shell .
Parsing [sent. 15420 len. 12]: Nothing is heard of him , nothing is seen of him .
Parsing [sent. 15421 len. 19]: What power of cannon might it take to shake that rusty old man out of his immovable composure ?
Parsing [sent. 15422 len. 19]: For many years the persistent Roman has been pointing , with no particular meaning , from that ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 15423 len. 14]: It is not likely that he has any new meaning in him to-night .
Parsing [sent. 15424 len. 19]: Once pointing , always pointing -- like any Roman , or even Briton , with a single idea .
Parsing [sent. 15425 len. 20]: There he is , no doubt , in his impossible attitude , pointing , unavailingly , all night long .
Parsing [sent. 15426 len. 10]: Moonlight , darkness , dawn , sunrise , day .
Parsing [sent. 15427 len. 14]: There he is still , eagerly pointing , and no one minds him .
Parsing [sent. 15428 len. 16]: But a little after the coming of the day come people to clean the rooms .
Parsing [sent. 15429 len. 45]: And either the Roman has some new meaning in him , not expressed before , or the foremost of them goes wild , for looking up at his outstretched hand and looking down at what is below it , that person shrieks and flies .
Parsing [sent. 15430 len. 25]: The others , looking in as the first one looked , shriek and fly too , and there is an alarm in the street .
Parsing [sent. 15431 len. 5]: What does it mean ?
Parsing [sent. 15432 len. 33]: No light is admitted into the darkened chamber , and people unaccustomed to it enter , and treading softly but heavily , carry a weight into the bedroom and lay it down .
Parsing [sent. 15433 len. 31]: There is whispering and wondering all day , strict search of every corner , careful tracing of steps , and careful noting of the disposition of every article of furniture .
Parsing [sent. 15434 len. 24]: All eyes look up at the Roman , and all voices murmur , `` If he could only tell what he saw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15435 len. 33]: He is pointing at a table with a bottle -LRB- nearly full of wine -RRB- and a glass upon it and two candles that were blown out suddenly soon after being lighted .
Parsing [sent. 15436 len. 25]: He is pointing at an empty chair and at a stain upon the ground before it that might be almost covered with a hand .
Parsing [sent. 15437 len. 8]: These objects lie directly within his range .
Parsing [sent. 15438 len. 59]: An excited imagination might suppose that there was something in them so terrific as to drive the rest of the composition , not only the attendant big-legged boys , but the clouds and flowers and pillars too -- in short , the very body and soul of Allegory , and all the brains it has -- stark mad .
Parsing [sent. 15439 len. 44]: It happens surely that every one who comes into the darkened room and looks at these things looks up at the Roman and that he is invested in all eyes with mystery and awe , as if he were a paralysed dumb witness .
Parsing [sent. 15440 len. 81]: So it shall happen surely , through many years to come , that ghostly stories shall be told of the stain upon the floor , so easy to be covered , so hard to be got out , and that the Roman , pointing from the ceiling shall point , so long as dust and damp and spiders spare him , with far greater significance than he ever had in Mr. Tulkinghorn 's time , and with a deadly meaning .
Parsing [sent. 15441 len. 46]: For Mr. Tulkinghorn 's time is over for evermore , and the Roman pointed at the murderous hand uplifted against his life , and pointed helplessly at him , from night to morning , lying face downward on the floor , shot through the heart .
Parsing [sent. 15442 len. 29]: Chapter XLIX -- Dutiful Friendship A great annual occasion has come round in the establishment of Mr. Matthew Bagnet , otherwise Lignum Vitae , ex-artilleryman and present bassoon-player .
Parsing [sent. 15443 len. 7]: An occasion of feasting and festival .
Parsing [sent. 15444 len. 9]: The celebration of a birthday in the family .
Parsing [sent. 15445 len. 8]: It is not Mr. Bagnet 's birthday .
Parsing [sent. 15446 len. 62]: Mr. Bagnet merely distinguishes that epoch in the musical instrument business by kissing the children with an extra smack before breakfast , smoking an additional pipe after dinner , and wondering towards evening what his poor old mother is thinking about it -- a subject of infinite speculation , and rendered so by his mother having departed this life twenty years .
Parsing [sent. 15447 len. 33]: Some men rarely revert to their father , but seem , in the bank-books of their remembrance , to have transferred all the stock of filial affection into their mother 's name .
Parsing [sent. 15448 len. 13]: Mr. Bagnet is one of like his trade the better for that .
Parsing [sent. 15449 len. 24]: If I had kept clear of his old girl causes him usually to make the noun-substantive `` goodness '' of the feminine gender .
Parsing [sent. 15450 len. 12]: It is not the birthday of one of the three children .
Parsing [sent. 15451 len. 23]: Those occasions are kept with some marks of distinction , but they rarely overleap the bounds of happy returns and a pudding .
Parsing [sent. 15452 len. 61]: On young Woolwich 's last birthday , Mr. Bagnet certainly did , after observing on his growth and general advancement , proceed , in a moment of profound reflection on the changes wrought by time , to examine him in the catechism , accomplishing with extreme accuracy the questions number one and two , `` What is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15453 len. 9]: and `` Who gave you that name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15454 len. 27]: but there failing in the exact precision of his memory and substituting for number three the question `` And how do you like that name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15455 len. 25]: which he propounded with a sense of its importance , in itself so edifying and improving as to give it quite an orthodox air .
Parsing [sent. 15456 len. 18]: This , however , was a speciality on that particular birthday , and not a general solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 15457 len. 23]: It is the old girl 's birthday , and that is the greatest holiday and reddest-letter day in Mr. Bagnet 's calendar .
Parsing [sent. 15458 len. 20]: The auspicious event is always commemorated according to certain forms settled and prescribed by Mr. Bagnet some years since .
Parsing [sent. 15459 len. 68]: Mr. Bagnet , being deeply convinced that to have a pair of fowls for dinner is to attain the highest pitch of imperial luxury , invariably goes forth himself very early in the morning of this day to buy a pair ; he is , as invariably , taken in by the vendor and installed in the possession of the oldest inhabitants of any coop in Europe .
Parsing [sent. 15460 len. 42]: Returning with these triumphs of toughness tied up in a clean blue and white cotton handkerchief -LRB- essential to the arrangements -RRB- , he in a casual manner invites Mrs. Bagnet to declare at breakfast what she would like for dinner .
Parsing [sent. 15461 len. 31]: Mrs. Bagnet , by a coincidence never known to fail , replying fowls , Mr. Bagnet instantly produces his bundle from a place of concealment amidst general amazement and rejoicing .
Parsing [sent. 15462 len. 30]: He further requires that the old girl shall do nothing all day long but sit in her very best gown and be served by himself and the young people .
Parsing [sent. 15463 len. 39]: As he is not illustrious for his cookery , this may be supposed to be a matter of state rather than enjoyment on the old girl 's part , but she keeps her state with all imaginable cheerfulness .
Parsing [sent. 15464 len. 13]: On this present birthday , Mr. Bagnet has accomplished the usual preliminaries .
Parsing [sent. 15465 len. 83]: He has bought two specimens of poultry , which , if there be any truth in adages , were certainly not caught with chaff , to be prepared for the spit ; he has amazed and rejoiced the family by their unlooked-for production ; he is himself directing the roasting of the poultry ; and Mrs. Bagnet , with her wholesome brown fingers itching to prevent what she sees going wrong , sits in her gown of ceremony , an honoured guest .
Parsing [sent. 15466 len. 27]: Quebec and Malta lay the cloth for dinner , while Woolwich , serving , as beseems him , under his father , keeps the fowls revolving .
Parsing [sent. 15467 len. 28]: To these young scullions Mrs. Bagnet occasionally imparts a wink , or a shake of the head , or a crooked face , as they made mistakes .
Parsing [sent. 15468 len. 7]: `` At half after one . ''
Parsing [sent. 15469 len. 4]: Says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15470 len. 5]: `` To the minute .
Parsing [sent. 15471 len. 6]: They 'll be done . ''
Parsing [sent. 15472 len. 21]: Mrs. Bagnet , with anguish , beholds one of them at a standstill before the fire and beginning to burn .
Parsing [sent. 15473 len. 15]: `` You shall have a dinner , old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15474 len. 7]: `` Fit for a queen . ''
Parsing [sent. 15475 len. 73]: Mrs. Bagnet shows her white teeth cheerfully , but to the perception of her son , betrays so much uneasiness of spirit that he is impelled by the dictates of affection to ask her , with his eyes , what is the matter , thus standing , with his eyes wide open , more oblivious of the fowls than before , and not affording the least hope of a return to consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 15476 len. 23]: Fortunately his elder sister perceives the cause of the agitation in Mrs. Bagnet 's breast and with an admonitory poke recalls him .
Parsing [sent. 15477 len. 19]: The stopped fowls going round again , Mrs. Bagnet closes her eyes in the intensity of her relief .
Parsing [sent. 15478 len. 12]: `` George will look us up , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15479 len. 6]: `` At half after four .
Parsing [sent. 15480 len. 4]: To the moment .
Parsing [sent. 15481 len. 7]: How many years , old girl .
Parsing [sent. 15482 len. 6]: Has George looked us up .
Parsing [sent. 15483 len. 4]: This afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15484 len. 24]: `` Ah , Lignum , Lignum , as many as make an old woman of a young one , I begin to think .
Parsing [sent. 15485 len. 19]: Just about that , and no less , '' returns Mrs. Bagnet , laughing and shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 15486 len. 13]: `` Old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet , `` never mind .
Parsing [sent. 15487 len. 10]: You 'd be as young as ever you was .
Parsing [sent. 15488 len. 6]: If you was n't younger .
Parsing [sent. 15489 len. 4]: Which you are .
Parsing [sent. 15490 len. 5]: As everybody knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 15491 len. 30]: Quebec and Malta here exclaim , with clapping of hands , that Bluffy is sure to bring mother something , and begin to speculate on what it will be .
Parsing [sent. 15492 len. 25]: `` Do you know , Lignum , '' says Mrs. Bagnet , casting a glance on the table-cloth , and winking `` salt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15493 len. 31]: at Malta with her right eye , and shaking the pepper away from Quebec with her head , `` I begin to think George is in the roving way again .
Parsing [sent. 15494 len. 13]: `` George , '' returns Mr. Bagnet , `` will never desert .
Parsing [sent. 15495 len. 6]: And leave his old comrade .
Parsing [sent. 15496 len. 4]: In the lurch .
Parsing [sent. 15497 len. 8]: Do n't be afraid of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 15498 len. 5]: `` No , Lignum .
Parsing [sent. 15499 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 15500 len. 7]: I do n't say he will .
Parsing [sent. 15501 len. 7]: I do n't think he will .
Parsing [sent. 15502 len. 20]: But if he could get over this money trouble of his , I believe he would be off . ''
Parsing [sent. 15503 len. 5]: Mr. Bagnet asks why .
Parsing [sent. 15504 len. 25]: `` Well , '' returns his wife , considering , `` George seems to me to be getting not a little impatient and restless .
Parsing [sent. 15505 len. 13]: I do n't say but what he 's as free as ever .
Parsing [sent. 15506 len. 22]: Of course he must be free or he would n't be George , but he smarts and seems put out . ''
Parsing [sent. 15507 len. 10]: `` He 's extra-drilled , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15508 len. 5]: `` By a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 15509 len. 8]: Who would put the devil out . ''
Parsing [sent. 15510 len. 21]: `` There 's something in that , '' his wife assents ; `` but so it is , Lignum . ''
Parsing [sent. 15511 len. 65]: Further conversation is prevented , for the time , by the necessity under which Mr. Bagnet finds himself of directing the whole force of his mind to the dinner , which is a little endangered by the dry humour of the fowls in not yielding any gravy , and also by the made gravy acquiring no flavour and turning out of a flaxen complexion .
Parsing [sent. 15512 len. 32]: With a similar perverseness , the potatoes crumble off forks in the process of peeling , upheaving from their centres in every direction , as if they were subject to earthquakes .
Parsing [sent. 15513 len. 19]: The legs of the fowls , too , are longer than could be desired , and extremely scaly .
Parsing [sent. 15514 len. 34]: Overcoming these disadvantages to the best of his ability , Mr. Bagnet at last dishes and they sit down at table , Mrs. Bagnet occupying the guest 's place at his right hand .
Parsing [sent. 15515 len. 27]: It is well for the old girl that she has but one birthday in a year , for two such indulgences in poultry might be injurious .
Parsing [sent. 15516 len. 28]: Every kind of finer tendon and ligament that is in the nature of poultry to possess is developed in these specimens in the singular form of guitar-strings .
Parsing [sent. 15517 len. 22]: Their limbs appear to have struck roots into their breasts and bodies , as aged trees strike roots into the earth .
Parsing [sent. 15518 len. 33]: Their legs are so hard as to encourage the idea that they must have devoted the greater part of their long and arduous lives to pedestrian exercises and the walking of matches .
Parsing [sent. 15519 len. 63]: But Mr. Bagnet , unconscious of these little defects , sets his heart on Mrs. Bagnet eating a most severe quantity of the delicacies before her ; and as that good old girl would not cause him a moment 's disappointment on any day , least of all on such a day , for any consideration , she imperils her digestion fearfully .
Parsing [sent. 15520 len. 22]: How young Woolwich cleans the drum-sticks without being of ostrich descent , his anxious mother is at a loss to understand .
Parsing [sent. 15521 len. 39]: The old girl has another trial to undergo after the conclusion of the repast in sitting in state to see the room cleared , the hearth swept , and the dinner-service washed up and polished in the backyard .
Parsing [sent. 15522 len. 52]: The great delight and energy with which the two young ladies apply themselves to these duties , turning up their skirts in imitation of their mother and skating in and out on little scaffolds of pattens , inspire the highest hopes for the future , but some anxiety for the present .
Parsing [sent. 15523 len. 63]: The same causes lead to confusion of tongues , a clattering of crockery , a rattling of tin mugs , a whisking of brooms , and an expenditure of water , all in excess , while the saturation of the young ladies themselves is almost too moving a spectacle for Mrs. Bagnet to look upon with the calmness proper to her position .
Parsing [sent. 15524 len. 57]: At last the various cleansing processes are triumphantly completed ; Quebec and Malta appear in fresh attire , smiling and dry ; pipes , tobacco , and something to drink are placed upon the table ; and the old girl enjoys the first peace of mind she ever knows on the day of this delightful entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 15525 len. 33]: When Mr. Bagnet takes his usual seat , the hands of the clock are very near to half-past four ; as they mark it accurately , Mr. Bagnet announces , `` George !
Parsing [sent. 15526 len. 4]: Military time . ''
Parsing [sent. 15527 len. 33]: It is George , and he has hearty congratulations for the old girl -LRB- whom he kisses on the great occasion -RRB- , and for the children , and for Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15528 len. 7]: `` Happy returns to all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15529 len. 4]: says Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 15530 len. 9]: `` But , George , old man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15531 len. 9]: cries Mrs. Bagnet , looking at him curiously .
Parsing [sent. 15532 len. 8]: `` What 's come to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15533 len. 6]: `` Come to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15534 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 15535 len. 15]: You are so white , George -- for you -- and look so shocked .
Parsing [sent. 15536 len. 8]: Now do n't he , Lignum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15537 len. 14]: `` George , '' says Mr. Bagnet , `` tell the old girl .
Parsing [sent. 15538 len. 6]: What 's the matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 15539 len. 38]: `` I did n't know I looked white , '' says the trooper , passing his hand over his brow , `` and I did n't know I looked shocked , and I 'm sorry I do .
Parsing [sent. 15540 len. 27]: But the truth is , that boy who was taken in at my place died yesterday afternoon , and it has rather knocked me over . ''
Parsing [sent. 15541 len. 5]: `` Poor creetur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15542 len. 9]: says Mrs. Bagnet with a mother 's pity .
Parsing [sent. 15543 len. 5]: `` Is he gone ?
Parsing [sent. 15544 len. 5]: Dear , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15545 len. 35]: `` I did n't mean to say anything about it , for it 's not birthday talk , but you have got it out of me , you see , before I sit down .
Parsing [sent. 15546 len. 31]: I should have roused up in a minute , '' says the trooper , making himself speak more gaily , `` but you 're so quick , Mrs. Bagnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 15547 len. 5]: `` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 15548 len. 9]: The old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15549 len. 5]: `` Is as quick .
Parsing [sent. 15550 len. 4]: As powder . ''
Parsing [sent. 15551 len. 26]: `` And what 's more , she 's the subject of the day , and we 'll stick to her , '' cries Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 15552 len. 14]: `` See here , I have brought a little brooch along with me .
Parsing [sent. 15553 len. 15]: It 's a poor thing , you know , but it 's a keepsake .
Parsing [sent. 15554 len. 12]: That 's all the good it is , Mrs. Bagnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 15555 len. 30]: Mr. George produces his present , which is greeted with admiring leapings and clappings by the young family , and with a species of reverential admiration by Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15556 len. 9]: `` Old girl , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15557 len. 9]: `` Tell him my opinion of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 15558 len. 11]: `` Why , it 's a wonder , George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15559 len. 4]: Mrs. Bagnet exclaims .
Parsing [sent. 15560 len. 12]: `` It 's the beautifullest thing that ever was seen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15561 len. 4]: `` Good ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15562 len. 4]: says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15563 len. 5]: `` My opinion . ''
Parsing [sent. 15564 len. 37]: `` It 's so pretty , George , '' cries Mrs. Bagnet , turning it on all sides and holding it out at arm 's length , `` that it seems too choice for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 15565 len. 4]: `` Bad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15566 len. 4]: says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15567 len. 6]: `` Not my opinlon . ''
Parsing [sent. 15568 len. 67]: `` But whatever it is , a hundred thousand thanks , old fellow , '' says Mrs. Bagnet , her eyes sparkling with pleasure and her hand stretched out to him ; `` and though I have been a crossgrained soldier 's wife to you sometimes , George , we are as strong friends , I am sure , in reality , as ever can be .
Parsing [sent. 15569 len. 19]: Now you shall fasten it on yourself , for good luck , if you will , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 15570 len. 63]: The children close up to see it done , and Mr. Bagnet looks over young Woolwich 's head to see it done with an interest so maturely wooden , yet pleasantly childish , that Mrs. Bagnet can not help laughing in her airy way and saying , `` Oh , Lignum , Lignum , what a precious old chap you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15571 len. 9]: But the trooper fails to fasten the brooch .
Parsing [sent. 15572 len. 13]: His hand shakes , he is nervous , and it falls off .
Parsing [sent. 15573 len. 8]: `` Would any one believe this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15574 len. 12]: says he , catching it as it drops and looking round .
Parsing [sent. 15575 len. 18]: `` I am so out of sorts that I bungle at an easy job like this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15576 len. 45]: Mrs. Bagnet concludes that for such a case there is no remedy like a pipe , and fastening the brooch herself in a twinkling , causes the trooper to be inducted into his usual snug place and the pipes to be got into action .
Parsing [sent. 15577 len. 38]: `` If that do n't bring you round , George , '' says she , `` just throw your eye across here at your present now and then , and the two together MUST do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 15578 len. 23]: `` You ought to do it of yourself , '' George answers ; `` I know that very well , Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15579 len. 22]: I 'll tell you how , one way and another , the blues have got to be too many for me .
Parsing [sent. 15580 len. 6]: Here was this poor lad .
Parsing [sent. 15581 len. 21]: 'T was dull work to see him dying as he did , and not be able to help him . ''
Parsing [sent. 15582 len. 8]: `` What do you mean , George ?
Parsing [sent. 15583 len. 5]: You did help him .
Parsing [sent. 15584 len. 8]: You took him under your roof . ''
Parsing [sent. 15585 len. 12]: `` I helped him so far , but that 's little .
Parsing [sent. 15586 len. 28]: I mean , Mrs. Bagnet , there he was , dying without ever having been taught much more than to know his right hand from his left .
Parsing [sent. 15587 len. 14]: And he was too far gone to be helped out of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 15588 len. 7]: `` Ah , poor creetur ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15589 len. 4]: says Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15590 len. 34]: `` Then , '' says the trooper , not yet lighting his pipe , and passing his heavy hand over his hair , `` that brought up Gridley in a man 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 15591 len. 12]: His was a bad case too , in a different way .
Parsing [sent. 15592 len. 23]: Then the two got mixed up in a man 's mind with a flinty old rascal who had to do with both .
Parsing [sent. 15593 len. 42]: And to think of that rusty carbine , stock and barrel , standing up on end in his corner , hard , indifferent , taking everything so evenly -- it made flesh and blood tingle , I do assure you . ''
Parsing [sent. 15594 len. 22]: `` My advice to you , '' returns Mrs. Bagnet , `` is to light your pipe and tingle that way .
Parsing [sent. 15595 len. 14]: It 's wholesomer and comfortabler , and better for the health altogether . ''
Parsing [sent. 15596 len. 18]: `` You 're right , '' says the trooper , `` and I 'll do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 15597 len. 47]: So he does it , though still with an indignant gravity that impresses the young Bagnets , and even causes Mr. Bagnet to defer the ceremony of drinking Mrs. Bagnet 's health , always given by himself on these occasions in a speech of exemplary terseness .
Parsing [sent. 15598 len. 45]: But the young ladies having composed what Mr. Bagnet is in the habit of calling `` the mixtur , '' and George 's pipe being now in a glow , Mr. Bagnet considers it his duty to proceed to the toast of the evening .
Parsing [sent. 15599 len. 10]: He addresses the assembled company in the following terms .
Parsing [sent. 15600 len. 3]: `` George .
Parsing [sent. 15601 len. 2]: Woolwich .
Parsing [sent. 15602 len. 2]: Quebec .
Parsing [sent. 15603 len. 2]: Malta .
Parsing [sent. 15604 len. 5]: This is her birthday .
Parsing [sent. 15605 len. 6]: Take a day 's march .
Parsing [sent. 15606 len. 8]: And you wo n't find such another .
Parsing [sent. 15607 len. 6]: Here 's towards her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15608 len. 20]: The toast having been drunk with enthusiasm , Mrs. Bagnet returns thanks in a neat address of corresponding brevity .
Parsing [sent. 15609 len. 15]: This model composition is limited to the three words `` And wishing yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15610 len. 21]: which the old girl follows up with a nod at everybody in succession and a well-regulated swig of the mixture .
Parsing [sent. 15611 len. 24]: This she again follows up , on the present occasion , by the wholly unexpected exclamation , `` Here 's a man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15612 len. 20]: Here IS a man , much to the astonishment of the little company , looking in at the parlour-door .
Parsing [sent. 15613 len. 39]: He is a sharp-eyed man -- a quick keen man -- and he takes in everybody 's look at him , all at once , individually and collectively , in a manner that stamps him a remarkable man .
Parsing [sent. 15614 len. 18]: `` George , '' says the man , nodding , `` how do you find yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15615 len. 8]: `` Why , it 's Bucket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15616 len. 4]: cries Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 15617 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' says the man , coming in and closing the door .
Parsing [sent. 15618 len. 66]: `` I was going down the street here when I happened to stop and look in at the musical instruments in the shop-window -- a friend of mine is in want of a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone -- and I saw a party enjoying themselves , and I thought it was you in the corner ; I thought I could n't be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 15619 len. 14]: How goes the world with you , George , at the present moment ?
Parsing [sent. 15620 len. 3]: Pretty smooth ?
Parsing [sent. 15621 len. 6]: And with you , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 15622 len. 6]: And with you , governor ?
Parsing [sent. 15623 len. 18]: And Lord , '' says Mr. Bucket , opening his arms , `` here 's children too !
Parsing [sent. 15624 len. 13]: You may do anything with me if you only show me children .
Parsing [sent. 15625 len. 8]: Give us a kiss , my pets .
Parsing [sent. 15626 len. 11]: No occasion to inquire who YOUR father and mother is .
Parsing [sent. 15627 len. 10]: Never saw such a likeness in my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15628 len. 23]: Mr. Bucket , not unwelcome , has sat himself down next to Mr. George and taken Quebec and Malta on his knees .
Parsing [sent. 15629 len. 26]: `` You pretty dears , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` give us another kiss ; it 's the only thing I 'm greedy in .
Parsing [sent. 15630 len. 9]: Lord bless you , how healthy you look !
Parsing [sent. 15631 len. 12]: And what may be the ages of these two , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 15632 len. 15]: I should put 'em down at the figures of about eight and ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 15633 len. 13]: `` You 're very near , sir , '' says Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15634 len. 18]: `` I generally am near , '' returns Mr. Bucket , `` being so fond of children .
Parsing [sent. 15635 len. 29]: A friend of mine has had nineteen of 'em , ma'am , all by one mother , and she 's still as fresh and rosy as the morning .
Parsing [sent. 15636 len. 18]: Not so much so as yourself , but , upon my soul , she comes near you !
Parsing [sent. 15637 len. 11]: And what do you call these , my darling ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15638 len. 9]: pursues Mr. Bucket , pinching Malta 's cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 15639 len. 8]: `` These are peaches , these are .
Parsing [sent. 15640 len. 4]: Bless your heart !
Parsing [sent. 15641 len. 8]: And what do you think about father ?
Parsing [sent. 15642 len. 22]: Do you think father could recommend a second-hand wiolinceller of a good tone for Mr. Bucket 's friend , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 15643 len. 5]: My name 's Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15644 len. 8]: Ai n't that a funny name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15645 len. 9]: These blandishments have entirely won the family heart .
Parsing [sent. 15646 len. 24]: Mrs. Bagnet forgets the day to the extent of filling a pipe and a glass for Mr. Bucket and waiting upon him hospitably .
Parsing [sent. 15647 len. 45]: She would be glad to receive so pleasant a character under any circumstances , but she tells him that as a friend of George 's she is particularly glad to see him this evening , for George has not been in his usual spirits .
Parsing [sent. 15648 len. 8]: `` Not in his usual spirits ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15649 len. 4]: exclaims Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15650 len. 11]: `` Why , I never heard of such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 15651 len. 7]: What 's the matter , George ?
Parsing [sent. 15652 len. 14]: You do n't intend to tell me you 've been out of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 15653 len. 9]: What should you be out of spirits for ?
Parsing [sent. 15654 len. 13]: You have n't got anything on your mind , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 15655 len. 9]: `` Nothing particular , '' returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 15656 len. 11]: `` I should think not , '' rejoins Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15657 len. 12]: `` What could you have on your mind , you know !
Parsing [sent. 15658 len. 12]: And have these pets got anything on THEIR minds , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 15659 len. 28]: Not they , but they 'll be upon the minds of some of the young fellows , some of these days , and make 'em precious low-spirited .
Parsing [sent. 15660 len. 18]: I ai n't much of a prophet , but I can tell you that , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 15661 len. 16]: Mrs. Bagnet , quite charmed , hopes Mr. Bucket has a family of his own .
Parsing [sent. 15662 len. 6]: `` There , ma'am ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15663 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15664 len. 6]: `` Would you believe it ?
Parsing [sent. 15665 len. 6]: No , I have n't .
Parsing [sent. 15666 len. 9]: My wife and a lodger constitute my family .
Parsing [sent. 15667 len. 19]: Mrs. Bucket is as fond of children as myself and as wishful to have 'em , but no .
Parsing [sent. 15668 len. 4]: So it is .
Parsing [sent. 15669 len. 12]: Worldly goods are divided unequally , and man must not repine .
Parsing [sent. 15670 len. 8]: What a very nice backyard , ma'am !
Parsing [sent. 15671 len. 10]: Any way out of that yard , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15672 len. 9]: There is no way out of that yard .
Parsing [sent. 15673 len. 7]: `` Ai n't there really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15674 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15675 len. 10]: `` I should have thought there might have been .
Parsing [sent. 15676 len. 18]: Well , I do n't know as I ever saw a backyard that took my fancy more .
Parsing [sent. 15677 len. 9]: Would you allow me to look at it ?
Parsing [sent. 15678 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15679 len. 10]: No , I see there 's no way out .
Parsing [sent. 15680 len. 10]: But what a very good-proportioned yard it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15681 len. 29]: Having cast his sharp eye all about it , Mr. Bucket returns to his chair next his friend Mr. George and pats Mr. George affectionately on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 15682 len. 10]: `` How are your spirits now , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15683 len. 10]: `` All right now , '' returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 15684 len. 7]: `` That 's your sort ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15685 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15686 len. 9]: `` Why should you ever have been otherwise ?
Parsing [sent. 15687 len. 17]: A man of your fine figure and constitution has no right to be out of spirits .
Parsing [sent. 15688 len. 16]: That ai n't a chest to be out of spirits , is it , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 15689 len. 24]: And you have n't got anything on your mind , you know , George ; what could you have on your mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15690 len. 40]: Somewhat harping on this phrase , considering the extent and variety of his conversational powers , Mr. Bucket twice or thrice repeats it to the pipe he lights , and with a listening face that is particularly his own .
Parsing [sent. 15691 len. 16]: But the sun of his sociality soon recovers from this brief eclipse and shines again .
Parsing [sent. 15692 len. 13]: `` And this is brother , is it , my dears ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15693 len. 18]: says Mr. Bucket , referring to Quebec and Malta for information on the subject of young Woolwich .
Parsing [sent. 15694 len. 14]: `` And a nice brother he is -- half-brother I mean to say .
Parsing [sent. 15695 len. 13]: For he 's too old to be your boy , ma'am . ''
Parsing [sent. 15696 len. 22]: `` I can certify at all events that he is not anybody else 's , '' returns Mrs. Bagnet , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 15697 len. 8]: `` Well , you do surprise me !
Parsing [sent. 15698 len. 11]: Yet he 's like you , there 's no denying .
Parsing [sent. 15699 len. 8]: Lord , he 's wonderfully like you !
Parsing [sent. 15700 len. 19]: But about what you may call the brow , you know , THERE his father comes out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15701 len. 19]: Mr. Bucket compares the faces with one eye shut up , while Mr. Bagnet smokes in stolid satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 15702 len. 18]: This is an opportunity for Mrs. Bagnet to inform him that the boy is George 's godson .
Parsing [sent. 15703 len. 9]: `` George 's godson , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15704 len. 7]: rejoins Mr. Bucket with extreme cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 15705 len. 12]: `` I must shake hands over again with George 's godson .
Parsing [sent. 15706 len. 9]: Godfather and godson do credit to one another .
Parsing [sent. 15707 len. 12]: And what do you intend to make of him , ma'am ?
Parsing [sent. 15708 len. 11]: Does he show any turn for any musical instrument ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15709 len. 10]: Mr. Bagnet suddenly interposes , `` Plays the fife .
Parsing [sent. 15710 len. 3]: Beautiful . ''
Parsing [sent. 15711 len. 31]: `` Would you believe it , governor , '' says Mr. Bucket , struck by the coincidence , `` that when I was a boy I played the fife myself ?
Parsing [sent. 15712 len. 16]: Not in a scientific way , as I expect he does , but by ear .
Parsing [sent. 15713 len. 4]: Lord bless you !
Parsing [sent. 15714 len. 15]: ` British Grenadiers ' -- there 's a tune to warm an Englishman up !
Parsing [sent. 15715 len. 14]: COULD you give us ` British Grenadiers , ' my fine fellow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15716 len. 54]: Nothing could be more acceptable to the little circle than this call upon young Woolwich , who immediately fetches his fife and performs the stirring melody , during which performance Mr. Bucket , much enlivened , beats time and never falls to come in sharp with the burden , `` British Gra-a-anadeers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15717 len. 29]: In short , he shows so much musical taste that Mr. Bagnet actually takes his pipe from his lips to express his conviction that he is a singer .
Parsing [sent. 15718 len. 47]: Mr. Bucket receives the harmonious impeachment so modestly , confessing how that he did once chaunt a little , for the expression of the feelings of his own bosom , and with no presumptuous idea of entertaining his friends , that he is asked to sing .
Parsing [sent. 15719 len. 28]: Not to be behindhand in the sociality of the evening , he complies and gives them `` Believe Me , if All Those Endearing Young Charms . ''
Parsing [sent. 15720 len. 51]: This ballad , he informs Mrs. Bagnet , he considers to have been his most powerful ally in moving the heart of Mrs. Bucket when a maiden , and inducing her to approach the altar -- Mr. Bucket 's own words are `` to come up to the scratch . ''
Parsing [sent. 15721 len. 42]: This sparkling stranger is such a new and agreeable feature in the evening that Mr. George , who testified no great emotions of pleasure on his entrance , begins , in spite of himself , to be rather proud of him .
Parsing [sent. 15722 len. 32]: He is so friendly , is a man of so many resources , and so easy to get on with , that it is something to have made him known there .
Parsing [sent. 15723 len. 32]: Mr. Bagnet becomes , after another pipe , so sensible of the value of his acquaintance that he solicits the honour of his company on the old girl 's next birthday .
Parsing [sent. 15724 len. 30]: If anything can more closely cement and consolidate the esteem which Mr. Bucket has formed for the family , it is the discovery of the nature of the occasion .
Parsing [sent. 15725 len. 60]: He drinks to Mrs. Bagnet with a warmth approaching to rapture , engages himself for that day twelvemonth more than thankfully , makes a memorandum of the day in a large black pocket-book with a girdle to it , and breathes a hope that Mrs. Bucket and Mrs. Bagnet may before then become , in a manner , sisters .
Parsing [sent. 15726 len. 13]: As he says himself , what is public life without private ties ?
Parsing [sent. 15727 len. 22]: He is in his humble way a public man , but it is not in that sphere that he finds happiness .
Parsing [sent. 15728 len. 13]: No , it must be sought within the confines of domestic bliss .
Parsing [sent. 15729 len. 30]: It is natural , under these circumstances , that he , in his turn , should remember the friend to whom he is indebted for so promising an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 15730 len. 4]: And he does .
Parsing [sent. 15731 len. 7]: He keeps very close to him .
Parsing [sent. 15732 len. 15]: Whatever the subject of the conversation , he keeps a tender eye upon him .
Parsing [sent. 15733 len. 8]: He waits to walk home with him .
Parsing [sent. 15734 len. 22]: He is interested in his very boots and observes even them attentively as Mr. George sits smoking cross-legged in the chimney-corner .
Parsing [sent. 15735 len. 8]: At length Mr. George rises to depart .
Parsing [sent. 15736 len. 17]: At the same moment Mr. Bucket , with the secret sympathy of friendship , also rises .
Parsing [sent. 15737 len. 20]: He dotes upon the children to the last and remembers the commission he has undertaken for an absent friend .
Parsing [sent. 15738 len. 17]: `` Respecting that second-hand wiolinceller , governor -- could you recommend me such a thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15739 len. 8]: `` Scores , '' says Mr. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 15740 len. 16]: `` I am obliged to you , '' returns Mr. Bucket , squeezing his hand .
Parsing [sent. 15741 len. 8]: `` You 're a friend in need .
Parsing [sent. 15742 len. 7]: A good tone , mind you !
Parsing [sent. 15743 len. 9]: My friend is a regular dab at it .
Parsing [sent. 15744 len. 20]: Ecod , he saws away at Mozart and Handel and the rest of the big-wigs like a thorough workman .
Parsing [sent. 15745 len. 30]: And you need n't , '' says Mr. Bucket in a considerate and private voice , `` you need n't commit yourself to too low a figure , governor .
Parsing [sent. 15746 len. 32]: I do n't want to pay too large a price for my friend , but I want you to have your proper percentage and be remunerated for your loss of time .
Parsing [sent. 15747 len. 5]: That is but fair .
Parsing [sent. 15748 len. 11]: Every man must live , and ought to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 15749 len. 21]: Mr. Bagnet shakes his head at the old girl to the effect that they have found a jewel of price .
Parsing [sent. 15750 len. 20]: `` Suppose I was to give you a look in , say , at half arter ten to-morrow morning .
Parsing [sent. 15751 len. 16]: Perhaps you could name the figures of a few wiolincellers of a good tone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15752 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 15753 len. 3]: Nothing easier .
Parsing [sent. 15754 len. 31]: Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet both engage to have the requisite information ready and even hint to each other at the practicability of having a small stock collected there for approval .
Parsing [sent. 15755 len. 13]: `` Thank you , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` thank you .
Parsing [sent. 15756 len. 5]: Good night , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 15757 len. 5]: Good night , governor .
Parsing [sent. 15758 len. 5]: Good night , darlings .
Parsing [sent. 15759 len. 20]: I am much obliged to you for one of the pleasantest evenings I ever spent in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 15760 len. 35]: They , on the contrary , are much obliged to him for the pleasure he has given them in his company ; and so they part with many expressions of goodwill on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 15761 len. 24]: `` Now George , old boy , '' says Mr. Bucket , taking his arm at the shop-door , `` come along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15762 len. 45]: As they go down the little street and the Bagnets pause for a minute looking after them , Mrs. Bagnet remarks to the worthy Lignum that Mr. Bucket `` almost clings to George like , and seems to be really fond of him . ''
Parsing [sent. 15763 len. 23]: The neighbouring streets being narrow and ill-paved , it is a little inconvenient to walk there two abreast and arm in arm .
Parsing [sent. 15764 len. 9]: Mr. George therefore soon proposes to walk singly .
Parsing [sent. 15765 len. 27]: But Mr. Bucket , who can not make up his mind to relinquish his friendly hold , replies , `` Wait half a minute , George .
Parsing [sent. 15766 len. 10]: I should wish to speak to you first . ''
Parsing [sent. 15767 len. 27]: Immediately afterwards , he twists him into a public-house and into a parlour , where he confronts him and claps his own back against the door .
Parsing [sent. 15768 len. 20]: `` Now , George , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` duty is duty , and friendship is friendship .
Parsing [sent. 15769 len. 13]: I never want the two to clash if I can help it .
Parsing [sent. 15770 len. 23]: I have endeavoured to make things pleasant to-night , and I put it to you whether I have done it or not .
Parsing [sent. 15771 len. 10]: You must consider yourself in custody , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 15772 len. 3]: `` Custody ?
Parsing [sent. 15773 len. 4]: What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15774 len. 6]: returns the trooper , thunderstruck .
Parsing [sent. 15775 len. 42]: `` Now , George , '' says Mr. Bucket , urging a sensible view of the case upon him with his fat forefinger , `` duty , as you know very well , is one thing , and conversation is another .
Parsing [sent. 15776 len. 22]: It 's my duty to inform you that any observations you may make will be liable to be used against you .
Parsing [sent. 15777 len. 10]: Therefore , George , be careful what you say .
Parsing [sent. 15778 len. 12]: You do n't happen to have heard of a murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15779 len. 4]: `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15780 len. 31]: `` Now , George , '' says Mr. Bucket , keeping his forefinger in an impressive state of action , `` bear in mind what I 've said to you .
Parsing [sent. 15781 len. 5]: I ask you nothing .
Parsing [sent. 15782 len. 9]: You 've been in low spirits this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 15783 len. 15]: I say , you do n't happen to have heard of a murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15784 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 15785 len. 8]: Where has there been a murder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15786 len. 19]: `` Now , George , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` do n't you go and commit yourself .
Parsing [sent. 15787 len. 12]: I 'm a-going to tell you what I want you for .
Parsing [sent. 15788 len. 18]: There has been a murder in Lincoln 's Inn Fields -- gentleman of the name of Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 15789 len. 6]: He was shot last night .
Parsing [sent. 15790 len. 7]: I want you for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 15791 len. 26]: The trooper sinks upon a seat behind him , and great drops start out upon his forehead , and a deadly pallor overspreads his face .
Parsing [sent. 15792 len. 3]: `` Bucket !
Parsing [sent. 15793 len. 17]: It 's not possible that Mr. Tulkinghorn has been killed and that you suspect ME ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15794 len. 25]: `` George , '' returns Mr. Bucket , keeping his forefinger going , `` it is certainly possible , because it 's the case .
Parsing [sent. 15795 len. 10]: This deed was done last night at ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 15796 len. 26]: Now , you know where you were last night at ten o'clock , and you 'll be able to prove it , no doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 15797 len. 4]: `` Last night !
Parsing [sent. 15798 len. 4]: Last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15799 len. 5]: repeats the trooper thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 15800 len. 6]: Then it flashes upon him .
Parsing [sent. 15801 len. 13]: `` Why , great heaven , I was there last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15802 len. 16]: `` So I have understood , George , '' returns Mr. Bucket with great deliberation .
Parsing [sent. 15803 len. 6]: `` So I have understood .
Parsing [sent. 15804 len. 8]: Likewise you 've been very often there .
Parsing [sent. 15805 len. 63]: You 've been seen hanging about the place , and you 've been heard more than once in a wrangle with him , and it 's possible -- I do n't say it 's certainly so , mind you , but it 's possible -- that he may have been heard to call you a threatening , murdering , dangerous fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 15806 len. 15]: The trooper gasps as if he would admit it all if he could speak .
Parsing [sent. 15807 len. 47]: `` Now , George , '' continues Mr. Bucket , putting his hat upon the table with an air of business rather in the upholstery way than otherwise , `` my wish is , as it has been all the evening , to make things pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 15808 len. 23]: I tell you plainly there 's a reward out , of a hundred guineas , offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Parsing [sent. 15809 len. 41]: You and me have always been pleasant together ; but I have got a duty to discharge ; and if that hundred guineas is to be made , it may as well be made by me as any other man .
Parsing [sent. 15810 len. 32]: On all of which accounts , I should hope it was clear to you that I must have you , and that I 'm damned if I do n't have you .
Parsing [sent. 15811 len. 15]: Am I to call in any assistance , or is the trick done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15812 len. 12]: Mr. George has recovered himself and stands up like a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 15813 len. 13]: `` Come , '' he says ; `` I am ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 15814 len. 14]: `` George , '' continues Mr. Bucket , `` wait a bit ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15815 len. 27]: With his upholsterer manner , as if the trooper were a window to be fitted up , he takes from his pocket a pair of handcuffs .
Parsing [sent. 15816 len. 16]: `` This is a serious charge , George , and such is my duty . ''
Parsing [sent. 15817 len. 25]: The trooper flushes angrily and hesitates a moment , but holds out his two hands , clasped together , and says , `` There !
Parsing [sent. 15818 len. 5]: Put them on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15819 len. 8]: Mr. Bucket adjusts them in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 15820 len. 7]: `` How do you find them ?
Parsing [sent. 15821 len. 4]: Are they comfortable ?
Parsing [sent. 15822 len. 32]: If not , say so , for I wish to make things as pleasant as is consistent with my duty , and I 've got another pair in my pocket . ''
Parsing [sent. 15823 len. 24]: This remark he offers like a most respectable tradesman anxious to execute an order neatly and to the perfect satisfaction of his customer .
Parsing [sent. 15824 len. 8]: `` They 'll do as they are ?
Parsing [sent. 15825 len. 3]: Very well !
Parsing [sent. 15826 len. 43]: Now , you see , George '' -- he takes a cloak from a corner and begins adjusting it about the trooper 's neck -- `` I was mindful of your feelings when I come out , and brought this on purpose .
Parsing [sent. 15827 len. 2]: There !
Parsing [sent. 15828 len. 6]: Who 's the wiser ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15829 len. 31]: `` Only I , '' returns the trooper , `` but as I know it , do me one more good turn and pull my hat over my eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 15830 len. 5]: `` Really , though !
Parsing [sent. 15831 len. 5]: Do you mean it ?
Parsing [sent. 15832 len. 6]: Ai n't it a pity ?
Parsing [sent. 15833 len. 5]: It looks so . ''
Parsing [sent. 15834 len. 21]: `` I ca n't look chance men in the face with these things on , '' Mr. George hurriedly replies .
Parsing [sent. 15835 len. 14]: `` Do , for God 's sake , pull my hat forward . ''
Parsing [sent. 15836 len. 54]: So strongly entreated , Mr. Bucket complies , puts his own hat on , and conducts his prize into the streets , the trooper marching on as steadily as usual , though with his head less erect , and Mr. Bucket steering him with his elbow over the crossings and up the turnings .
Parsing [sent. 15837 len. 69]: Chapter L -- Esther 's Narrative It happened that when I came home from Deal I found a note from Caddy Jellyby -LRB- as we always continued to call her -RRB- , informing me that her health , which had been for some time very delicate , was worse and that she would be more glad than she could tell me if I would go to see her .
Parsing [sent. 15838 len. 37]: It was a note of a few lines , written from the couch on which she lay and enclosed to me in another from her husband , in which he seconded her entreaty with much solicitude .
Parsing [sent. 15839 len. 50]: Caddy was now the mother , and I the godmother , of such a poor little baby -- such a tiny old-faced mite , with a countenance that seemed to be scarcely anything but cap-border , and a little lean , long-fingered hand , always clenched under its chin .
Parsing [sent. 15840 len. 35]: It would lie in this attitude all day , with its bright specks of eyes open , wondering -LRB- as I used to imagine -RRB- how it came to be so small and weak .
Parsing [sent. 15841 len. 32]: Whenever it was moved it cried , but at all other times it was so patient that the sole desire of its life appeared to be to lie quiet and think .
Parsing [sent. 15842 len. 47]: It had curious little dark veins in its face and curious little dark marks under its eyes like faint remembrances of poor Caddy 's inky days , and altogether , to those who were not used to it , it was quite a piteous little sight .
Parsing [sent. 15843 len. 13]: But it was enough for Caddy that SHE was used to it .
Parsing [sent. 15844 len. 75]: The projects with which she beguiled her illness , for little Esther 's education , and little Esther 's marriage , and even for her own old age as the grandmother of little Esther 's little Esthers , was so prettily expressive of devotion to this pride of her life that I should be tempted to recall some of them but for the timely remembrance that I am getting on irregularly as it is .
Parsing [sent. 15845 len. 6]: To return to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 15846 len. 31]: Caddy had a superstition about me which had been strengthening in her mind ever since that night long ago when she had lain asleep with her head in my lap .
Parsing [sent. 15847 len. 22]: She almost -- I think I must say quite -- believed that I did her good whenever I was near her .
Parsing [sent. 15848 len. 37]: Now although this was such a fancy of the affectionate girl 's that I am almost ashamed to mention it , still it might have all the force of a fact when she was really ill .
Parsing [sent. 15849 len. 32]: Therefore I set off to Caddy , with my guardian 's consent , post-haste ; and she and Prince made so much of me that there never was anything like it .
Parsing [sent. 15850 len. 17]: Next day I went again to sit with her , and next day I went again .
Parsing [sent. 15851 len. 34]: It was a very easy journey , for I had only to rise a little earlier in the morning , and keep my accounts , and attend to housekeeping matters before leaving home .
Parsing [sent. 15852 len. 35]: But when I had made these three visits , my guardian said to me , on my return at night , `` Now , little woman , little woman , this will never do .
Parsing [sent. 15853 len. 18]: Constant dropping will wear away a stone , and constant coaching will wear out a Dame Durden .
Parsing [sent. 15854 len. 17]: We will go to London for a while and take possession of our old lodgings . ''
Parsing [sent. 15855 len. 25]: `` Not for me , dear guardian , '' said I , `` for I never feel tired , '' which was strictly true .
Parsing [sent. 15856 len. 11]: I was only too happy to be in such request .
Parsing [sent. 15857 len. 21]: `` For me then , '' returned my guardian , `` or for Ada , or for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 15858 len. 11]: It is somebody 's birthday to-morrow , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 15859 len. 21]: `` Truly I think it is , '' said I , kissing my darling , who would be twenty-one to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 15860 len. 50]: `` Well , '' observed my guardian , half pleasantly , half seriously , `` that 's a great occasion and will give my fair cousin some necessary business to transact in assertion of her independence , and will make London a more convenient place for all of us .
Parsing [sent. 15861 len. 7]: So to London we will go .
Parsing [sent. 15862 len. 16]: That being settled , there is another thing -- how have you left Caddy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15863 len. 6]: `` Very unwell , guardian .
Parsing [sent. 15864 len. 16]: I fear it will be some time before she regains her health and strength . ''
Parsing [sent. 15865 len. 11]: `` What do you call some time , now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15866 len. 5]: asked my guardian thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 15867 len. 9]: `` Some weeks , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 15868 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15869 len. 23]: He began to walk about the room with his hands in his pockets , showing that he had been thinking as much .
Parsing [sent. 15870 len. 11]: `` Now , what do you say about her doctor ?
Parsing [sent. 15871 len. 10]: Is he a good doctor , my love ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15872 len. 35]: I felt obliged to confess that I knew nothing to the contrary but that Prince and I had agreed only that evening that we would like his opinion to be confirmed by some one .
Parsing [sent. 15873 len. 18]: `` Well , you know , '' returned my guardian quickly , `` there 's Woodcourt . ''
Parsing [sent. 15874 len. 13]: I had not meant that , and was rather taken by surprise .
Parsing [sent. 15875 len. 24]: For a moment all that I had had in my mind in connexion with Mr. Woodcourt seemed to come back and confuse me .
Parsing [sent. 15876 len. 12]: `` You do n't object to him , little woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15877 len. 7]: `` Object to him , guardian ?
Parsing [sent. 15878 len. 4]: Oh no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 15879 len. 14]: `` And you do n't think the patient would object to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15880 len. 27]: So far from that , I had no doubt of her being prepared to have a great reliance on him and to like him very much .
Parsing [sent. 15881 len. 25]: I said that he was no stranger to her personally , for she had seen him often in his kind attendance on Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 15882 len. 9]: `` Very good , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 15883 len. 20]: `` He has been here to-day , my dear , and I will see him about it to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 15884 len. 55]: I felt in this short conversation -- though I did not know how , for she was quiet , and we interchanged no look -- that my dear girl well remembered how merrily she had clasped me round the waist when no other hands than Caddy 's had brought me the little parting token .
Parsing [sent. 15885 len. 51]: This caused me to feel that I ought to tell her , and Caddy too , that I was going to be the mistress of Bleak House and that if I avoided that disclosure any longer I might become less worthy in my own eyes of its master 's love .
Parsing [sent. 15886 len. 75]: Therefore , when we went upstairs and had waited listening until the clock struck twelve in order that only I might be the first to wish my darling all good wishes on her birthday and to take her to my heart , I set before her , just as I had set before myself , the goodness and honour of her cousin John and the happy life that was in store for for me .
Parsing [sent. 15887 len. 27]: If ever my darling were fonder of me at one time than another in all our intercourse , she was surely fondest of me that night .
Parsing [sent. 15888 len. 37]: And I was so rejoiced to know it and so comforted by the sense of having done right in casting this last idle reservation away that I was ten times happier than I had been before .
Parsing [sent. 15889 len. 28]: I had scarcely thought it a reservation a few hours ago , but now that it was gone I felt as if I understood its nature better .
Parsing [sent. 15890 len. 7]: Next day we went to London .
Parsing [sent. 15891 len. 25]: We found our old lodging vacant , and in half an hour were quietly established there , as if we had never gone away .
Parsing [sent. 15892 len. 38]: Mr. Woodcourt dined with us to celebrate my darling 's birthday , and we were as pleasant as we could be with the great blank among us that Richard 's absence naturally made on such an occasion .
Parsing [sent. 15893 len. 53]: After that day I was for some weeks -- eight or nine as I remember -- very much with Caddy , and thus it fell out that I saw less of Ada at this time than any other since we had first come together , except the time of my own illness .
Parsing [sent. 15894 len. 29]: She often came to Caddy 's , but our function there was to amuse and cheer her , and we did not talk in our usual confidential manner .
Parsing [sent. 15895 len. 27]: Whenever I went home at night we were together , but Caddy 's rest was broken by pain , and I often remained to nurse her .
Parsing [sent. 15896 len. 27]: With her husband and her poor little mite of a baby to love and their home to strive for , what a good creature Caddy was !
Parsing [sent. 15897 len. 50]: So self-denying , so uncomplaining , so anxious to get well on their account , so afraid of giving trouble , and so thoughtful of the unassisted labours of her husband and the comforts of old Mr. Turveydrop ; I had never known the best of her until now .
Parsing [sent. 15898 len. 57]: And it seemed so curious that her pale face and helpless figure should be lying there day after day where dancing was the business of life , where the kit and the apprentices began early every morning in the ball-room , and where the untidy little boy waltzed by himself in the kitchen all the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 15899 len. 77]: At Caddy 's request I took the supreme direction of her apartment , trimmed it up , and pushed her , couch and all , into a lighter and more airy and more cheerful corner than she had yet occupied ; then , every day , when we were in our neatest array , I used to lay my small small namesake in her arms and sit down to chat or work or read to her .
Parsing [sent. 15900 len. 19]: It was at one of the first of these quiet times that I told Caddy about Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 15901 len. 7]: We had other visitors besides Ada .
Parsing [sent. 15902 len. 38]: First of all we had Prince , who in his hurried intervals of teaching used to come softly in and sit softly down , with a face of loving anxiety for Caddy and the very little child .
Parsing [sent. 15903 len. 33]: Whatever Caddy 's condition really was , she never failed to declare to Prince that she was all but well -- which I , heaven forgive me , never failed to confirm .
Parsing [sent. 15904 len. 51]: This would put Prince in such good spirits that he would sometimes take the kit from his pocket and play a chord or two to astonish the baby , which I never knew it to do in the least degree , for my tiny namesake never noticed it at all .
Parsing [sent. 15905 len. 6]: Then there was Mrs. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 15906 len. 34]: She would come occasionally , with her usual distraught manner , and sit calmly looking miles beyond her grandchild as if her attention were absorbed by a young Borrioboolan on its native shores .
Parsing [sent. 15907 len. 31]: As bright-eyed as ever , as serene , and as untidy , she would say , `` Well , Caddy , child , and how do you do to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15908 len. 42]: And then would sit amiably smiling and taking no notice of the reply or would sweetly glide off into a calculation of the number of letters she had lately received and answered or of the coffee-bearing power of Borrioboola -- Gha .
Parsing [sent. 15909 len. 21]: This she would always do with a serene contempt for our limited sphere of action , not to be disguised .
Parsing [sent. 15910 len. 24]: Then there was old Mr. Turveydrop , who was from morning to night and from night to morning the subject of innumerable precautions .
Parsing [sent. 15911 len. 17]: If the baby cried , it was nearly stifled lest the noise should make him uncomfortable .
Parsing [sent. 15912 len. 20]: If the fire wanted stirring in the night , it was surreptitiously done lest his rest should be broken .
Parsing [sent. 15913 len. 24]: If Caddy required any little comfort that the house contained , she first carefully discussed whether he was likely to require it too .
Parsing [sent. 15914 len. 66]: In return for this consideration he would come into the room once a day , all but blessing it -- showing a condescension , and a patronage , and a grace of manner in dispensing the light of his high-shouldered presence from which I might have supposed him -LRB- if I had not known better -RRB- to have been the benefactor of Caddy 's life .
Parsing [sent. 15915 len. 21]: `` My Caroline , '' he would say , making the nearest approach that he could to bending over her .
Parsing [sent. 15916 len. 10]: `` Tell me that you are better to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 15917 len. 17]: `` Oh , much better , thank you , Mr. Turveydrop , '' Caddy would reply .
Parsing [sent. 15918 len. 3]: `` Delighted !
Parsing [sent. 15919 len. 2]: Enchanted !
Parsing [sent. 15920 len. 6]: And our dear Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 15921 len. 9]: She is not qulte prostrated by fatigue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15922 len. 36]: Here he would crease up his eyelids and kiss his fingers to me , though I am happy to say he had ceased to be particular in his attentions since I had been so altered .
Parsing [sent. 15923 len. 11]: `` Not at all , '' I would assure him .
Parsing [sent. 15924 len. 3]: `` Charming !
Parsing [sent. 15925 len. 12]: We must take care of our dear Caroline , Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 15926 len. 9]: We must spare nothing that will restore her .
Parsing [sent. 15927 len. 5]: We must nourish her .
Parsing [sent. 15928 len. 25]: My dear Caroline '' -- he would turn to his daughter-in-law with infinite generosity and protection -- `` want for nothing , my love .
Parsing [sent. 15929 len. 10]: Frame a wish and gratify it , my daughter .
Parsing [sent. 15930 len. 18]: Everything this house contains , everything my room contains , is at your service , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 15931 len. 37]: Do not , '' he would sometimes add in a burst of deportment , `` even allow my simple requirements to be considered if they should at any time interfere with your own , my Caroline .
Parsing [sent. 15932 len. 8]: Your necessities are greater than mine . ''
Parsing [sent. 15933 len. 40]: He had established such a long prescriptive right to this deportment -LRB- his son 's inheritance from his mother -RRB- that I several times knew both Caddy and her husband to be melted to tears by these affectionate self-sacrifices .
Parsing [sent. 15934 len. 41]: `` Nay , my dears , '' he would remonstrate ; and when I saw Caddy 's thin arm about his fat neck as he said it , I would be melted too , though not by the same process .
Parsing [sent. 15935 len. 5]: `` Nay , nay !
Parsing [sent. 15936 len. 8]: I have promised never to leave ye .
Parsing [sent. 15937 len. 14]: Be dutiful and affectionate towards me , and I ask no other return .
Parsing [sent. 15938 len. 5]: Now , bless ye !
Parsing [sent. 15939 len. 8]: I am going to the Park . ''
Parsing [sent. 15940 len. 16]: He would take the air there presently and get an appetite for his hotel dinner .
Parsing [sent. 15941 len. 68]: I hope I do old Mr. Turveydrop no wrong , but I never saw any better traits in him than these I faithfully record , except that he certainly conceived a liking for Peepy and would take the child out walking with great pomp , always on those occasions sending him home before he went to dinner himself , and occasionally with a halfpenny in his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 15942 len. 53]: But even this disinterestedness was attended with no inconsiderable cost , to my knowledge , for before Peepy was sufficiently decorated to walk hand in hand with the professor of deportment , he had to be newly dressed , at the expense of Caddy and her husband , from top to toe .
Parsing [sent. 15943 len. 10]: Last of our visitors , there was Mr. Jellyby .
Parsing [sent. 15944 len. 48]: Really when he used to come in of an evening , and ask Caddy in his meek voice how she was , and then sit down with his head against the wall , and make no attempt to say anything more , I liked him very much .
Parsing [sent. 15945 len. 38]: If he found me bustling about doing any little thing , he sometimes half took his coat off , as if with an intention of helping by a great exertion ; but he never got any further .
Parsing [sent. 15946 len. 37]: His sole occupation was to sit with his head against the wall , looking hard at the thoughtful baby ; and I could not quite divest my mind of a fancy that they understood one another .
Parsing [sent. 15947 len. 18]: I have not counted Mr. Woodcourt among our visitors because he was now Caddy 's regular attendant .
Parsing [sent. 15948 len. 38]: She soon began to improve under his care , but he was so gentle , so skilful , so unwearying in the pains he took that it is not to be wondered at , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 15949 len. 44]: I saw a good deal of Mr. Woodcourt during this time , though not so much as might be supposed , for knowing Caddy to be safe in his hands , I often slipped home at about the hours when he was expected .
Parsing [sent. 15950 len. 6]: We frequently met , notwithstanding .
Parsing [sent. 15951 len. 32]: I was quite reconciled to myself now , but I still felt glad to think that he was sorry for me , and he still WAS sorry for me I believed .
Parsing [sent. 15952 len. 24]: He helped Mr. Badger in his professional engagements , which were numerous , and had as yet no settled projects for the future .
Parsing [sent. 15953 len. 19]: It was when Caddy began to recover that I began to notice a change in my dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 15954 len. 35]: I can not say how it first presented itself to me , because I observed it in many slight particulars which were nothing in themselves and only became something when they were pieced together .
Parsing [sent. 15955 len. 26]: But I made it out , by putting them together , that Ada was not so frankly cheerful with me as she used to be .
Parsing [sent. 15956 len. 46]: Her tenderness for me was as loving and true as ever ; I did not for a moment doubt that ; but there was a quiet sorrow about her which she did not confide to me , and in which I traced some hidden regret .
Parsing [sent. 15957 len. 32]: Now , I could not understand this , and I was so anxious for the happiness of my own pet that it caused me some uneasiness and set me thinking often .
Parsing [sent. 15958 len. 45]: At length , feeling sure that Ada suppressed this something from me lest it should make me unhappy too , it came into my head that she was a little grieved -- for me -- by what I had told her about Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 15959 len. 14]: How I persuaded myself that this was likely , I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 15960 len. 15]: I had no idea that there was any selfish reference in my doing so .
Parsing [sent. 15961 len. 15]: I was not grieved for myself : I was quite contented and quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 15962 len. 40]: Still , that Ada might be thinking -- for me , though I had abandoned all such thoughts -- of what once was , but was now all changed , seemed so easy to believe that I believed it .
Parsing [sent. 15963 len. 23]: What could I do to reassure my darling -LRB- I considered then -RRB- and show her that I had no such feelings ?
Parsing [sent. 15964 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 15965 len. 21]: I could only be as brisk and busy as possible , and that I had tried to be all along .
Parsing [sent. 15966 len. 68]: However , as Caddy 's illness had certainly interfered , more or less , with my home duties -- though I had always been there in the morning to make my guardian 's breakfast , and he had a hundred times laughed and said there must be two little women , for his little woman was never missing -- I resolved to be doubly diligent and gay .
Parsing [sent. 15967 len. 37]: So I went about the house humming all the tunes I knew , and I sat working and working in a desperate manner , and I talked and talked , morning , noon , and night .
Parsing [sent. 15968 len. 13]: And still there was the same shade between me and my darling .
Parsing [sent. 15969 len. 40]: `` So , Dame Trot , '' observed my guardian , shutting up his book one night when we were all three together , `` so Woodcourt has restored Caddy Jellyby to the full enjoyment of life again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15970 len. 26]: `` Yes , '' I said ; `` and to be repaid by such gratitude as hers is to be made rich , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 15971 len. 17]: `` I wish it was , '' he returned , `` with all my heart . ''
Parsing [sent. 15972 len. 9]: So did I too , for that matter .
Parsing [sent. 15973 len. 4]: I said so .
Parsing [sent. 15974 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 15975 len. 14]: We would make him as rich as a Jew if we knew how .
Parsing [sent. 15976 len. 8]: Would we not , little woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15977 len. 40]: I laughed as I worked and replied that I was not sure about that , for it might spoil him , and he might not be so useful , and there might be many who could ill spare him .
Parsing [sent. 15978 len. 12]: As Miss Flite , and Caddy herself , and many others .
Parsing [sent. 15979 len. 8]: `` True , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 15980 len. 6]: `` I had forgotten that .
Parsing [sent. 15981 len. 15]: But we would agree to make him rich enough to live , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 15982 len. 10]: Rich enough to work with tolerable peace of mind ?
Parsing [sent. 15983 len. 23]: Rich enough to have his own happy home and his own household gods -- and household goddess , too , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15984 len. 9]: That was quite another thing , I said .
Parsing [sent. 15985 len. 7]: We must all agree in that .
Parsing [sent. 15986 len. 10]: `` To be sure , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 15987 len. 5]: `` All of us .
Parsing [sent. 15988 len. 25]: I have a great regard for Woodcourt , a high esteem for him ; and I have been sounding him delicately about his plans .
Parsing [sent. 15989 len. 20]: It is difficult to offer aid to an independent man with that just kind of pride which he possesses .
Parsing [sent. 15990 len. 18]: And yet I would be glad to do it if I might or if I knew how .
Parsing [sent. 15991 len. 8]: He seems half inclined for another voyage .
Parsing [sent. 15992 len. 11]: But that appears like casting such a man away . ''
Parsing [sent. 15993 len. 27]: `` It might open a new world to him , '' said I. '' So it might , little woman , '' my guardian assented . ''
Parsing [sent. 15994 len. 11]: I doubt if he expects much of the old world .
Parsing [sent. 15995 len. 19]: Do you know I have fancied that he sometimes feels some particular disappointment or misfortune encountered in it .
Parsing [sent. 15996 len. 10]: You never heard of anything of that sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 15997 len. 5]: I shook my head .
Parsing [sent. 15998 len. 8]: `` Humph , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 15999 len. 10]: `` I am mistaken , I dare say . ''
Parsing [sent. 16000 len. 40]: As there was a little pause here , which I thought , for my dear girl 's satisfaction , had better be filled up , I hummed an air as I worked which was a favourite with my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16001 len. 13]: `` And do you think Mr. Woodcourt will make another voyage ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16002 len. 12]: I asked him when I had hummed it quietly all through .
Parsing [sent. 16003 len. 34]: `` I do n't quite know what to think , my dear , but I should say it was likely at present that he will give a long trip to another country . ''
Parsing [sent. 16004 len. 47]: `` I am sure he will take the best wishes of all our hearts with him wherever he goes , '' said I ; `` and though they are not riches , he will never be the poorer for them , guardian , at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 16005 len. 10]: `` Never , little woman , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 16006 len. 17]: I was sitting in my usual place , which was now beside my guardian 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 16007 len. 16]: That had not been my usual place before the letter , but it was now .
Parsing [sent. 16008 len. 37]: I looked up to Ada , who was sitting opposite , and I saw , as she looked at me , that her eyes were filled with tears and that tears were falling down her face .
Parsing [sent. 16009 len. 26]: I felt that I had only to be placid and merry once for all to undeceive my dear and set her loving heart at rest .
Parsing [sent. 16010 len. 16]: I really was so , and I had nothing to do but to be myself .
Parsing [sent. 16011 len. 21]: So I made my sweet girl lean upon my shoulder -- how little thinking what was heavy on her mind !
Parsing [sent. 16012 len. 22]: -- and I said she was not quite well , and put my arm about her , and took her upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 16013 len. 44]: When we were in our own room , and when she might perhaps have told me what I was so unprepared to hear , I gave her no encouragement to confide in me ; I never thought she stood in need of it .
Parsing [sent. 16014 len. 35]: `` Oh , my dear good Esther , '' said Ada , `` if I could only make up my mind to speak to you and my cousin John when you are together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16015 len. 7]: `` Why , my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16016 len. 3]: I remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 16017 len. 12]: `` Ada , why should you not speak to us ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16018 len. 13]: Ada only dropped her head and pressed me closer to her heart .
Parsing [sent. 16019 len. 37]: `` You surely do n't forget , my beauty , '' said I , smiling , `` what quiet , old-fashioned people we are and how I have settled down to be the discreetest of dames ?
Parsing [sent. 16020 len. 21]: You do n't forget how happily and peacefully my life is all marked out for me , and by whom ?
Parsing [sent. 16021 len. 16]: I am certain that you do n't forget by what a noble character , Ada .
Parsing [sent. 16022 len. 6]: That can never be . ''
Parsing [sent. 16023 len. 8]: `` No , never , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 16024 len. 28]: `` Why then , my dear , '' said I , `` there can be nothing amiss -- and why should you not speak to us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16025 len. 7]: `` Nothing amiss , Esther ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16026 len. 3]: returned Ada .
Parsing [sent. 16027 len. 42]: `` Oh , when I think of all these years , and of his fatherly care and kindness , and of the old relations among us , and of you , what shall I do , what shall I do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16028 len. 43]: I looked at my child in some wonder , but I thought it better not to answer otherwise than by cheering her , and so I turned off into many little recollections of our life together and prevented her from saying more .
Parsing [sent. 16029 len. 37]: When she lay down to sleep , and not before , I returned to my guardian to say good night , and then I came back to Ada and sat near her for a little while .
Parsing [sent. 16030 len. 19]: She was asleep , and I thought as I looked at her that she was a little changed .
Parsing [sent. 16031 len. 9]: I had thought so more than once lately .
Parsing [sent. 16032 len. 33]: I could not decide , even looking at her while she was unconscious , how she was changed , but something in the familiar beauty of her face looked different to me .
Parsing [sent. 16033 len. 39]: My guardian 's old hopes of her and Richard arose sorrowfully in my mind , and I said to myself , `` She has been anxious about him , '' and I wondered how that love would end .
Parsing [sent. 16034 len. 39]: When I had come home from Caddy 's while she was ill , I had often found Ada at work , and she had always put her work away , and I had never known what it was .
Parsing [sent. 16035 len. 17]: Some of it now lay in a drawer near her , which was not quite closed .
Parsing [sent. 16036 len. 26]: I did not open the drawer , but I still rather wondered what the work could he , for it was evidently nothing for herself .
Parsing [sent. 16037 len. 23]: And I noticed as I kissed my dear that she lay with one hand under her pillow so that it was hidden .
Parsing [sent. 16038 len. 54]: How much less amiable I must have been than they thought me , how much less amiable than I thought myself , to be so preoccupied with my own cheerfulness and contentment as to think that it only rested with me to put my dear girl right and set her mind at peace !
Parsing [sent. 16039 len. 11]: But I lay down , self-deceived , in that belief .
Parsing [sent. 16040 len. 22]: And I awoke in it next day to find that there was still the same shade between me and my darling .
Parsing [sent. 16041 len. 28]: Chapter LI -- Enlightened When Mr. Woodcourt arrived in London , he went , that very same day , to Mr. Vholes 's in Symond 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 16042 len. 25]: For he never once , from the moment when I entreated him to be a friend to Richard , neglected or forgot his promise .
Parsing [sent. 16043 len. 25]: He had told me that he accepted the charge as a sacred trust , and he was ever true to it in that spirit .
Parsing [sent. 16044 len. 26]: He found Mr. Vholes in his office and informed Mr. Vholes of his agreement with Richard that he should call there to learn his address .
Parsing [sent. 16045 len. 11]: `` Just so , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 16046 len. 27]: `` Mr. C. 's address is not a hundred miles from here , sir , Mr. C. 's address is not a hundred miles from here .
Parsing [sent. 16047 len. 9]: Would you take a seat , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16048 len. 19]: Mr. Woodcourt thanked Mr. Vholes , but he had no business with him beyond what he had mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 16049 len. 6]: `` Just so , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16050 len. 39]: I believe , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes , still quietly insisting on the seat by not giving the address , `` that you have influence with Mr. C. Indeed I am aware that you have . ''
Parsing [sent. 16051 len. 23]: `` I was not aware of it myself , '' returned Mr. Woodcourt ; `` but I suppose you know best . ''
Parsing [sent. 16052 len. 29]: `` Sir , '' rejoined Mr. Vholes , self-contained as usual , voice and all , `` it is a part of my professional duty to know best .
Parsing [sent. 16053 len. 22]: It is a part of my professional duty to study and to understand a gentleman who confides his interests to me .
Parsing [sent. 16054 len. 17]: In my professional duty I shall not be wanting , sir , if I know it .
Parsing [sent. 16055 len. 26]: I may , with the best intentions , be wanting in it without knowing it ; but not if I know it , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 16056 len. 7]: Mr. Woodcourt again mentioned the address .
Parsing [sent. 16057 len. 12]: `` Give me leave , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 16058 len. 8]: `` Bear with me for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 16059 len. 23]: Sir , Mr. C. is playing for a considerable stake , and can not play without -- need I say what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16060 len. 7]: `` Money , I presume ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16061 len. 43]: `` Sir , '' said Mr. Vholes , `` to be honest with you -LRB- honesty being my golden rule , whether I gain by it or lose , and I find that I generally lose -RRB- , money is the word .
Parsing [sent. 16062 len. 22]: Now , sir , upon the chances of Mr. C. 's game I express to you no opinion , NO opinion .
Parsing [sent. 16063 len. 31]: It might be highly impolitic in Mr. C. , after playing so long and so high , to leave off ; it might be the reverse ; I say nothing .
Parsing [sent. 16064 len. 26]: No , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes , bringing his hand flat down upon his desk in a positive manner , `` nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 16065 len. 30]: `` You seem to forget , '' returned Mr , Woodcourt , `` that I ask you to say nothing and have no interest in anything you say . ''
Parsing [sent. 16066 len. 7]: `` Pardon me , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16067 len. 4]: retorted Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 16068 len. 7]: `` You do yourself an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 16069 len. 4]: No , sir !
Parsing [sent. 16070 len. 3]: Pardon me !
Parsing [sent. 16071 len. 20]: You shall not -- shall not in my office , if I know it -- do yourself an injustice .
Parsing [sent. 16072 len. 16]: You are interested in anything , and in everything , that relates to your friend .
Parsing [sent. 16073 len. 31]: I know human nature much better , sir , than to admit for an instant that a gentleman of your appearance is not interested in whatever concerns his friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 16074 len. 13]: `` Well , '' replied Mr. Woodcourt , `` that may be .
Parsing [sent. 16075 len. 9]: I am particularly interested in his address . ''
Parsing [sent. 16076 len. 20]: `` The number , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes parenthetically , `` I believe I have already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 16077 len. 20]: If Mr. C. is to continue to play for this considerable stake , sir , he must have funds .
Parsing [sent. 16078 len. 3]: Understand me !
Parsing [sent. 16079 len. 8]: There are funds in hand at present .
Parsing [sent. 16080 len. 11]: I ask for nothing ; there are funds in hand .
Parsing [sent. 16081 len. 36]: But for the onward play , more funds must be provided , unless Mr. C. is to throw away what he has already ventured , which is wholly and solely a point for his consideration .
Parsing [sent. 16082 len. 55]: This , sir , I take the opportunity of stating openly to you as the friend of Mr. C. Without funds I shall always be happy to appear and act for Mr. C. to the extent of all such costs as are safe to be allowed out of the estate , not beyond that .
Parsing [sent. 16083 len. 14]: I could not go beyond that , sir , without wronging some one .
Parsing [sent. 16084 len. 30]: I must either wrong my three dear girls or my venerable father , who is entirely dependent on me , in the Vale of Taunton ; or some one .
Parsing [sent. 16085 len. 23]: Whereas , sir , my resolution is -LRB- call it weakness or folly if you please -RRB- to wrong no one . ''
Parsing [sent. 16086 len. 13]: Mr. Woodcourt rather sternly rejoined that he was glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 16087 len. 20]: `` I wish , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes , `` to leave a good name behind me .
Parsing [sent. 16088 len. 20]: Therefore I take every opportunity of openly stating to a friend of Mr. C. how Mr. C. is situated .
Parsing [sent. 16089 len. 14]: As to myself , sir , the labourer is worthy of his hire .
Parsing [sent. 16090 len. 22]: If I undertake to put my shoulder to the wheel , I do it , and I earn what I get .
Parsing [sent. 16091 len. 7]: I am here for that purpose .
Parsing [sent. 16092 len. 14]: My name is painted on the door outside , with that object . ''
Parsing [sent. 16093 len. 11]: `` And Mr. Carstone 's address , Mr. Vholes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16094 len. 22]: `` Sir , '' returned Mr. Vholes , `` as I believe I have already mentioned , it is next door .
Parsing [sent. 16095 len. 12]: On the second story you will find Mr. C. 's apartments .
Parsing [sent. 16096 len. 23]: Mr. C. desires to be near his professional adviser , and I am far from objecting , for I court inquiry . ''
Parsing [sent. 16097 len. 30]: Upon this Mr. Woodcourt wished Mr. Vholes good day and went in search of Richard , the change in whose appearance he began to understand now but too well .
Parsing [sent. 16098 len. 51]: He found him in a dull room , fadedly furnished , much as I had found him in his barrack-room but a little while before , except that he was not writing but was sitting with a book before him , from which his eyes and thoughts were far astray .
Parsing [sent. 16099 len. 50]: As the door chanced to be standing open , Mr. Woodcourt was in his presence for some moments without being perceived , and he told me that he never could forget the haggardness of his face and the dejection of his manner before he was aroused from his dream .
Parsing [sent. 16100 len. 28]: `` Woodcourt , my dear fellow , '' cried Richard , starting up with extended hands , `` you come upon my vision like a ghost . ''
Parsing [sent. 16101 len. 24]: `` A friendly one , '' he replied , `` and only waiting , as they say ghosts do , to be addressed .
Parsing [sent. 16102 len. 8]: How does the mortal world go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16103 len. 8]: They were seated now , near together .
Parsing [sent. 16104 len. 23]: `` Badly enough , and slowly enough , '' said Richard , `` speaking at least for my part of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 16105 len. 7]: `` What part is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16106 len. 6]: `` The Chancery part . ''
Parsing [sent. 16107 len. 22]: `` I never heard , '' returned Mr. Woodcourt , shaking his head , `` of its going well yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16108 len. 9]: `` Nor I , '' said Richard moodily .
Parsing [sent. 16109 len. 6]: `` Who ever did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16110 len. 36]: He brightened again in a moment and said with his natural openness , `` Woodcourt , I should be sorry to be misunderstood by you , even if I gained by it in your estimation .
Parsing [sent. 16111 len. 13]: You must know that I have done no good this long time .
Parsing [sent. 16112 len. 20]: I have not intended to do much harm , but I seem to have been capable of nothing else .
Parsing [sent. 16113 len. 49]: It may be that I should have done better by keeping out of the net into which my destiny has worked me , but I think not , though I dare say you will soon hear , if you have not already heard , a very different opinion .
Parsing [sent. 16114 len. 38]: To make short of a long story , I am afraid I have wanted an object ; but I have an object now -- or it has me -- and it is too late to discuss it .
Parsing [sent. 16115 len. 14]: Take me as I am , and make the best of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 16116 len. 9]: `` A bargain , '' said Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 16117 len. 10]: `` Do as much by me in return . ''
Parsing [sent. 16118 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 16119 len. 38]: You , '' returned Richard , `` you can pursue your art for its own sake , and can put your hand upon the plough and never turn , and can strike a purpose out of anything .
Parsing [sent. 16120 len. 9]: You and I are very different creatures . ''
Parsing [sent. 16121 len. 13]: He spoke regretfully and lapsed for a moment into his weary condition .
Parsing [sent. 16122 len. 6]: `` Well , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16123 len. 7]: he cried , shaking it off .
Parsing [sent. 16124 len. 6]: `` Everything has an end .
Parsing [sent. 16125 len. 4]: We shall see !
Parsing [sent. 16126 len. 17]: So you will take me as I am , and make the best of me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16127 len. 3]: `` Aye !
Parsing [sent. 16128 len. 5]: Indeed I will . ''
Parsing [sent. 16129 len. 12]: They shook hands upon it laughingly , but in deep earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 16130 len. 13]: I can answer for one of them with my heart of hearts .
Parsing [sent. 16131 len. 22]: `` You come as a godsend , '' said Richard , `` for I have seen nobody here yet but Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 16132 len. 25]: Woodcourt , there is one subject I should like to mention , for once and for all , in the beginning of our treaty .
Parsing [sent. 16133 len. 13]: You can hardly make the best of me if I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 16134 len. 18]: You know , I dare say , that I have an attachment to my cousin Ada ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16135 len. 12]: Mr. Woodcourt replied that I had hinted as much to him .
Parsing [sent. 16136 len. 18]: `` Now pray , '' returned Richard , `` do n't think me a heap of selfishness .
Parsing [sent. 16137 len. 27]: Do n't suppose that I am splitting my head and half breaking my heart over this miserable Chancery suit for my own rights and interests alone .
Parsing [sent. 16138 len. 21]: Ada 's are bound up with mine ; they ca n't be separated ; Vholes works for both of us .
Parsing [sent. 16139 len. 6]: Do think of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16140 len. 23]: He was so very solicitous on this head that Mr. Woodcourt gave him the strongest assurances that he did him no injustice .
Parsing [sent. 16141 len. 55]: `` You see , '' said Richard , with something pathetic in his manner of lingering on the point , though it was off-hand and unstudied , `` to an upright fellow like you , bringing a friendly face like yours here , I can not bear the thought of appearing selfish and mean .
Parsing [sent. 16142 len. 45]: I want to see Ada righted , Woodcourt , as well as myself ; I want to do my utmost to right her , as well as myself ; I venture what I can scrape together to extricate her , as well as myself .
Parsing [sent. 16143 len. 11]: Do , I beseech you , think of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16144 len. 48]: Afterwards , when Mr. Woodcourt came to reflect on what had passed , he was so very much impressed by the strength of Richard 's anxiety on this point that in telling me generally of his first visit to Symond 's Inn he particularly dwelt upon it .
Parsing [sent. 16145 len. 33]: It revived a fear I had had before that my dear girl 's little property would be absorbed by Mr. Vholes and that Richard 's justification to himself would be sincerely this .
Parsing [sent. 16146 len. 39]: It was just as I began to take care of Caddy that the interview took place , and I now return to the time when Caddy had recovered and the shade was still between me and my darling .
Parsing [sent. 16147 len. 14]: I proposed to Ada that morning that we should go and see Richard .
Parsing [sent. 16148 len. 21]: It a little surprised me to find that she hesitated and was not so radiantly willing as I had expected .
Parsing [sent. 16149 len. 26]: `` My dear , '' said I , `` you have not had any difference with Richard since I have been so much away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16150 len. 6]: `` No , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 16151 len. 9]: `` Not heard of him , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16152 len. 15]: said I. `` Yes , I have heard of him , '' said Ada .
Parsing [sent. 16153 len. 13]: Such tears in her eyes , and such love in her face .
Parsing [sent. 16154 len. 8]: I could not make my darling out .
Parsing [sent. 16155 len. 9]: Should I go to Richard 's by myself ?
Parsing [sent. 16156 len. 3]: I said .
Parsing [sent. 16157 len. 12]: No , Ada thought I had better not go by myself .
Parsing [sent. 16158 len. 6]: Would she go with me ?
Parsing [sent. 16159 len. 11]: Yes , Ada thought she had better go with me .
Parsing [sent. 16160 len. 5]: Should we go now ?
Parsing [sent. 16161 len. 7]: Yes , let us go now .
Parsing [sent. 16162 len. 22]: Well , I could not understand my darling , with the tears in her eyes and the love in her face !
Parsing [sent. 16163 len. 8]: We were soon equipped and went out .
Parsing [sent. 16164 len. 15]: It was a sombre day , and drops of chill rain fell at intervals .
Parsing [sent. 16165 len. 14]: It was one of those colourless days when everything looks heavy and harsh .
Parsing [sent. 16166 len. 30]: The houses frowned at us , the dust rose at us , the smoke swooped at us , nothing made any compromise about itself or wore a softened aspect .
Parsing [sent. 16167 len. 33]: I fancied my beautiful girl quite out of place in the rugged streets , and I thought there were more funerals passing along the dismal pavements than I had ever seen before .
Parsing [sent. 16168 len. 10]: We had first to find out Symond 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 16169 len. 19]: We were going to inquire in a shop when Ada said she thought it was near Chancery Lane .
Parsing [sent. 16170 len. 24]: `` We are not likely to be far out , my love , if we go in that direction , '' said I .
Parsing [sent. 16171 len. 19]: So to Chancery Lane we went , and there , sure enough , we saw it written up .
Parsing [sent. 16172 len. 4]: Symond 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 16173 len. 9]: We had next to find out the number .
Parsing [sent. 16174 len. 24]: `` Or Mr. Vholes 's office will do , '' I recollected , `` for Mr. Vholes 's office is next door . ''
Parsing [sent. 16175 len. 17]: Upon which Ada said , perhaps that was Mr. Vholes 's office in the corner there .
Parsing [sent. 16176 len. 5]: And it really was .
Parsing [sent. 16177 len. 12]: Then came the question , which of the two next doors ?
Parsing [sent. 16178 len. 23]: I was going for the one , and my darling was going for the other ; and my darling was right again .
Parsing [sent. 16179 len. 25]: So up we went to the second story , when we came to Richard 's name in great white letters on a hearse-like panel .
Parsing [sent. 16180 len. 19]: I should have knocked , but Ada said perhaps we had better turn the handle and go in .
Parsing [sent. 16181 len. 28]: Thus we came to Richard , poring over a table covered with dusty bundles of papers which seemed to me like dusty mirrors reflecting his own mind .
Parsing [sent. 16182 len. 14]: Wherever I looked I saw the ominous words that ran in it repeated .
Parsing [sent. 16183 len. 4]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 16184 len. 11]: He received us very affectionately , and we sat down .
Parsing [sent. 16185 len. 21]: `` If you had come a little earlier , '' he said , `` you would have found Woodcourt here .
Parsing [sent. 16186 len. 11]: There never was such a good fellow as Woodcourt is .
Parsing [sent. 16187 len. 27]: He finds time to look in between-whiles , when anybody else with half his work to do would be thinking about not being able to come .
Parsing [sent. 16188 len. 39]: And he is so cheery , so fresh , so sensible , so earnest , so -- everything that I am not , that the place brightens whenever he comes , and darkens whenever he goes again . ''
Parsing [sent. 16189 len. 17]: `` God bless him , '' I thought , `` for his truth to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16190 len. 44]: `` He is not so sanguine , Ada , '' continued Richard , casting his dejected look over the bundles of papers , `` as Vholes and I are usually , but he is only an outsider and is not in the mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 16191 len. 11]: We have gone into them , and he has not .
Parsing [sent. 16192 len. 14]: He ca n't be expected to know much of such a labyrinth . ''
Parsing [sent. 16193 len. 44]: As his look wandered over the papers again and he passed his two hands over his head , I noticed how sunken and how large his eyes appeared , how dry his lips were , and how his finger-nails were all bitten away .
Parsing [sent. 16194 len. 17]: `` Is this a healthy place to live in , Richard , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16195 len. 53]: said I. `` Why , my dear Minerva , '' answered Richard with his old gay laugh , `` it is neither a rural nor a cheerful place ; and when the sun shines here , you may lay a pretty heavy wager that it is shining brightly in an open spot .
Parsing [sent. 16196 len. 9]: But it 's well enough for the time .
Parsing [sent. 16197 len. 10]: It 's near the offices and near Vholes . ''
Parsing [sent. 16198 len. 21]: `` Perhaps , '' I hinted , `` a change from both -- '' `` Might do me good ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16199 len. 12]: said Richard , forcing a laugh as he finished the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 16200 len. 6]: `` I should n't wonder !
Parsing [sent. 16201 len. 21]: But it can only come in one way now -- in one of two ways , I should rather say .
Parsing [sent. 16202 len. 13]: Either the suit must be ended , Esther , or the suitor .
Parsing [sent. 16203 len. 19]: But it shall be the suit , my dear girl , the suit , my dear girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16204 len. 15]: These latter words were addressed to Ada , who was sitting nearest to him .
Parsing [sent. 16205 len. 17]: Her face being turned away from me and towards him , I could not see it .
Parsing [sent. 16206 len. 11]: `` We are doing very well , '' pursued Richard .
Parsing [sent. 16207 len. 7]: `` Vholes will tell you so .
Parsing [sent. 16208 len. 6]: We are really spinning along .
Parsing [sent. 16209 len. 3]: Ask Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 16210 len. 7]: We are giving them no rest .
Parsing [sent. 16211 len. 15]: Vholes knows all their windings and turnings , and we are upon them everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 16212 len. 6]: We have astonished them already .
Parsing [sent. 16213 len. 14]: We shall rouse up that nest of sleepers , mark my words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16214 len. 55]: His hopefulness had long been more painful to me than his despondency ; it was so unlike hopefulness , had something so fierce in its determination to be it , was so hungry and eager , and yet so conscious of being forced and unsustainable that it had long touched me to the heart .
Parsing [sent. 16215 len. 23]: But the commentary upon it now indelibly written in his handsome face made it far more distressing than it used to be .
Parsing [sent. 16216 len. 59]: I say indelibly , for I felt persuaded that if the fatal cause could have been for ever terminated , according to his brightest visions , in that same hour , the traces of the premature anxiety , self-reproach , and disappointment it had occasioned him would have remained upon his features to the hour of his death .
Parsing [sent. 16217 len. 43]: `` The sight of our dear little woman , '' said Richard , Ada still remaining silent and quiet , `` is so natural to me , and her compassionate face is so like the face of old days -- '' Ah !
Parsing [sent. 16218 len. 4]: No , no .
Parsing [sent. 16219 len. 8]: I smiled and shook my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 16220 len. 41]: -- So exactly like the face of old days , '' said Richard in his cordial voice , and taking my hand with the brotherly regard which nothing ever changed , `` that I ca n't make pretences with her .
Parsing [sent. 16221 len. 10]: I fluctuate a little ; that 's the truth .
Parsing [sent. 16222 len. 19]: Sometimes I hope , my dear , and sometimes I -- do n't quite despair , but nearly .
Parsing [sent. 16223 len. 22]: I get , '' said Richard , relinquishing my hand gently and walking across the room , `` so tired ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16224 len. 14]: He took a few turns up and down and sunk upon the sofa .
Parsing [sent. 16225 len. 13]: `` I get , '' he repeated gloomily , `` so tired .
Parsing [sent. 16226 len. 9]: It is such weary , weary work ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16227 len. 58]: He was leaning on his arm saying these words in a meditative voice and looking at the ground when my darling rose , put off her bonnet , kneeled down beside him with her golden hair falling like sunlight on his head , clasped her two arms round his neck , and turned her face to me .
Parsing [sent. 16228 len. 11]: Oh , what a loving and devoted face I saw !
Parsing [sent. 16229 len. 20]: `` Esther , dear , '' she said very quietly , `` I am not going home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 16230 len. 10]: A light shone in upon me all at once .
Parsing [sent. 16231 len. 5]: `` Never any more .
Parsing [sent. 16232 len. 10]: I am going to stay with my dear husband .
Parsing [sent. 16233 len. 8]: We have been married above two months .
Parsing [sent. 16234 len. 18]: Go home without me , my own Esther ; I shall never go home any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16235 len. 17]: With those words my darling drew his head down on her breast and held it there .
Parsing [sent. 16236 len. 24]: And if ever in my life I saw a love that nothing but death could change , I saw it then before me .
Parsing [sent. 16237 len. 17]: `` Speak to Esther , my dearest , '' said Richard , breaking the silence presently .
Parsing [sent. 16238 len. 8]: `` Tell her how it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 16239 len. 16]: I met her before she could come to me and folded her in my arms .
Parsing [sent. 16240 len. 19]: We neither of us spoke , but with her cheek against my own I wanted to hear nothing .
Parsing [sent. 16241 len. 11]: `` My pet , '' said I. `` My love .
Parsing [sent. 16242 len. 7]: My poor , poor girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16243 len. 6]: I pitied her so much .
Parsing [sent. 16244 len. 22]: I was very fond of Richard , but the impulse that I had upon me was to pity her so much .
Parsing [sent. 16245 len. 8]: `` Esther , will you forgive me ?
Parsing [sent. 16246 len. 8]: Will my cousin John forgive me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16247 len. 23]: `` My dear , '' said I , `` to doubt it for a moment is to do him a great wrong .
Parsing [sent. 16248 len. 6]: And as to me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16249 len. 12]: Why , as to me , what had I to forgive !
Parsing [sent. 16250 len. 62]: I dried my sobbing darling 's eyes and sat beside her on the sofa , and Richard sat on my other side ; and while I was reminded of that so different night when they had first taken me into their confidence and had gone on in their own wild happy way , they told me between them how it was .
Parsing [sent. 16251 len. 38]: `` All I had was Richard 's , '' Ada said ; `` and Richard would not take it , Esther , and what could I do but be his wife when I loved him dearly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16252 len. 32]: `` And you were so fully and so kindly occupied , excellent Dame Durden , '' said Richard , `` that how could we speak to you at such a time !
Parsing [sent. 16253 len. 10]: And besides , it was not a long-considered step .
Parsing [sent. 16254 len. 10]: We went out one morning and were married . ''
Parsing [sent. 16255 len. 31]: `` And when it was done , Esther , '' said my darling , `` I was always thinking how to tell you and what to do for the best .
Parsing [sent. 16256 len. 45]: And sometimes I thought you ought to know it directly , and sometimes I thought you ought not to know it and keep it from my cousin John ; and I could not tell what to do , and I fretted very much . ''
Parsing [sent. 16257 len. 14]: How selfish I must have been not to have thought of this before !
Parsing [sent. 16258 len. 9]: I do n't know what I said now .
Parsing [sent. 16259 len. 43]: I was so sorry , and yet I was so fond of them and so glad that they were fond of me ; I pitied them so much , and yet I felt a kind of pride in their loving one another .
Parsing [sent. 16260 len. 25]: I never had experienced such painful and pleasurable emotion at one time , and in my own heart I did not know which predominated .
Parsing [sent. 16261 len. 16]: But I was not there to darken their way ; I did not do that .
Parsing [sent. 16262 len. 27]: When I was less foolish and more composed , my darling took her wedding-ring from her bosom , and kissed it , and put it on .
Parsing [sent. 16263 len. 27]: Then I remembered last night and told Richard that ever since her marriage she had worn it at night when there was no one to see .
Parsing [sent. 16264 len. 14]: Then Ada blushingly asked me how did I know that , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 16265 len. 23]: Then I told Ada how I had seen her hand concealed under her pillow and had little thought why , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 16266 len. 47]: Then they began telling me how it was all over again , and I began to be sorry and glad again , and foolish again , and to hide my plain old face as much as I could lest I should put them out of heart .
Parsing [sent. 16267 len. 16]: Thus the time went on until it became necessary for me to think of returning .
Parsing [sent. 16268 len. 19]: When that time arrived it was the worst of all , for then my darling completely broke down .
Parsing [sent. 16269 len. 25]: She clung round my neck , calling me by every dear name she could think of and saying what should she do without me !
Parsing [sent. 16270 len. 46]: Nor was Richard much better ; and as for me , I should have been the worst of the three if I had not severely said to myself , `` Now Esther , if you do , I 'll never speak to you again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16271 len. 18]: `` Why , I declare , '' said I , `` I never saw such a wife .
Parsing [sent. 16272 len. 11]: I do n't think she loves her husband at all .
Parsing [sent. 16273 len. 14]: Here , Richard , take my child , for goodness ' sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 16274 len. 22]: But I held her tight all the while , and could have wept over her I do n't know how long .
Parsing [sent. 16275 len. 46]: `` I give this dear young couple notice , '' said I , `` that I am only going away to come back to-morrow and that I shall be always coming backwards and forwards until Symond 's Inn is tired of the sight of me .
Parsing [sent. 16276 len. 9]: So I shall not say good-bye , Richard .
Parsing [sent. 16277 len. 21]: For what would be the use of that , you know , when I am coming back so soon ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16278 len. 37]: I had given my darling to him now , and I meant to go ; but I lingered for one more look of the precious face which it seemed to rive my heart to turn from .
Parsing [sent. 16279 len. 71]: So I said -LRB- in a merry , bustling manner -RRB- that unless they gave me some encouragement to come back , I was not sure that I could take that liberty , upon which my dear girl looked up , faintly smiling through her tears , and I folded her lovely face between my hands , and gave it one last kiss , and laughed , and ran away .
Parsing [sent. 16280 len. 12]: And when I got downstairs , oh , how I cried !
Parsing [sent. 16281 len. 14]: It almost seemed to me that I had lost my Ada for ever .
Parsing [sent. 16282 len. 51]: I was so lonely and so blank without her , and it was so desolate to be going home with no hope of seeing her there , that I could get no comfort for a little while as I walked up and down in a dim corner sobbing and crying .
Parsing [sent. 16283 len. 19]: I came to myself by and by , after a little scolding , and took a coach home .
Parsing [sent. 16284 len. 38]: The poor boy whom I had found at St. Albans had reappeared a short time before and was lying at the point of death ; indeed , was then dead , though I did not know it .
Parsing [sent. 16285 len. 16]: My guardian had gone out to inquire about him and did not return to dinner .
Parsing [sent. 16286 len. 26]: Being quite alone , I cried a little again , though on the whole I do n't think I behaved so very , very ill .
Parsing [sent. 16287 len. 19]: It was only natural that I should not be quite accustomed to the loss of my darling yet .
Parsing [sent. 16288 len. 12]: Three or four hours were not a long time after years .
Parsing [sent. 16289 len. 62]: But my mind dwelt so much upon the uncongenial scene in which I had left her , and I pictured it as such an overshadowed stony-hearted one , and I so longed to be near her and taking some sort of care of her , that I determined to go back in the evening only to look up at her windows .
Parsing [sent. 16290 len. 30]: It was foolish , I dare say , but it did not then seem at all so to me , and it does not seem quite so even now .
Parsing [sent. 16291 len. 14]: I took Charley into my confidence , and we went out at dusk .
Parsing [sent. 16292 len. 26]: It was dark when we came to the new strange home of my dear girl , and there was a light behind the yellow blinds .
Parsing [sent. 16293 len. 41]: We walked past cautiously three or four times , looking up , and narrowly missed encountering Mr. Vholes , who came out of his office while we were there and turned his head to look up too before going home .
Parsing [sent. 16294 len. 26]: The sight of his lank black figure and the lonesome air of that nook in the dark were favourable to the state of my mind .
Parsing [sent. 16295 len. 31]: I thought of the youth and love and beauty of my dear girl , shut up in such an ill-assorted refuge , almost as if it were a cruel place .
Parsing [sent. 16296 len. 20]: It was very solitary and very dull , and I did not doubt that I might safely steal upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 16297 len. 26]: I left Charley below and went up with a light foot , not distressed by any glare from the feeble oil lanterns on the way .
Parsing [sent. 16298 len. 28]: I listened for a few moments , and in the musty rotting silence of the house believed that I could hear the murmur of their young voices .
Parsing [sent. 16299 len. 36]: I put my lips to the hearse-like panel of the door as a kiss for my dear and came quietly down again , thinking that one of these days I would confess to the visit .
Parsing [sent. 16300 len. 43]: And it really did me good , for though nobody but Charley and I knew anything about it , I somehow felt as if it had diminished the separation between Ada and me and had brought us together again for those moments .
Parsing [sent. 16301 len. 23]: I went back , not quite accustomed yet to the change , but all the better for that hovering about my darling .
Parsing [sent. 16302 len. 14]: My guardian had come home and was standing thoughtfully by the dark window .
Parsing [sent. 16303 len. 28]: When I went in , his face cleared and he came to his seat , but he caught the light upon my face as I took mine .
Parsing [sent. 16304 len. 15]: `` Little woman , '' said he , `` You have been crying . ''
Parsing [sent. 16305 len. 22]: `` Why , yes , guardian , '' said I , `` I am afraid I have been , a little .
Parsing [sent. 16306 len. 16]: Ada has been in such distress , and is so very sorry , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 16307 len. 31]: I put my arm on the back of his chair , and I saw in his glance that my words and my look at her empty place had prepared him .
Parsing [sent. 16308 len. 9]: `` Is she married , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16309 len. 17]: I told him all about it and how her first entreaties had referred to his forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 16310 len. 12]: `` She has no need of it , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16311 len. 9]: `` Heaven bless her and her husband ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16312 len. 16]: But just as my first impulse had been to pity her , so was his .
Parsing [sent. 16313 len. 7]: `` Poor girl , poor girl !
Parsing [sent. 16314 len. 3]: Poor Rick !
Parsing [sent. 16315 len. 4]: Poor Ada ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16316 len. 22]: Neither of us spoke after that , until he said with a sigh , `` Well , well , my dear !
Parsing [sent. 16317 len. 7]: Bleak House is thinning fast . ''
Parsing [sent. 16318 len. 9]: `` But its mistress remains , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 16319 len. 21]: Though I was timid about saying it , I ventured because of the sorrowful tone in which he had spoken .
Parsing [sent. 16320 len. 24]: `` She will do all she can to make it happy , '' said I. `` She will succeed , my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16321 len. 26]: The letter had made no difference between us except that the seat by his side had come to be mine ; it made none now .
Parsing [sent. 16322 len. 33]: He turned his old bright fatherly look upon me , laid his hand on my hand in his old way , and said again , `` She will succeed , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 16323 len. 13]: Nevertheless , Bleak House is thinning fast , O little woman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16324 len. 13]: I was sorry presently that this was all we said about that .
Parsing [sent. 16325 len. 5]: I was rather disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 16326 len. 21]: I feared I might not quite have been all I had meant to be since the letter and the answer .
Parsing [sent. 16327 len. 51]: Chapter LII -- Obstinacy But one other day had intervened when , early in the morning as we were going to breakfast , Mr. Woodcourt came in haste with the astounding news that a terrible murder had been committed for which Mr. George had been apprehended and was in custody .
Parsing [sent. 16328 len. 61]: When he told us that a large reward was offered by Sir Leicester Dedlock for the murderer 's apprehension , I did not in my first consternation understand why ; but a few more words explained to me that the murdered person was Sir Leicester 's lawyer , and immediately my mother 's dread of him rushed into my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 16329 len. 56]: This unforeseen and violent removal of one whom she had long watched and distrusted and who had long watched and distrusted her , one for whom she could have had few intervals of kindness , always dreading in him a dangerous and secret enemy , appeared so awful that my first thoughts were of her .
Parsing [sent. 16330 len. 16]: How appalling to hear of such a death and be able to feel no pity !
Parsing [sent. 16331 len. 26]: How dreadful to remember , perhaps , that she had sometimes even wished the old man away who was so swiftly hurried out of life !
Parsing [sent. 16332 len. 33]: Such crowding reflections , increasing the distress and fear I always felt when the name was mentioned , made me so agitated that I could scarcely hold my place at the table .
Parsing [sent. 16333 len. 18]: I was quite unable to follow the conversation until I had had a little time to recover .
Parsing [sent. 16334 len. 64]: But when I came to myself and saw how shocked my guardian was and found that they were earnestly speaking of the suspected man and recalling every favourable impression we had formed of him out of the good we had known of him , my interest and my fears were so strongly aroused in his behalf that I was quite set up again .
Parsing [sent. 16335 len. 16]: `` Guardian , you do n't think it possible that he is justly accused ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16336 len. 10]: `` My dear , I CA N'T think so .
Parsing [sent. 16337 len. 52]: This man whom we have seen so open-hearted and compassionate , who with the might of a giant has the gentleness of a child , who looks as brave a fellow as ever lived and is so simple and quiet with it , this man justly accused of such a crime ?
Parsing [sent. 16338 len. 6]: I ca n't believe it .
Parsing [sent. 16339 len. 12]: It 's not that I do n't or I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 16340 len. 5]: I ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16341 len. 11]: `` And I ca n't , '' said Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 16342 len. 23]: `` Still , whatever we believe or know of him , we had better not forget that some appearances are against him .
Parsing [sent. 16343 len. 9]: He bore an animosity towards the deceased gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 16344 len. 9]: He has openly mentioned it in many places .
Parsing [sent. 16345 len. 22]: He is said to have expressed himself violently towards him , and he certainly did about him , to my knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 16346 len. 20]: He admits that he was alone on the scene of the murder within a few minutes of its commission .
Parsing [sent. 16347 len. 29]: I sincerely believe him to be as innocent of any participation in it as I am , but these are all reasons for suspicion falling upon him . ''
Parsing [sent. 16348 len. 8]: `` True , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16349 len. 36]: And he added , turning to me , `` It would be doing him a very bad service , my dear , to shut our eyes to the truth in any of these respects . ''
Parsing [sent. 16350 len. 28]: I felt , of course , that we must admit , not only to ourselves but to others , the full force of the circumstances against him .
Parsing [sent. 16351 len. 25]: Yet I knew withal -LRB- I could not help saying -RRB- that their weight would not induce us to desert him in his need .
Parsing [sent. 16352 len. 5]: `` Heaven forbid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16353 len. 4]: returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16354 len. 21]: `` We will stand by him , as he himself stood by the two poor creatures who are gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 16355 len. 18]: He meant Mr. Gridley and the boy , to both of whom Mr. George had given shelter .
Parsing [sent. 16356 len. 29]: Mr. Woodcourt then told us that the trooper 's man had been with him before day , after wandering about the streets all night like a distracted creature .
Parsing [sent. 16357 len. 17]: That one of the trooper 's first anxieties was that we should not suppose him guilty .
Parsing [sent. 16358 len. 20]: That he had charged his messenger to represent his perfect innocence with every solemn assurance be could send us .
Parsing [sent. 16359 len. 24]: That Mr. Woodcourt had only quieted the man by undertaking to come to our house very early in the morning with these representations .
Parsing [sent. 16360 len. 15]: He added that he was now upon his way to see the prisoner himself .
Parsing [sent. 16361 len. 9]: My guardian said directly he would go too .
Parsing [sent. 16362 len. 34]: Now , besides that I liked the retired soldier very much and that he liked me , I had that secret interest in what had happened which was only known to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16363 len. 12]: I felt as if it came close and near to me .
Parsing [sent. 16364 len. 34]: It seemed to become personally important to myself that the truth should be discovered and that no innocent people should be suspected , for suspicion , once run wild , might run wilder .
Parsing [sent. 16365 len. 19]: In a word , I felt as if it were my duty and obligation to go with them .
Parsing [sent. 16366 len. 13]: My guardian did not seek to dissuade me , and I went .
Parsing [sent. 16367 len. 69]: It was a large prison with many courts and passages so like one another and so uniformly paved that I seemed to gain a new comprehension , as I passed along , of the fondness that solitary prisoners , shut up among the same staring walls from year to year , have had -- as I have read -- for a weed or a stray blade of grass .
Parsing [sent. 16368 len. 44]: In an arched room by himself , like a cellar upstairs , with walls so glaringly white that they made the massive iron window-bars and iron-bound door even more profoundly black than they were , we found the trooper standing in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 16369 len. 20]: He had been sitting on a bench there and had risen when he heard the locks and bolts turn .
Parsing [sent. 16370 len. 25]: When he saw us , he came forward a step with his usual heavy tread , and there stopped and made a slight bow .
Parsing [sent. 16371 len. 20]: But as I still advanced , putting out my hand to him , he understood us in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 16372 len. 33]: `` This is a load off my mind , I do assure you , miss and gentlemen , '' said he , saluting us with great heartiness and drawing a long breath .
Parsing [sent. 16373 len. 14]: `` And now I do n't so much care how it ends . ''
Parsing [sent. 16374 len. 8]: He scarcely seemed to be the prisoner .
Parsing [sent. 16375 len. 18]: What with his coolness and his soldierly bearing , he looked far more like the prison guard .
Parsing [sent. 16376 len. 35]: `` This is even a rougher place than my gallery to receive a lady in , '' said Mr. George , `` but I know Miss Summerson will make the best of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 16377 len. 26]: As he handed me to the bench on which he had been sitting , I sat down , which seemed to give him great satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 16378 len. 11]: `` I thank you , miss , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16379 len. 33]: `` Now , George , '' observed my guardian , `` as we require no new assurances on your part , so I believe we need give you none on ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 16380 len. 7]: `` Not at all , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16381 len. 8]: I thank you with all my heart .
Parsing [sent. 16382 len. 29]: If I was not innocent of this crime , I could n't look at you and keep my secret to myself under the condescension of the present visit .
Parsing [sent. 16383 len. 8]: I feel the present visit very much .
Parsing [sent. 16384 len. 22]: I am not one of the eloquent sort , but I feel it , Miss Summerson and gentlemen , deeply . ''
Parsing [sent. 16385 len. 18]: He laid his hand for a moment on his broad chest and bent his bead to us .
Parsing [sent. 16386 len. 20]: Although he squared himself again directly , he expressed a great amount of natural emotion by these simple means .
Parsing [sent. 16387 len. 21]: `` First , '' said my guardian , `` can we do anything for your personal comfort , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16388 len. 7]: `` For which , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16389 len. 7]: he inquired , clearing his throat .
Parsing [sent. 16390 len. 6]: `` For your personal comfort .
Parsing [sent. 16391 len. 15]: Is there anything you want that would lessen the hardship of this confinement ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16392 len. 38]: `` Well , sir , '' replied George , after a little cogitation , `` I am equally obliged to you , but tobacco being against the rules , I ca n't say that there is . ''
Parsing [sent. 16393 len. 14]: `` You will think of many little things perhaps , by and by .
Parsing [sent. 16394 len. 12]: ` Whenever you do , George , let us know . ''
Parsing [sent. 16395 len. 6]: `` Thank you , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16396 len. 53]: Howsoever , '' observed Mr. George with one of his sunburnt smiles , `` a man who has been knocking about the world in a vagabond kind of a way as long as I have gets on well enough in a place like the present , so far as that goes . ''
Parsing [sent. 16397 len. 13]: `` Next , as to your case , '' observed my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16398 len. 25]: `` Exactly so , sir , '' returned Mr. George , folding his arms upon his breast with perfect self-possession and a little curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 16399 len. 8]: `` How does it stand now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16400 len. 12]: `` Why , sir , it is under remand at present .
Parsing [sent. 16401 len. 26]: Bucket gives me to understand that he will probably apply for a series of remands from time to time until the case is more complete .
Parsing [sent. 16402 len. 25]: How it is to be made more complete I do n't myself see , but I dare say Bucket will manage it somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 16403 len. 35]: `` Why , heaven save us , man , '' exclaimed my guardian , surprised into his old oddity and vehemence , `` you talk of yourself as if you were somebody else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16404 len. 11]: `` No offence , sir , '' said Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 16405 len. 9]: `` I am very sensible of your kindness .
Parsing [sent. 16406 len. 37]: But I do n't see how an innocent man is to make up his mind to this kind of thing without knocking his head against the walls unless he takes it in that point of view .
Parsing [sent. 16407 len. 17]: `` That is true enough to a certain extent , '' returned my guardian , softened .
Parsing [sent. 16408 len. 19]: `` But my good fellow , even an innocent man must take ordinary precautions to defend himself . ''
Parsing [sent. 16409 len. 5]: `` Certainly , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16410 len. 6]: And I have done so .
Parsing [sent. 16411 len. 43]: I have stated to the magistrates , ` Gentlemen , I am as innocent of this charge as yourselves ; what has been stated against me in the way of facts is perfectly true ; I know no more about it . '
Parsing [sent. 16412 len. 9]: I intend to continue stating that , sir .
Parsing [sent. 16413 len. 6]: What more can I do ?
Parsing [sent. 16414 len. 6]: It 's the truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 16415 len. 14]: `` But the mere truth wo n't do , '' rejoined my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16416 len. 8]: `` Wo n't it indeed. , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 16417 len. 8]: Rather a bad look-out for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16418 len. 5]: Mr. George good-humouredly observed .
Parsing [sent. 16419 len. 12]: `` You must have a lawyer , '' pursued my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16420 len. 11]: `` We must engage a good one for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 16421 len. 17]: `` I ask your pardon , sir , '' said Mr. George with a step backward .
Parsing [sent. 16422 len. 6]: `` I am equally obliged .
Parsing [sent. 16423 len. 15]: But I must decidedly beg to be excused from anything of that sort . ''
Parsing [sent. 16424 len. 9]: `` You wo n't have a lawyer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16425 len. 6]: `` No , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 16426 len. 11]: Mr. George shook his head in the most emphatic manner .
Parsing [sent. 16427 len. 16]: `` I thank you all the same , sir , but -- no lawyer ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16428 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16429 len. 15]: `` I do n't take kindly to the breed , '' said Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 16430 len. 5]: `` Gridley did n't .
Parsing [sent. 16431 len. 23]: And -- if you 'll excuse my saying so much -- I should hardly have thought you did yourself , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 16432 len. 24]: `` That 's equity , '' my guardian explained , a little at a loss ; `` that 's equity , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 16433 len. 9]: `` Is it , indeed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16434 len. 8]: returned the trooper in his off-hand manner .
Parsing [sent. 16435 len. 24]: `` I am not acquainted with those shades of names myself , but in a general way I object to the breed . ''
Parsing [sent. 16436 len. 46]: Unfolding his arms and changing his position , he stood with one massive hand upon the table and the other on his hip , as complete a picture of a man who was not to be moved from a fixed purpose as ever I saw .
Parsing [sent. 16437 len. 47]: It was in vain that we all three talked to him and endeavoured to persuade him ; he listened with that gentleness which went so well with his bluff bearing , but was evidently no more shaken by our representations that his place of confinement was .
Parsing [sent. 16438 len. 25]: `` Pray think , once more , Mr. George , '' said I. `` Have you no wish in reference to your case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16439 len. 34]: `` I certainly could wish it to be tried , miss , '' he returned , `` by court-martial ; but that is out of the question , as I am well aware .
Parsing [sent. 16440 len. 37]: If you will be so good as to favour me with your attention for a couple of minutes , miss , not more , I 'll endeavour to explain myself as clearly as I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 16441 len. 39]: He looked at us all three in turn , shook his head a little as if he were adjusting it in the stock and collar of a tight uniform , and after a moment 's reflection went on .
Parsing [sent. 16442 len. 18]: `` You see , miss , I have been handcuffed and taken into custody and brought here .
Parsing [sent. 16443 len. 13]: I am a marked and disgraced man , and here I am .
Parsing [sent. 16444 len. 45]: My shooting gallery is rummaged , high and low , by Bucket ; such property as I have -- 't is small -- is turned this way and that till it do n't know itself ; and -LRB- as aforesaid -RRB- here I am !
Parsing [sent. 16445 len. 8]: I do n't particular complain of that .
Parsing [sent. 16446 len. 40]: Though I am in these present quarters through no immediately preceding fault of mine , I can very well understand that if I had n't gone into the vagabond way in my youth , this would n't have happened .
Parsing [sent. 16447 len. 4]: It HAS happened .
Parsing [sent. 16448 len. 40]: Then comes the question how to meet it '' He rubbed his swarthy forehead for a moment with a good-humoured look and said apologetically , `` I am such a short-winded talker that I must think a bit . ''
Parsing [sent. 16449 len. 12]: Having thought a bit , he looked up again and resumed .
Parsing [sent. 16450 len. 6]: `` How to meet it .
Parsing [sent. 16451 len. 18]: Now , the unfortunate deceased was himself a lawyer and had a pretty tight hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 16452 len. 32]: I do n't wish to rake up his ashes , but he had , what I should call if he was living , a devil of a tight hold of me .
Parsing [sent. 16453 len. 11]: I do n't like his trade the better for that .
Parsing [sent. 16454 len. 17]: If I had kept clear of his trade , I should have kept outside this place .
Parsing [sent. 16455 len. 8]: But that 's not what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 16456 len. 8]: Now , suppose I had killed him .
Parsing [sent. 16457 len. 41]: Suppose I really had discharged into his body any one of those pistols recently fired off that Bucket has found at my place , and dear me , might have found there any day since it has been my place .
Parsing [sent. 16458 len. 15]: What should I have done as soon as I was hard and fast here ?
Parsing [sent. 16459 len. 5]: Got a lawyer . ''
Parsing [sent. 16460 len. 26]: He stopped on hearing some one at the locks and bolts and did not resume until the door had been opened and was shut again .
Parsing [sent. 16461 len. 10]: For what purpose opened , I will mention presently .
Parsing [sent. 16462 len. 48]: `` I should have got a lawyer , and he would have said -LRB- as I have often read in the newspapers -RRB- , ` My client says nothing , my client reserves his defence ' : my client this , that , and t ` other .
Parsing [sent. 16463 len. 27]: Well , 't is not the custom of that breed to go straight , according to my opinion , or to think that other men do .
Parsing [sent. 16464 len. 10]: Say I am innocent and I get a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 16465 len. 15]: He would be as likely to believe me guilty as not ; perhaps more .
Parsing [sent. 16466 len. 9]: What would he do , whether or not ?
Parsing [sent. 16467 len. 35]: Act as if I was -- shut my mouth up , tell me not to commit myself , keep circumstances back , chop the evidence small , quibble , and get me off perhaps !
Parsing [sent. 16468 len. 40]: But , Miss Summerson , do I care for getting off in that way ; or would I rather be hanged in my own way -- if you 'll excuse my mentioning anything so disagreeable to a lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16469 len. 19]: He had warmed into his subject now , and was under no further necessity to wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 16470 len. 11]: `` I would rather be hanged in my own way .
Parsing [sent. 16471 len. 6]: And I mean to be !
Parsing [sent. 16472 len. 36]: I do n't intend to say , '' looking round upon us with his powerful arms akimbo and his dark eyebrows raised , `` that I am more partial to being hanged than another man .
Parsing [sent. 16473 len. 17]: What I say is , I must come off clear and full or not at all .
Parsing [sent. 16474 len. 49]: Therefore , when I hear stated against me what is true , I say it 's true ; and when they tell me , ` whatever you say will be used , ' I tell them I do n't mind that ; I mean it to be used .
Parsing [sent. 16475 len. 29]: If they ca n't make me innocent out of the whole truth , they are not likely to do it out of anything less , or anything else .
Parsing [sent. 16476 len. 13]: And if they are , it 's worth nothing to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 16477 len. 24]: Taking a pace or two over the stone floor , he came back to the table and finished what he had to say .
Parsing [sent. 16478 len. 24]: `` I thank you , miss and gentlemen both , many times for your attention , and many times more for your interest .
Parsing [sent. 16479 len. 26]: That 's the plain state of the matter as it points itself out to a mere trooper with a blunt broadsword kind of a mind .
Parsing [sent. 16480 len. 32]: I have never done well in life beyond my duty as a soldier , and if the worst comes after all , I shall reap pretty much as I have sown .
Parsing [sent. 16481 len. 49]: When I got over the first crash of being seized as a murderer -- it do n't take a rover who has knocked about so much as myself so very long to recover from a crash -- I worked my way round to what you find me now .
Parsing [sent. 16482 len. 6]: As such I shall remain .
Parsing [sent. 16483 len. 26]: No relations will be disgraced by me or made unhappy for me , and -- and that 's all I 've got to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 16484 len. 45]: The door had been opened to admit another soldier-looking man of less prepossessing appearance at first sight and a weather-tanned , bright-eyed wholesome woman with a basket , who , from her entrance , had been exceedingly attentive to all Mr. George had said .
Parsing [sent. 16485 len. 27]: Mr. George had received them with a familiar nod and a friendly look , but without any more particular greeting in the midst of his address .
Parsing [sent. 16486 len. 28]: He now shook them cordially by the hand and said , `` Miss Summerson and gentlemen , this is an old comrade of mine , Matthew Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 16487 len. 10]: And this is his wife , Mrs. Bagnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16488 len. 17]: Mr. Bagnet made us a stiff military bow , and Mrs. Bagnet dropped us a curtsy .
Parsing [sent. 16489 len. 15]: `` Real good friends of mine , they are , '' sald Mr. George .
Parsing [sent. 16490 len. 11]: `` It was at their house I was taken . ''
Parsing [sent. 16491 len. 17]: `` With a second-hand wiolinceller , '' Mr. Bagnet put in , twitching his head angrily .
Parsing [sent. 16492 len. 6]: `` Of a good tone .
Parsing [sent. 16493 len. 4]: For a friend .
Parsing [sent. 16494 len. 8]: That money was no object to . ''
Parsing [sent. 16495 len. 27]: `` Mat , '' said Mr. George , `` you have heard pretty well all I have been saying to this lady and these two gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 16496 len. 8]: I know it meets your approval ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16497 len. 13]: Mr. Bagnet , after considering , referred the point to his wife .
Parsing [sent. 16498 len. 8]: `` Old girl , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16499 len. 4]: `` Tell him .
Parsing [sent. 16500 len. 4]: Whether or not .
Parsing [sent. 16501 len. 6]: It meets my approval . ''
Parsing [sent. 16502 len. 48]: `` Why , George , '' exclaimed Mrs. Bagnet , who had been unpacking her basket , in which there was a piece of cold pickled pork , a little tea and sugar , and a brown loaf , `` you ought to know it do n't .
Parsing [sent. 16503 len. 16]: You ought to know it 's enough to drive a person wild to hear you .
Parsing [sent. 16504 len. 29]: You wo n't be got off this way , and you wo n't be got off that way -- what do you mean by such picking and choosing ?
Parsing [sent. 16505 len. 9]: It 's stuff and nonsense , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 16506 len. 20]: `` Do n't be severe upon me in my misfortunes , Mrs. Bagnet , '' said the trooper lightly .
Parsing [sent. 16507 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 16508 len. 23]: Bother your misfortunes , '' cried Mrs. Bagnet , `` if they do n't make you more reasonable than that comes to .
Parsing [sent. 16509 len. 29]: I never was so ashamed in my life to hear a man talk folly as I have been to hear you talk this day to the present company .
Parsing [sent. 16510 len. 2]: Lawyers ?
Parsing [sent. 16511 len. 36]: Why , what but too many cooks should hinder you from having a dozen lawyers if the gentleman recommended them to you '' `` This is a very sensible woman , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16512 len. 12]: `` I hope you will persuade him , Mrs. Bagnet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16513 len. 7]: `` Persuade him , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16514 len. 3]: she returned .
Parsing [sent. 16515 len. 7]: `` Lord bless you , no .
Parsing [sent. 16516 len. 6]: You do n't know George .
Parsing [sent. 16517 len. 5]: Now , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16518 len. 16]: Mrs. Bagnet left her basket to point him out with both her bare brown hands .
Parsing [sent. 16519 len. 5]: `` There he stands !
Parsing [sent. 16520 len. 25]: As self-willed and as determined a man , in the wrong way , as ever put a human creature under heaven out of patience !
Parsing [sent. 16521 len. 35]: You could as soon take up and shoulder an eight and forty pounder by your own strength as turn that man when he has got a thing into his head and fixed it there .
Parsing [sent. 16522 len. 9]: Why , do n't I know him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16523 len. 4]: cried Mrs. Bagnet .
Parsing [sent. 16524 len. 9]: `` Do n't I know you , George !
Parsing [sent. 16525 len. 22]: You do n't mean to set up for a new character with ME after all these years , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16526 len. 29]: Her friendly indignation had an exemplary effect upon her husband , who shook his head at the trooper several times as a silent recommendation to him to yield .
Parsing [sent. 16527 len. 33]: Between whiles , Mrs. Bagnet looked at me ; and I understood from the play of her eyes that she wished me to do something , though I did not comprehend what .
Parsing [sent. 16528 len. 60]: `` But I have given up talking to you , old fellow , years and years , '' said Mrs. Bagnet as she blew a little dust off the pickled pork , looking at me again ; `` and when ladies and gentlemen know you as well as I do , they 'll give up talking to you too .
Parsing [sent. 16529 len. 19]: If you are not too headstrong to accept of a bit of dinner , here it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 16530 len. 13]: `` I accept it with many thanks , '' returned the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 16531 len. 8]: `` Do you though , indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16532 len. 10]: said Mrs. Bagnet , continuing to grumble on good-humouredly .
Parsing [sent. 16533 len. 21]: `` I 'm sure I 'm surprised at that I wonder you do n't starve in your own way also .
Parsing [sent. 16534 len. 7]: It would only be like you .
Parsing [sent. 16535 len. 11]: Perhaps you 'll set your mind upon THAT next . ''
Parsing [sent. 16536 len. 40]: Here she again looked at me , and I now perceived from her glances at the door and at me , by turns , that she wished us to retire and to await her following us outside the prison .
Parsing [sent. 16537 len. 15]: Communicating this by similar means to my guardian and Mr. Woodcourt , I rose .
Parsing [sent. 16538 len. 35]: `` We hope you will think better of it , Mr. George , '' said I , `` and we shall come to see you again , trusting to find you more reasonable . ''
Parsing [sent. 16539 len. 17]: `` More grateful , Miss Summerson , you ca n't find me , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 16540 len. 50]: `` But more persuadable we can , I hope , '' said I. `` And let me entreat you to consider that the clearing up of this mystery and the discovery of the real perpetrator of this deed may be of the last importance to others besides yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 16541 len. 54]: He heard me respectfully but without much heeding these words , which I spoke a little turned from him , already on my way to the door ; he was observing -LRB- this they afterwards told me -RRB- my height and figure , which seemed to catch his attention all at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 16542 len. 8]: 'T is curious , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 16543 len. 11]: `` And yet I thought so at the time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16544 len. 8]: My guardian asked him what he meant .
Parsing [sent. 16545 len. 56]: `` Why , sir , '' he answered , `` when my ill fortune took me to the dead man 's staircase on the night of his murder , I saw a shape so like Miss Summerson 's go by me in the dark that I had half a mind to speak to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 16546 len. 23]: For an instant I felt such a shudder as I never felt before or since and hope I shall never feel again .
Parsing [sent. 16547 len. 35]: `` It came downstairs as I went up , '' said the trooper , `` and crossed the moonlighted window with a loose black mantle on ; I noticed a deep fringe to it .
Parsing [sent. 16548 len. 31]: However , it has nothing to do with the present subject , excepting that Miss Summerson looked so like it at the moment that it came into my head . ''
Parsing [sent. 16549 len. 69]: I can not separate and define the feelings that arose in me after this ; it is enough that the vague duty and obligation I had felt upon me from the first of following the investigation was , without my distinctly daring to ask myself any question , increased , and that I was indignantly sure of there being no possibility of a reason for my being afraid .
Parsing [sent. 16550 len. 27]: We three went out of the prison and walked up and down at some short distance from the gate , which was in a retired place .
Parsing [sent. 16551 len. 18]: We had not waited long when Mr. and Mrs. Bagnet came out too and quickly joined us .
Parsing [sent. 16552 len. 20]: There was a tear in each of Mrs. Bagnet 's eyes , and her face was flushed and hurried .
Parsing [sent. 16553 len. 42]: `` I did n't let George see what I thought about it , you know , miss , '' was her first remark when she came up , `` but he 's in a bad way , poor old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16554 len. 15]: `` Not with care and prudence and good help , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16555 len. 37]: `` A gentleman like you ought to know best , sir , '' returned Mrs. Bagnet , hurriedly drying her eyes on the hem of her grey cloak , `` but I am uneasy for him .
Parsing [sent. 16556 len. 14]: He has been so careless and said so much that he never meant .
Parsing [sent. 16557 len. 15]: The gentlemen of the juries might not understand him as Lignum and me do .
Parsing [sent. 16558 len. 35]: And then such a number of circumstances have happened bad for him , and such a number of people will be brought forward to speak against him , and Bucket is so deep . ''
Parsing [sent. 16559 len. 6]: `` With a second-hand wiolinceller .
Parsing [sent. 16560 len. 7]: And said he played the fife .
Parsing [sent. 16561 len. 12]: When a boy , '' Mr. Bagnet added with great solemnity .
Parsing [sent. 16562 len. 25]: `` Now , I tell you , miss , '' said Mrs. Bagnet ; `` and when I say miss , I mean all !
Parsing [sent. 16563 len. 15]: Just come into the corner of the wall and I 'll tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16564 len. 28]: Mrs. Bagnet hurried us into a more secluded place and was at first too breathless to proceed , occasioning Mr. Bagnet to say , `` Old girl !
Parsing [sent. 16565 len. 4]: Tell 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16566 len. 49]: `` Why , then , miss , '' the old girl proceeded , untying the strings of her bonnet for more air , `` you could as soon move Dover Castle as move George on this point unless you had got a new power to move him with .
Parsing [sent. 16567 len. 7]: And I have got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16568 len. 14]: `` You are a jewel of a woman , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16569 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16570 len. 40]: `` Now , I tell you , miss , '' she proceeded , clapping her hands in her hurry and agitation a dozen times in every sentence , `` that what he says concerning no relations is all bosh .
Parsing [sent. 16571 len. 14]: They do n't know of him , but he does know of them .
Parsing [sent. 16572 len. 35]: He has said more to me at odd times than to anybody else , and it war n't for nothing that he once spoke to my Woolwich about whitening and wrinkling mothers ' heads .
Parsing [sent. 16573 len. 11]: For fifty pounds he had seen his mother that day .
Parsing [sent. 16574 len. 11]: She 's alive and must be brought here straight ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16575 len. 37]: Instantly Mrs. Bagnet put some pins into her mouth and began pinning up her skirts all round a little higher than the level of her grey cloak , which she accomplished with surpassing dispatch and dexterity .
Parsing [sent. 16576 len. 25]: `` Lignum , '' said Mrs. Bagnet , `` you take care of the children , old man , and give me the umbrella !
Parsing [sent. 16577 len. 13]: I 'm away to Lincolnshire to bring that old lady here . ''
Parsing [sent. 16578 len. 24]: `` But , bless the woman , '' cried my guardian with his hand in his pocket , `` how is she going ?
Parsing [sent. 16579 len. 7]: What money has she got ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16580 len. 33]: Mrs. Bagnet made another application to her skirts and brought forth a leathern purse in which she hastily counted over a few shillings and which she then shut up with perfect satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 16581 len. 9]: `` Never you mind for me , miss .
Parsing [sent. 16582 len. 14]: I 'm a soldier 's wife and accustomed to travel my own way .
Parsing [sent. 16583 len. 19]: Lignum , old boy , '' kissing him , `` one for yourself , three for the children .
Parsing [sent. 16584 len. 12]: Now I 'm away into Lincolnshire after George 's mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16585 len. 17]: And she actually set off while we three stood looking at one another lost in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 16586 len. 22]: She actually trudged away in her grey cloak at a sturdy pace , and turned the corner , and was gone .
Parsing [sent. 16587 len. 9]: `` Mr. Bagnet , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 16588 len. 13]: `` Do you mean to let her go in that way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16589 len. 10]: `` Ca n't help it , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 16590 len. 13]: `` Made her way home once from another quarter of the world .
Parsing [sent. 16591 len. 6]: With the same grey cloak .
Parsing [sent. 16592 len. 4]: And same umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 16593 len. 8]: Whatever the old girl says , do .
Parsing [sent. 16594 len. 3]: Do it !
Parsing [sent. 16595 len. 11]: Whenever the old girl says , I 'LL do it .
Parsing [sent. 16596 len. 5]: She does it . ''
Parsing [sent. 16597 len. 29]: `` Then she is as honest and genuine as she looks , '' rejoined my guardian , `` and it is impossible to say more for her . ''
Parsing [sent. 16598 len. 29]: `` She 's Colour -- Sergeant of the Nonpareil battalion , '' said Mr. Bagnet , looking at us over his shoulder as he went his way also .
Parsing [sent. 16599 len. 8]: `` And there 's not such another .
Parsing [sent. 16600 len. 9]: But I never own to it before her .
Parsing [sent. 16601 len. 6]: Discipline must be maintained . ''
Parsing [sent. 16602 len. 20]: Chapter LIII -- The Track Mr. Bucket and his fat forefinger are much in consultation together under existing circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 16603 len. 29]: When Mr. Bucket has a matter of this pressing interest under his consideration , the fat forefinger seems to rise , to the dignity of a familiar demon .
Parsing [sent. 16604 len. 55]: He puts it to his ears , and it whispers information ; he puts it to his lips , and it enjoins him to secrecy ; he rubs it over his nose , and it sharpens his scent ; he shakes it before a guilty man , and it charms him to his destruction .
Parsing [sent. 16605 len. 30]: The Augurs of the Detective Temple invariably predict that when Mr. Bucket and that finger are in much conference , a terrible avenger will be heard of before long .
Parsing [sent. 16606 len. 54]: Otherwise mildly studious in his observation of human nature , on the whole a benignant philosopher not disposed to be severe upon the follies of mankind , Mr. Bucket pervades a vast number of houses and strolls about an infinity of streets , to outward appearance rather languishing for want of an object .
Parsing [sent. 16607 len. 17]: He is in the friendliest condition towards his species and will drink with most of them .
Parsing [sent. 16608 len. 32]: He is free with his money , affable in his manners , innocent in his conversation -- but through the placid stream of his life there glides an under-current of forefinger .
Parsing [sent. 16609 len. 9]: Time and place can not bind Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16610 len. 29]: Like man in the abstract , he is here to-day and gone to-morrow -- but , very unlike man indeed , he is here again the next day .
Parsing [sent. 16611 len. 52]: This evening he will be casually looking into the iron extinguishers at the door of Sir Leicester Dedlock 's house in town ; and to-morrow morning he will be walking on the leads at Chesney Wold , where erst the old man walked whose ghost is propitiated with a hundred guineas .
Parsing [sent. 16612 len. 16]: Drawers , desks , pockets , all things belonging to him , Mr. Bucket examines .
Parsing [sent. 16613 len. 16]: A few hours afterwards , he and the Roman will be alone together comparing forefingers .
Parsing [sent. 16614 len. 26]: It is likely that these occupations are irreconcilable with home enjoyment , but it is certain that Mr. Bucket at present does not go home .
Parsing [sent. 16615 len. 57]: Though in general he highly appreciates the society of Mrs. Bucket -- a lady of a natural detective genius , which if it had been improved by professional exercise , might have done great things , but which has paused at the level of a clever amateur -- he holds himself aloof from that dear solace .
Parsing [sent. 16616 len. 24]: Mrs. Bucket is dependent on their lodger -LRB- fortunately an amiable lady in whom she takes an interest -RRB- for companionship and conversation .
Parsing [sent. 16617 len. 16]: A great crowd assembles in Lincoln 's Inn Fields on the day of the funeral .
Parsing [sent. 16618 len. 52]: Sir Leicester Dedlock attends the ceremony in person ; strictly speaking , there are only three other human followers , that is to say , Lord Doodle , William Buffy , and the debilitated cousin -LRB- thrown in as a make-weight -RRB- , but the amount of inconsolable carriages is immense .
Parsing [sent. 16619 len. 15]: The peerage contributes more four-wheeled affliction than has ever been seen in that neighbourhood .
Parsing [sent. 16620 len. 29]: Such is the assemblage of armorial bearings on coach panels that the Herald 's College might be supposed to have lost its father and mother at a blow .
Parsing [sent. 16621 len. 44]: The Duke of Foodle sends a splendid pile of dust and ashes , with silver wheel-boxes , patent axles , all the last improvements , and three bereaved worms , six feet high , holding on behind , in a bunch of woe .
Parsing [sent. 16622 len. 42]: All the state coachmen in London seem plunged into mourning ; and if that dead old man of the rusty garb be not beyond a taste in horseflesh -LRB- which appears impossible -RRB- , it must be highly gratified this day .
Parsing [sent. 16623 len. 41]: Quiet among the undertakers and the equipages and the calves of so many legs all steeped in grief , Mr. Bucket sits concealed in one of the inconsolable carriages and at his ease surveys the crowd through the lattice blinds .
Parsing [sent. 16624 len. 14]: He has a keen eye for a crowd -- as for what not ?
Parsing [sent. 16625 len. 38]: -- and looking here and there , now from this side of the carriage , now from the other , now up at the house windows , now along the people 's heads , nothing escapes him .
Parsing [sent. 16626 len. 12]: `` And there you are , my partner , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16627 len. 25]: says Mr. Bucket to himself , apostrophizing Mrs. Bucket , stationed , by his favour , on the steps of the deceased 's house .
Parsing [sent. 16628 len. 6]: `` And so you are .
Parsing [sent. 16629 len. 5]: And so you are !
Parsing [sent. 16630 len. 12]: And very well indeed you are looking , Mrs. Bucket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16631 len. 21]: The procession has not started yet , but is waiting for the cause of its assemblage to be brought out .
Parsing [sent. 16632 len. 27]: Mr. Bucket , in the foremost emblazoned carriage , uses his two fat forefingers to hold the lattice a hair 's breadth open while he looks .
Parsing [sent. 16633 len. 33]: And it says a great deal for his attachment , as a husband , that he is still occupied with Mrs. B. `` There you are , my partner , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16634 len. 4]: he murmuringly repeats .
Parsing [sent. 16635 len. 7]: `` And our lodger with you .
Parsing [sent. 16636 len. 24]: I 'm taking notice of you , Mrs. Bucket ; I hope you 're all right in your health , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16637 len. 32]: Not another word does Mr. Bucket say , but sits with most attentive eyes until the sacked depository of noble secrets is brought down -- Where are all those secrets now ?
Parsing [sent. 16638 len. 6]: Does he keep them yet ?
Parsing [sent. 16639 len. 10]: Did they fly with him on that sudden journey ?
Parsing [sent. 16640 len. 15]: -- and until the procession moves , and Mr. Bucket 's view is changed .
Parsing [sent. 16641 len. 28]: After which he composes himself for an easy ride and takes note of the fittings of the carriage in case he should ever find such knowledge useful .
Parsing [sent. 16642 len. 19]: Contrast enough between Mr. Tulkinghorn shut up in his dark carriage and Mr. Bucket shut up in HIS .
Parsing [sent. 16643 len. 52]: Between the immeasurable track of space beyond the little wound that has thrown the one into the fixed sleep which jolts so heavily over the stones of the streets , and the narrow track of blood which keeps the other in the watchful state expressed in every hair of his head !
Parsing [sent. 16644 len. 14]: But it is all one to both ; neither is troubled about that .
Parsing [sent. 16645 len. 26]: Mr. Bucket sits out the procession in his own easy manner and glides from the carriage when the opportunity he has settled with himself arrives .
Parsing [sent. 16646 len. 58]: He makes for Sir Leicester Dedlock 's , which is at present a sort of home to him , where he comes and goes as he likes at all hours ' , where he is always welcome and made much of , where he knows the whole establishment , and walks in an atmosphere of mysterious greatness .
Parsing [sent. 16647 len. 8]: No knocking or ringing for Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16648 len. 18]: He has caused himself to be provided with a key and can pass in at his pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 16649 len. 32]: As he is crossing the hall , Mercury informs him , `` Here 's another letter for you , Mr. Bucket , come by post , '' and gives it him .
Parsing [sent. 16650 len. 7]: `` Another one , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16651 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16652 len. 29]: If Mercury should chance to be possessed by any lingering curiosity as to Mr. Bucket 's letters , that wary person is not the man to gratify it .
Parsing [sent. 16653 len. 25]: Mr. Bucket looks at him as if his face were a vista of some miles in length and he were leisurely contemplating the same .
Parsing [sent. 16654 len. 10]: `` Do you happen to carry a box ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16655 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16656 len. 6]: Unfortunately Mercury is no snuff-taker .
Parsing [sent. 16657 len. 11]: `` Could you fetch me a pinch from anywheres ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16658 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16659 len. 3]: `` Thankee .
Parsing [sent. 16660 len. 17]: It do n't matter what it is ; I 'm not particular as to the kind .
Parsing [sent. 16661 len. 3]: Thankee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16662 len. 59]: Having leisurely helped himself from a canister borrowed from somebody downstairs for the purpose , and having made a considerable show of tasting it , first with one side of his nose and then with the other , Mr. Bucket , with much deliberation , pronounces it of the right sort and goes on , letter in hand .
Parsing [sent. 16663 len. 41]: Now although Mr. Bucket walks upstairs to the little library within the larger one with the face of a man who receives some scores of letters every day , it happens that much correspondence is not incidental to his life .
Parsing [sent. 16664 len. 44]: He is no great scribe , rather handling his pen like the pocket-staff he carries about with him always convenient to his grasp , and discourages correspondence with himself in others as being too artless and direct a way of doing delicate business .
Parsing [sent. 16665 len. 25]: Further , he often sees damaging letters produced in evidence and has occasion to reflect that it was a green thing to write them .
Parsing [sent. 16666 len. 18]: For these reasons he has very little to do with letters , either as sender or receiver .
Parsing [sent. 16667 len. 14]: And yet he has received a round half-dozen within the last twenty-four hours .
Parsing [sent. 16668 len. 32]: `` And this , '' says Mr. Bucket , spreading it out on the table , `` is in the same hand , and consists of the same two words . ''
Parsing [sent. 16669 len. 4]: What two words ?
Parsing [sent. 16670 len. 39]: He turns the key in the door , ungirdles his black pocket-book -LRB- book of fate to many -RRB- , lays another letter by it , and reads , boldly written in each , `` Lady Dedlock . ''
Parsing [sent. 16671 len. 10]: `` Yes , yes , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16672 len. 14]: `` But I could have made the money without this anonymous information . ''
Parsing [sent. 16673 len. 40]: Having put the letters in his book of fate and girdled it up again , he unlocks the door just in time to admit his dinner , which is brought upon a goodly tray with a decanter of sherry .
Parsing [sent. 16674 len. 35]: Mr. Bucket frequently observes , in friendly circles where there is no restraint , that he likes a toothful of your fine old brown East Inder sherry better than anything you can offer him .
Parsing [sent. 16675 len. 26]: Consequently he fills and empties his glass with a smack of his lips and is proceeding with his refreshment when an idea enters his mind .
Parsing [sent. 16676 len. 18]: Mr. Bucket softly opens the door of communication between that room and the next and looks in .
Parsing [sent. 16677 len. 12]: The library is deserted , and the fire is sinking low .
Parsing [sent. 16678 len. 26]: Mr. Bucket 's eye , after taking a pigeon-flight round the room , alights upon a table where letters are usually put as they arrive .
Parsing [sent. 16679 len. 9]: Several letters for Sir Leicester are upon it .
Parsing [sent. 16680 len. 9]: Mr. Bucket draws near and examines the directions .
Parsing [sent. 16681 len. 15]: `` No , '' he says , `` there 's none in that hand .
Parsing [sent. 16682 len. 9]: It 's only me as is written to .
Parsing [sent. 16683 len. 14]: I can break it to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 16684 len. 25]: With that he returns to finish his dinner with a good appetite , and after a light nap , is summoned into the drawing-room .
Parsing [sent. 16685 len. 19]: Sir Leicester has received him there these several evenings past to know whether he has anything to report .
Parsing [sent. 16686 len. 16]: The debilitated cousin -LRB- much exhausted by the funeral -RRB- and Volumnia are in attendance .
Parsing [sent. 16687 len. 12]: Mr. Bucket makes three distinctly different bows to these three people .
Parsing [sent. 16688 len. 50]: A bow of homage to Sir Leicester , a bow of gallantry to Volumnia , and a bow of recognition to the debilitated Cousin , to whom it airily says , `` You are a swell about town , and you know me , and I know you . ''
Parsing [sent. 16689 len. 15]: Having distributed these little specimens of his tact , Mr. Bucket rubs his hands .
Parsing [sent. 16690 len. 11]: `` Have you anything new to communicate , officer ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16691 len. 4]: inquires Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 16692 len. 14]: `` Do you wish to hold any conversation with me in private ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16693 len. 13]: `` Why -- not tonight , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16694 len. 31]: `` Because my time , '' pursues Sir Leicester , `` is wholly at your disposal with a view to the vindication of the outraged majesty of the law . ''
Parsing [sent. 16695 len. 31]: Mr. Bucket coughs and glances at Volumnia , rouged and necklaced , as though he would respectfully observe , `` I do assure you , you 're a pretty creetur .
Parsing [sent. 16696 len. 17]: I 've seen hundreds worse looking at your time of life , I have indeed . ''
Parsing [sent. 16697 len. 30]: The fair Volumnia , not quite unconscious perhaps of the humanizing influence of her charms , pauses in the writing of cocked-hat notes and meditatively adjusts the pearl necklace .
Parsing [sent. 16698 len. 21]: Mr. Bucket prices that decoration in his mind and thinks it as likely as not that Volumnia is writing poetry .
Parsing [sent. 16699 len. 50]: `` If I have not , '' pursues Sir Leicester , `` in the most emphatic manner , adjured you , officer , to exercise your utmost skill in this atrocious case , I particularly desire to take the present opportunity of rectifying any omission I may have made .
Parsing [sent. 16700 len. 7]: Let no expense be a consideration .
Parsing [sent. 16701 len. 8]: I am prepared to defray all charges .
Parsing [sent. 16702 len. 23]: You can incur none in pursuit of the object you have undertaken that I shall hesitate for a moment to bear . ''
Parsing [sent. 16703 len. 15]: Mr. Bucket made Sir Leicester 's bow again as a response to this liberality .
Parsing [sent. 16704 len. 32]: `` My mind , '' Sir Leicester adds with a generous warmth , `` has not , as may be easily supposed , recovered its tone since the late diabolical occurrence .
Parsing [sent. 16705 len. 10]: It is not likely ever to recover its tone .
Parsing [sent. 16706 len. 30]: But it is full of indignation to-night after undergoing the ordeal of consigning to the tomb the remains of a faithful , a zealous , a devoted adherent . ''
Parsing [sent. 16707 len. 14]: Sir Leicester 's voice trembles and his grey hair stirs upon his head .
Parsing [sent. 16708 len. 15]: Tears are in his eyes ; the best part of his nature is aroused .
Parsing [sent. 16709 len. 41]: `` I declare , '' he says , `` I solemnly declare that until this crime is discovered and , in the course of justice , punished , I almost feel as if there were a stain upon my name .
Parsing [sent. 16710 len. 64]: A gentleman who has devoted a large portion of his life to me , a gentleman who has devoted the last day of his life to me , a gentleman who has constantly sat at my table and slept under my roof , goes from my house to his own , and is struck down within an hour of his leaving my house .
Parsing [sent. 16711 len. 54]: I can not say but that he may have been followed from my house , watched at my house , even first marked because of his association with my house -- which may have suggested his possessing greater wealth and being altogether of greater importance than his own retiring demeanour would have indicated .
Parsing [sent. 16712 len. 50]: If I can not with my means and influence and my position bring all the perpetrators of such a crime to light , I fail in the assertion of my respect for that gentleman 's memory and of my fidelity towards one who was ever faithful to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 16713 len. 51]: While he makes this protestation with great emotion and earnestness , looking round the room as if he were addressing an assembly , Mr. Bucket glances at him with an observant gravity in which there might be , but for the audacity of the thought , a touch of compassion .
Parsing [sent. 16714 len. 67]: `` The ceremony of to-day , '' continues Sir Leicester , `` strikingly illustrative of the respect in which my deceased friend '' -- he lays a stress upon the word , for death levels all distinctions -- `` was held by the flower of the land , has , I say , aggravated the shock I have received from this most horrible and audacious crime .
Parsing [sent. 16715 len. 17]: If it were my brother who had committed it , I would not spare him . ''
Parsing [sent. 16716 len. 6]: Mr. Bucket looks very grave .
Parsing [sent. 16717 len. 14]: Volumnia remarks of the deceased that he was the trustiest and dearest person !
Parsing [sent. 16718 len. 22]: `` You must feel it as a deprivation to you , miss , replies Mr. Bucket soothingly , `` no doubt .
Parsing [sent. 16719 len. 15]: He was calculated to BE a deprivation , I 'm sure he was . ''
Parsing [sent. 16720 len. 52]: Volumnia gives Mr. Bucket to understand , in reply , that her sensitive mind is fully made up never to get the better of it as long as she lives , that her nerves are unstrung for ever , and that she has not the least expectation of ever smiling again .
Parsing [sent. 16721 len. 21]: Meanwhile she folds up a cocked hat for that redoubtable old general at Bath , descriptive of her melancholy condition .
Parsing [sent. 16722 len. 24]: `` It gives a start to a delicate female , '' says Mr. Bucket sympathetically , `` but it 'll wear off . ''
Parsing [sent. 16723 len. 11]: Volumnia wishes of all things to know what is doing ?
Parsing [sent. 16724 len. 16]: Whether they are going to convict , or whatever it is , that dreadful soldier ?
Parsing [sent. 16725 len. 16]: Whether he had any accomplices , or whatever the thing is called in the law ?
Parsing [sent. 16726 len. 11]: And a great deal more to the like artless purpose .
Parsing [sent. 16727 len. 49]: `` Why you see , miss , '' returns Mr. Bucket , bringing the finger into persuasive action -- and such is his natural gallantry that he had almost said `` my dear '' -- `` it ai n't easy to answer those questions at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 16728 len. 6]: Not at the present moment .
Parsing [sent. 16729 len. 36]: I 've kept myself on this case , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' whom Mr. Bucket takes into the conversation in right of his importance , `` morning , noon , and night .
Parsing [sent. 16730 len. 29]: But for a glass or two of sherry , I do n't think I could have had my mind so much upon the stretch as it has been .
Parsing [sent. 16731 len. 13]: I COULD answer your questions , miss , but duty forbids it .
Parsing [sent. 16732 len. 19]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , will very soon be made acquainted with all that has been traced .
Parsing [sent. 16733 len. 22]: And I hope that he may find it '' -- Mr. Bucket again looks grave -- `` to his satisfaction . ''
Parsing [sent. 16734 len. 13]: The debilitated cousin only hopes some fler 'll be executed -- zample .
Parsing [sent. 16735 len. 20]: Thinks more interest 's wanted -- get man hanged presentime -- than get man place ten thousand a year .
Parsing [sent. 16736 len. 16]: Has n't a doubt -- zample -- far better hang wrong fler than no fler .
Parsing [sent. 16737 len. 40]: `` YOU know life , you know , sir , '' says Mr. Bucket with a complimentary twinkle of his eye and crook of his finger , `` and you can confirm what I 've mentioned to this lady .
Parsing [sent. 16738 len. 19]: YOU do n't want to be told that from information I have received I have gone to work .
Parsing [sent. 16739 len. 16]: You 're up to what a lady ca n't be expected to be up to .
Parsing [sent. 16740 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 16741 len. 27]: Especially in your elevated station of society , miss , '' says Mr. Bucket , quite reddening at another narrow escape from `` my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 16742 len. 23]: `` The officer , Volumnia , '' observes Sir Leicester , `` is faithful to his duty , and perfectly right . ''
Parsing [sent. 16743 len. 21]: Mr. Bucket murmurs , `` Glad to have the honour of your approbation , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16744 len. 36]: `` In fact , Volumnia , '' proceeds Sir Leicester , `` it is not holding up a good model for imitation to ask the officer any such questions as you have put to him .
Parsing [sent. 16745 len. 16]: He is the best judge of his own responsibility ; he acts upon his responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 16746 len. 26]: And it does not become us , who assist in making the laws , to impede or interfere with those who carry them into execution .
Parsing [sent. 16747 len. 32]: Or , '' says Sir Leicester somewhat sternly , for Volumnia was going to cut in before he had rounded his sentence , `` or who vindicate their outraged majesty . ''
Parsing [sent. 16748 len. 49]: Volumnia with all humility explains that she had not merely the plea of curiosity to urge -LRB- in common with the giddy youth of her sex in general -RRB- but that she is perfectly dying with regret and interest for the darling man whose loss they all deplore .
Parsing [sent. 16749 len. 11]: `` Very well , Volumnia , '' returns Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 16750 len. 10]: `` Then you can not be too discreet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16751 len. 13]: Mr. Bucket takes the opportunity of a pause to be heard again .
Parsing [sent. 16752 len. 34]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I have no objections to telling this lady , with your leave and among ourselves , that I look upon the case as pretty well complete .
Parsing [sent. 16753 len. 32]: It is a beautiful case -- a beautiful case -- and what little is wanting to complete it , I expect to be able to supply in a few hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 16754 len. 15]: `` I am very glad indeed to hear it , '' says Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 16755 len. 7]: `` Highly creditable to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 16756 len. 34]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' returns Mr. Bucket very seriously , `` I hope it may at one and the same time do me credit and prove satisfactory to all .
Parsing [sent. 16757 len. 35]: When I depict it as a beautiful case , you see , miss , '' Mr. Bucket goes on , glancing gravely at Sir Leicester , `` I mean from my point of view .
Parsing [sent. 16758 len. 18]: As considered from other points of view , such cases will always involve more or less unpleasantness .
Parsing [sent. 16759 len. 27]: Very strange things comes to our knowledge in families , miss ; bless your heart , what you would think to be phenomenons , quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 16760 len. 11]: Volumnia , with her innocent little scream , supposes so .
Parsing [sent. 16761 len. 29]: `` Aye , and even in gen-teel families , in high families , in great families , '' says Mr. Bucket , again gravely eyeing Sir Leicester aside .
Parsing [sent. 16762 len. 53]: `` I have had the honour of being employed in high families before , and you have no idea -- come , I 'll go so far as to say not even YOU have any idea , sir , '' this to the debilitated cousin , `` what games goes on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16763 len. 32]: The cousin , who has been casting sofa-pillows on his head , in a prostration of boredom yawns , `` Vayli , '' being the used-up for `` very likely . ''
Parsing [sent. 16764 len. 22]: Sir Leicester , deeming it time to dismiss the officer , here majestically interposes with the words , `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 16765 len. 4]: Thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16766 len. 36]: and also with a wave of his hand , implying not only that there is an end of the discourse , but that if high families fall into low habits they must take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 16767 len. 26]: `` You will not forget , officer , '' he adds with condescension , `` that I am at your disposal when you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 16768 len. 31]: Mr. Bucket -LRB- still grave -RRB- inquires if to-morrow morning , now , would suit , in case he should be as for ` ard as he expects to be .
Parsing [sent. 16769 len. 13]: Sir Leicester replies , `` All times are alike to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 16770 len. 17]: Mr. Bucket makes his three bows and is withdrawing when a forgotten point occurs to him .
Parsing [sent. 16771 len. 30]: `` Might I ask , by the by , '' he says in a low voice , cautiously returning , `` who posted the reward-bill on the staircase . ''
Parsing [sent. 16772 len. 15]: `` I ordered it to be put up there , '' replies Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 16773 len. 23]: `` Would it be considered a liberty , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , if I was to ask you why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16774 len. 5]: `` Not at all .
Parsing [sent. 16775 len. 11]: I chose it as a conspicuous part of the house .
Parsing [sent. 16776 len. 14]: I think it can not be too prominently kept before the whole establishment .
Parsing [sent. 16777 len. 26]: I wish my people to be impressed with the enormity of the crime , the determination to punish it , and the hopelessness of escape .
Parsing [sent. 16778 len. 41]: At the same time , officer , if you in your better knowledge of the subject see any objection -- '' Mr. Bucket sees none now ; the bill having been put up , had better not be taken down .
Parsing [sent. 16779 len. 34]: Repeating his three bows he withdraws , closing the door on Volumnia 's little scream , which is a preliminary to her remarking that that charmingly horrible person is a perfect Blue Chamber .
Parsing [sent. 16780 len. 33]: In his fondness for society and his adaptability to all grades , Mr. Bucket is presently standing before the hall-fire -- bright and warm on the early winter night -- admiring Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 16781 len. 13]: `` Why , you 're six foot two , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16782 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16783 len. 7]: `` Three , '' says Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 16784 len. 6]: `` Are you so much ?
Parsing [sent. 16785 len. 17]: But then , you see , you 're broad in proportion and do n't look it .
Parsing [sent. 16786 len. 13]: You 're not one of the weak-legged ones , you ai n't .
Parsing [sent. 16787 len. 7]: Was you ever modelled now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16788 len. 19]: Mr. Bucket asks , conveying the expression of an artist into the turn of his eye and head .
Parsing [sent. 16789 len. 5]: Mercury never was modelled .
Parsing [sent. 16790 len. 48]: `` Then you ought to be , you know , '' says Mr. Bucket ; `` and a friend of mine that you 'll hear of one day as a Royal Academy sculptor would stand something handsome to make a drawing of your proportions for the marble .
Parsing [sent. 16791 len. 10]: My Lady 's out , ai n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16792 len. 6]: `` Out to dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 16793 len. 13]: `` Goes out pretty well every day , do n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16794 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 16795 len. 8]: `` Not to be wondered at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16796 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16797 len. 31]: `` Such a fine woman as her , so handsome and so graceful and so elegant , is like a fresh lemon on a dinner-table , ornamental wherever she goes .
Parsing [sent. 16798 len. 13]: Was your father in the same way of life as yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16799 len. 5]: Answer in the negative .
Parsing [sent. 16800 len. 9]: `` Mine was , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16801 len. 24]: `` My father was first a page , then a footman , then a butler , then a steward , then an inn-keeper .
Parsing [sent. 16802 len. 8]: Lived universally respected , and died lamented .
Parsing [sent. 16803 len. 22]: Said with his last breath that he considered service the most honourable part of his career , and so it was .
Parsing [sent. 16804 len. 11]: I 've a brother in service , AND a brother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 16805 len. 7]: My Lady a good temper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16806 len. 12]: Mercury replies , `` As good as you can expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 16807 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16808 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16809 len. 5]: `` A little spoilt ?
Parsing [sent. 16810 len. 4]: A little capricious ?
Parsing [sent. 16811 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 16812 len. 12]: What can you anticipate when they 're so handsome as that ?
Parsing [sent. 16813 len. 15]: And we like 'em all the better for it , do n't we ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16814 len. 33]: Mercury , with his hands in the pockets of his bright peach-blossom small-clothes , stretches his symmetrical silk legs with the air of a man of gallantry and ca n't deny it .
Parsing [sent. 16815 len. 13]: Come the roll of wheels and a violent ringing at the bell .
Parsing [sent. 16816 len. 11]: `` Talk of the angels , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16817 len. 6]: `` Here she is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16818 len. 13]: The doors are thrown open , and she passes through the hall .
Parsing [sent. 16819 len. 16]: Still very pale , she is dressed in slight mourning and wears two beautiful bracelets .
Parsing [sent. 16820 len. 16]: Either their beauty or the beauty of her arms is particularly attractive to Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16821 len. 18]: He looks at them with an eager eye and rattles something in his pocket -- halfpence perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 16822 len. 21]: Noticing him at his distance , she turns an inquiring look on the other Mercury who has brought her home .
Parsing [sent. 16823 len. 8]: `` Mr. Bucket , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 16824 len. 20]: Mr. Bucket makes a leg and comes forward , passing his familiar demon over the region of his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 16825 len. 10]: `` Are you waiting to see Sir Leicester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16826 len. 12]: `` No , my Lady , I 've seen him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16827 len. 10]: `` Have you anything to say to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16828 len. 10]: `` Not just at present , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 16829 len. 9]: `` Have you made any new discoveries ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16830 len. 8]: `` A few , my Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 16831 len. 6]: This is merely in passing .
Parsing [sent. 16832 len. 11]: She scarcely makes a stop , and sweeps upstairs alone .
Parsing [sent. 16833 len. 55]: Mr. Bucket , moving towards the staircase-foot , watches her as she goes up the steps the old man came down to his grave , past murderous groups of statuary repeated with their shadowy weapons on the wall , past the printed bill , which she looks at going by , out of view .
Parsing [sent. 16834 len. 23]: `` She 's a lovely woman , too , she really is , '' says Mr. Bucket , coming back to Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 16835 len. 9]: `` Do n't look quite healthy though . ''
Parsing [sent. 16836 len. 9]: Is not quite healthy , Mercury informs him .
Parsing [sent. 16837 len. 5]: Suffers much from headaches .
Parsing [sent. 16838 len. 2]: Really ?
Parsing [sent. 16839 len. 5]: That 's a pity !
Parsing [sent. 16840 len. 9]: Walking , Mr. Bucket would recommend for that .
Parsing [sent. 16841 len. 9]: Well , she tries walking , Mercury rejoins .
Parsing [sent. 16842 len. 11]: Walks sometimes for two hours when she has them bad .
Parsing [sent. 16843 len. 5]: By night , too .
Parsing [sent. 16844 len. 15]: `` Are you sure you 're quite so much as six foot three ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16845 len. 4]: asks Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16846 len. 11]: `` Begging your pardon for interrupting you a moment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16847 len. 6]: Not a doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 16848 len. 15]: `` You 're so well put together that I should n't have thought it .
Parsing [sent. 16849 len. 15]: But the household troops , though considered fine men , are built so straggling .
Parsing [sent. 16850 len. 7]: Walks by night , does she ?
Parsing [sent. 16851 len. 8]: When it 's moonlight , though ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16852 len. 4]: Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 16853 len. 5]: When it 's moonlight !
Parsing [sent. 16854 len. 3]: Of course .
Parsing [sent. 16855 len. 5]: Oh , of course !
Parsing [sent. 16856 len. 7]: Conversational and acquiescent on both sides .
Parsing [sent. 16857 len. 14]: `` I suppose you ai n't in the habit of walking yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16858 len. 4]: says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16859 len. 12]: `` Not much time for it , I should say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16860 len. 9]: Besides which , Mercury do n't like it .
Parsing [sent. 16861 len. 4]: Prefers carriage exercise .
Parsing [sent. 16862 len. 10]: `` To be sure , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16863 len. 6]: `` That makes a difference .
Parsing [sent. 16864 len. 34]: Now I think of it , '' says Mr. Bucket , warming his hands and looking pleasantly at the blaze , `` she went out walking the very night of this business . ''
Parsing [sent. 16865 len. 7]: `` To be sure she did !
Parsing [sent. 16866 len. 10]: I let her into the garden over the way .
Parsing [sent. 16867 len. 6]: `` And left her there .
Parsing [sent. 16868 len. 4]: Certainly you did .
Parsing [sent. 16869 len. 7]: I saw you doing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 16870 len. 11]: `` I did n't see YOU , '' says Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 16871 len. 58]: `` I was rather in a hurry , '' returns Mr. Bucket , `` for I was going to visit a aunt of mine that lives at Chelsea -- next door but two to the old original Bun House -- ninety year old the old lady is , a single woman , and got a little property .
Parsing [sent. 16872 len. 11]: Yes , I chanced to be passing at the time .
Parsing [sent. 16873 len. 4]: Let 's see .
Parsing [sent. 16874 len. 6]: What time might it be ?
Parsing [sent. 16875 len. 6]: It was n't ten . ''
Parsing [sent. 16876 len. 5]: `` Half-past nine . ''
Parsing [sent. 16877 len. 5]: `` You 're right .
Parsing [sent. 16878 len. 4]: So it was .
Parsing [sent. 16879 len. 26]: And if I do n't deceive myself , my Lady was muffled in a loose black mantle , with a deep fringe to it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16880 len. 7]: `` Of course she was . ''
Parsing [sent. 16881 len. 5]: Of course she was .
Parsing [sent. 16882 len. 67]: Mr. Bucket must return to a little work he has to get on with upstairs , but he must shake hands with Mercury in acknowledgment of his agreeable conversation , and will he -- this is all he asks -- will he , when he has a leisure half-hour , think of bestowing it on that Royal Academy sculptor , for the advantage of both parties ?
Parsing [sent. 16883 len. 23]: Chapter LIV -- Springing a Mine Refreshed by sleep , Mr. Bucket rises betimes in the morning and prepares for a field-day .
Parsing [sent. 16884 len. 71]: Smartened up by the aid of a clean shirt and a wet hairbrush , with which instrument , on occasions of ceremony , he lubricates such thin locks as remain to him after his life of severe study , Mr. Bucket lays in a breakfast of two mutton chops as a foundation to work upon , together with tea , eggs , toast , and marmalade on a corresponding scale .
Parsing [sent. 16885 len. 47]: Having much enjoyed these strengthening matters and having held subtle conference with his familiar demon , he confidently instructs Mercury `` just to mention quietly to Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , that whenever he 's ready for me , I 'm ready for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 16886 len. 47]: A gracious message being returned that Sir Leicester will expedite his dressing and join Mr. Bucket in the library within ten minutes , Mr. Bucket repairs to that apartment and stands before the fire with his finger on his chin , looking at the blazing coals .
Parsing [sent. 16887 len. 23]: Thoughtful Mr. Bucket is , as a man may be with weighty work to do , but composed , sure , confident .
Parsing [sent. 16888 len. 51]: From the expression of his face he might be a famous whist-player for a large stake -- say a hundred guineas certain -- with the game in his hand , but with a high reputation involved in his playing his hand out to the last card in a masterly way .
Parsing [sent. 16889 len. 55]: Not in the least anxious or disturbed is Mr. Bucket when Sir Leicester appears , but he eyes the baronet aside as he comes slowly to his easy-chair with that observant gravity of yesterday in which there might have been yesterday , but for the audacity of the idea , a touch of compassion .
Parsing [sent. 16890 len. 24]: `` I am sorry to have kept you waiting , officer , but I am rather later than my usual hour this morning .
Parsing [sent. 16891 len. 5]: I am not well .
Parsing [sent. 16892 len. 18]: The agitation and the indignation from which I have recently suffered have been too much for me .
Parsing [sent. 16893 len. 43]: I am subject to -- gout '' -- Sir Leicester was going to say indisposition and would have said it to anybody else , but Mr. Bucket palpably knows all about it -- `` and recent circumstances have brought it on . ''
Parsing [sent. 16894 len. 33]: As he takes his seat with some difficulty and with an air of pain , Mr. Bucket draws a little nearer , standing with one of his large hands on the library-table .
Parsing [sent. 16895 len. 37]: `` I am not aware , officer , '' Sir Leicester observes ; raising his eyes to his face , `` whether you wish us to be alone , but that is entirely as you please .
Parsing [sent. 16896 len. 8]: If you do , well and good .
Parsing [sent. 16897 len. 52]: If not , Miss Dedlock would be interested -- '' `` Why , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' returns Mr. Bucket with his head persuasively on one side and his forefinger pendant at one ear like an earring , `` we ca n't be too private just at present .
Parsing [sent. 16898 len. 12]: You will presently see that we ca n't be too private .
Parsing [sent. 16899 len. 53]: A lady , under the circumstances , and especially in Miss Dedlock 's elevated station of society , ca n't but be agreeable to me , but speaking without a view to myself , I will take the liberty of assuring you that I know we ca n't be too private . ''
Parsing [sent. 16900 len. 6]: `` That is enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 16901 len. 36]: `` So much so , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' Mr. Bucket resumes , `` that I was on the point of asking your permission to turn the key in the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 16902 len. 6]: `` By all means . ''
Parsing [sent. 16903 len. 40]: Mr. Bucket skilfully and softly takes that precaution , stooping on his knee for a moment from mere force of habit so to adjust the key in the lock as that no one shall peep in from the outerside .
Parsing [sent. 16904 len. 23]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I mentioned yesterday evening that I wanted but a very little to complete this case .
Parsing [sent. 16905 len. 17]: I have now completed it and collected proof against the person who did this crime . ''
Parsing [sent. 16906 len. 6]: `` Against the soldier ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16907 len. 12]: `` No , Sir Leicester Dedlock ; not the soldier . ''
Parsing [sent. 16908 len. 15]: Sir Leicester looks astounded and inquires , `` Is the man in custody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16909 len. 16]: Mr. Bucket tells him , after a pause , `` It was a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 16910 len. 17]: Sir Leicester leans back in his chair , and breathlessly ejaculates , `` Good heaven ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16911 len. 67]: `` Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' Mr. Bucket begins , standing over him with one hand spread out on the library-table and the forefinger of the other in impressive use , `` it 's my duty to prepare you for a train of circumstances that may , and I go so far as to say that will , give you a shock .
Parsing [sent. 16912 len. 27]: But Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , you are a gentleman , and I know what a gentleman is and what a gentleman is capable of .
Parsing [sent. 16913 len. 15]: A gentleman can bear a shock when it must come , boldly and steadily .
Parsing [sent. 16914 len. 15]: A gentleman can make up his mind to stand up against almost any blow .
Parsing [sent. 16915 len. 11]: Why , take yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Parsing [sent. 16916 len. 18]: If there 's a blow to be inflicted on you , you naturally think of your family .
Parsing [sent. 16917 len. 58]: You ask yourself , how would all them ancestors of yours , away to Julius Caesar -- not to go beyond him at present -- have borne that blow ; you remember scores of them that would have borne it well ; and you bear it well on their accounts , and to maintain the family credit .
Parsing [sent. 16918 len. 22]: That 's the way you argue , and that 's the way you act , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ''
Parsing [sent. 16919 len. 22]: Sir Leicester , leaning back in his chair and grasping the elbows , sits looking at him with a stony face .
Parsing [sent. 16920 len. 39]: `` Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , '' proceeds Mr. Bucket , `` thus preparing you , let me beg of you not to trouble your mind for a moment as to anything having come to MY knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 16921 len. 27]: I know so much about so many characters , high and low , that a piece of information more or less do n't signify a straw .
Parsing [sent. 16922 len. 59]: I do n't suppose there 's a move on the board that would surprise ME , and as to this or that move having taken place , why my knowing it is no odds at all , any possible move whatever -LRB- provided it 's in a wrong direction -RRB- being a probable move according to my experience .
Parsing [sent. 16923 len. 40]: Therefore , what I say to you , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , is , do n't you go and let yourself be put out of the way because of my knowing anything of your family affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 16924 len. 43]: `` I thank you for your preparation , '' returns Sir Leicester after a silence , without moving hand , foot , or feature , `` which I hope is not necessary ; though I give it credit for being well intended .
Parsing [sent. 16925 len. 8]: Be so good as to go on .
Parsing [sent. 16926 len. 30]: Also '' -- Sir Leicester seems to shrink in the shadow of his figure -- `` also , to take a seat , if you have no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 16927 len. 4]: None at all .
Parsing [sent. 16928 len. 10]: Mr. Bucket brings a chair and diminishes his shadow .
Parsing [sent. 16929 len. 19]: `` Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , with this short preface I come to the point .
Parsing [sent. 16930 len. 17]: Lady Dedlock -- '' Sir Leicester raises himself in his seat and stares at him fiercely .
Parsing [sent. 16931 len. 11]: Mr. Bucket brings the finger into play as an emollient .
Parsing [sent. 16932 len. 11]: `` Lady Dedlock , you see she 's universally admired .
Parsing [sent. 16933 len. 17]: That 's what her ladyship is ; she 's universally admired , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 16934 len. 27]: `` I would greatly prefer , officer , '' Sir Leicester returns stiffly , `` my Lady 's name being entirely omitted from this discussion . ''
Parsing [sent. 16935 len. 18]: `` So would I , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , but -- it 's impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 16936 len. 4]: `` Impossible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16937 len. 7]: Mr. Bucket shakes his relentless head .
Parsing [sent. 16938 len. 12]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it 's altogether impossible .
Parsing [sent. 16939 len. 11]: What I have got to say is about her ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 16940 len. 10]: She is the pivot it all turns on . ''
Parsing [sent. 16941 len. 22]: `` Officer , '' retorts Sir Leicester with a fiery eye and a quivering lip , `` you know your duty .
Parsing [sent. 16942 len. 12]: Do your duty , but be careful not to overstep it .
Parsing [sent. 16943 len. 6]: I would not suffer it .
Parsing [sent. 16944 len. 6]: I would not endure it .
Parsing [sent. 16945 len. 17]: You bring my Lady 's name into this communication upon your responsibility -- upon your responsibility .
Parsing [sent. 16946 len. 16]: My Lady 's name is not a name for common persons to trifle with ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16947 len. 19]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I say what I must say , and no more . ''
Parsing [sent. 16948 len. 8]: `` I hope it may prove so .
Parsing [sent. 16949 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 16950 len. 3]: Go on .
Parsing [sent. 16951 len. 6]: Go on , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16952 len. 41]: Glancing at the angry eyes which now avoid him and at the angry figure trembling from head to foot , yet striving to be still , Mr. Bucket feels his way with his forefinger and in a low voice proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 16953 len. 29]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it becomes my duty to tell you that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn long entertained mistrusts and suspicions of Lady Dedlock . ''
Parsing [sent. 16954 len. 26]: `` If he had dared to breathe them to me , sir -- which he never did -- I would have killed him myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16955 len. 11]: exclaims Sir Leicester , striking his hand upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 16956 len. 40]: But in the very heat and fury of the act he stops , fixed by the knowing eyes of Mr. Bucket , whose forefinger is slowly going and who , with mingled confidence and patience , shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 16957 len. 36]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was deep and close , and what he fully had in his mind in the very beginning I ca n't quite take upon myself to say .
Parsing [sent. 16958 len. 71]: But I know from his lips that he long ago suspected Lady Dedlock of having discovered , through the sight of some handwriting -- in this very house , and when you yourself , Sir Leicester Dedlock , were present -- the existence , in great poverty , of a certain person who had been her lover before you courted her and who ought to have been her husband . ''
Parsing [sent. 16959 len. 21]: Mr. Bucket stops and deliberately repeats , `` Ought to have been her husband , not a doubt about it .
Parsing [sent. 16960 len. 32]: I know from his lips that when that person soon afterwards died , he suspected Lady Dedlock of visiting his wretched lodging and his wretched grave , alone and in secret .
Parsing [sent. 16961 len. 65]: I know from my own inquiries and through my eyes and ears that Lady Dedlock did make such visit in the dress of her own maid , for the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn employed me to reckon up her ladyship -- if you 'll excuse my making use of the term we commonly employ -- and I reckoned her up , so far , completely .
Parsing [sent. 16962 len. 47]: I confronted the maid in the chambers in Lincoln 's Inn Fields with a witness who had been Lady Dedlock 's guide , and there could n't be the shadow of a doubt that she had worn the young woman 's dress , unknown to her .
Parsing [sent. 16963 len. 33]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I did endeavour to pave the way a little towards these unpleasant disclosures yesterday by saying that very strange things happened even in high families sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 16964 len. 21]: All this , and more , has happened in your own family , and to and through your own Lady .
Parsing [sent. 16965 len. 38]: It 's my belief that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn followed up these inquiries to the hour of his death and that he and Lady Dedlock even had bad blood between them upon the matter that very night .
Parsing [sent. 16966 len. 61]: Now , only you put that to Lady Dedlock , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and ask her ladyship whether , even after he had left here , she did n't go down to his chambers with the intention of saying something further to him , dressed in a loose black mantle with a deep fringe to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 16967 len. 21]: Sir Leicester sits like a statue , gazing at the cruel finger that is probing the life-blood of his heart .
Parsing [sent. 16968 len. 23]: `` You put that to her ladyship , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , from me , Inspector Bucket of the Detective .
Parsing [sent. 16969 len. 59]: And if her ladyship makes any difficulty about admitting of it , you tell her that it 's no use , that Inspector Bucket knows it and knows that she passed the soldier as you called him -LRB- though he 's not in the army now -RRB- and knows that she knows she passed him on the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 16970 len. 16]: Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , why do I relate all this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16971 len. 25]: Sir Leicester , who has covered his face with his hands , uttering a single groan , requests him to pause for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 16972 len. 43]: By and by he takes his hands away , and so preserves his dignity and outward calmness , though there is no more colour in his face than in his white hair , that Mr. Bucket is a little awed by him .
Parsing [sent. 16973 len. 48]: Something frozen and fixed is upon his manner , over and above its usual shell of haughtiness , and Mr. Bucket soon detects an unusual slowness in his speech , with now and then a curious trouble in beginning , which occasions him to utter inarticulate sounds .
Parsing [sent. 16974 len. 56]: With such sounds he now breaks silence , soon , however , controlling himself to say that he does not comprehend why a gentleman so faithful and zealous as the late Mr. Tulkinghorn should have communicated to him nothing of this painful , this distressing , this unlooked-for , this overwhelming , this incredible intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 16975 len. 25]: `` Again , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' returns Mr. Bucket , `` put it to her ladyship to clear that up .
Parsing [sent. 16976 len. 19]: Put it to her ladyship , if you think it right , from Inspector Bucket of the Detective .
Parsing [sent. 16977 len. 45]: You 'll find , or I 'm much mistaken , that the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn had the intention of communicating the whole to you as soon as he considered it ripe , and further , that he had given her ladyship so to understand .
Parsing [sent. 16978 len. 19]: Why , he might have been going to reveal it the very morning when I examined the body !
Parsing [sent. 16979 len. 51]: You do n't know what I 'm going to say and do five minutes from this present time , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ; and supposing I was to be picked off now , you might wonder why I had n't done it , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16980 len. 2]: True .
Parsing [sent. 16981 len. 18]: Sir Leicester , avoiding , with some trouble those obtrusive sounds , says , `` True . ''
Parsing [sent. 16982 len. 14]: At this juncture a considerable noise of voices is heard in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 16983 len. 21]: Mr. Bucket , after listening , goes to the library-door , softly unlocks and opens it , and listens again .
Parsing [sent. 16984 len. 43]: Then he draws in his head and whispers hurriedly but composedly , `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this unfortunate family affair has taken air , as I expected it might , the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn being cut down so sudden .
Parsing [sent. 16985 len. 19]: The chance to hush it is to let in these people now in a wrangle with your footmen .
Parsing [sent. 16986 len. 17]: Would you mind sitting quiet -- on the family account -- while I reckon 'em up ?
Parsing [sent. 16987 len. 18]: And would you just throw in a nod when I seem to ask you for it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 16988 len. 8]: Sir Leicester indistinctly answers , `` Officer .
Parsing [sent. 16989 len. 11]: The best you can , the best you can ! ''
Parsing [sent. 16990 len. 28]: and Mr. Bucket , with a nod and a sagacious crook of the forefinger , slips down into the hall , where the voices quickly die away .
Parsing [sent. 16991 len. 38]: He is not long in returning ; a few paces ahead of Mercury and a brother deity also powdered and in peach-blossomed smalls , who bear between them a chair in which is an incapable old man .
Parsing [sent. 16992 len. 8]: Another man and two women come behind .
Parsing [sent. 16993 len. 24]: Directing the pitching of the chair in an affable and easy manner , Mr. Bucket dismisses the Mercuries and locks the door again .
Parsing [sent. 16994 len. 16]: Sir Leicester looks on at this invasion of the sacred precincts with an icy stare .
Parsing [sent. 16995 len. 22]: `` Now , perhaps you may know me , ladies and gentlemen , '' says Mr. Bucket in a confidential voice .
Parsing [sent. 16996 len. 33]: `` I am Inspector Bucket of the Detective , I am ; and this , '' producing the tip of his convenient little staff from his breast-pocket , `` is my authority .
Parsing [sent. 16997 len. 12]: Now , you wanted to see Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Parsing [sent. 16998 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 16999 len. 21]: You do see him , and mind you , it ai n't every one as is admitted to that honour .
Parsing [sent. 17000 len. 22]: Your name , old gentleman , is Smallweed ; that 's what your name is ; I know it well . ''
Parsing [sent. 17001 len. 13]: `` Well , and you never heard any harm of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17002 len. 9]: cries Mr. Smallweed in a shrill loud voice .
Parsing [sent. 17003 len. 17]: `` You do n't happen to know why they killed the pig , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17004 len. 14]: retorts Mr. Bucket with a steadfast look , but without loss of temper .
Parsing [sent. 17005 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17006 len. 22]: `` Why , they killed him , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` on account of his having so much cheek .
Parsing [sent. 17007 len. 17]: Do n't YOU get into the same position , because it is n't worthy of you .
Parsing [sent. 17008 len. 17]: You ai n't in the habit of conversing with a deaf person , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17009 len. 15]: `` Yes , '' snarls Mr. Smallweed , `` my wife 's deaf . ''
Parsing [sent. 17010 len. 11]: `` That accounts for your pitching your voice so high .
Parsing [sent. 17011 len. 42]: But as she ai n't here ; just pitch it an octave or two lower , will you , and I 'll not only be obliged to you , but it 'll do you more credit , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17012 len. 14]: `` This other gentleman is in the preaching line , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17013 len. 19]: `` Name of Chadband , '' Mr. Smallweed puts in , speaking henceforth in a much lower key .
Parsing [sent. 17014 len. 31]: `` Once had a friend and brother serjeant of the same name , '' says Mr. Bucket , offering his hand , `` and consequently feel a liking for it .
Parsing [sent. 17015 len. 7]: Mrs. Chadband , no doubt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17016 len. 10]: `` And Mrs. Snagsby , '' Mr. Smallweed introduces .
Parsing [sent. 17017 len. 16]: `` Husband a law-stationer and a friend of my own , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17018 len. 7]: `` Love him like a brother !
Parsing [sent. 17019 len. 7]: Now , what 's up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17020 len. 12]: `` Do you mean what business have we come upon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17021 len. 14]: Mr. Smallweed asks , a little dashed by the suddenness of this turn .
Parsing [sent. 17022 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 17023 len. 6]: You know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 17024 len. 17]: Let us hear what it 's all about in presence of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Parsing [sent. 17025 len. 3]: Come . ''
Parsing [sent. 17026 len. 18]: Mr. Smallweed , beckoning Mr. Chadband , takes a moment 's counsel with him in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 17027 len. 28]: Mr. Chadband , expressing a considerable amount of oil from the pores of his forehead and the palms of his hands , says aloud , `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 17028 len. 4]: You first ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17029 len. 7]: and retires to his former place .
Parsing [sent. 17030 len. 24]: `` I was the client and friend of Mr. Tulkinghorn , '' pipes Grandfather Smallweed then ; `` I did business with him .
Parsing [sent. 17031 len. 13]: I was useful to him , and he was useful to me .
Parsing [sent. 17032 len. 10]: Krook , dead and gone , was my brother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 17033 len. 13]: He was own brother to a brimstone magpie -- leastways Mrs. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 17034 len. 7]: I come into Krook 's property .
Parsing [sent. 17035 len. 10]: I examined all his papers and all his effects .
Parsing [sent. 17036 len. 9]: They was all dug out under my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 17037 len. 37]: There was a bundle of letters belonging to a dead and gone lodger as was hid away at the back of a shelf in the side of Lady Jane 's bed -- his cat 's bed .
Parsing [sent. 17038 len. 10]: He hid all manner of things away , everywheres .
Parsing [sent. 17039 len. 15]: Mr. Tulkinghorn wanted 'em and got 'em , but I looked 'em over first .
Parsing [sent. 17040 len. 15]: I 'm a man of business , and I took a squint at 'em .
Parsing [sent. 17041 len. 14]: They was letters from the lodger 's sweetheart , and she signed Honoria .
Parsing [sent. 17042 len. 15]: Dear me , that 's not a common name , Honoria , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 17043 len. 13]: There 's no lady in this house that signs Honoria is there ?
Parsing [sent. 17044 len. 10]: Oh , no , I do n't think so !
Parsing [sent. 17045 len. 10]: Oh , no , I do n't think so !
Parsing [sent. 17046 len. 9]: And not in the same hand , perhaps ?
Parsing [sent. 17047 len. 11]: Oh , no , I do n't think so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17048 len. 28]: Here Mr. Smallweed , seized with a fit of coughing in the midst of his triumph , breaks off to ejaculate , `` Oh , dear me !
Parsing [sent. 17049 len. 4]: Oh , Lord !
Parsing [sent. 17050 len. 8]: I 'm shaken all to pieces ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17051 len. 39]: `` Now , when you 're ready , '' says Mr. Bucket after awaiting his recovery , `` to come to anything that concerns Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , here the gentleman sits , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 17052 len. 12]: `` Have n't I come to it , Mr. Bucket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17053 len. 4]: cries Grandfather Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 17054 len. 8]: `` Is n't the gentleman concerned yet ?
Parsing [sent. 17055 len. 18]: Not with Captain Hawdon , and his ever affectionate Honoria , and their child into the bargain ?
Parsing [sent. 17056 len. 13]: Come , then , I want to know where those letters are .
Parsing [sent. 17057 len. 13]: That concerns me , if it do n't concern Sir Leicester Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 17058 len. 7]: I will know where they are .
Parsing [sent. 17059 len. 9]: I wo n't have 'em disappear so quietly .
Parsing [sent. 17060 len. 19]: I handed 'em over to my friend and solicitor , Mr. Tulkinghorn , not to anybody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 17061 len. 21]: `` Why , he paid you for them , you know , and handsome too , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17062 len. 8]: `` I do n't care for that .
Parsing [sent. 17063 len. 9]: I want to know who 's got 'em .
Parsing [sent. 17064 len. 17]: And I tell you what we want -- what we all here want , Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17065 len. 10]: We want more painstaking and search-making into this murder .
Parsing [sent. 17066 len. 17]: We know where the interest and the motive was , and you have not done enough .
Parsing [sent. 17067 len. 22]: If George the vagabond dragoon had any hand in it , he was only an accomplice , and was set on .
Parsing [sent. 17068 len. 12]: You know what I mean as well as any man . ''
Parsing [sent. 17069 len. 67]: `` Now I tell you what , '' says Mr. Bucket , instantaneously altering his manner , coming close to him , and communicating an extraordinary fascination to the forefinger , `` I am damned if I am a-going to have my case spoilt , or interfered with , or anticipated by so much as half a second of time by any human being in creation .
Parsing [sent. 17070 len. 7]: YOU want more painstaking and search-making !
Parsing [sent. 17071 len. 3]: YOU do ?
Parsing [sent. 17072 len. 34]: Do you see this hand , and do you think that I do n't know the right time to stretch it out and put it on the arm that fired that shot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17073 len. 29]: Such is the dread power of the man , and so terribly evident it is that he makes no idle boast , that Mr. Smallweed begins to apologize .
Parsing [sent. 17074 len. 11]: Mr. Bucket , dismissing his sudden anger , checks him .
Parsing [sent. 17075 len. 18]: `` The advice I give you is , do n't you trouble your head about the murder .
Parsing [sent. 17076 len. 5]: That 's my affair .
Parsing [sent. 17077 len. 30]: You keep half an eye on the newspapers , and I should n't wonder if you was to read something about it before long , if you look sharp .
Parsing [sent. 17078 len. 20]: I know my business , and that 's all I 've got to say to you on that subject .
Parsing [sent. 17079 len. 5]: Now about those letters .
Parsing [sent. 17080 len. 9]: You want to know who 's got 'em .
Parsing [sent. 17081 len. 7]: I do n't mind telling you .
Parsing [sent. 17082 len. 5]: I have got 'em .
Parsing [sent. 17083 len. 6]: Is that the packet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17084 len. 30]: Mr. Smallweed looks , with greedy eyes , at the little bundle Mr. Bucket produces from a mysterious part of his coat , and identifles it as the same .
Parsing [sent. 17085 len. 10]: `` What have you got to say next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17086 len. 4]: asks Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17087 len. 23]: `` Now , do n't open your mouth too wide , because you do n't look handsome when you do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 17088 len. 8]: `` I want five hundred pound . ''
Parsing [sent. 17089 len. 17]: `` No , you do n't ; you mean fifty , '' says Mr. Bucket humorously .
Parsing [sent. 17090 len. 12]: It appears , however , that Mr. Smallweed means five hundred .
Parsing [sent. 17091 len. 54]: `` That is , I am deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to consider -LRB- without admitting or promising anything -RRB- this bit of business , '' says Mr. Bucket -- Sir Leicester mechanically bows his head -- `` and you ask me to consider a proposal of five hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 17092 len. 8]: Why , it 's an unreasonable proposal !
Parsing [sent. 17093 len. 12]: Two fifty would be bad enough , but better than that .
Parsing [sent. 17094 len. 9]: Had n't you better say two fifty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17095 len. 11]: Mr. Smallweed is quite clear that he had better not .
Parsing [sent. 17096 len. 15]: `` Then , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` let 's hear Mr. Chadband .
Parsing [sent. 17097 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 17098 len. 30]: Many a time I 've heard my old fellow-serjeant of that name ; and a moderate man he was in all respects , as ever I come across ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17099 len. 55]: Thus invited , Mr. Chadband steps forth , and after a little sleek smiling and a little oil-grinding with the palms of his hands , delivers himself as follows , `` My friends , we are now -- Rachael , my wife , and I -- in the mansions of the rich and great .
Parsing [sent. 17100 len. 16]: Why are we now in the mansions of the rich and great , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 17101 len. 7]: Is it because we are invited ?
Parsing [sent. 17102 len. 38]: Because we are bidden to feast with them , because we are bidden to rejoice with them , because we are bidden to play the lute with them , because we are bidden to dance with them ?
Parsing [sent. 17103 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 17104 len. 9]: Then why are we here , my friends ?
Parsing [sent. 17105 len. 36]: Air we in possession of a sinful secret , and do we require corn , and wine , and oil , or what is much the same thing , money , for the keeping thereof ?
Parsing [sent. 17106 len. 7]: Probably so , my friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 17107 len. 36]: `` You 're a man of business , you are , '' returns Mr. Bucket , very attentive , `` and consequently you 're going on to mention what the nature of your secret is .
Parsing [sent. 17108 len. 4]: You are right .
Parsing [sent. 17109 len. 7]: You could n't do better . ''
Parsing [sent. 17110 len. 28]: `` Let us then , my brother , in a spirit of love , '' says Mr. Chadband with a cunning eye , `` proceed unto it .
Parsing [sent. 17111 len. 8]: Rachael , my wife , advance ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17112 len. 28]: Mrs. Chadband , more than ready , so advances as to jostle her husband into the background and confronts Mr. Bucket with a hard , frowning smile .
Parsing [sent. 17113 len. 20]: `` Since you want to know what we know , '' says she , `` I 'll tell you .
Parsing [sent. 17114 len. 13]: I helped to bring up Miss Hawdon , her ladyship 's daughter .
Parsing [sent. 17115 len. 50]: I was in the service of her ladyship 's sister , who was very sensitive to the disgrace her ladyship brought upon her , and gave out , even to her ladyship , that the child was dead -- she WAS very nearly so -- when she was born .
Parsing [sent. 17116 len. 11]: But she 's alive , and I know her . ''
Parsing [sent. 17117 len. 32]: With these words , and a laugh , and laying a bitter stress on the word `` ladyship , '' Mrs. Chadband folds her arms and looks implacably at Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17118 len. 27]: `` I suppose now , '' returns that officer , `` YOU will he expecting a twenty-pound note or a present of about that figure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17119 len. 16]: Mrs. Chadband merely laughs and contemptuously tells him he can `` offer '' twenty pence .
Parsing [sent. 17120 len. 25]: `` My friend the law-stationer 's good lady , over there , '' says Mr. Bucket , luring Mrs. Snagsby forward with the finger .
Parsing [sent. 17121 len. 10]: `` What may YOUR game be , ma'am ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17122 len. 111]: Mrs. Snagsby is at first prevented , by tears and lamentations , from stating the nature of her game , but by degrees it confusedly comes to light that she is a woman overwhelmed with injuries and wrongs , whom Mr. Snagsby has habitually deceived , abandoned , and sought to keep in darkness , and whose chief comfort , under her afflictions , has been the sympathy of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , who showed so much commiseration for her on one occasion of his calling in Cook 's Court in the absence of her perjured husband that she has of late habitually carried to him all her woes .
Parsing [sent. 17123 len. 17]: Everybody it appears , the present company excepted , has plotted against Mrs. Snagsby 's peace .
Parsing [sent. 17124 len. 48]: There is Mr. Guppy , clerk to Kenge and Carboy , who was at first as open as the sun at noon , but who suddenly shut up as close as midnight , under the influence -- no doubt -- of Mr. Snagsby 's suborning and tampering .
Parsing [sent. 17125 len. 24]: There is Mr. Weevle , friend of Mr. Guppy , who lived mysteriously up a court , owing to the like coherent causes .
Parsing [sent. 17126 len. 28]: There was Krook , deceased ; there was Nimrod , deceased ; and there was Jo , deceased ; and they were `` all in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 17127 len. 62]: In what , Mrs. Snagsby does not with particularity express , but she knows that Jo was Mr. Snagsby 's son , `` as well as if a trumpet had spoken it , '' and she followed Mr. Snagsby when he went on his last visit to the boy , and if he was not his son why did he go ?
Parsing [sent. 17128 len. 66]: The one occupation of her life has been , for some time back , to follow Mr. Snagsby to and fro , and up and down , and to piece suspicious circumstances together -- and every circumstance that has happened has been most suspicious ; and in this way she has pursued her object of detecting and confounding her false husband , night and day .
Parsing [sent. 17129 len. 73]: Thus did it come to pass that she brought the Chadbands and Mr. Tulkinghorn together , and conferred with Mr. Tulkinghorn on the change in Mr. Guppy , and helped to turn up the circumstances in which the present company are interested , casually , by the wayside , being still and ever on the great high road that is to terminate in Mr. Snagsby 's full exposure and a matrimonial separation .
Parsing [sent. 17130 len. 95]: All this , Mrs. Snagsby , as an injured woman , and the friend of Mrs. Chadband , and the follower of Mr. Chadband , and the mourner of the late Mr. Tulkinghorn , is here to certify under the seal of confidence , with every possible confusion and involvement possible and impossible , having no pecuniary motive whatever , no scheme or project but the one mentioned , and bringing here , and taking everywhere , her own dense atmosphere of dust , arising from the ceaseless working of her mill of jealousy .
Parsing [sent. 17131 len. 48]: While this exordium is in hand -- and it takes some time -- Mr. Bucket , who has seen through the transparency of Mrs. Snagsby 's vinegar at a glance , confers with his familiar demon and bestows his shrewd attention on the Chadbands and Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 17132 len. 35]: Sir Leicester Dedlock remains immovable , with the same icy surface upon him , except that he once or twice looks towards Mr. Bucket , as relying on that officer alone of all mankind .
Parsing [sent. 17133 len. 9]: `` Very good , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17134 len. 48]: `` Now I understand you , you know , and being deputed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to look into this little matter , '' again Sir Leicester mechanically bows in confirmation of the statement , `` can give it my fair and full attention .
Parsing [sent. 17135 len. 36]: Now I wo n't allude to conspiring to extort money or anything of that sort , because we are men and women of the world here , and our object is to make things pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 17136 len. 26]: But I tell you what I DO wonder at ; I am surprised that you should think of making a noise below in the hall .
Parsing [sent. 17137 len. 8]: It was so opposed to your interests .
Parsing [sent. 17138 len. 8]: That 's what I look at . ''
Parsing [sent. 17139 len. 12]: `` We wanted to get in , '' pleads Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 17140 len. 39]: `` Why , of course you wanted to get in , '' Mr. Bucket asserts with cheerfulness ; `` but for a old gentleman at your time of life -- what I call truly venerable , mind you !
Parsing [sent. 17141 len. 69]: -- with his wits sharpened , as I have no doubt they are , by the loss of the use of his limbs , which occasions all his animation to mount up into his head , not to consider that if he do n't keep such a business as the present as close as possible it ca n't be worth a mag to him , is so curious !
Parsing [sent. 17142 len. 28]: You see your temper got the better of you ; that 's where you lost ground , '' says Mr. Bucket in an argumentative and friendly way .
Parsing [sent. 17143 len. 25]: `` I only said I would n't go without one of the servants came up to Sir Leicester Dedlock , '' returns Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 17144 len. 5]: `` That 's it !
Parsing [sent. 17145 len. 11]: That 's where your temper got the better of you .
Parsing [sent. 17146 len. 16]: Now , you keep it under another time and you 'll make money by it .
Parsing [sent. 17147 len. 11]: Shall I ring for them to carry you down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17148 len. 11]: `` When are we to hear more of this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17149 len. 5]: Mrs. Chadband sternly demands .
Parsing [sent. 17150 len. 9]: `` Bless your heart for a true woman !
Parsing [sent. 17151 len. 9]: Always curious , your delightful sex is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17152 len. 6]: replies Mr. Bucket with gallantry .
Parsing [sent. 17153 len. 28]: `` I shall have the pleasure of giving you a call to-morrow or next day -- not forgetting Mr. Smallweed and his proposal of two fifty . ''
Parsing [sent. 17154 len. 5]: `` Five hundred ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17155 len. 4]: exclaims Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 17156 len. 4]: `` All right !
Parsing [sent. 17157 len. 5]: Nominally five hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 17158 len. 9]: Mr. Bucket has his hand on the bell-rope .
Parsing [sent. 17159 len. 23]: `` SHALL I wish you good day for the present on the part of myself and the gentleman of the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17160 len. 7]: he asks in an insinuating tone .
Parsing [sent. 17161 len. 24]: Nobody having the hardihood to object to his doing so , he does it , and the party retire as they came up .
Parsing [sent. 17162 len. 40]: Mr. Bucket follows them to the door , and returning , says with an air of serious business , `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , it 's for you to consider whether or not to buy this up .
Parsing [sent. 17163 len. 25]: I should recommend , on the whole , it 's being bought up myself ; and I think it may be bought pretty cheap .
Parsing [sent. 17164 len. 40]: You see , that little pickled cowcumber of a Mrs. Snagsby has been used by all sides of the speculation and has done a deal more harm in bringing odds and ends together than if she had meant it .
Parsing [sent. 17165 len. 58]: Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , he held all these horses in his hand and could have drove 'em his own way , I have n't a doubt ; but he was fetched off the box head-foremost , and now they have got their legs over the traces , and are all dragging and pulling their own ways .
Parsing [sent. 17166 len. 9]: So it is , and such is life .
Parsing [sent. 17167 len. 21]: The cat 's away , and the mice they play ; the frost breaks up , and the water runs .
Parsing [sent. 17168 len. 12]: Now , with regard to the party to be apprehended . ''
Parsing [sent. 17169 len. 29]: Sir Leicester seems to wake , though his eyes have been wide open , and he looks intently at Mr. Bucket as Mr. Bucket refers to his watch .
Parsing [sent. 17170 len. 44]: `` The party to be apprehended is now in this house , '' proceeds Mr. Bucket , putting up his watch with a steady hand and with rising spirits , `` and I 'm about to take her into custody in your presence .
Parsing [sent. 17171 len. 16]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , do n't you say a word nor yet stir .
Parsing [sent. 17172 len. 11]: There 'll be no noise and no disturbance at all .
Parsing [sent. 17173 len. 36]: I 'll come back in the course of the evening , if agreeable to you , and endeavour to meet your wishes respecting this unfortunate family matter and the nobbiest way of keeping it quiet .
Parsing [sent. 17174 len. 23]: Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , do n't you be nervous on account of the apprehension at present coming off .
Parsing [sent. 17175 len. 14]: You shall see the whole case clear , from first to last . ''
Parsing [sent. 17176 len. 26]: Mr. Bucket rings , goes to the door , briefly whispers Mercury , shuts the door , and stands behind it with his arms folded .
Parsing [sent. 17177 len. 17]: After a suspense of a minute or two the door slowly opens and a Frenchwoman enters .
Parsing [sent. 17178 len. 3]: Mademoiselle Hortense .
Parsing [sent. 17179 len. 20]: The moment she is in the room Mr. Bucket claps the door to and puts his back against it .
Parsing [sent. 17180 len. 25]: The suddenness of the noise occasions her to turn , and then for the first time she sees Sir Leicester Dedlock in his chair .
Parsing [sent. 17181 len. 11]: `` I ask you pardon , '' she mutters hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 17182 len. 11]: `` They tell me there was no one here . ''
Parsing [sent. 17183 len. 14]: Her step towards the door brings her front to front with Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17184 len. 13]: Suddenly a spasm shoots across her face and she turns deadly pale .
Parsing [sent. 17185 len. 19]: `` This is my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , '' says Mr. Bucket , nodding at her .
Parsing [sent. 17186 len. 15]: `` This foreign young woman has been my lodger for some weeks back . ''
Parsing [sent. 17187 len. 16]: `` What do Sir Leicester care for that , you think , my angel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17188 len. 7]: returns mademoiselle in a jocular strain .
Parsing [sent. 17189 len. 17]: `` Why , my angel , '' returns Mr. Bucket , `` we shall see . ''
Parsing [sent. 17190 len. 27]: Mademoiselle Hortense eyes him with a scowl upon her tight face , which gradually changes into a smile of scorn , `` You are very mysterieuse .
Parsing [sent. 17191 len. 5]: Are you drunk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17192 len. 12]: `` Tolerable sober , my angel , '' returns Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17193 len. 14]: `` I come from arriving at this so detestable house with your wife .
Parsing [sent. 17194 len. 9]: Your wife have left me since some minutes .
Parsing [sent. 17195 len. 10]: They tell me downstairs that your wife is here .
Parsing [sent. 17196 len. 11]: I come here , and your wife is not here .
Parsing [sent. 17197 len. 14]: What is the intention of this fool 's play , say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17198 len. 21]: mademoiselle demands , with her arms composedly crossed , but with something in her dark cheek beating like a clock .
Parsing [sent. 17199 len. 9]: Mr. Bucket merely shakes the finger at her .
Parsing [sent. 17200 len. 13]: `` Ah , my God , you are an unhappy idiot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17201 len. 12]: cries mademoiselle with a toss of her head and a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 17202 len. 11]: `` Leave me to pass downstairs , great pig . ''
Parsing [sent. 17203 len. 10]: With a stamp of her foot and a menace .
Parsing [sent. 17204 len. 26]: `` Now , mademoiselle , '' says Mr. Bucket in a cool determined way , `` you go and sit down upon that sofy . ''
Parsing [sent. 17205 len. 18]: `` I will not sit down upon nothing , '' she replies with a shower of nods .
Parsing [sent. 17206 len. 27]: `` Now , mademoiselle , '' repeats Mr. Bucket , making no demonstration except with the finger , `` you sit down upon that sofy . ''
Parsing [sent. 17207 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17208 len. 23]: `` Because I take you into custody on a charge of murder , and you do n't need to be told it .
Parsing [sent. 17209 len. 19]: Now , I want to be polite to one of your sex and a foreigner if I can .
Parsing [sent. 17210 len. 17]: If I ca n't , I must be rough , and there 's rougher ones outside .
Parsing [sent. 17211 len. 9]: What I am to be depends on you .
Parsing [sent. 17212 len. 31]: So I recommend you , as a friend , afore another half a blessed moment has passed over your head , to go and sit down upon that sofy . ''
Parsing [sent. 17213 len. 26]: Mademoiselle complies , saying in a concentrated voice while that something in her cheek beats fast and hard , `` You are a devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 17214 len. 33]: `` Now , you see , '' Mr. Bucket proceeds approvingly , `` you 're comfortable and conducting yourself as I should expect a foreign young woman of your sense to do .
Parsing [sent. 17215 len. 22]: So I 'll give you a piece of advice , and it 's this , do n't you talk too much .
Parsing [sent. 17216 len. 22]: You 're not expected to say anything here , and you ca n't keep too quiet a tongue in your head .
Parsing [sent. 17217 len. 15]: In short , the less you PARLAY , the better , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 17218 len. 10]: Mr. Bucket is very complacent over this French explanation .
Parsing [sent. 17219 len. 56]: Mademoiselle , with that tigerish expansion of the mouth and her black eyes darting fire upon him , sits upright on the sofa in a rigid state , with her hands clenched -- and her feet too , one might suppose -- muttering , `` Oh , you Bucket , you are a devil ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17220 len. 69]: `` Now , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' says Mr. Bucket , and from this time forth the finger never rests , `` this young woman , my lodger , was her ladyship 's maid at the time I have mentioned to you ; and this young woman , besides being extraordinary vehement and passionate against her ladyship after being discharged -- '' `` Lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17221 len. 3]: cries mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 17222 len. 6]: `` I discharge myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 17223 len. 12]: `` Now , why do n't you take my advice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17224 len. 14]: returns Mr. Bucket in an impressive , almost in an imploring , tone .
Parsing [sent. 17225 len. 10]: `` I 'm surprised at the indiscreetness you commit .
Parsing [sent. 17226 len. 14]: You 'll say something that 'll be used against you , you know .
Parsing [sent. 17227 len. 8]: You 're sure to come to it .
Parsing [sent. 17228 len. 13]: Never you mind what I say till it 's given in evidence .
Parsing [sent. 17229 len. 8]: It is not addressed to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 17230 len. 15]: `` Discharge , too , '' cries mademoiselle furiously , `` by her ladyship !
Parsing [sent. 17231 len. 9]: Eh , my faith , a pretty ladyship !
Parsing [sent. 17232 len. 15]: Why , I r-r-r-ruin my character hy remaining with a ladyship so infame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17233 len. 10]: `` Upon my soul I wonder at you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17234 len. 4]: Mr. Bucket remonstrates .
Parsing [sent. 17235 len. 15]: `` I thought the French were a polite nation , I did , really .
Parsing [sent. 17236 len. 17]: Yet to hear a female going on like that before Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17237 len. 8]: `` He is a poor abused ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17238 len. 3]: cries mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 17239 len. 25]: `` I spit upon his house , upon his name , upon his imbecility , '' all of which she makes the carpet represent .
Parsing [sent. 17240 len. 10]: `` Oh , that he is a great man !
Parsing [sent. 17241 len. 6]: Oh , yes , superb !
Parsing [sent. 17242 len. 4]: Oh , heaven !
Parsing [sent. 17243 len. 3]: Bah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17244 len. 60]: `` Well , Sir Leicester Dedlock , '' proceeds Mr. Bucket , `` this intemperate foreigner also angrily took it into her head that she had established a claim upon Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , by attending on the occasion I told you of at his chambers , though she was liberally paid for her time and trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 17245 len. 4]: `` Lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17246 len. 3]: cries mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 17247 len. 9]: `` I ref-use his money all togezzer . ''
Parsing [sent. 17248 len. 22]: `` If you WILL PARLAY , you know , '' says Mr. Bucket parenthetically , `` you must take the consequences .
Parsing [sent. 17249 len. 77]: Now , whether she became my lodger , Sir Leicester Dedlock , with any deliberate intention then of doing this deed and blinding me , I give no opinion on ; but she lived in my house in that capacity at the time that she was hovering about the chambers of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn with a view to a wrangle , and likewise persecuting and half frightening the life out of an unfortunate stationer . ''
Parsing [sent. 17250 len. 4]: `` Lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17251 len. 3]: cries mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 17252 len. 5]: `` All lie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17253 len. 19]: `` The murder was commttted , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you know under what circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 17254 len. 19]: Now , I beg of you to follow me close with your attention for a minute or two .
Parsing [sent. 17255 len. 13]: I was sent for , and the case was entrusted to me .
Parsing [sent. 17256 len. 16]: I examined the place , and the body , and the papers , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 17257 len. 64]: From information I received -LRB- from a clerk in the same house -RRB- I took George into custody as having been seen hanging about there on the night , and at very nigh the time of the murder , also as having been overheard in high words with the deceased on former occasions -- even threatening him , as the witness made out .
Parsing [sent. 17258 len. 55]: If you ask me , Sir Leicester Dedlock , whether from the first I believed George to be the murderer , I tell you candidly no , but he might be , notwithstanding , and there was enough against him to make it my duty to take him and get him kept under remand .
Parsing [sent. 17259 len. 5]: Now , observe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17260 len. 53]: As Mr. Bucket bends forward in some excitement -- for him -- and inaugurates what he is going to say with one ghostly beat of his forefinger in the air , Mademoiselle Hortense fixes her black eyes upon him with a dark frown and sets her dry lips closely and firmly together .
Parsing [sent. 17261 len. 27]: `` I went home , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , at night and found this young woman having supper with my wife , Mrs. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17262 len. 36]: She had made a mighty show of being fond of Mrs. Bucket from her first offering herself as our lodger , but that night she made more than ever -- in fact , overdid it .
Parsing [sent. 17263 len. 20]: Likewise she overdid her respect , and all that , for the lamented memory of the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn .
Parsing [sent. 17264 len. 35]: By the living Lord it flashed upon me , as I sat opposite to her at the table and saw her with a knife in her hand , that she had done it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17265 len. 21]: Mademoiselle is hardly audible in straining through her teeth and lips the words , `` You are a devil . ''
Parsing [sent. 17266 len. 20]: `` Now where , '' pursues Mr. Bucket , `` had she been on the night of the murder ?
Parsing [sent. 17267 len. 7]: She had been to the theayter .
Parsing [sent. 17268 len. 20]: -LRB- She really was there , I have since found , both before the deed and after it . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 17269 len. 45]: I knew I had an artful customer to deal with and that proof would be very difficult ; and I laid a trap for her -- such a trap as I never laid yet , and such a venture as I never made yet .
Parsing [sent. 17270 len. 16]: I worked it out in my mind while I was talking to her at supper .
Parsing [sent. 17271 len. 44]: When I went upstairs to bed , our house being small and this young woman 's ears sharp , I stuffed the sheet into Mrs. Bucket 's mouth that she should n't say a word of surprise and told her all about it .
Parsing [sent. 17272 len. 25]: My dear , do n't you give your mind to that again , or I shall link your feet together at the ankles . ''
Parsing [sent. 17273 len. 22]: Mr. Bucket , breaking off , has made a noiseless descent upon mademoiselle and laid his heavy hand upon her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 17274 len. 10]: `` What is the matter with you now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17275 len. 4]: she asks him .
Parsing [sent. 17276 len. 24]: `` Do n't you think any more , '' returns Mr. Bucket with admonitory finger , `` of throwing yourself out of window .
Parsing [sent. 17277 len. 9]: That 's what 's the matter with me .
Parsing [sent. 17278 len. 2]: Come !
Parsing [sent. 17279 len. 5]: Just take my arm .
Parsing [sent. 17280 len. 13]: You need n't get up ; I 'll sit down by you .
Parsing [sent. 17281 len. 8]: Now take my arm , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 17282 len. 16]: I 'm a married man , you know ; you 're acquainted with my wife .
Parsing [sent. 17283 len. 6]: Just take my arm . ''
Parsing [sent. 17284 len. 19]: Vaiuly endeavouring to moisten those dry lips , with a painful sound she struggles with herself and complies .
Parsing [sent. 17285 len. 8]: `` Now we 're all right again .
Parsing [sent. 17286 len. 36]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , this case could never have been the case it is but for Mrs. Bucket , who is a woman in fifty thousand -- in a hundred and fifty thousand !
Parsing [sent. 17287 len. 40]: To throw this young woman off her guard , I have never set foot in our house since , though I 've communicated with Mrs. Bucket in the baker 's loaves and in the milk as often as required .
Parsing [sent. 17288 len. 46]: My whispered words to Mrs. Bucket when she had the sheet in her mouth were , ` My dear , can you throw her off continually with natural accounts of my suspicions against George , and this , and that , and t ` other ?
Parsing [sent. 17289 len. 14]: Can you do without rest and keep watch upon her night and day ?
Parsing [sent. 17290 len. 63]: Can you undertake to say , `` She shall do nothing without my knowledge , she shall be my prisoner without suspecting it , she shall no more escape from me than from death , and her life shall be my life , and her soul my soul , till I have got her , if she did this murder ? '' '
Parsing [sent. 17291 len. 25]: Mrs. Bucket says to me , as well as she could speak on account of the sheet , ` Bucket , I can ! '
Parsing [sent. 17292 len. 10]: And she has acted up to it glorious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17293 len. 4]: `` Lies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17294 len. 3]: mademoiselle interposes .
Parsing [sent. 17295 len. 8]: `` All lies , my friend ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17296 len. 17]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , how did my calculations come out under these circumstances ?
Parsing [sent. 17297 len. 21]: When I calculated that this impetuous young woman would overdo it in new directions , was I wrong or right ?
Parsing [sent. 17298 len. 4]: I was right .
Parsing [sent. 17299 len. 7]: What does she try to do ?
Parsing [sent. 17300 len. 9]: Do n't let it give you a turn ?
Parsing [sent. 17301 len. 9]: To throw the murder on her ladyship . ''
Parsing [sent. 17302 len. 11]: Sir Leicester rises from his chair and staggers down again .
Parsing [sent. 17303 len. 20]: `` And she got encouragement in it from hearing that I was always here , which was done a-purpose .
Parsing [sent. 17304 len. 45]: Now , open that pocket-book of mine , Sir Leicester Dedlock , if I may take the liberty of throwing it towards you , and look at the letters sent to me , each with the two words ` Lady Dedlock ' in it .
Parsing [sent. 17305 len. 28]: Open the one directed to yourself , which I stopped this very morning , and read the three words ` Lady Dedlock , Murderess ' in it .
Parsing [sent. 17306 len. 12]: These letters have been falling about like a shower of lady-birds .
Parsing [sent. 17307 len. 23]: What do you say now to Mrs. Bucket , from her spy-place having seen them all ` written by this young woman ?
Parsing [sent. 17308 len. 26]: What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having , within this half-hour , secured the corresponding ink and paper , fellow half-sheets and what not ?
Parsing [sent. 17309 len. 27]: What do you say to Mrs. Bucket having watched the posting of 'em every one by this young woman , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17310 len. 14]: Mr. Bucket asks , triumphant in his admiration of his lady 's genius .
Parsing [sent. 17311 len. 13]: Two things are especially observable as Mr. Bucket proceeds to a conclusion .
Parsing [sent. 17312 len. 16]: First , that he seems imperceptibly to establish a dreadful right of property in mademoiselle .
Parsing [sent. 17313 len. 35]: Secondly , that the very atmosphere she breathes seems to narrow and contract about her as if a close net or a pall were being drawn nearer and yet nearer around her breathless figure .
Parsing [sent. 17314 len. 42]: `` There is no doubt that her ladyship was on the spot at the eventful period , '' says Mr. Bucket , `` and my foreign friend here saw her , I believe , from the upper part of the staircase .
Parsing [sent. 17315 len. 18]: Her ladyship and George and my foreign friend were all pretty close on one another 's heels .
Parsing [sent. 17316 len. 16]: But that do n't signify any more , so I 'll not go into it .
Parsing [sent. 17317 len. 16]: I found the wadding of the pistol with which the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn was shot .
Parsing [sent. 17318 len. 15]: It was a bit of the printed description of your house at Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 17319 len. 15]: Not much in that , you 'll say , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Parsing [sent. 17320 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 17321 len. 51]: But when my foreign friend here is so thoroughly off her guard as to think it a safe time to tear up the rest of that leaf , and when Mrs. Bucket puts the pieces together and finds the wadding wanting , it begins to look like Queer Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 17322 len. 11]: `` These are very long lies , '' mademoiselle interposes .
Parsing [sent. 17323 len. 6]: `` You prose great deal .
Parsing [sent. 17324 len. 16]: Is it that you have almost all finished , or are you speaking always ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17325 len. 64]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , '' proceeds Mr. Bucket , who delights in a full title and does violence to himself when he dispenses with any fragment of it , `` the last point in the case which I am now going to mention shows the necessity of patience in our business , and never doing a thing in a hurry .
Parsing [sent. 17326 len. 100]: I watched this young woman yesterday without her knowledge when she was looking at the funeral , in company with my wife , who planned to take her there ; and I had so much to convict her , and I saw such an expression in her face , and my mind so rose against her malice towards her ladyship , and the time was altogether such a time for bringing down what you may call retribution upon her , that if I had been a younger hand with less experience , I should have taken her , certain .
Parsing [sent. 17327 len. 72]: Equally , last night , when her ladyship , as is so universally admired I am sure , come home looking -- why , Lord , a man might almost say like Venus rising from the ocean -- it was so unpleasant and inconsistent to think of her being charged with a murder of which she was innocent that I felt quite to want to put an end to the job .
Parsing [sent. 17328 len. 6]: What should I have lost ?
Parsing [sent. 17329 len. 13]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I should have lost the weapon .
Parsing [sent. 17330 len. 38]: My prisoner here proposed to Mrs. Bucket , after the departure of the funeral , that they should go per bus a little ways into the country and take tea at a very decent house of entertainment .
Parsing [sent. 17331 len. 14]: Now , near that house of entertainment there 's a piece of water .
Parsing [sent. 17332 len. 36]: At tea , my prisoner got up to fetch her pocket handkercher from the bedroom where the bonnets was ; she was rather a long time gone and came back a little out of wind .
Parsing [sent. 17333 len. 22]: As soon as they came home this was reported to me by Mrs. Bucket , along with her observations and suspicions .
Parsing [sent. 17334 len. 34]: I had the piece of water dragged by moonlight , in presence of a couple of our men , and the pocket pistol was brought up before it had been there half-a-dozen hours .
Parsing [sent. 17335 len. 27]: Now , my dear , put your arm a little further through mine , and hold it steady , and I sha n't hurt you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17336 len. 12]: In a trice Mr. Bucket snaps a handcuff on her wrist .
Parsing [sent. 17337 len. 10]: `` That 's one , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17338 len. 7]: `` Now the other , darling .
Parsing [sent. 17339 len. 7]: Two , and all told ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17340 len. 7]: He rises ; she rises too .
Parsing [sent. 17341 len. 39]: `` Where , '' she asks him , darkening her large eyes until their drooping lids almost conceal them -- and yet they stare , `` where is your false , your treacherous , and cursed wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17342 len. 15]: `` She 's gone forrard to the Police Office , '' returns Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17343 len. 11]: `` You 'll see her there , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 17344 len. 9]: `` I would like to kiss her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17345 len. 7]: exclaims Mademoiselle Hortense , panting tigress-like .
Parsing [sent. 17346 len. 14]: `` You 'd bite her , I suspect , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17347 len. 5]: `` I would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17348 len. 6]: making her eyes very large .
Parsing [sent. 17349 len. 12]: `` I would love to tear her limb from limb . ''
Parsing [sent. 17350 len. 24]: `` Bless you , darling , '' says Mr. Bucket with the greatest composure , `` I 'm fully prepared to hear that .
Parsing [sent. 17351 len. 15]: Your sex have such a surprising animosity against one another when you do differ .
Parsing [sent. 17352 len. 13]: You do n't mind me half so much , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17353 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 17354 len. 8]: Though you are a devil still . ''
Parsing [sent. 17355 len. 10]: `` Angel and devil by turns , eh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17356 len. 4]: cries Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17357 len. 13]: `` But I am in my regular employment , you must consider .
Parsing [sent. 17358 len. 7]: Let me put your shawl tidy .
Parsing [sent. 17359 len. 13]: I 've been lady 's maid to a good many before now .
Parsing [sent. 17360 len. 6]: Anything wanting to the bonnet ?
Parsing [sent. 17361 len. 9]: There 's a cab at the door . ''
Parsing [sent. 17362 len. 29]: Mademoiselle Hortense , casting an indignant eye at the glass , shakes herself perfectly neat in one shake and looks , to do her justice , uncommonly genteel .
Parsing [sent. 17363 len. 15]: `` Listen then , my angel , '' says she after several sarcastic nods .
Parsing [sent. 17364 len. 6]: `` You are very spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 17365 len. 10]: But can you restore him back to life ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17366 len. 9]: Mr. Bucket answers , `` Not exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 17367 len. 5]: `` That is droll .
Parsing [sent. 17368 len. 5]: Listen yet one time .
Parsing [sent. 17369 len. 5]: You are very spiritual .
Parsing [sent. 17370 len. 10]: Can you make a honourahle lady of her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17371 len. 12]: `` Do n't be so malicious , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17372 len. 9]: `` Or a haughty gentleman of HIM ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17373 len. 11]: cries mademoiselle , referring to Sir Leicester with ineffable disdain .
Parsing [sent. 17374 len. 3]: `` Eh !
Parsing [sent. 17375 len. 6]: Oh , then regard him !
Parsing [sent. 17376 len. 4]: The poor infant !
Parsing [sent. 17377 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 17378 len. 2]: Ha !
Parsing [sent. 17379 len. 3]: Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17380 len. 19]: `` Come , come , why this is worse PARLAYING than the other , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17381 len. 5]: `` Come along ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17382 len. 8]: `` You can not do these things ?
Parsing [sent. 17383 len. 10]: Then you can do as you please with me .
Parsing [sent. 17384 len. 12]: It is but the death , it is all the same .
Parsing [sent. 17385 len. 7]: Let us go , my angel .
Parsing [sent. 17386 len. 8]: Adieu , you old man , grey .
Parsing [sent. 17387 len. 10]: I pity you , and I despise you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17388 len. 18]: With these last words she snaps her teeth together as if her mouth closed with a spring .
Parsing [sent. 17389 len. 53]: It is impossible to describe how Mr. Bucket gets her out , but he accomplishes that feat in a manner so peculiar to himself , enfolding and pervading her like a cloud , and hovering away with her as if he were a homely Jupiter and she the object of his affections .
Parsing [sent. 17390 len. 25]: Sir Leicester , left alone , remains in the same attitude , as though he were still listening and his attention were still occupied .
Parsing [sent. 17391 len. 37]: At length he gazes round the empty room , and finding it deserted , rises unsteadily to his feet , pushes back his chair , and walks a few steps , supporting himself by the table .
Parsing [sent. 17392 len. 23]: Then he stops , and with more of those inarticulate sounds , lifts up his eyes and seems to stare at something .
Parsing [sent. 17393 len. 6]: Heaven knows what he sees .
Parsing [sent. 17394 len. 47]: The green , green woods of Chesney Wold , the noble house , the pictures of his forefathers , strangers defacing them , officers of police coarsely handling his most precious heirlooms , thousands of fingers pointing at him , thousands of faces sneering at him .
Parsing [sent. 17395 len. 43]: But if such shadows flit before him to his bewilderment , there is one other shadow which he can name with something like distinctness even yet and to which alone he addresses his tearing of his white hair and his extended arms .
Parsing [sent. 17396 len. 35]: It is she in association with whom , saving that she has been for years a main fibre of the root of his dignity and pride , he has never had a selfish thought .
Parsing [sent. 17397 len. 21]: It is she whom he has loved , admired , honoured , and set up for the world to respect .
Parsing [sent. 17398 len. 43]: It is she who , at the core of all the constrained formalities and conventionalities of his life , has been a stock of living tenderness and love , susceptible as nothing else is of being struck with the agony he feels .
Parsing [sent. 17399 len. 31]: He sees her , almost to the exclusion of himself , and can not bear to look upon her cast down from the high place she has graced so well .
Parsing [sent. 17400 len. 47]: And even to the point of his sinking on the ground , oblivious of his suffering , he can yet pronounce her name with something like distinctness in the midst of those intrusive sounds , and in a tone of mourning and compassion rather than reproach .
Parsing [sent. 17401 len. 59]: Chapter LV -- Flight Inspector Bucket of the Detective has not yet struck his great blow , as just now chronicled , but is yet refreshing himself with sleep preparatory to his field-day , when through the night and along the freezing wintry roads a chaise and pair comes out of Lincolnshire , making its way towards London .
Parsing [sent. 17402 len. 50]: Railroads shall soon traverse all this country , and with a rattle and a glare the engine and train shall shoot like a meteor over the wide night-landscape , turning the moon paler ; but as yet such things are non-existent in these parts , though not wholly unexpected .
Parsing [sent. 17403 len. 13]: Preparations are afoot , measurements are made , ground is staked out .
Parsing [sent. 17404 len. 76]: Bridges are begun , and their not yet united piers desolately look at one another over roads and streams like brick and mortar couples with an obstacle to their union ; fragments of embankments are thrown up and left as precipices with torrents of rusty carts and barrows tumbling over them ; tripods of tall poles appear on hilltops , where there are rumours of tunnels ; everything looks chaotic and abandoned in full hopelessness .
Parsing [sent. 17405 len. 22]: Along the freezing roads , and through the night , the post-chaise makes its way without a railroad on its mind .
Parsing [sent. 17406 len. 30]: Mrs. Rouncewell , so many years housekeeper at Chesney Wold , sits within the chaise ; and by her side sits Mrs. Bagnet with her grey cloak and umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 17407 len. 48]: The old girl would prefer the bar in front , as being exposed to the weather and a primitive sort of perch more in accordance with her usual course of travelling , but Mrs. Rouncewell is too thoughtful of her comfort to admit of her proposing it .
Parsing [sent. 17408 len. 12]: The old lady can not make enough of the old girl .
Parsing [sent. 17409 len. 25]: She sits , in her stately manner , holding her hand , and regardless of its roughness , puts it often to her lips .
Parsing [sent. 17410 len. 27]: `` You are a mother , my dear soul , '' says she many times , `` and you found out my George 's mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17411 len. 96]: `` Why , George , '' returns Mrs. Bagnet , `` was always free with me , ma'am , and when he said at our house to my Woolwich that of all the things my Woolwich could have to think of when he grew to be a man , the comfortablest would be that he had never brought a sorrowful line into his mother 's face or turned a hair of her head grey , then I felt sure , from his way , that something fresh had brought his own mother into his mind .
Parsing [sent. 17412 len. 22]: I had often known him say to me , in past times , that he had behaved bad to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 17413 len. 7]: `` Never , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17414 len. 8]: returns Mrs. Rouncewell , bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 17415 len. 8]: `` My blessing on him , never !
Parsing [sent. 17416 len. 16]: He was always fond of me , and loving to me , was my George !
Parsing [sent. 17417 len. 19]: But he had a bold spirit , and he ran a little wild and went for a soldier .
Parsing [sent. 17418 len. 48]: And I know he waited at first , in letting us know about himself , till he should rise to be an officer ; and when he did n't rise , I know he considered himself beneath us , and would n't be a disgrace to us .
Parsing [sent. 17419 len. 17]: For he had a lion heart , had my George , always from a baby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17420 len. 92]: The old lady 's hands stray about her as of yore , while she recalls , all in a tremble , what a likely lad , what a fine lad , what a gay good-humoured clever lad he was ; how they all took to him down at Chesney Wold ; how Sir Leicester took to him when he was a young gentleman ; how the dogs took to him ; how even the people who had been angry with him forgave him the moment he was gone , poor boy .
Parsing [sent. 17421 len. 14]: And now to see him after all , and in a prison too !
Parsing [sent. 17422 len. 20]: And the broad stomacher heaves , and the quaint upright old-fashioned figure bends under its load of affectionate distress .
Parsing [sent. 17423 len. 87]: Mrs. Bagnet , with the instinctive skill of a good warm heart , leaves the old housekeeper to her emotions for a little while -- not without passing the back of her hand across her own motherly eyes -- and presently chirps up in her cheery manner , `` So I says to George when I goes to call him in to tea -LRB- he pretended to be smoking his pipe outside -RRB- , ` What ails you this afternoon , George , for gracious sake ?
Parsing [sent. 17424 len. 35]: I have seen all sorts , and I have seen you pretty often in season and out of season , abroad and at home , and I never see you so melancholy penitent . '
Parsing [sent. 17425 len. 31]: ` Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ' says George , ` it 's because I AM melancholy and penitent both , this afternoon , that you see me so . '
Parsing [sent. 17426 len. 10]: ` What have you done , old fellow ? '
Parsing [sent. 17427 len. 3]: I says .
Parsing [sent. 17428 len. 38]: ` Why , Mrs. Bagnet , ' says George , shaking his head , ` what I have done has been done this many a long year , and is best not tried to be undone now .
Parsing [sent. 17429 len. 26]: If I ever get to heaven it wo n't be for being a good son to a widowed mother ; I say no more . '
Parsing [sent. 17430 len. 50]: Now , ma'am , when George says to me that it 's best not tried to be undone now , I have my thoughts as I have often had before , and I draw it out of George how he comes to have such things on him that afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 17431 len. 60]: Then George tells me that he has seen by chance , at the lawyer 's office , a fine old lady that has brought his mother plain before him , and he runs on about that old lady till he quite forgets himself and paints her picture to me as she used to be , years upon years back .
Parsing [sent. 17432 len. 19]: So I says to George when he has done , who is this old lady he has seen ?
Parsing [sent. 17433 len. 27]: And George tells me it 's Mrs. Rouncewell , housekeeper for more than half a century to the Dedlock family down at Chesney Wold in Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 17434 len. 38]: George has frequently told me before that he 's a Lincolnshire man , and I says to my old Lignum that night , ` Lignum , that 's his mother for five and for-ty pound ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 17435 len. 18]: All this Mrs. Bagnet now relates for the twentieth time at least within the last four hours .
Parsing [sent. 17436 len. 31]: Trilling it out like a kind of bird , with a pretty high note , that it may be audible to the old lady above the hum of the wheels .
Parsing [sent. 17437 len. 13]: `` Bless you , and thank you , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell .
Parsing [sent. 17438 len. 13]: `` Bless you , and thank you , my worthy soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17439 len. 5]: `` Dear heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17440 len. 9]: cries Mrs. Bagnet in the most natural manner .
Parsing [sent. 17441 len. 10]: `` No thanks to me , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 17442 len. 14]: Thanks to yourself , ma'am , for being so ready to pay 'em !
Parsing [sent. 17443 len. 57]: And mind once more , ma'am , what you had best do on finding George to be your own son is to make him -- for your sake -- have every sort of help to put himself in the right and clear himself of a charge of which he is as innocent as you or me .
Parsing [sent. 17444 len. 49]: It wo n't do to have truth and justice on his side ; he must have law and lawyers , '' exclaims the old girl , apparently persuaded that the latter form a separate establishment and have dissolved partnership with truth and justice for ever and a day .
Parsing [sent. 17445 len. 27]: `` He shall have , '' says Mrs. Rouncewell , `` all the help that can be got for him in the world , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 17446 len. 14]: I will spend all I have , and thankfully , to procure it .
Parsing [sent. 17447 len. 15]: Sir Leicester will do his best , the whole family will do their best .
Parsing [sent. 17448 len. 36]: I -- I know something , my dear ; and will make my own appeal , as his mother parted from him all these years , and finding him in a jail at last . ''
Parsing [sent. 17449 len. 49]: The extreme disquietude of the old housekeeper 's manner in saying this , her broken words , and her wringing of her hands make a powerful impression on Mrs. Bagnet and would astonish her but that she refers them all to her sorrow for her son 's condition .
Parsing [sent. 17450 len. 25]: And yet Mrs. Bagnet wonders too why Mrs. Rouncewell should murmur so distractedly , `` My Lady , my Lady , my Lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17451 len. 5]: over and over again .
Parsing [sent. 17452 len. 29]: The frosty night wears away , and the dawn breaks , and the post-chaise comes rolling on through the early mist like the ghost of a chaise departed .
Parsing [sent. 17453 len. 24]: It has plenty of spectral company in ghosts of trees and hedges , slowly vanishing and giving place to the realities of day .
Parsing [sent. 17454 len. 60]: London reached , the travellers alight , the old housekeeper in great tribulation and confusion , Mrs. Bagnet quite fresh and collected -- as she would be if her next point , with no new equipage and outfit , were the Cape of Good Hope , the Island of Ascension , Hong Kong , or any other military station .
Parsing [sent. 17455 len. 40]: But when they set out for the prison where the trooper is confined , the old lady has managed to draw about her , with her lavender-coloured dress , much of the staid calmness which is its usual accompaniment .
Parsing [sent. 17456 len. 41]: A wonderfully grave , precise , and handsome piece of old china she looks , though her heart beats fast and her stomacher is ruffled more than even the remembrance of this wayward son has ruffled it these many years .
Parsing [sent. 17457 len. 19]: Approaching the cell , they find the door opening and a warder in the act of coming out .
Parsing [sent. 17458 len. 31]: The old girl promptly makes a sign of entreaty to him to say nothing ; assenting with a nod , he suffers them to enter as he shuts the door .
Parsing [sent. 17459 len. 26]: So George , who is writing at his table , supposing himself to be alone , does not raise his eyes , but remains absorbed .
Parsing [sent. 17460 len. 44]: The old housekeeper looks at him , and those wandering hands of hers are quite enough for Mrs. Bagnet 's confirmation , even if she could see the mother and the son together , knowing what she knows , and doubt their relationship .
Parsing [sent. 17461 len. 19]: Not a rustle of the housekeeper 's dress , not a gesture , not a word betrays her .
Parsing [sent. 17462 len. 24]: She stands looking at him as he writes on , all unconscious , and only her fluttering hands give utterance to her emotions .
Parsing [sent. 17463 len. 11]: But they are very eloquent , very , very eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 17464 len. 5]: Mrs. Bagnet understands them .
Parsing [sent. 17465 len. 72]: They speak of gratitude , of joy , of grief , of hope ; of inextinguishable affection , cherished with no return since this stalwart man was a stripling ; of a better son loved less , and this son loved so fondly and so proudly ; and they speak in such touching language that Mrs. Bagnet 's eyes brim up with tears and they run glistening down her sun-brown face .
Parsing [sent. 17466 len. 4]: `` George Rouncewell !
Parsing [sent. 17467 len. 13]: Oh , my dear child , turn and look at me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17468 len. 21]: The trooper starts up , clasps his mother round the neck , and falls down on his knees before her .
Parsing [sent. 17469 len. 47]: Whether in a late repentance , whether in the first association that comes back upon him , he puts his hands together as a child does when it says its prayers , and raising them towards her breast , bows down his head , and cries .
Parsing [sent. 17470 len. 8]: `` My George , my dearest son !
Parsing [sent. 17471 len. 19]: Always my favourite , and my favourite still , where have you been these cruel years and years ?
Parsing [sent. 17472 len. 13]: Grown such a man too , grown such a fine strong man .
Parsing [sent. 17473 len. 19]: Grown so like what I knew he must be , if it pleased God he was alive ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17474 len. 15]: She can ask , and he can answer , nothing connected for a time .
Parsing [sent. 17475 len. 48]: All that time the old girl , turned away , leans one arm against the whitened wall , leans her honest forehead upon it , wipes her eyes with her serviceable grey cloak , and quite enjoys herself like the best of old girls as she is .
Parsing [sent. 17476 len. 29]: `` Mother , '' says the trooper when they are more composed , `` forgive me first of all , for I know my need of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 17477 len. 3]: Forgive him !
Parsing [sent. 17478 len. 10]: She does it with all her heart and soul .
Parsing [sent. 17479 len. 6]: She always has done it .
Parsing [sent. 17480 len. 25]: She tells him how she has had it written in her will , these many years , that he was her beloved son George .
Parsing [sent. 17481 len. 11]: She has never believed any ill of him , never .
Parsing [sent. 17482 len. 47]: If she had died without this happiness -- and she is an old woman now and ca n't look to live very long -- she would have blessed him with her last breath , if she had had her senses , as her beloved son George .
Parsing [sent. 17483 len. 36]: `` Mother , I have been an undutiful trouble to you , and I have my reward ; but of late years I have had a kind of glimmering of a purpose in me too .
Parsing [sent. 17484 len. 54]: When I left home I did n't care much , mother -- I am afraid not a great deal -- for leaving ; and went away and ` listed , harum-scarum , making believe to think that I cared for nobody , no not I , and that nobody cared for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 17485 len. 44]: The trooper has dried his eyes and put away his handkerchief , but there is an extraordinary contrast between his habitual manner of expressing himself and carrying himself and the softened tone in which he speaks , interrupted occasionally by a half-stifled sob .
Parsing [sent. 17486 len. 31]: `` So I wrote a line home , mother , as you too well know , to say I had ` listed under another name , and I went abroad .
Parsing [sent. 17487 len. 61]: Abroad , at one time I thought I would write home next year , when I might be better off ; and when that year was out , I thought I would write home next year , when I might be better off ; and when that year was out again , perhaps I did n't think much about it .
Parsing [sent. 17488 len. 33]: So on , from year to year , through a service of ten years , till I began to get older , and to ask myself why should I ever write . ''
Parsing [sent. 17489 len. 19]: `` I do n't find any fault , child -- but not to ease my mind , George ?
Parsing [sent. 17490 len. 15]: Not a word to your loving mother , who was growing older too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17491 len. 24]: This almost overturns the trooper afresh , but he sets himself up with a great , rough , sounding clearance of his throat .
Parsing [sent. 17492 len. 22]: `` Heaven forgive me , mother , but I thought there would be small consolation then in hearing anything about me .
Parsing [sent. 17493 len. 8]: There were you , respected and esteemed .
Parsing [sent. 17494 len. 24]: There was my brother , as I read in chance North Country papers now and then , rising to be prosperous and famous .
Parsing [sent. 17495 len. 47]: There was I a dragoon , roving , unsettled , not self-made like him , but self-unmade -- all my earlier advantages thrown away , all my little learning unlearnt , nothing picked up but what unfitted me for most things that I could think of .
Parsing [sent. 17496 len. 9]: What business had I to make myself known ?
Parsing [sent. 17497 len. 16]: After letting all that time go by me , what good could come of it ?
Parsing [sent. 17498 len. 9]: The worst was past with you , mother .
Parsing [sent. 17499 len. 50]: I knew by that time -LRB- being a man -RRB- how you had mourned for me , and wept for me , and prayed for me ; and the pain was over , or was softened down , and I was better in your mind as it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 17500 len. 23]: The old lady sorrowfully shakes her head , and taking one of his powerful hands , lays it lovingly upon her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 17501 len. 24]: `` No , I do n't say that it was so , mother , but that I made it out to be so .
Parsing [sent. 17502 len. 12]: I said just now , what good could come of it ?
Parsing [sent. 17503 len. 24]: Well , my dear mother , some good might have come of it to myself -- and there was the meanness of it .
Parsing [sent. 17504 len. 60]: You would have sought me out ; you would have purchased my discharge ; you would have taken me down to Chesney Wold ; you would have brought me and my brother and my brother 's family together ; you would all have considered anxiously how to do something for me and set me up as a respectable civilian .
Parsing [sent. 17505 len. 22]: But how could any of you feel sure of me when I could n't so much as feel sure of myself ?
Parsing [sent. 17506 len. 31]: How could you help regarding as an incumbrance and a discredit to you an idle dragooning chap who was an incumbrance and a discredit to himself , excepting under discipline ?
Parsing [sent. 17507 len. 42]: How could I look my brother 's children in the face and pretend to set them an example -- I , the vagabond boy who had run away from home and been the grief and unhappiness of my mother 's life ?
Parsing [sent. 17508 len. 6]: ` No , George . '
Parsing [sent. 17509 len. 23]: Such were my words , mother , when I passed this in review before me : ` You have made your bed .
Parsing [sent. 17510 len. 8]: Now , lie upon it . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 17511 len. 36]: Mrs. Rouncewell , drawing up her stately form , shakes her head at the old girl with a swelling pride upon her , as much as to say , `` I told you so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17512 len. 67]: The old girl relieves her feelings and testifies her interest in the conversation by giving the trooper a great poke between the shoulders with her umbrella ; this action she afterwards repeats , at intervals , in a species of affectionate lunacy , never failing , after the administration of each of these remonstrances , to resort to the whitened wall and the grey cloak again .
Parsing [sent. 17513 len. 32]: `` This was the way I brought myself to think , mother , that my best amends was to lie upon that bed I had made , and die upon it .
Parsing [sent. 17514 len. 48]: And I should have done it -LRB- though I have been to see you more than once down at Chesney Wold , when you little thought of me -RRB- but for my old comrade 's wife here , who I find has been too many for me .
Parsing [sent. 17515 len. 7]: But I thank her for it .
Parsing [sent. 17516 len. 17]: I thank you for it , Mrs. Bagnet , with all my heart and might . ''
Parsing [sent. 17517 len. 9]: To which Mrs. Bagnet responds with two pokes .
Parsing [sent. 17518 len. 126]: And now the old lady impresses upon her son George , her own dear recovered boy , her joy and pride , the light of her eyes , the happy close of her life , and every fond name she can think of , that he must be governed by the best advice obtainable by money and influence , that he must yield up his case to the greatest lawyers that can be got , that he must act in this serious plight as he shall be advised to act and must not be self-willed , however right , but must promise to think only of his poor old mother 's anxiety and suffering until he is released , or he will break her heart .
Parsing [sent. 17519 len. 41]: `` Mother , 't is little enough to consent to , '' returns the trooper , stopping her with a kiss ; `` tell me what I shall do , and I 'll make a late beginning and do it .
Parsing [sent. 17520 len. 15]: Mrs. Bagnet , you 'll take care of my mother , I know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17521 len. 11]: A very hard poke from the old girl 's umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 17522 len. 36]: `` If you 'll bring her acquainted with Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , she will find them of her way of thinking , and they will give her the best advice and assistance . ''
Parsing [sent. 17523 len. 22]: `` And , George , '' says the old lady , `` we must send with all haste for your brother .
Parsing [sent. 17524 len. 40]: He is a sensible sound man as they tell me -- out in the world beyond Chesney Wold , my dear , though I do n't know much of it myself -- and will be of great service . ''
Parsing [sent. 17525 len. 19]: `` Mother , '' returns the trooper , `` is it too soon to ask a favour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17526 len. 8]: `` Surely not , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 17527 len. 9]: `` Then grant me this one great favour .
Parsing [sent. 17528 len. 8]: Do n't let my brother know . ''
Parsing [sent. 17529 len. 9]: `` Not know what , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17530 len. 6]: `` Not know of me .
Parsing [sent. 17531 len. 21]: In fact , mother , I ca n't bear it ; I ca n't make up my mmd to it .
Parsing [sent. 17532 len. 41]: He has proved himself so different from me and has done so much to raise himself while I 've been soldiering that I have n't brass enough in my composition to see him in this place and under this charge .
Parsing [sent. 17533 len. 17]: How could a man like him be expected to have any pleasure in such a discovery ?
Parsing [sent. 17534 len. 4]: It 's impossible .
Parsing [sent. 17535 len. 31]: No , keep my secret from him , mother ; do me a greater kindness than I deserve and keep my secret from my brother , of all men . ''
Parsing [sent. 17536 len. 9]: `` But not always , dear George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17537 len. 31]: `` Why , mother , perhaps not for good and all -- though I may come to ask that too -- but keep it now , I do entreat you .
Parsing [sent. 17538 len. 57]: If it 's ever broke to him that his rip of a brother has turned up , I could wish , '' says the trooper , shaking his head very doubtfully , `` to break it myself and be governed as to advancing or retreating by the way in which he seems to take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 17539 len. 36]: As he evidently has a rooted feeling on this point , and as the depth of it is recognized in Mrs. Bagnet 's face , his mother yields her implicit assent to what he asks .
Parsing [sent. 17540 len. 7]: For this he thanks her kindly .
Parsing [sent. 17541 len. 31]: `` In all other respects , my dear mother , I 'll be as tractable and obedient as you can wish ; on this one alone , I stand out .
Parsing [sent. 17542 len. 10]: So now I am ready even for the lawyers .
Parsing [sent. 17543 len. 39]: I have been drawing up , '' he glances at his writing on the table , `` an exact account of what I knew of the deceased and how I came to be involved in this unfortunate affair .
Parsing [sent. 17544 len. 25]: It 's entered , plain and regular , like an orderly-book ; not a word in it but what 's wanted for the facts .
Parsing [sent. 17545 len. 23]: I did intend to read it , straight on end , whensoever I was called upon to say anything in my defence .
Parsing [sent. 17546 len. 42]: I hope I may be let to do it still ; but I have no longer a will of my own in this case , and whatever is said or done , I give my promise not to have any . ''
Parsing [sent. 17547 len. 23]: Matters being brought to this so far satisfactory pass , and time being on the wane , Mrs. Bagnet proposes a departure .
Parsing [sent. 17548 len. 26]: Again and again the old lady hangs upon her son 's neck , and again and again the trooper holds her to his broad chest .
Parsing [sent. 17549 len. 14]: `` Where are you going to take my mother , Mrs. Bagnet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17550 len. 16]: `` I am going to the town house , my dear , the family house .
Parsing [sent. 17551 len. 17]: I have some business there that must be looked to directly , '' Mrs. Rouncewell answers .
Parsing [sent. 17552 len. 15]: `` Will you see my mother safe there in a coach , Mrs. Bagnet ?
Parsing [sent. 17553 len. 8]: But of course I know you will .
Parsing [sent. 17554 len. 7]: Why should I ask it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17555 len. 10]: Why indeed , Mrs. Bagnet expresses with the umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 17556 len. 16]: `` Take her , my old friend , and take my gratitude along with you .
Parsing [sent. 17557 len. 40]: Kisses to Quebec and Malta , love to my godson , a hearty shake of the hand to Lignum , and this for yourself , and I wish it was ten thousand pound in gold , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17558 len. 26]: So saying , the trooper puts his lips to the old girl 's tanned forehead , and the door shuts upon him in his cell .
Parsing [sent. 17559 len. 24]: No entreaties on the part of the good old housekeeper will induce Mrs. Bagnet to retain the coach for her own conveyance home .
Parsing [sent. 17560 len. 49]: Jumping out cheerfully at the door of the Dedlock mansion and handing Mrs. Rouncewell up the steps , the old girl shakes hands and trudges off , arriving soon afterwards in the bosom of the Bagnet family and falling to washing the greens as if nothing had happened .
Parsing [sent. 17561 len. 52]: My Lady is in that room in which she held her last conference with the murdered man , and is sitting where she sat that night , and is looking at the spot where he stood upon the hearth studying her so leisurely , when a tap comes at the door .
Parsing [sent. 17562 len. 4]: Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 17563 len. 3]: Mrs. Rouncewell .
Parsing [sent. 17564 len. 10]: What has brought Mrs. Rouncewell to town so unexpectedly ?
Parsing [sent. 17565 len. 6]: `` Trouble , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 17566 len. 3]: Sad trouble .
Parsing [sent. 17567 len. 14]: Oh , my Lady , may I beg a word with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17568 len. 14]: What new occurrence is it that makes this tranquil old woman tremble so ?
Parsing [sent. 17569 len. 29]: Far happier than her Lady , as her Lady has often thought , why does she falter in this manner and look at her with such strange mistrust ?
Parsing [sent. 17570 len. 6]: `` What is the matter ?
Parsing [sent. 17571 len. 8]: Sit down and take your breath . ''
Parsing [sent. 17572 len. 9]: `` Oh , my Lady , my Lady .
Parsing [sent. 17573 len. 19]: I have found my son -- my youngest , who went away for a soldier so long ago .
Parsing [sent. 17574 len. 7]: And he is in prison . ''
Parsing [sent. 17575 len. 5]: `` For debt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17576 len. 19]: `` Oh , no , my Lady ; I would have paid any debt , and joyful . ''
Parsing [sent. 17577 len. 10]: `` For what is he in prison then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17578 len. 21]: `` Charged with a murder , my Lady , of which he is as innocent as -- as I am .
Parsing [sent. 17579 len. 9]: Accused of the murder of Mr. Tulkinghorn . ''
Parsing [sent. 17580 len. 12]: What does she mean by this look and this imploring gesture ?
Parsing [sent. 17581 len. 7]: Why does she come so close ?
Parsing [sent. 17582 len. 8]: What is the letter that she holds ?
Parsing [sent. 17583 len. 16]: `` Lady Dedlock , my dear Lady , my good Lady , my kind Lady !
Parsing [sent. 17584 len. 19]: You must have a heart to feel for me , you must have a heart to forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 17585 len. 10]: I was in this family before you were born .
Parsing [sent. 17586 len. 6]: I am devoted to it .
Parsing [sent. 17587 len. 10]: But think of my dear son wrongfully accused . ''
Parsing [sent. 17588 len. 8]: `` I do not accuse him . ''
Parsing [sent. 17589 len. 8]: `` No , my Lady , no .
Parsing [sent. 17590 len. 13]: But others do , and he is in prison and in danger .
Parsing [sent. 17591 len. 22]: Oh , Lady Dedlock , if you can say but a word to help to clear him , say it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17592 len. 6]: What delusion can this be ?
Parsing [sent. 17593 len. 22]: What power does she suppose is in the person she petitions to avert this unjust suspicion , if it be unjust ?
Parsing [sent. 17594 len. 14]: Her Lady 's handsome eyes regard her with astonishment , almost with fear .
Parsing [sent. 17595 len. 46]: `` My Lady , I came away last night from Chesney Wold to find my son in my old age , and the step upon the Ghost 's Walk was so constant and so solemn that I never heard the like in all these years .
Parsing [sent. 17596 len. 25]: Night after night , as it has fallen dark , the sound has echoed through your rooms , but last night it was awfullest .
Parsing [sent. 17597 len. 17]: And as it fell dark last night , my Lady , I got this letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 17598 len. 7]: `` What letter is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17599 len. 3]: `` Hush !
Parsing [sent. 17600 len. 3]: Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17601 len. 53]: The housekeeper looks round and answers in a frightened whisper , `` My Lady , I have not breathed a word of it , I do n't believe what 's written in it , I know it ca n't be true , I am sure and certain that it is not true .
Parsing [sent. 17602 len. 17]: But my son is in danger , and you must have a heart to pity me .
Parsing [sent. 17603 len. 58]: If you know of anything that is not known to others , if you have any suspicion , if you have any clue at all , and any reason for keeping it in your own breast , oh , my dear Lady , think of me , and conquer that reason , and let it be known !
Parsing [sent. 17604 len. 8]: This is the most I consider possible .
Parsing [sent. 17605 len. 61]: I know you are not a hard lady , but you go your own way always without help , and you are not familiar with your friends ; and all who admire you -- and all do -- as a beautiful and elegant lady , know you to be one far away from themselves who ca n't be approached close .
Parsing [sent. 17606 len. 58]: My Lady , you may have some proud or angry reasons for disdaining to utter something that you know ; if so , pray , oh , pray , think of a faithful servant whose whole life has been passed in this family which she dearly loves , and relent , and help to clear my son !
Parsing [sent. 17607 len. 86]: My Lady , my good Lady , '' the old housekeeper pleads with genuine simplicity , `` I am so humble in my place and you are by nature so high and distant that you may not think what I feel for my child , but I feel so much that I have come here to make so bold as to beg and pray you not to be scornful of us if you can do us any right or justice at this fearful time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17608 len. 17]: Lady Dedlock raises her without one word , until she takes the letter from her hand .
Parsing [sent. 17609 len. 8]: `` Am I to read this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17610 len. 24]: `` When I am gone , my Lady , if you please , and then remembering the most that I consider possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 17611 len. 9]: `` I know of nothing I can do .
Parsing [sent. 17612 len. 12]: I know of nothing I reserve that can affect your son .
Parsing [sent. 17613 len. 7]: I have never accused him . ''
Parsing [sent. 17614 len. 20]: `` My Lady , you may pity him the more under a false accusation after reading the letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 17615 len. 12]: The old housekeeper leaves her with the letter in her hand .
Parsing [sent. 17616 len. 37]: In truth she is not a hard lady naturally , and the time has been when the sight of the venerable figure suing to her with such strong earnestness would have moved her to great compassion .
Parsing [sent. 17617 len. 70]: But so long accustomed to suppress emotion and keep down reality , so long schooled for her own purposes in that destructive school which shuts up the natural feelings of the heart like flies in amber and spreads one uniform and dreary gloss over the good and bad , the feeling and the unfeeling , the sensible and the senseless , she had subdued even her wonder until now .
Parsing [sent. 17618 len. 5]: She opens the letter .
Parsing [sent. 17619 len. 45]: Spread out upon the paper is a printed account of the discovery of the body as it lay face downward on the floor , shot through the heart ; and underneath is written her own name , with the word `` murderess '' attached .
Parsing [sent. 17620 len. 7]: It falls out of her hand .
Parsing [sent. 17621 len. 35]: How long it may have lain upon the ground she knows not , but it lies where it fell when a servant stands before her announcing the young man of the name of Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 17622 len. 23]: The words have probably been repeated several times , for they are ringing in her head before she begins to understand them .
Parsing [sent. 17623 len. 7]: `` Let him come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17624 len. 4]: He comes in .
Parsing [sent. 17625 len. 22]: Holding the letter in her hand , which she has taken from the floor , she tries to collect her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 17626 len. 23]: In the eyes of Mr. Guppy she is the same Lady Dedlock , holding the same prepared , proud , chilling state .
Parsing [sent. 17627 len. 81]: `` Your ladyship may not be at first disposed to excuse this visit from one who has never been welcome to your ladyship '' -- which he do n't complain of , for he is bound to confess that there never has been any particular reason on the face of things why he should be -- `` but I hope when I mention my motives to your ladyship you will not find fault with me , '' says Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 17628 len. 5]: `` Do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 17629 len. 5]: `` Thank your ladyship .
Parsing [sent. 17630 len. 104]: I ought first to explain to your ladyship , '' Mr. Guppy sits on the edge of a chair and puts his hat on the carpet at his feet , `` that Miss Summerson , whose image , as I formerly mentioned to your ladyship , was at one period of my life imprinted on my ` eart until erased by circumstances over which I had no control , communicated to me , after I had the pleasure of waiting on your ladyship last , that she particularly wished me to take no steps whatever in any manner at all relating to her .
Parsing [sent. 17631 len. 41]: And Miss Summerson 's wishes being to me a law -LRB- except as connected with circumstances over which I have no control -RRB- , I consequently never expected to have the distinguished honour of waiting on your ladyship again . ''
Parsing [sent. 17632 len. 13]: And yet he is here now , Lady Dedlock moodily reminds him .
Parsing [sent. 17633 len. 13]: `` And yet I am here now , '' Mr. Guppy admits .
Parsing [sent. 17634 len. 22]: `` My object being to communicate to your ladyship , under the seal of confidence , why I am here . ''
Parsing [sent. 17635 len. 16]: He can not do so , she tells him , too plainly or too briefly .
Parsing [sent. 17636 len. 40]: `` Nor can I , '' Mr. Guppy returns with a sense of injury upon him , `` too particularly request your ladyship to take particular notice that it 's no personal affair of mine that brings me here .
Parsing [sent. 17637 len. 14]: I have no interested views of my own to serve in coming here .
Parsing [sent. 17638 len. 41]: If it was not for my promise to Miss Summerson and my keeping of it sacred -- I , in point of fact , should n't have darkened these doors again , but should have seen 'em further first . ''
Parsing [sent. 17639 len. 16]: Mr. Guppy considers this a favourable moment for sticking up his hair with both hands .
Parsing [sent. 17640 len. 33]: `` Your ladyship will remember when I mention it that the last time I was here I run against a party very eminent in our profession and whose loss we all deplore .
Parsing [sent. 17641 len. 58]: That party certainly did from that time apply himself to cutting in against me in a way that I will call sharp practice , and did make it , at every turn and point , extremely difficult for me to be sure that I had n't inadvertently led up to something contrary to Miss Summerson 's wishes .
Parsing [sent. 17642 len. 24]: Self-praise is no recommendation , but I may say for myself that I am not so bad a man of business neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 17643 len. 9]: Lady Dedlock looks at him in stern inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 17644 len. 14]: Mr. Guppy immediately withdraws his eyes from her face and looks anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 17645 len. 66]: `` Indeed , it has been made so hard , '' he goes on , `` to have any idea what that party was up to in combination with others that until the loss which we all deplore I was gravelled -- an expression which your ladyship , moving in the higher circles , will be so good as to consider tantamount to knocked over .
Parsing [sent. 17646 len. 49]: Small likewise -- a name by which I refer to another party , a friend of mine that your ladyship is not acquainted with -- got to be so close and double-faced that at times it was n't easy to keep one 's hands off his ` ead .
Parsing [sent. 17647 len. 69]: However , what with the exertion of my humble abilities , and what with the help of a mutual friend by the name of Mr. Tony Weevle -LRB- who is of a high aristocratic turn and has your ladyship 's portrait always hanging up in his room -RRB- , I have now reasons for an apprehension as to which I come to put your ladyship upon your guard .
Parsing [sent. 17648 len. 20]: First , will your ladyship allow me to ask you whether you have had any strange visitors this morning ?
Parsing [sent. 17649 len. 41]: I do n't mean fashionable visitors , but such visitors , for instance , as Miss Barbary 's old servant , or as a person without the use of his lower extremities , carried upstairs similarly to a guy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17650 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17651 len. 18]: `` Then I assure your ladyship that such visitors have been here and have been received here .
Parsing [sent. 17652 len. 34]: Because I saw them at the door , and waited at the corner of the square till they came out , and took half an hour 's turn afterwards to avoid them . ''
Parsing [sent. 17653 len. 14]: `` What have I to do with that , or what have you ?
Parsing [sent. 17654 len. 6]: I do not understand you .
Parsing [sent. 17655 len. 6]: What do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17656 len. 13]: `` Your ladyship , I come to put you on your guard .
Parsing [sent. 17657 len. 8]: There may be no occasion for it .
Parsing [sent. 17658 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 17659 len. 15]: Then I have only done my best to keep my promise to Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 17660 len. 40]: I strongly suspect -LRB- from what Small has dropped , and from what we have corkscrewed out of him -RRB- that those letters I was to have brought to your ladyship were not destroyed when I supposed they were .
Parsing [sent. 17661 len. 15]: That if there was anything to be blown upon , it IS blown upon .
Parsing [sent. 17662 len. 18]: That the visitors I have alluded to have been here this morning to make money of it .
Parsing [sent. 17663 len. 11]: And that the money is made , or making . ''
Parsing [sent. 17664 len. 9]: Mr. Guppy picks up his hat and rises .
Parsing [sent. 17665 len. 21]: `` Your ladyship , you know best whether there 's anything in what I say or whether there 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 17666 len. 38]: Something or nothing , I have acted up to Miss Summerson 's wishes in letting things alone and in undoing what I had begun to do , as far as possible ; that 's sufficient for me .
Parsing [sent. 17667 len. 45]: In case I should be taking a liberty in putting your ladyship on your guard when there 's no necessity for it , you will endeavour , I should hope , to outlive my presumption , and I shall endeavour to outlive your disapprobation .
Parsing [sent. 17668 len. 28]: I now take my farewell of your ladyship , and assure you that there 's no danger of your ever being waited on by me again . ''
Parsing [sent. 17669 len. 25]: She scarcely acknowledges these parting words by any look , but when he has been gone a little while , she rings her bell .
Parsing [sent. 17670 len. 7]: `` Where is Sir Leicester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17671 len. 14]: Mercury reports that he is at present shut up in the library alone .
Parsing [sent. 17672 len. 11]: `` Has Sir Leicester had any visitors this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17673 len. 5]: Several , on business .
Parsing [sent. 17674 len. 16]: Mercury proceeds to a description of them , which has been anticipated by Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 17675 len. 6]: Enough ; he may go .
Parsing [sent. 17676 len. 2]: So !
Parsing [sent. 17677 len. 5]: All is broken down .
Parsing [sent. 17678 len. 60]: Her name is in these many mouths , her husband knows his wrongs , her shame will be published -- may be spreading while she thinks about it -- and in addition to the thunderbolt so long foreseen by her , so unforeseen by him , she is denounced by an invisible accuser as the murderess of her enemy .
Parsing [sent. 17679 len. 17]: Her enemy he was , and she has often , often , often wished him dead .
Parsing [sent. 17680 len. 10]: Her enemy he is , even in his grave .
Parsing [sent. 17681 len. 15]: This dreadful accusation comes upon her like a new torment at his lifeless hand .
Parsing [sent. 17682 len. 50]: And when she recalls how she was secretly at his door that night , and how she may be represented to have sent her favourite girl away so soon before merely to release herself from observation , she shudders as if the hangman 's hands were at her neck .
Parsing [sent. 17683 len. 26]: She has thrown herself upon the floor and lies with her hair all wildly scattered and her face buried in the cushions of a couch .
Parsing [sent. 17684 len. 19]: She rises up , hurries to and fro , flings herself down again , and rocks and moans .
Parsing [sent. 17685 len. 9]: The horror that is upon her is unutterable .
Parsing [sent. 17686 len. 19]: If she really were the murderess , it could hardly be , for the moment , more intense .
Parsing [sent. 17687 len. 118]: For as her murderous perspective , before the doing of the deed , however subtle the precautions for its commission , would have been closed up by a gigantic dilatation of the hateful figure , preventing her from seeing any consequences beyond it ; and as those consequences would have rushed in , in an unimagined flood , the moment the figure was laid low -- which always happens when a murder is done ; so , now she sees that when he used to be on the watch before her , and she used to think , `` if some mortal stroke would but fall on this old man and take him from my way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17688 len. 25]: it was but wishing that all he held against her in his hand might be flung to the winds and chance-sown in many places .
Parsing [sent. 17689 len. 15]: So , too , with the wicked relief she has felt in his death .
Parsing [sent. 17690 len. 31]: What was his death but the key-stone of a gloomy arch removed , and now the arch begins to fall in a thousand fragments , each crushing and mangling piecemeal !
Parsing [sent. 17691 len. 47]: Thus , a terrible impression steals upon and overshadows her that from this pursuer , living or dead -- obdurate and imperturbable before her in his well-remembered shape , or not more obdurate and imperturbable in his coffin-bed -- there is no escape but in death .
Parsing [sent. 17692 len. 5]: Hunted , she flies .
Parsing [sent. 17693 len. 39]: The complication of her shame , her dread , remorse , and misery , overwhelms her at its height ; and even her strength of self-reliance is overturned and whirled away like a leaf before a mighty wind .
Parsing [sent. 17694 len. 38]: She hurriedly addresses these lines to her husband , seals , and leaves them on her table : If I am sought for , or accused of , his murder , believe that I am wholly innocent .
Parsing [sent. 17695 len. 28]: Believe no other good of me , for I am innocent of nothing else that you have heard , or will hear , laid to my charge .
Parsing [sent. 17696 len. 18]: He prepared me , on that fatal night , for his disclosure of my guilt to you .
Parsing [sent. 17697 len. 62]: After he had left me , I went out on pretence of walking in the garden where I sometimes walk , but really to follow him and make one last petition that he would not protract the dreadful suspense on which I have been racked by him , you do not know how long , but would mercifully strike next morning .
Parsing [sent. 17698 len. 8]: I found his house dark and silent .
Parsing [sent. 17699 len. 18]: I rang twice at his door , but there was no reply , and I came home .
Parsing [sent. 17700 len. 6]: I have no home left .
Parsing [sent. 17701 len. 7]: I will encumber you no more .
Parsing [sent. 17702 len. 49]: May you , in your just resentment , be able to forget the unworthy woman on whom you have wasted a most generous devotion -- who avoids you only with a deeper shame than that with which she hurries from herself -- and who writes this last adieu .
Parsing [sent. 17703 len. 42]: She veils and dresses quickly , leaves all her jewels and her money , listens , goes downstairs at a moment when the hall is empty , opens and shuts the great door , flutters away in the shrill frosty wind .
Parsing [sent. 17704 len. 38]: Chapter LVI -- Pursuit Impassive , as behoves its high breeding , the Dedlock town house stares at the other houses in the street of dismal grandeur and gives no outward sign of anything going wrong within .
Parsing [sent. 17705 len. 53]: Carriages rattle , doors are battered at , the world exchanges calls ; ancient charmers with skeleton throats and peachy cheeks that have a rather ghastly bloom upon them seen by daylight , when indeed these fascinating creatures look like Death and the Lady fused together , dazzle the eyes of men .
Parsing [sent. 17706 len. 45]: Forth from the frigid mews come easily swinging carriages guided by short-legged coachmen in flaxen wigs , deep sunk into downy hammercloths , and up behind mount luscious Mercuries bearing sticks of state and wearing cocked hats broadwise , a spectacle for the angels .
Parsing [sent. 17707 len. 19]: The Dedlock town house changes not externally , and hours pass before its exalted dullness is disturbed within .
Parsing [sent. 17708 len. 37]: But Volumnia the fair , being subject to the prevalent complaint of boredom and finding that disorder attacking her spirits with some virulence , ventures at length to repair to the library for change of scene .
Parsing [sent. 17709 len. 25]: Her gentle tapping at the door producing no response , she opens it and peeps in ; seeing no one there , takes possession .
Parsing [sent. 17710 len. 50]: The sprightly Dedlock is reputed , in that grass-grown city of the ancients , Bath , to be stimulated by an urgent curiosity which impels her on all convenient and inconvenient occasions to sidle about with a golden glass at her eye , peering into objects of every description .
Parsing [sent. 17711 len. 64]: Certain it is that she avails herself of the present opportunity of hovering over her kinsman 's letters and papers like a bird , taking a short peck at this document and a blink with her head on one side at that document , and hopping about from table to table with her glass at her eye in an inquisitive and restless manner .
Parsing [sent. 17712 len. 31]: In the course of these researches she stumbles over something , and turning her glass in that direction , sees her kinsman lying on the ground like a felled tree .
Parsing [sent. 17713 len. 23]: Volumnia 's pet little scream acquires a considerable augmentation of reality from this surprise , and the house is quickly in commotion .
Parsing [sent. 17714 len. 30]: Servants tear up and down stairs , bells are violently rung , doctors are sent for , and Lady Dedlock is sought in all directions , but not found .
Parsing [sent. 17715 len. 13]: Nobody has seen or heard her since she last rang her bell .
Parsing [sent. 17716 len. 49]: Her letter to Sir Leicester is discovered on her table , but it is doubtful yet whether he has not received another missive from another world requiring to be personally answered , and all the living languages , and all the dead , are as one to him .
Parsing [sent. 17717 len. 31]: They lay him down upon his bed , and chafe , and rub , and fan , and put ice to his head , and try every means of restoration .
Parsing [sent. 17718 len. 37]: Howbeit , the day has ebbed away , and it is night in his room before his stertorous breathing lulls or his fixed eyes show any consciousness of the candle that is occasionally passed before them .
Parsing [sent. 17719 len. 32]: But when this change begins , it goes on ; and by and by he nods or moves his eyes or even his hand in token that he hears and comprehends .
Parsing [sent. 17720 len. 27]: He fell down , this morning , a handsome stately gentleman , somewhat infirm , but of a fine presence , and with a well-filled face .
Parsing [sent. 17721 len. 19]: He lies upon his bed , an aged man with sunken cheeks , the decrepit shadow of himself .
Parsing [sent. 17722 len. 42]: His voice was rich and mellow and he had so long been thoroughly persuaded of the weight and import to mankind of any word he said that his words really had come to sound as if there were something in them .
Parsing [sent. 17723 len. 22]: But now he can only whisper , and what he whispers sounds like what it is -- mere jumble and jargon .
Parsing [sent. 17724 len. 10]: His favourite and faithful housekeeper stands at his bedside .
Parsing [sent. 17725 len. 16]: It is the first act he notices , and he clearly derives pleasure from it .
Parsing [sent. 17726 len. 17]: After vainly trying to make himself understood in speech , he makes signs for a pencil .
Parsing [sent. 17727 len. 28]: So inexpressively that they can not at first understand him ; it is his old housekeeper who makes out what he wants and brings in a slate .
Parsing [sent. 17728 len. 24]: After pausing for some time , he slowly scrawls upon it in a hand that is not his , `` Chesney Wold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17729 len. 11]: No , she tells him ; he is in London .
Parsing [sent. 17730 len. 10]: He was taken ill in the library this morning .
Parsing [sent. 17731 len. 19]: Right thankful she is that she happened to come to London and is able to attend upon him .
Parsing [sent. 17732 len. 14]: `` It is not an illness of any serious consequence , Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 17733 len. 10]: You will be much better to-morrow , Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 17734 len. 7]: All the gentlemen say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 17735 len. 12]: This , with the tears coursing down her fair old face .
Parsing [sent. 17736 len. 29]: After making a survey of the room and looking with particular attention all round the bed where the doctors stand , he writes , `` My Lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 17737 len. 25]: `` My Lady went out , Sir Leicester , before you were taken ill , and do n't know of your illness yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 17738 len. 13]: He points again , in great agitation , at the two words .
Parsing [sent. 17739 len. 15]: They all try to quiet him , but he points again with increased agitation .
Parsing [sent. 17740 len. 25]: On their looking at one another , not knowing what to say , he takes the slate once more and writes `` My Lady .
Parsing [sent. 17741 len. 8]: For God 's sake , where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17742 len. 6]: And makes an imploring moan .
Parsing [sent. 17743 len. 27]: It is thought better that his old housekeeper should give him Lady Dedlock 's letter , the contents of which no one knows or can surmise .
Parsing [sent. 17744 len. 13]: She opens it for him and puts it out for his perusal .
Parsing [sent. 17745 len. 24]: Having read it twice by a great effort , he turns it down so that it shall not be seen and lies moaning .
Parsing [sent. 17746 len. 34]: He passes into a kind of relapse or into a swoon , and it is an hour before he opens his eyes , reclining on his faithful and attached old servant 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 17747 len. 21]: The doctors know that he is best with her , and when not actively engaged about him , stand aloof .
Parsing [sent. 17748 len. 19]: The slate comes into requisition again , but the word he wants to write he can not remember .
Parsing [sent. 17749 len. 16]: His anxiety , his eagerness , and affliction at this pass are pitiable to behold .
Parsing [sent. 17750 len. 32]: It seems as if he must go mad in the necessity he feels for haste and the inability under which he labours of expressing to do what or to fetch whom .
Parsing [sent. 17751 len. 11]: He has written the letter B , and there stopped .
Parsing [sent. 17752 len. 17]: Of a sudden , in the height of his misery , he puts Mr. before it .
Parsing [sent. 17753 len. 6]: The old housekeeper suggests Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17754 len. 3]: Thank heaven !
Parsing [sent. 17755 len. 5]: That 's his meaning .
Parsing [sent. 17756 len. 11]: Mr. Bucket is found to be downstairs , by appointment .
Parsing [sent. 17757 len. 5]: Shall he come up ?
Parsing [sent. 17758 len. 31]: There is no possibility of misconstruing Sir Leicester 's burning wish to see him or the desire he signifies to have the room cleared of every one but the housekeeper .
Parsing [sent. 17759 len. 10]: It is speedily done , and Mr. Bucket appears .
Parsing [sent. 17760 len. 25]: Of all men upon earth , Sir Leicester seems fallen from his high estate to place his sole trust and reliance upon this man .
Parsing [sent. 17761 len. 16]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I 'm sorry to see you like this .
Parsing [sent. 17762 len. 7]: I hope you 'll cheer up .
Parsing [sent. 17763 len. 14]: I 'm sure you will , on account of the family credit . ''
Parsing [sent. 17764 len. 18]: Leicester puts her letter in his hands and looks intently in his face while he reads it .
Parsing [sent. 17765 len. 46]: A new intelligence comes into Mr. Bucket 's eye as he reads on ; with one hook of his finger , while that eye is still glancing over the words , he indicates , `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I understand you . ''
Parsing [sent. 17766 len. 7]: Sir Leicester writes upon the slate .
Parsing [sent. 17767 len. 4]: `` Full forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 17768 len. 9]: Find -- '' Mr. Bucket stops his hand .
Parsing [sent. 17769 len. 12]: `` Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I 'll find her .
Parsing [sent. 17770 len. 12]: But my search after her must be begun out of hand .
Parsing [sent. 17771 len. 8]: Not a minute must be lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 17772 len. 21]: With the quickness of thought , he follows Sir Leicester Dedlock 's look towards a little box upon a table .
Parsing [sent. 17773 len. 11]: `` Bring it here , Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet ?
Parsing [sent. 17774 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 17775 len. 9]: Open it with one of these here keys ?
Parsing [sent. 17776 len. 2]: Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 17777 len. 4]: The littlest key ?
Parsing [sent. 17778 len. 4]: TO be sure .
Parsing [sent. 17779 len. 5]: Take the notes out ?
Parsing [sent. 17780 len. 4]: So I will .
Parsing [sent. 17781 len. 3]: Count 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 17782 len. 5]: That 's soon done .
Parsing [sent. 17783 len. 23]: Twenty and thirty 's fifty , and twenty 's seventy , and fifty 's one twenty , and forty 's one sixty .
Parsing [sent. 17784 len. 5]: Take 'em for expenses ?
Parsing [sent. 17785 len. 12]: That I 'll do , and render an account of course .
Parsing [sent. 17786 len. 5]: Do n't spare money ?
Parsing [sent. 17787 len. 6]: No I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 17788 len. 19]: The velocity and certainty of Mr. Bucket 's interpretation on all these heads is little short of miraculous .
Parsing [sent. 17789 len. 28]: Mrs. Rouncewell , who holds the light , is giddy with the swiftness of his eyes and hands as he starts up , furnished for his journey .
Parsing [sent. 17790 len. 21]: `` You 're George 's mother , old lady ; that 's about what you are , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17791 len. 15]: says Mr. Bucket aside , with his hat already on and buttoning his coat .
Parsing [sent. 17792 len. 12]: `` Yes , sir , I am his distressed mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 17793 len. 15]: `` So I thought , according to what he mentioned to me just now .
Parsing [sent. 17794 len. 10]: Well , then , I 'll tell you something .
Parsing [sent. 17795 len. 8]: You need n't be distressed no more .
Parsing [sent. 17796 len. 6]: Your son 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 17797 len. 35]: Now , do n't you begin a-crying , because what you 've got to do is to take care of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and you wo n't do that by crying .
Parsing [sent. 17798 len. 28]: As to your son , he 's all right , I tell you ; and he sends his loving duty , and hoping you 're the same .
Parsing [sent. 17799 len. 38]: He 's discharged honourable ; that 's about what HE is ; with no more imputation on his character than there is on yours , and yours is a tidy one , I 'LL bet a pound .
Parsing [sent. 17800 len. 11]: You may trust me , for I took your son .
Parsing [sent. 17801 len. 52]: He conducted himself in a game way , too , on that occasion ; and he 's a fine-made man , and you 're a fine-made old lady , and you 're a mother and son , the pair of you , as might be showed for models in a caravan .
Parsing [sent. 17802 len. 18]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , what you 've trusted to me I 'll go through with .
Parsing [sent. 17803 len. 40]: Do n't you be afraid of my turing out of my way , right or left , or taking a sleep , or a wash , or a shave till I have found what I go in search of .
Parsing [sent. 17804 len. 11]: Say everything as is kind and forgiving on your part ?
Parsing [sent. 17805 len. 9]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , I will .
Parsing [sent. 17806 len. 37]: And I wish you better , and these family affairs smoothed over -- as , Lord , many other family affairs equally has been , and equally wlll be , to the end of time . ''
Parsing [sent. 17807 len. 32]: With this peroration , Mr. Bucket , buttoned up , goes quietly out , looking steadily before him as if he were already piercing the night in quest of the fugitive .
Parsing [sent. 17808 len. 26]: His first step is to take himself to Lady Dedlock 's rooms and look all over them for any trifling indication that may help him .
Parsing [sent. 17809 len. 63]: The rooms are in darkness now ; and to see Mr. Bucket with a wax-light in his hand , holding it above his head and taking a sharp mental inventory of the many delicate objects so curiously at variance with himself , would be to see a sight -- which nobody DOES see , as he is particular to lock himself in .
Parsing [sent. 17810 len. 29]: `` A spicy boudoir , this , '' says Mr. Bucket , who feels in a manner furbished up in his French by the blow of the morning .
Parsing [sent. 17811 len. 9]: `` Must have cost a sight of money .
Parsing [sent. 17812 len. 19]: Rum articles to cut away from , these ; she must have been hard put to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17813 len. 25]: Opening and shutting table-drawers and looking into caskets and jewel-cases , he sees the reflection of himself in various mirrors , and moralizes thereon .
Parsing [sent. 17814 len. 24]: `` One might suppose I was a-moving in the fashionable circles and getting myself up for almac 's , '' says Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17815 len. 18]: `` I begin to think I must be a swell in the Guards without knowing it . ''
Parsing [sent. 17816 len. 16]: Ever looking about , he has opened a dainty little chest in an inner drawer .
Parsing [sent. 17817 len. 29]: His great hand , turning over some gloves which it can scarcely feel , they are so light and soft within it , comes upon a white handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 17818 len. 3]: `` Hum !
Parsing [sent. 17819 len. 18]: Let 's have a look at YOU , '' says Mr. Bucket , putting down the light .
Parsing [sent. 17820 len. 10]: `` What should YOU be kept by yourself for ?
Parsing [sent. 17821 len. 5]: What 's YOUR motive ?
Parsing [sent. 17822 len. 12]: Are you her ladyship 's property , or somebody else 's ?
Parsing [sent. 17823 len. 15]: You 've got a mark upon you somewheres or another , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17824 len. 12]: He finds it as he speaks , `` Esther Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 17825 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17826 len. 13]: says Mr. Bucket , pausing , with his finger at his ear .
Parsing [sent. 17827 len. 9]: `` Come , I 'll take YOU . ''
Parsing [sent. 17828 len. 39]: He completes his observations as quietly and carefully as he has carried them on , leaves everything else precisely as he found it , glides away after some five minutes in all , and passes into the street .
Parsing [sent. 17829 len. 44]: With a glance upward at the dimly lighted windows of Sir Leicester 's room , he sets off , full-swing , to the nearest coach-stand , picks out the horse for his money , and directs to be driven to the shooting gallery .
Parsing [sent. 17830 len. 54]: Mr. Bucket does not claim to be a scientific judge of horses , but he lays out a little money on the principal events in that line , and generally sums up his knowledge of the subject in the remark that when he sees a horse as can go , he knows him .
Parsing [sent. 17831 len. 11]: His knowledge is not at fault in the present instance .
Parsing [sent. 17832 len. 108]: Clattering over the stones at a dangerous pace , yet thoughtfully bringing his keen eyes to bear on every slinking creature whom he passes in the midnight streets , and even on the lights in upper windows where people are going or gone to bed , and on all the turnings that he rattles by , and alike on the heavy sky , and on the earth where the snow lies thin -- for something may present itself to assist him , anywhere -- he dashes to his destination at such a speed that when he stops the horse half smothers him in a cloud of steam .
Parsing [sent. 17833 len. 18]: `` Unbear him half a moment to freshen him up , and I 'll be back . ''
Parsing [sent. 17834 len. 15]: He runs up the long wooden entry and finds the trooper smoking his pipe .
Parsing [sent. 17835 len. 18]: `` I thought I should , George , after what you have gone through , my lad .
Parsing [sent. 17836 len. 8]: I have n't a word to spare .
Parsing [sent. 17837 len. 4]: Now , honour !
Parsing [sent. 17838 len. 6]: All to save a woman .
Parsing [sent. 17839 len. 26]: Miss Summerson that was here when Gridley died -- that was the name , I know -- all right -- where does she live ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17840 len. 17]: The trooper has just come from there and gives him the address , near Oxford Street .
Parsing [sent. 17841 len. 9]: `` You wo n't repent it , George .
Parsing [sent. 17842 len. 4]: Good night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17843 len. 37]: He is off again , with an impression of having seen Phil sitting by the frosty fire staring at him open-mouthed , and gallops away again , and gets out in a cloud of steam again .
Parsing [sent. 17844 len. 40]: Mr. Jarndyce , the only person up in the house , is just going to bed , rises from his book on hearing the rapid ringing at the bell , and comes down to the door in his dressing-gown .
Parsing [sent. 17845 len. 9]: `` Do n't be alarmed , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 17846 len. 27]: In a moment his visitor is confidential with him in the hall , has shut the door , and stands with his hand upon the lock .
Parsing [sent. 17847 len. 11]: `` I 've had the pleasure of seeing you before .
Parsing [sent. 17848 len. 3]: Inspector Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17849 len. 12]: Look at that handkerchief , sir , Miss Esther Summerson 's .
Parsing [sent. 17850 len. 19]: Found it myself put away in a drawer of Lady Dedlock 's , quarter of an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 17851 len. 6]: Not a moment to lose .
Parsing [sent. 17852 len. 6]: Matter of life or death .
Parsing [sent. 17853 len. 6]: You know Lady Dedlock ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17854 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 17855 len. 9]: `` There has been a discovery there to-day .
Parsing [sent. 17856 len. 6]: Family affairs have come out .
Parsing [sent. 17857 len. 29]: Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has had a fit -- apoplexy or paralysis -- and could n't be brought to , and precious time has been lost .
Parsing [sent. 17858 len. 15]: Lady Dedlock disappeared this afternoon and left a letter for him that looks bad .
Parsing [sent. 17859 len. 6]: Run your eye over it .
Parsing [sent. 17860 len. 5]: Here it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17861 len. 13]: Mr. Jarndyce , having read it , asks him what he thinks .
Parsing [sent. 17862 len. 6]: `` I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 17863 len. 5]: It looks like suicide .
Parsing [sent. 17864 len. 18]: Anyways , there 's more and more danger , every minute , of its drawing to that .
Parsing [sent. 17865 len. 18]: I 'd give a hundred pound an hour to have got the start of the present time .
Parsing [sent. 17866 len. 31]: Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I am employed by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , to follow her and find her , to save her and take her his forgiveness .
Parsing [sent. 17867 len. 13]: I have money and full power , but I want something else .
Parsing [sent. 17868 len. 6]: I want Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 17869 len. 13]: Mr. Jarndyce in a troubled voice repeats , `` Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17870 len. 44]: `` Now , Mr. Jarndyce '' -- Mr. Bucket has read his face with the greatest attention all along -- `` I speak to you as a gentleman of a humane heart , and under such pressing circumstances as do n't often happen .
Parsing [sent. 17871 len. 29]: If ever delay was dangerous , it 's dangerous now ; and if ever you could n't afterwards forgive yourself for causing it , this is the time .
Parsing [sent. 17872 len. 27]: Eight or ten hours , worth , as I tell you , a hundred pound apiece at least , have been lost since Lady Dedlock disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 17873 len. 7]: I am charged to find her .
Parsing [sent. 17874 len. 5]: I am Inspector Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17875 len. 23]: Besides all the rest that 's heavy on her , she has upon her , as she believes , suspicion of murder .
Parsing [sent. 17876 len. 30]: If I follow her alone , she , being in ignorance of what Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , has communicated to me , may be driven to desperation .
Parsing [sent. 17877 len. 49]: But if I follow her in company with a young lady , answering to the description of a young lady that she has a tenderness for -- I ask no question , and I say no more than that -- she will give me credit for being friendly .
Parsing [sent. 17878 len. 38]: Let me come up with her and be able to have the hold upon her of putting that young lady for ` ard , and I 'll save her and prevail with her if she is alive .
Parsing [sent. 17879 len. 31]: Let me come up with her alone -- a hard matter -- and I 'll do my best , but I do n't answer for what the best may be .
Parsing [sent. 17880 len. 11]: Time flies ; it 's getting on for one o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 17881 len. 24]: When one strikes , there 's another hour gone , and it 's worth a thousand pound now instead of a hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 17882 len. 17]: This is all true , and the pressing nature of the case can not be questioned .
Parsing [sent. 17883 len. 14]: Mr. Jarndyce begs him to remain there while he speaks to Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 17884 len. 28]: Mr. Bucket says he will , but acting on his usual principle , does no such thing , following upstairs instead and keeping his man in sight .
Parsing [sent. 17885 len. 18]: So he remains , dodging and lurking about in the gloom of the staircase while they confer .
Parsing [sent. 17886 len. 32]: In a very little time Mr. Jarndyce comes down and tells him that Miss Summerson will join him directly and place herself under his protection to accompany him where he pleases .
Parsing [sent. 17887 len. 16]: Mr. Bucket , satisfied , expresses high approval and awaits her coming at the door .
Parsing [sent. 17888 len. 16]: There he mounts a high tower in his mind and looks out far and wide .
Parsing [sent. 17889 len. 25]: Many solitary figures he perceives creeping through the streets ; many solitary figures out on heaths , and roads , and lying under haystacks .
Parsing [sent. 17890 len. 11]: But the figure that he seeks is not among them .
Parsing [sent. 17891 len. 51]: Other solitaries he perceives , in nooks of bridges , looking over ; and in shadowed places down by the river 's level ; and a dark , dark , shapeless object drifting with the tide , more solitary than all , clings with a drowning hold on his attention .
Parsing [sent. 17892 len. 4]: Where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 17893 len. 8]: Living or dead , where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 17894 len. 49]: If , as he folds the handkerchief and carefully puts it up , it were able with an enchanted power to bring before him the place where she found it and the night-landscape near the cottage where it covered the little child , would he descry her there ?
Parsing [sent. 17895 len. 103]: On the waste where the brick-kilns are burning with a pale blue flare , where the straw-roofs of the wretched huts in which the bricks are made are being scattered by the wind , where the clay and water are hard frozen and the mill in which the gaunt blind horse goes round all day looks like an instrument of human torture -- traversing this deserted , blighted spot there is a lonely figure with the sad world to itself , pelted by the snow and driven by the wind , and cast out , it would seem , from all companionship .
Parsing [sent. 17896 len. 36]: It is the figure of a woman , too ; but it is miserably dressed , and no such clothes ever came through the hall and out at the great door of the Dedlock mansion .
Parsing [sent. 17897 len. 32]: Chapter LVII -- Esther 's Narrative I had gone to bed and fallen asleep when my guardian knocked at the door of my room and begged me to get up directly .
Parsing [sent. 17898 len. 37]: On my hurrying to speak to him and learn what had happened , he told me , after a word or two of preparation , that there had been a discovery at Sir Leicester Dedlock 's .
Parsing [sent. 17899 len. 59]: That my mother had fled , that a person was now at our door who was empowered to convey to her the fullest assurances of affectionate protection and forgiveness if he could possibly find her , and that I was sought for to accompany him in the hope that my entreaties might prevail upon her if his failed .
Parsing [sent. 17900 len. 58]: Something to this general purpose I made out , but I was thrown into such a tumult of alarm , and hurry and distress , that in spite of every effort I could make to subdue my agitation , I did not seem , to myself , fully to recover my right mind until hours had passed .
Parsing [sent. 17901 len. 29]: But I dressed and wrapped up expeditiously without waking Charley or any one and went down to Mr. Bucket , who was the person entrusted with the secret .
Parsing [sent. 17902 len. 26]: In taking me to him my guardian told me this , and also explained how it was that he had come to think of me .
Parsing [sent. 17903 len. 57]: Mr. Bucket , in a low voice , by the light of my guardian 's candle , read to me in the hall a letter that my mother had left upon her table ; and I suppose within ten minutes of my having been aroused I was sitting beside him , rolling swiftly through the streets .
Parsing [sent. 17904 len. 40]: His manner was very keen , and yet considerate when he explained to me that a great deal might depend on my being able to answer , without confusion , a few questions that he wished to ask me .
Parsing [sent. 17905 len. 45]: These were , chiefly , whether I had had much communication with my mother -LRB- to whom he only referred as Lady Dedlock -RRB- , when and where I had spoken with her last , and how she had become possessed of my handkerchief .
Parsing [sent. 17906 len. 51]: When I had satisfied him on these points , he asked me particularly to consider -- taking time to think -- whether within my knowledge there was any one , no matter where , in whom she might be at all likely to confide under circumstances of the last necessity .
Parsing [sent. 17907 len. 10]: I could think of no one but my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 17908 len. 9]: But by and by I mentioned Mr. Boythorn .
Parsing [sent. 17909 len. 41]: He came into my mind as connected with his old chivalrous manner of mentioning my mother 's name and with what my guardian had informed me of his engagement to her sister and his unconscious connexion with her unhappy story .
Parsing [sent. 17910 len. 21]: My companion had stopped the driver while we held this conversation , that we might the better hear each other .
Parsing [sent. 17911 len. 33]: He now told him to go on again and said to me , after considering within himself for a few moments , that he had made up his mind how to proceed .
Parsing [sent. 17912 len. 23]: He was quite willing to tell me what his plan was , but I did not feel clear enough to understand it .
Parsing [sent. 17913 len. 24]: We had not driven very far from our lodgings when we stopped in a by-street at a public-looking place lighted up with gas .
Parsing [sent. 17914 len. 16]: Mr. Bucket took me in and sat me in an armchair by a bright fire .
Parsing [sent. 17915 len. 16]: It was now past one , as I saw by the clock against the wall .
Parsing [sent. 17916 len. 55]: Two police officers , looking in their perfectly neat uniform not at all like people who were up all night , were quietly writing at a desk ; and the place seemed very quiet altogether , except for some beating and calling out at distant doors underground , to which nobody paid any attention .
Parsing [sent. 17917 len. 38]: A third man in uniform , whom Mr. Bucket called and to whom he whispered his instructions , went out ; and then the two others advised together while one wrote from Mr. Bucket 's subdued dictation .
Parsing [sent. 17918 len. 31]: It was a description of my mother that they were busy with , for Mr. Bucket brought it to me when it was done and read it in a whisper .
Parsing [sent. 17919 len. 6]: It was very accurate indeed .
Parsing [sent. 17920 len. 42]: The second officer , who had attended to it closely , then copied it out and called in another man in uniform -LRB- there were several in an outer room -RRB- , who took it up and went away with it .
Parsing [sent. 17921 len. 23]: All this was done with the greatest dispatch and without the waste of a moment ; yet nobody was at all hurried .
Parsing [sent. 17922 len. 27]: As soon as the paper was sent out upon its travels , the two officers resumed their former quiet work of writing with neatness and care .
Parsing [sent. 17923 len. 23]: Mr. Bucket thoughtfully came and warmed the soles of his boots , first one and then the other , at the fire .
Parsing [sent. 17924 len. 11]: `` Are you well wrapped up , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17925 len. 9]: he asked me as his eyes met mine .
Parsing [sent. 17926 len. 17]: `` It 's a desperate sharp night for a young lady to be out in . ''
Parsing [sent. 17927 len. 13]: I told him I cared for no weather and was warmly clothed .
Parsing [sent. 17928 len. 26]: `` It may be a long job , '' he observed ; `` but so that it ends well , never mind , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 17929 len. 11]: `` I pray to heaven it may end well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17930 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 17931 len. 4]: He nodded comfortingly .
Parsing [sent. 17932 len. 16]: `` You see , whatever you do , do n't you go and fret yourself .
Parsing [sent. 17933 len. 43]: You keep yourself cool and equal for anything that may happen , and it 'll be the better for you , the better for me , the better for Lady Dedlock , and the better for Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet . ''
Parsing [sent. 17934 len. 37]: He was really very kind and gentle , and as he stood before the fire warming his boots and rubbing his face with his forefinger , I felt a confidence in his sagacity which reassured me .
Parsing [sent. 17935 len. 18]: It was not yet a quarter to two when I heard horses ' feet and wheels outside .
Parsing [sent. 17936 len. 20]: `` Now , Miss Summerson , '' said he , `` we are off , if you please ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17937 len. 32]: He gave me his arm , and the two officers courteously bowed me out , and we found at the door a phaeton or barouche with a postilion and post horses .
Parsing [sent. 17938 len. 14]: Mr. Bucket handed me in and took his own seat on the box .
Parsing [sent. 17939 len. 39]: The man in uniform whom he had sent to fetch this equipage then handed him up a dark lantern at his request , and when he had given a few directions to the driver , we rattled away .
Parsing [sent. 17940 len. 13]: I was far from sure that I was not in a dream .
Parsing [sent. 17941 len. 65]: We rattled with great rapidity through such a labyrinth of streets that I soon lost all idea where we were , except that we had crossed and re-crossed the river , and still seemed to be traversing a low-lying , waterside , dense neighbourhood of narrow thoroughfares chequered by docks and basins , high piles of warehouses , swing-bridges , and masts of ships .
Parsing [sent. 17942 len. 56]: At length we stopped at the corner of a little slimy turning , which the wind from the river , rushing up it , did not purify ; and I saw my companion , by the light of his lantern , in conference with several men who looked like a mixture of police and sailors .
Parsing [sent. 17943 len. 49]: Against the mouldering wall by which they stood , there was a bill , on which I could discern the words , `` Found Drowned '' ; and this and an inscription about drags possessed me with the awful suspicion shadowed forth in our visit to that place .
Parsing [sent. 17944 len. 39]: I had no need to remind myself that I was not there by the indulgence of any feeling of mine to increase the difficulties of the search , or to lessen its hopes , or enhance its delays .
Parsing [sent. 17945 len. 17]: I remained quiet , but what I suffered in that dreadful spot I never can forget .
Parsing [sent. 17946 len. 11]: And still it was like the horror of a dream .
Parsing [sent. 17947 len. 53]: A man yet dark and muddy , in long swollen sodden boots and a hat like them , was called out of a boat and whispered with Mr. Bucket , who went away with him down some slippery steps -- as if to look at something secret that he had to show .
Parsing [sent. 17948 len. 27]: They came back , wiping their hands upon their coats , after turning over something wet ; but thank God it was not what I feared !
Parsing [sent. 17949 len. 46]: After some further conference , Mr. Bucket -LRB- whom everybody seemed to know and defer to -RRB- went in with the others at a door and left me in the carriage , while the driver walked up and down by his horses to warm himself .
Parsing [sent. 17950 len. 34]: The tide was coming in , as I judged from the sound it made , and I could hear it break at the end of the alley with a little rush towards me .
Parsing [sent. 17951 len. 53]: It never did so -- and I thought it did so , hundreds of times , in what can have been at the most a quarter of an hour , and probably was less -- but the thought shuddered through me that it would cast my mother at the horses ' feet .
Parsing [sent. 17952 len. 24]: Mr. Bucket came out again , exhorting the others to be vigilant , darkened his lantern , and once more took his seat .
Parsing [sent. 17953 len. 26]: `` Do n't you be alarmed , Miss Summerson , on account of our coming down here , '' he said , turning to me .
Parsing [sent. 17954 len. 23]: `` I only want to have everything in train and to know that it is in train by looking after it myself .
Parsing [sent. 17955 len. 7]: Get on , my lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17956 len. 10]: We appeared to retrace the way we had come .
Parsing [sent. 17957 len. 27]: Not that I had taken note of any particular objects in my perturbed state of mind , but judging from the general character of the streets .
Parsing [sent. 17958 len. 16]: We called at another office or station for a minute and crossed the river again .
Parsing [sent. 17959 len. 52]: During the whole of this time , and during the whole search , my companion , wrapped up on the box , never relaxed in his vigilance a single moment ; but when we crossed the bridge he seemed , if possible , to be more on the alert than before .
Parsing [sent. 17960 len. 45]: He stood up to look over the parapet , he alighted and went back after a shadowy female figure that flitted past us , and he gazed into the profound black pit of water with a face that made my heart die within me .
Parsing [sent. 17961 len. 43]: The river had a fearful look , so overcast and secret , creeping away so fast between the low flat lines of shore -- so heavy with indistinct and awful shapes , both of substance and shadow ; so death-like and mysterious .
Parsing [sent. 17962 len. 25]: I have seen it many times since then , by sunlight and by moonlight , but never free from the impressions of that journey .
Parsing [sent. 17963 len. 56]: In my memory the lights upon the bridge are always burning dim , the cutting wind is eddying round the homeless woman whom we pass , the monotonous wheels are whirling on , and the light of the carriage-lamps reflected back looks palely in upon me -- a face rising out of the dreaded water .
Parsing [sent. 17964 len. 29]: Clattering and clattering through the empty streets , we came at length from the pavement on to dark smooth roads and began to leave the houses behind us .
Parsing [sent. 17965 len. 12]: After a while I recognized the familiar way to Saint Albans .
Parsing [sent. 17966 len. 16]: At Barnet fresh horses were ready for us , and we changed and went on .
Parsing [sent. 17967 len. 21]: It was very cold indeed , and the open country was white with snow , though none was falling then .
Parsing [sent. 17968 len. 19]: `` An old acquaintance of yours , this road , Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Bucket cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 17969 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 17970 len. 8]: `` Have you gathered any intelligence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17971 len. 25]: `` None that can be quite depended on as yet , '' he answered , `` but it 's early times as yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 17972 len. 43]: He had gone into every late or early public-house where there was a light -LRB- they were not a few at that time , the road being then much frequented by drovers -RRB- and had got down to talk to the turnpike-keepers .
Parsing [sent. 17973 len. 59]: I had heard him ordering drink , and chinking money , and making himself agreeable and merry everywhere ; but whenever he took his seat upon the box again , his face resumed its watchful steady look , and he always said to the driver in the same business tone , `` Get on , my lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17974 len. 41]: With all these stoppages , it was between five and six o'clock and we were yet a few miles short of Saint Albans when he came out of one of these houses and handed me in a cup of tea .
Parsing [sent. 17975 len. 13]: `` Drink it , Miss Summerson , it 'll do you good .
Parsing [sent. 17976 len. 14]: You 're beginning to get more yourself now , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 17977 len. 9]: I thanked him and said I hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 17978 len. 22]: `` You was what you may call stunned at first , '' he returned ; `` and Lord , no wonder !
Parsing [sent. 17979 len. 8]: Do n't speak loud , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 17980 len. 5]: It 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 17981 len. 6]: She 's on ahead . ''
Parsing [sent. 17982 len. 26]: I do n't know what joyful exclamation I made or was going to make , but he put up his finger and I stopped myself .
Parsing [sent. 17983 len. 13]: `` Passed through here on foot this evening about eight or nine .
Parsing [sent. 17984 len. 21]: I heard of her first at the archway toll , over at Highgate , but could n't make quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 17985 len. 9]: Traced her all along , on and off .
Parsing [sent. 17986 len. 22]: Picked her up at one place , and dropped her at another ; but she 's before us now , safe .
Parsing [sent. 17987 len. 10]: Take hold of this cup and saucer , ostler .
Parsing [sent. 17988 len. 31]: Now , if you was n't brought up to the butter trade , look out and see if you can catch half a crown in your t ` other hand .
Parsing [sent. 17989 len. 11]: One , two , three , and there you are !
Parsing [sent. 17990 len. 10]: Now , my lad , try a gallop ! ''
Parsing [sent. 17991 len. 38]: We were soon in Saint Albans and alighted a little before day , when I was just beginning to arrange and comprehend the occurrences of the night and really to believe that they were not a dream .
Parsing [sent. 17992 len. 27]: Leaving the carriage at the posting-house and ordering fresh horses to be ready , my companion gave me his arm , and we went towards home .
Parsing [sent. 17993 len. 43]: `` As this is your regular abode , Miss Summerson , you see , '' he observed , `` I should like to know whether you 've been asked for by any stranger answering the description , or whether Mr. Jarndyce has .
Parsing [sent. 17994 len. 13]: I do n't much expect it , but it might be . ''
Parsing [sent. 17995 len. 53]: As we ascended the hill , he looked about him with a sharp eye -- the day was now breaking -- and reminded me that I had come down it one night , as I had reason for remembering , with my little servant and poor Jo , whom he called Toughey .
Parsing [sent. 17996 len. 7]: I wondered how he knew that .
Parsing [sent. 17997 len. 21]: `` When you passed a man upon the road , just yonder , you know , '' said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 17998 len. 10]: Yes , I remembered that too , very well .
Parsing [sent. 17999 len. 10]: `` That was me , '' said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18000 len. 23]: Seeing my surprise , he went on , `` I drove down in a gig that afternoon to look after that boy .
Parsing [sent. 18001 len. 36]: You might have heard my wheels when you came out to look after him yourself , for I was aware of you and your little maid going up when I was walking the horse down .
Parsing [sent. 18002 len. 39]: Making an inquiry or two about him in the town , I soon heard what company he was in and was coming among the brick-fields to look for him when I observed you bringing him home here . ''
Parsing [sent. 18003 len. 8]: `` Had he committed any crime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18004 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 18005 len. 27]: `` None was charged against him , '' said Mr. Bucket , coolly lifting off his hat , `` but I suppose he was n't over-particular .
Parsing [sent. 18006 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 18007 len. 18]: What I wanted him for was in connexion with keeping this very matter of Lady Dedlock quiet .
Parsing [sent. 18008 len. 46]: He had been making his tongue more free than welcome as to a small accidental service he had been paid for by the deceased Mr. Tulkinghorn ; and it would n't do , at any sort of price , to have him playing those games .
Parsing [sent. 18009 len. 49]: So having warned him out of London , I made an afternoon of it to warn him to keep out of it now he WAS away , and go farther from it , and maintain a bright look-out that I did n't catch him coming back again . ''
Parsing [sent. 18010 len. 5]: `` Poor creature ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18011 len. 27]: said I. `` Poor enough , '' assented Mr. Bucket , `` and trouble enough , and well enough away from London , or anywhere else .
Parsing [sent. 18012 len. 22]: I was regularly turned on my back when I found him taken up by your establishment , I do assure you .
Parsing [sent. 18013 len. 5]: I asked him why .
Parsing [sent. 18014 len. 7]: `` Why , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18015 len. 4]: said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18016 len. 11]: `` Naturally there was no end to his tongue then .
Parsing [sent. 18017 len. 22]: He might as well have been born with a yard and a half of it , and a remnant over . ''
Parsing [sent. 18018 len. 39]: Although I remember this conversation now , my head was in confusion at the time , and my power of attention hardly did more than enable me to understand that he entered into these particulars to divert me .
Parsing [sent. 18019 len. 32]: With the same kind intention , manifestly , he often spoke to me of indifferent things , while his face was busy with the one object that we had in view .
Parsing [sent. 18020 len. 13]: He still pursued this subject as we turned in at the garden-gate .
Parsing [sent. 18021 len. 4]: `` Ah ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18022 len. 4]: said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18023 len. 13]: `` Here we are , and a nice retired place it is .
Parsing [sent. 18024 len. 24]: Puts a man in mind of the country house in the Woodpecker-tapping , that was known by the smoke which so gracefully curled .
Parsing [sent. 18025 len. 14]: They 're early with the kitchen fire , and that denotes good servants .
Parsing [sent. 18026 len. 34]: But what you 've always got to be careful of with servants is who comes to see 'em ; you never know what they 're up to if you do n't know that .
Parsing [sent. 18027 len. 7]: And another thing , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 18028 len. 31]: Whenever you find a young man behind the kitchen-door , you give that young man in charge on suspicion of being secreted in a dwelling-house with an unlawful purpose . ''
Parsing [sent. 18029 len. 28]: We were now in front of the house ; he looked attentively and closely at the gravel for footprints before he raised his eyes to the windows .
Parsing [sent. 18030 len. 25]: `` Do you generally put that elderly young gentleman in the same room when he 's on a visit here , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18031 len. 11]: he inquired , glancing at Mr. Skimpole 's usual chamber .
Parsing [sent. 18032 len. 7]: `` You know Mr. Skimpole ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18033 len. 11]: said I. `` What do you call him again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18034 len. 9]: returned Mr. Bucket , bending down his ear .
Parsing [sent. 18035 len. 6]: `` Skimpole , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 18036 len. 10]: I 've often wondered what his name might be .
Parsing [sent. 18037 len. 2]: Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 18038 len. 12]: Not John , I should say , nor yet Jacob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18039 len. 8]: `` Harold , '' I told him .
Parsing [sent. 18040 len. 3]: `` Harold .
Parsing [sent. 18041 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 18042 len. 19]: He 's a queer bird is Harold , '' said Mr. Bucket , eyeing me with great expression .
Parsing [sent. 18043 len. 21]: `` He is a singular character , '' said I. `` No idea of money , '' observed Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18044 len. 8]: `` He takes it , though ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18045 len. 13]: I involuntarily returned for answer that I perceived Mr. Bucket knew him .
Parsing [sent. 18046 len. 16]: `` Why , now I 'll tell you , Miss Summerson , '' he replied .
Parsing [sent. 18047 len. 26]: `` Your mind will be all the better for not running on one point too continually , and I 'll tell you for a change .
Parsing [sent. 18048 len. 12]: It was him as pointed out to me where Toughey was .
Parsing [sent. 18049 len. 57]: I made up my mind that night to come to the door and ask for Toughey , if that was all ; but willing to try a move or so first , if any such was on the board , I just pitched up a morsel of gravel at that window where I saw a shadow .
Parsing [sent. 18050 len. 25]: As soon as Harold opens it and I have had a look at him , thinks I , you 're the man for me .
Parsing [sent. 18051 len. 72]: So I smoothed him down a bit about not wanting to disturb the family after they was gone to bed and about its being a thing to be regretted that charitable young ladies should harbour vagrants ; and then , when I pretty well understood his ways , I said I should consider a fypunnote well bestowed if I could relieve the premises of Toughey without causing any noise or trouble .
Parsing [sent. 18052 len. 44]: Then says he , lifting up his eyebrows in the gayest way , ` It 's no use menfioning a fypunnote to me , my friend , because I 'm a mere child in such matters and have no idea of money . '
Parsing [sent. 18053 len. 39]: Of course I understood what his taking it so easy meant ; and being now quite sure he was the man for me , I wrapped the note round a little stone and threw it up to him .
Parsing [sent. 18054 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 18055 len. 28]: He laughs and beams , and looks as innocent as you like , and says , ` But I do n't know the value of these things .
Parsing [sent. 18056 len. 9]: What am I to DO with this ? '
Parsing [sent. 18057 len. 44]: ` Spend it , sir , ' says I. ` But I shall be taken in , ' he says , ` they wo n't give me the right change , I shall lose it , it 's no use to me . '
Parsing [sent. 18058 len. 14]: Lord , you never saw such a face as he carried it with !
Parsing [sent. 18059 len. 16]: Of course he told me where to find Toughey , and I found him . ''
Parsing [sent. 18060 len. 26]: I regarded this as very treacherous on the part of Mr. Skimpole towards my guardian and as passing the usual bounds of his childish innocence .
Parsing [sent. 18061 len. 7]: `` Bounds , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18062 len. 4]: returned Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18063 len. 3]: `` Bounds ?
Parsing [sent. 18064 len. 32]: Now , Miss Summerson , I 'll give you a piece of advice that your husband will find useful when you are happily married and have got a family about you .
Parsing [sent. 18065 len. 38]: Whenever a person says to you that they are as innocent as can be in all concerning money , look well after your own money , for they are dead certain to collar it if they can .
Parsing [sent. 18066 len. 45]: Whenever a person proclaims to you ` In worldly matters I 'm a child , ' you consider that that person is only a-crying off from being held accountable and that you have got that person 's number , and it 's Number One .
Parsing [sent. 18067 len. 35]: Now , I am not a poetical man myself , except in a vocal way when it goes round a company , but I 'm a practical one , and that 's my experience .
Parsing [sent. 18068 len. 5]: So 's this rule .
Parsing [sent. 18069 len. 13]: Fast and loose in one thing , fast and loose in everything .
Parsing [sent. 18070 len. 6]: I never knew it fail .
Parsing [sent. 18071 len. 5]: No more will you .
Parsing [sent. 18072 len. 4]: Nor no one .
Parsing [sent. 18073 len. 29]: With which caution to the unwary , my dear , I take the liberty of pulling this here bell , and so go back to our business . ''
Parsing [sent. 18074 len. 31]: I believe it had not been for a moment out of his mind , any more than it had been out of my mind , or out of his face .
Parsing [sent. 18075 len. 34]: The whole household were amazed to see me , without any notice , at that time in the morning , and so accompanied ; and their surprise was not diminished by my inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 18076 len. 9]: No one , however , had been there .
Parsing [sent. 18077 len. 11]: It could not be doubted that this was the truth .
Parsing [sent. 18078 len. 29]: `` Then , Miss Summerson , '' said my companion , `` we ca n't be too soon at the cottage where those brickmakers are to be found .
Parsing [sent. 18079 len. 19]: Most inquiries there I leave to you , if you 'll be so good as to make 'em .
Parsing [sent. 18080 len. 18]: The naturalest way is the best way , and the naturalest way is your own way . ''
Parsing [sent. 18081 len. 6]: We set off again immediately .
Parsing [sent. 18082 len. 82]: On arriving at the cottage , we found it shut up and apparently deserted , but one of the neighbours who knew me and who came out when I was trying to make some one hear informed me that the two women and their husbands now lived together in another house , made of loose rough bricks , which stood on the margin of the piece of ground where the kilns were and where the long rows of bricks were drying .
Parsing [sent. 18083 len. 30]: We lost no time in repairing to this place , which was within a few hundred yards ; and as the door stood ajar , I pushed it open .
Parsing [sent. 18084 len. 21]: There were only three of them sitting at breakfast , the child lying asleep on a bed in the corner .
Parsing [sent. 18085 len. 15]: It was Jenny , the mother of the dead child , who was absent .
Parsing [sent. 18086 len. 32]: The other woman rose on seeing me ; and the men , though they were , as usual , sulky and silent , each gave me a morose nod of recognition .
Parsing [sent. 18087 len. 25]: A look passed between them when Mr. Bucket followed me in , and I was surprised to see that the woman evidently knew him .
Parsing [sent. 18088 len. 9]: I had asked leave to enter of course .
Parsing [sent. 18089 len. 40]: Liz -LRB- the only name by which I knew her -RRB- rose to give me her own chair , but I sat down on a stool near the fire , and Mr. Bucket took a corner of the bedstead .
Parsing [sent. 18090 len. 26]: Now that I had to speak and was among people with whom I was not familiar , I became conscious of being hurried and giddy .
Parsing [sent. 18091 len. 16]: It was very difficult to begin , and I could not help bursting into tears .
Parsing [sent. 18092 len. 63]: `` Liz , '' said I , `` I have come a long way in the night and through the snow to inquire after a lady -- '' `` Who has been here , you know , '' Mr. Bucket struck in , addressing the whole group with a composed propitiatory face ; `` that 's the lady the young lady means .
Parsing [sent. 18093 len. 12]: The lady that was here last night , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 18094 len. 12]: `` And who told YOU as there was anybody here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18095 len. 24]: inquired Jenny 's husband , who had made a surly stop in his eating to listen and now measured him with his eye .
Parsing [sent. 18096 len. 31]: `` A person of the name of Michael Jackson , with a blue welveteen waistcoat with a double row of mother of pearl buttons , '' Mr. Bucket immediately answered .
Parsing [sent. 18097 len. 19]: `` He had as good mind his own business , whoever he is , '' growled the man .
Parsing [sent. 18098 len. 26]: `` He 's out of employment , I believe , '' said Mr. Bucket apologetically for Michael Jackson , `` and so gets talking . ''
Parsing [sent. 18099 len. 23]: The woman had not resumed her chair , but stood faltering with her hand upon its broken back , looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 18100 len. 14]: I thought she would have spoken to me privately if she had dared .
Parsing [sent. 18101 len. 60]: She was still in this attitude of uncertainty when her husband , who was eating with a lump of bread and fat in one hand and his clasp-knife in the other , struck the handle of his knife violently on the table and told her with an oath to mind HER own business at any rate and sit down .
Parsing [sent. 18102 len. 49]: `` I should like to have seen Jenny very much , '' said I , `` for I am sure she would have told me all she could about this lady , whom I am very anxious indeed -- you can not think how anxious -- to overtake .
Parsing [sent. 18103 len. 6]: Will Jenny be here soon ?
Parsing [sent. 18104 len. 5]: Where is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18105 len. 27]: The woman had a great desire to answer , but the man , with another oath , openly kicked at her foot with his heavy boot .
Parsing [sent. 18106 len. 27]: He left it to Jenny 's husband to say what he chose , and after a dogged silence the latter turned his shaggy head towards me .
Parsing [sent. 18107 len. 26]: `` I 'm not partial to gentlefolks coming into my place , as you 've heerd me say afore now , I think , miss .
Parsing [sent. 18108 len. 18]: I let their places be , and it 's curious they ca n't let my place be .
Parsing [sent. 18109 len. 18]: There 'd be a pretty shine made if I was to go a-wisitin THEM , I think .
Parsing [sent. 18110 len. 42]: Howsoever , I do n't so much complain of you as of some others , and I 'm agreeable to make you a civil answer , though I give notice that I 'm not a-going to be drawed like a badger .
Parsing [sent. 18111 len. 6]: Will Jenny be here soon ?
Parsing [sent. 18112 len. 5]: No she wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 18113 len. 4]: Where is she ?
Parsing [sent. 18114 len. 8]: She 's gone up to Lunnun . ''
Parsing [sent. 18115 len. 8]: `` Did she go last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18116 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 18117 len. 7]: `` Did she go last night ?
Parsing [sent. 18118 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 18119 len. 16]: She went last night , '' he answered with a sulky jerk of his head .
Parsing [sent. 18120 len. 10]: `` But was she here when the lady came ?
Parsing [sent. 18121 len. 9]: And what did the lady say to her ?
Parsing [sent. 18122 len. 7]: And where is the lady gone ?
Parsing [sent. 18123 len. 29]: I beg and pray you to be so kind as to tell me , '' said I , `` for I am in great distress to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 18124 len. 23]: `` If my master would let me speak , and not say a word of harm -- '' the woman timidly began .
Parsing [sent. 18125 len. 32]: `` Your master , '' said her husband , muttering an imprecation with slow emphasis , `` will break your neck if you meddle with wot do n't concern you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18126 len. 24]: After another silence , the husband of the absent woman , turning to me again , answered me with his usual grumbling unwillingness .
Parsing [sent. 18127 len. 9]: `` Wos Jenny here when the lady come ?
Parsing [sent. 18128 len. 10]: Yes , she wos here when the lady come .
Parsing [sent. 18129 len. 8]: Wot did the lady say to her ?
Parsing [sent. 18130 len. 13]: Well , I 'll tell you wot the lady said to her .
Parsing [sent. 18131 len. 26]: She said , ` You remember me as come one time to talk to you about the young lady as had been a-wisiting of you ?
Parsing [sent. 18132 len. 17]: You remember me as give you somethink handsome for a handkercher wot she had left ? '
Parsing [sent. 18133 len. 5]: Ah , she remembered .
Parsing [sent. 18134 len. 5]: So we all did .
Parsing [sent. 18135 len. 14]: Well , then , wos that young lady up at the house now ?
Parsing [sent. 18136 len. 11]: No , she war n't up at the house now .
Parsing [sent. 18137 len. 7]: Well , then , lookee here .
Parsing [sent. 18138 len. 32]: The lady was upon a journey all alone , strange as we might think it , and could she rest herself where you 're a setten for a hour or so .
Parsing [sent. 18139 len. 9]: Yes she could , and so she did .
Parsing [sent. 18140 len. 40]: Then she went -- it might be at twenty minutes past eleven , and it might be at twenty minutes past twelve ; we ai n't got no watches here to know the time by , nor yet clocks .
Parsing [sent. 18141 len. 5]: Where did she go ?
Parsing [sent. 18142 len. 9]: I do n't know where she go 'd .
Parsing [sent. 18143 len. 25]: She went one way , and Jenny went another ; one went right to Lunnun , and t ` other went right from it .
Parsing [sent. 18144 len. 6]: That 's all about it .
Parsing [sent. 18145 len. 4]: Ask this man .
Parsing [sent. 18146 len. 10]: He heerd it all , and see it all .
Parsing [sent. 18147 len. 4]: He knows . ''
Parsing [sent. 18148 len. 13]: The other man repeated , `` That 's all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18149 len. 7]: `` Was the lady crying ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18150 len. 3]: I inquired .
Parsing [sent. 18151 len. 11]: `` Devil a bit , '' returned the first man .
Parsing [sent. 18152 len. 25]: `` Her shoes was the worse , and her clothes was the worse , but she war n't -- not as I see . ''
Parsing [sent. 18153 len. 14]: The woman sat with her arms crossed and her eyes upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 18154 len. 36]: Her husband had turned his seat a little so as to face her and kept his hammer-like hand upon the table as if it were in readiness to execute his threat if she disobeyed him .
Parsing [sent. 18155 len. 24]: `` I hope you will not object to my asking your wife , '' said I , `` how the lady looked . ''
Parsing [sent. 18156 len. 6]: `` Come , then ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18157 len. 6]: he gruffly cried to her .
Parsing [sent. 18158 len. 7]: `` You hear what she says .
Parsing [sent. 18159 len. 8]: Cut it short and tell her . ''
Parsing [sent. 18160 len. 8]: `` Bad , '' replied the woman .
Parsing [sent. 18161 len. 5]: `` Pale and exhausted .
Parsing [sent. 18162 len. 4]: Very bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 18163 len. 7]: `` Did she speak much ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18164 len. 11]: `` Not much , but her voice was hoarse . ''
Parsing [sent. 18165 len. 13]: She answered , looking all the while at her husband for leave .
Parsing [sent. 18166 len. 6]: `` Was she faint ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18167 len. 11]: said I. `` Did she eat or drink here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18168 len. 5]: `` Go on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18169 len. 9]: said the husband in answer to her look .
Parsing [sent. 18170 len. 9]: `` Tell her and cut it short . ''
Parsing [sent. 18171 len. 18]: `` She had a little water , miss , and Jenny fetched her some bread and tea .
Parsing [sent. 18172 len. 7]: But she hardly touched it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18173 len. 22]: `` And when she went from here , '' I was proceeding , when Jenny 's husband impatiently took me up .
Parsing [sent. 18174 len. 19]: `` When she went from here , she went right away nor ` ard by the high road .
Parsing [sent. 18175 len. 17]: Ask on the road if you doubt me , and see if it war n't so .
Parsing [sent. 18176 len. 7]: Now , there 's the end .
Parsing [sent. 18177 len. 7]: That 's all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18178 len. 33]: I glanced at my companion , and finding that he had already risen and was ready to depart , thanked them for what they had told me , and took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 18179 len. 19]: The woman looked full at Mr. Bucket as he went out , and he looked full at her .
Parsing [sent. 18180 len. 17]: `` Now , Miss Summerson , '' he said to me as we walked quickly away .
Parsing [sent. 18181 len. 11]: `` They 've got her ladyship 's watch among 'em .
Parsing [sent. 18182 len. 7]: That 's a positive fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 18183 len. 6]: `` You saw it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18184 len. 3]: I exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 18185 len. 12]: `` Just as good as saw it , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 18186 len. 25]: `` Else why should he talk about his ` twenty minutes past ' and about his having no watch to tell the time by ?
Parsing [sent. 18187 len. 3]: Twenty minutes !
Parsing [sent. 18188 len. 12]: He do n't usually cut his time so fine as that .
Parsing [sent. 18189 len. 14]: If he comes to half-hours , it 's as much as HE does .
Parsing [sent. 18190 len. 17]: Now , you see , either her ladyship gave him that watch or he took it .
Parsing [sent. 18191 len. 7]: I think she gave it him .
Parsing [sent. 18192 len. 10]: Now , what should she give it him for ?
Parsing [sent. 18193 len. 9]: What should she give it him for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18194 len. 27]: He repeated this question to himself several times as we hurried on , appearing to balance between a variety of answers that arose in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 18195 len. 50]: `` If time could be spared , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` which is the only thing that ca n't be spared in this case , I might get it out of that woman ; but it 's too doubtful a chance to trust to under present circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 18196 len. 48]: They are up to keeping a close eye upon her , and any fool knows that a poor creetur like her , beaten and kicked and scarred and bruised from head to foot , will stand by the husband that ill uses her through thick and thin .
Parsing [sent. 18197 len. 6]: There 's something kept back .
Parsing [sent. 18198 len. 14]: It 's a pity but what we had seen the other woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 18199 len. 23]: I regretted it exceedingly , for she was very grateful , and I felt sure would have resisted no entreaty of mine .
Parsing [sent. 18200 len. 47]: `` It 's possible , Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Bucket , pondering on it , `` that her ladyship sent her up to London with some word for you , and it 's possible that her husband got the watch to let her go .
Parsing [sent. 18201 len. 20]: It do n't come out altogether so plain as to please me , but it 's on the cards .
Parsing [sent. 18202 len. 38]: Now , I do n't take kindly to laying out the money of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , on these roughs , and I do n't see my way to the usefulness of it at present .
Parsing [sent. 18203 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 18204 len. 22]: So far our road , Miss Summerson , is for ` ard -- straight ahead -- and keeping everything quiet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18205 len. 30]: We called at home once more that I might send a hasty note to my guardian , and then we hurried back to where we had left the carriage .
Parsing [sent. 18206 len. 25]: The horses were brought out as soon as we were seen coming , and we were on the road again in a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 18207 len. 14]: It had set in snowing at daybreak , and it now snowed hard .
Parsing [sent. 18208 len. 30]: The air was so thick with the darkness of the day and the density of the fall that we could see but a very little way in any direction .
Parsing [sent. 18209 len. 41]: Although it was extremely cold , the snow was but partially frozen , and it churned -- with a sound as if it were a beach of small shells -- under the hoofs of the horses into mire and water .
Parsing [sent. 18210 len. 23]: They sometimes slipped and floundered for a mile together , and we were obliged to come to a standstill to rest them .
Parsing [sent. 18211 len. 32]: One horse fell three times in this first stage , and trembled so and was so shaken that the driver had to dismount from his saddle and lead him at last .
Parsing [sent. 18212 len. 39]: I could eat nothing and could not sleep , and I grew so nervous under those delays and the slow pace at which we travelled that I had an unreasonable desire upon me to get out and walk .
Parsing [sent. 18213 len. 16]: Yielding to my companion 's better sense , however , I remained where I was .
Parsing [sent. 18214 len. 109]: All this time , kept fresh by a certain enjoyment of the work in which he was engaged , he was up and down at every house we came to , addressing people whom he had never beheld before as old acquaintances , running in to warm himself at every fire he saw , talking and drinking and shaking hands at every bar and tap , friendly with every waggoner , wheelwright , blacksmith , and toll-taker , yet never seeming to lose time , and always mounting to the box again with his watchful , steady face and his business-like `` Get on , my lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18215 len. 57]: When we were changing horses the next time , he came from the stable-yard , with the wet snow encrusted upon him and dropping off him -- plashing and crashing through it to his wet knees as he had been doing frequently since we left Saint Albans -- and spoke to me at the carriage side .
Parsing [sent. 18216 len. 6]: `` Keep up your spirits .
Parsing [sent. 18217 len. 13]: It 's certainly true that she came on here , Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 18218 len. 21]: There 's not a doubt of the dress by this time , and the dress has been seen here . ''
Parsing [sent. 18219 len. 6]: `` Still on foot ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18220 len. 7]: said I. `` Still on foot .
Parsing [sent. 18221 len. 34]: I think the gentleman you mentioned must be the point she 's aiming at , and yet I do n't like his living down in her own part of the country neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 18222 len. 26]: `` I know so little , '' said I. `` There may be some one else nearer here , of whom I never heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 18223 len. 5]: `` That 's true .
Parsing [sent. 18224 len. 27]: But whatever you do , do n't you fall a-crying , my dear ; and do n't you worry yourself no more than you can help .
Parsing [sent. 18225 len. 7]: Get on , my lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18226 len. 25]: The sleet fell all that day unceasingly , a thick mist came on early , and it never rose or lightened for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 18227 len. 7]: Such roads I had never seen .
Parsing [sent. 18228 len. 18]: I sometimes feared we had missed the way and got into the ploughed grounds or the marshes .
Parsing [sent. 18229 len. 46]: If I ever thought of the time I had been out , it presented itself as an indefinite period of great duration , and I seemed , in a strange way , never to have been free from the anxiety under which I then laboured .
Parsing [sent. 18230 len. 15]: As we advanced , I began to feel misgivings that my companion lost confidence .
Parsing [sent. 18231 len. 25]: He was the same as before with all the roadside people , but he looked graver when he sat by himself on the box .
Parsing [sent. 18232 len. 20]: I saw his finger uneasily going across and across his mouth during the whole of one long weary stage .
Parsing [sent. 18233 len. 32]: I overheard that he began to ask the drivers of coaches and other vehicles coming towards us what passengers they had seen in other coaches and vehicles that were in advance .
Parsing [sent. 18234 len. 7]: Their replies did not encourage him .
Parsing [sent. 18235 len. 40]: He always gave me a reassuring beck of his finger and lift of his eyelid as he got upon the box again , but he seemed perplexed now when he said , `` Get on , my lad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18236 len. 29]: At last , when we were changing , he told me that he had lost the track of the dress so long that he began to be surprised .
Parsing [sent. 18237 len. 48]: It was nothing , he said , to lose such a track for one while , and to take it up for another while , and so on ; but it had disappeared here in an unaccountable manner , and we had not come upon it since .
Parsing [sent. 18238 len. 38]: This corroborated the apprehensions I had formed , when he began to look at direction-posts , and to leave the carriage at cross roads for a quarter of an hour at a time while he explored them .
Parsing [sent. 18239 len. 29]: But I was not to be down-hearted , he told me , for it was as likely as not that the next stage might set us right again .
Parsing [sent. 18240 len. 18]: The next stage , however , ended as that one ended ; we had no new clue .
Parsing [sent. 18241 len. 64]: There was a spacious inn here , solitary , but a comfortable substantial building , and as we drove in under a large gateway before I knew it , where a landlady and her pretty daughters came to the carriage-door , entreating me to alight and refresh myself while the horses were making ready , I thought it would be uncharitable to refuse .
Parsing [sent. 18242 len. 13]: They took me upstairs to a warm room and left me there .
Parsing [sent. 18243 len. 16]: It was at the corner of the house , I remember , looking two ways .
Parsing [sent. 18244 len. 53]: On one side to a stable-yard open to a by-road , where the ostlers were unharnessing the splashed and tired horses from the muddy carriage , and beyond that to the by-road itself , across which the sign was heavily swinging ; on the other side to a wood of dark pine-trees .
Parsing [sent. 18245 len. 22]: Their branches were encumbered with snow , and it silently dropped off in wet heaps while I stood at the window .
Parsing [sent. 18246 len. 24]: Night was setting in , and its bleakness was enhanced by the contrast of the pictured fire glowing and gleaming in the window-pane .
Parsing [sent. 18247 len. 58]: As I looked among the stems of the trees and followed the discoloured marks in the snow where the thaw was sinking into it and undermining it , I thought of the motherly face brightly set off by daughters that had just now welcomed me and of MY mother lying down in such a wood to die .
Parsing [sent. 18248 len. 34]: I was frightened when I found them all about me , but I remembered that before I fainted I tried very hard not to do it ; and that was some little comfort .
Parsing [sent. 18249 len. 33]: They cushioned me up on a large sofa by the fire , and then the comely landlady told me that I must travel no further to-night , but must go to bed .
Parsing [sent. 18250 len. 30]: But this put me into such a tremble lest they should detain me there that she soon recalled her words and compromised for a rest of half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 18251 len. 7]: A good endearing creature she was .
Parsing [sent. 18252 len. 13]: She and her three fair girls , all so busy about me .
Parsing [sent. 18253 len. 46]: I was to take hot soup and broiled fowl , while Mr. Bucket dried himself and dined elsewhere ; but I could not do it when a snug round table was presently spread by the fireside , though I was very unwilling to disappoint them .
Parsing [sent. 18254 len. 25]: However , I could take some toast and some hot negus , and as I really enjoyed that refreshment , it made some recompense .
Parsing [sent. 18255 len. 45]: Punctual to the time , at the half-hour 's end the carriage came rumbling under the gateway , and they took me down , warmed , refreshed , comforted by kindness , and safe -LRB- I assured them -RRB- not to faint any more .
Parsing [sent. 18256 len. 51]: After I had got in and had taken a grateful leave of them all , the youngest daughter -- a blooming girl of nineteen , who was to be the first married , they had told me -- got upon the carriage step , reached in , and kissed me .
Parsing [sent. 18257 len. 22]: I have never seen her , from that hour , but I think of her to this hour as my friend .
Parsing [sent. 18258 len. 37]: The transparent windows with the fire and light , looking so bright and warm from the cold darkness out of doors , were soon gone , and again we were crushing and churning the loose snow .
Parsing [sent. 18259 len. 28]: We went on with toil enough , but the dismal roads were not much worse than they had been , and the stage was only nine miles .
Parsing [sent. 18260 len. 60]: My companion smoking on the box -- I had thought at the last inn of begging him to do so when I saw him standing at a great fire in a comfortable cloud of tobacco -- was as vigilant as ever and as quickly down and up again when we came to any human abode or any human creature .
Parsing [sent. 18261 len. 43]: He had lighted his little dark lantern , which seemed to be a favourite with him , for we had lamps to the carriage ; and every now and then he turned it upon me to see that I was doing well .
Parsing [sent. 18262 len. 22]: There was a folding-window to the carriage-head , but I never closed it , for it seemed like shutting out hope .
Parsing [sent. 18263 len. 18]: We came to the end of the stage , and still the lost trace was not recovered .
Parsing [sent. 18264 len. 31]: I looked at him anxiously when we stopped to change , but I knew by his yet graver face as he stood watching the ostlers that he had heard nothing .
Parsing [sent. 18265 len. 33]: Almost in an instant afterwards , as I leaned back in my seat , he looked in , with his lighted lantern in his hand , an excited and quite different man .
Parsing [sent. 18266 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18267 len. 5]: said I , starting .
Parsing [sent. 18268 len. 6]: `` Is she here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18269 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 18270 len. 8]: Do n't deceive yourself , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 18271 len. 4]: Nobody 's here .
Parsing [sent. 18272 len. 7]: But I 've got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18273 len. 19]: The crystallized snow was in his eyelashes , in his hair , lying in ridges on his dress .
Parsing [sent. 18274 len. 18]: He had to shake it from his face and get his breath before he spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 18275 len. 31]: `` Now , Miss Summerson , '' said he , beating his finger on the apron , `` do n't you be disappointed at what I 'm a-going to do .
Parsing [sent. 18276 len. 4]: You know me .
Parsing [sent. 18277 len. 11]: I 'm Inspector Bucket , and you can trust me .
Parsing [sent. 18278 len. 10]: We 've come a long way ; never mind .
Parsing [sent. 18279 len. 10]: Four horses out there for the next stage up !
Parsing [sent. 18280 len. 3]: Quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18281 len. 26]: There was a commotion in the yard , and a man came running out of the stables to know if he meant up or down .
Parsing [sent. 18282 len. 7]: `` Up , I tell you !
Parsing [sent. 18283 len. 2]: Up !
Parsing [sent. 18284 len. 5]: Ai n't it English ?
Parsing [sent. 18285 len. 3]: Up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18286 len. 4]: `` Up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18287 len. 5]: said I , astonished .
Parsing [sent. 18288 len. 4]: `` To London !
Parsing [sent. 18289 len. 6]: Are we going back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18290 len. 11]: `` Miss Summerson , '' he answered , `` back .
Parsing [sent. 18291 len. 6]: Straight back as a die .
Parsing [sent. 18292 len. 4]: You know me .
Parsing [sent. 18293 len. 5]: Do n't be afraid .
Parsing [sent. 18294 len. 15]: I 'll follow the other , by G -- '' `` The other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18295 len. 3]: I repeated .
Parsing [sent. 18296 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18297 len. 10]: `` You called her Jenny , did n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 18298 len. 5]: I 'll follow her .
Parsing [sent. 18299 len. 12]: Bring those two pair out here for a crown a man .
Parsing [sent. 18300 len. 8]: Wake up , some of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18301 len. 38]: `` You will not desert this lady we are in search of ; you will not abandon her on such a night and in such a state of mind as I know her to be in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18302 len. 12]: said I , in an agony , and grasping his hand .
Parsing [sent. 18303 len. 12]: `` You are right , my dear , I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 18304 len. 7]: But I 'll follow the other .
Parsing [sent. 18305 len. 7]: Look alive here with them horses .
Parsing [sent. 18306 len. 34]: Send a man for ` ard in the saddle to the next stage , and let him send another for ` ard again , and order four on , up , right through .
Parsing [sent. 18307 len. 10]: My darling , do n't you be afraid ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18308 len. 30]: These orders and the way in which he ran about the yard urging them caused a general excitement that was scarcely less bewildering to me than the sudden change .
Parsing [sent. 18309 len. 28]: But in the height of the confusion , a mounted man galloped away to order the relays , and our horses were put to with great speed .
Parsing [sent. 18310 len. 44]: `` My dear , '' said Mr. Bucket , jumping to his seat and looking in again , '' -- you 'll excuse me if I 'm too familiar -- do n't you fret and worry yourself no more than you can help .
Parsing [sent. 18311 len. 22]: I say nothing else at present ; but you know me , my dear ; now , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18312 len. 31]: I endeavoured to say that I knew he was far more capable than I of deciding what we ought to do , but was he sure that this was right ?
Parsing [sent. 18313 len. 30]: Could I not go forward by myself in search of -- I grasped his hand again in my distress and whispered it to him -- of my own mother .
Parsing [sent. 18314 len. 26]: `` My dear , '' he answered , `` I know , I know , and would I put you wrong , do you think ?
Parsing [sent. 18315 len. 3]: Inspector Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18316 len. 10]: Now you know me , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18317 len. 7]: What could I say but yes !
Parsing [sent. 18318 len. 33]: `` Then you keep up as good a heart as you can , and you rely upon me for standing by you , no less than by Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet .
Parsing [sent. 18319 len. 8]: Now , are you right there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18320 len. 7]: `` All right , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18321 len. 7]: `` Off she goes , then .
Parsing [sent. 18322 len. 8]: And get on , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18323 len. 31]: We were again upon the melancholy road by which we had come , tearing up the miry sleet and thawing snow as if they were torn up by a waterwheel .
Parsing [sent. 18324 len. 31]: Chapter LVIII -- A Wintry Day and Night Still impassive , as behoves its breeding , the Dedlock town house carries itself as usual towards the street of dismal grandeur .
Parsing [sent. 18325 len. 54]: There are powdered heads from time to time in the little windows of the hall , looking out at the untaxed powder falling all day from the sky ; and in the same conservatory there is peach blossom turning itself exotically to the great hall fire from the nipping weather out of doors .
Parsing [sent. 18326 len. 20]: It is given out that my Lady has gone down into Lincolnshire , but is expected to return presently .
Parsing [sent. 18327 len. 14]: Rumour , busy overmuch , however , will not go down into Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 18328 len. 9]: It persists in flitting and chattering about town .
Parsing [sent. 18329 len. 16]: It knows that that poor unfortunate man , Sir Leicester , has been sadly used .
Parsing [sent. 18330 len. 13]: It hears , my dear child , all sorts of shocking things .
Parsing [sent. 18331 len. 11]: It makes the world of five miles round quite merry .
Parsing [sent. 18332 len. 18]: Not to know that there is something wrong at the Dedlocks ' is to augur yourself unknown .
Parsing [sent. 18333 len. 35]: One of the peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats is already apprised of all the principal circumstances that will come out before the Lords on Sir Leicester 's application for a bill of divorce .
Parsing [sent. 18334 len. 36]: At Blaze and Sparkle 's the jewellers and at Sheen and Gloss 's the mercers , it is and will be for several hours the topic of the age , the feature of the century .
Parsing [sent. 18335 len. 41]: The patronesses of those establishments , albeit so loftily inscrutable , being as nicely weighed and measured there as any other article of the stock-in-trade , are perfectly understood in this new fashion by the rawest hand behind the counter .
Parsing [sent. 18336 len. 33]: `` Our people , Mr. Jones , '' said Blaze and Sparkle to the hand in question on engaging him , `` our people , sir , are sheep -- mere sheep .
Parsing [sent. 18337 len. 13]: Where two or three marked ones go , all the rest follow .
Parsing [sent. 18338 len. 19]: Keep those two or three in your eye , Mr. Jones , and you have the flock . ''
Parsing [sent. 18339 len. 36]: So , likewise , Sheen and Gloss to THEIR Jones , in reference to knowing where to have the fashionable people and how to bring what they -LRB- Sheen and Gloss -RRB- choose into fashion .
Parsing [sent. 18340 len. 48]: On similar unerring principles , Mr. Sladdery the librarian , and indeed the great farmer of gorgeous sheep , admits this very day , `` Why yes , sir , there certainly ARE reports concerning Lady Dedlock , very current indeed among my high connexion , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18341 len. 40]: You see , my high connexion must talk about something , sir ; and it 's only to get a subject into vogue with one or two ladies I could name to make it go down with the whole .
Parsing [sent. 18342 len. 52]: Just what I should have done with those ladies , sir , in the case of any novelty you had left to me to bring in , they have done of themselves in this case through knowing Lady Dedlock and being perhaps a little innocently jealous of her too , sir .
Parsing [sent. 18343 len. 18]: You 'll find , sir , that this topic will be very popular among my high connexion .
Parsing [sent. 18344 len. 15]: If it had been a speculation , sir , it would have brought money .
Parsing [sent. 18345 len. 43]: And when I say so , you may trust to my being right , sir , for I have made it my business to study my high connexion and to be able to wind it up like a clock , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 18346 len. 15]: Thus rumour thrives in the capital , and will not go down into Lincolnshire .
Parsing [sent. 18347 len. 45]: By half-past five , post meridian , Horse Guards ' time , it has even elicited a new remark from the Honourable Mr. Stables , which bids fair to outshine the old one , on which he has so long rested his colloquial reputation .
Parsing [sent. 18348 len. 30]: This sparkling sally is to the effect that although he always knew she was the best-groomed woman in the stud , he had no idea she was a bolter .
Parsing [sent. 18349 len. 7]: It is immensely received in turf-circles .
Parsing [sent. 18350 len. 28]: At feasts and festivals also , in firmaments she has often graced , and among constellations she outshone but yesterday , she is still the prevalent subject .
Parsing [sent. 18351 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 18352 len. 4]: Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 18353 len. 4]: When was it ?
Parsing [sent. 18354 len. 4]: Where was it ?
Parsing [sent. 18355 len. 4]: How was it ?
Parsing [sent. 18356 len. 38]: She is discussed by her dear friends with all the genteelest slang in vogue , with the last new word , the last new manner , the last new drawl , and the perfection of polite indifference .
Parsing [sent. 18357 len. 32]: A remarkable feature of the theme is that it is found to be so inspiring that several people come out upon it who never came out before -- positively say things !
Parsing [sent. 18358 len. 73]: William Buffy carries one of these smartnesses from the place where he dines down to the House , where the Whip for his party hands it about with his snuff-box to keep men together who want to be off , with such effect that the Speaker -LRB- who has had it privately insinuated into his own ear under the corner of his wig -RRB- cries , `` Order at the bar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18359 len. 7]: three times without making an impression .
Parsing [sent. 18360 len. 108]: And not the least amazing circumstance connected with her being vaguely the town talk is that people hovering on the confines of Mr. Sladdery 's high connexion , people who know nothing and ever did know nothing about her , think it essential to their reputation to pretend that she is their topic too , and to retail her at second-hand with the last new word and the last new manner , and the last new drawl , and the last new polite indifference , and all the rest of it , all at second-hand but considered equal to new in inferior systems and to fainter stars .
Parsing [sent. 18361 len. 31]: If there be any man of letters , art , or science among these little dealers , how noble in him to support the feeble sisters on such majestic crutches !
Parsing [sent. 18362 len. 10]: So goes the wintry day outside the Dedlock mansion .
Parsing [sent. 18363 len. 4]: How within it ?
Parsing [sent. 18364 len. 19]: Sir Leicester , lying in his bed , can speak a little , though with difficulty and indistinctness .
Parsing [sent. 18365 len. 31]: He is enjoined to silence and to rest , and they have given him some opiate to lull his pain , for his old enemy is very hard with him .
Parsing [sent. 18366 len. 17]: He is never asleep , though sometimes he seems to fall into a dull waking doze .
Parsing [sent. 18367 len. 38]: He caused his bedstead to be moved out nearer to the window when he heard it was such inclement weather , and his head to be so adjusted that he could see the driving snow and sleet .
Parsing [sent. 18368 len. 13]: He watches it as it falls , throughout the whole wintry day .
Parsing [sent. 18369 len. 20]: Upon the least noise in the house , which is kept hushed , his hand is at the pencil .
Parsing [sent. 18370 len. 29]: The old housekeeper , sitting by him , knows what he would write and whispers , `` No , he has not come back yet , Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 18371 len. 9]: It was late last night when he went .
Parsing [sent. 18372 len. 11]: He has been but a little time gone yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 18373 len. 52]: He withdraws his hand and falls to looking at the sleet and snow again until they seem , by being long looked at , to fall so thick and fast that he is obliged to close his eyes for a minute on the giddy whirl of white flakes and icy blots .
Parsing [sent. 18374 len. 13]: He began to look at them as soon as it was light .
Parsing [sent. 18375 len. 23]: The day is not yet far spent when he conceives it to be necessary that her rooms should be prepared for her .
Parsing [sent. 18376 len. 7]: It is very cold and wet .
Parsing [sent. 18377 len. 6]: Let there be good fires .
Parsing [sent. 18378 len. 8]: Let them know that she is expected .
Parsing [sent. 18379 len. 6]: Please see to it yourself .
Parsing [sent. 18380 len. 18]: He writes to this purpose on his slate , and Mrs. Rouncewell with a heavy heart obeys .
Parsing [sent. 18381 len. 50]: `` For I dread , George , '' the old lady says to her son , who waits below to keep her company when she has a little leisure , `` I dread , my dear , that my Lady will never more set foot within these walls . ''
Parsing [sent. 18382 len. 10]: `` That 's a bad presentiment , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 18383 len. 14]: `` Nor yet within the walls of Chesney Wold , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 18384 len. 5]: `` That 's worse .
Parsing [sent. 18385 len. 6]: But why , mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18386 len. 39]: `` When I saw my Lady yesterday , George , she looked to me -- and I may say at me too -- as if the step on the Ghost 's Walk had almost walked her down . ''
Parsing [sent. 18387 len. 5]: `` Come , come !
Parsing [sent. 18388 len. 10]: You alarm yourself with old-story fears , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 18389 len. 9]: `` No I do n't , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 18390 len. 5]: No I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 18391 len. 25]: It 's going on for sixty year that I have been in this family , and I never had any fears for it before .
Parsing [sent. 18392 len. 19]: But it 's breaking up , my dear ; the great old Dedlock family is breaking up . ''
Parsing [sent. 18393 len. 8]: `` I hope not , mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 18394 len. 47]: `` I am thankful I have lived long enough to be with Sir Leicester in this illness and trouble , for I know I am not too old nor too useless to be a welcomer sight to him than anybody else in my place would be .
Parsing [sent. 18395 len. 36]: But the step on the Ghost 's Walk will walk my Lady down , George ; it has been many a day behind her , and now it will pass her and go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 18396 len. 15]: `` Well , mother dear , I say again , I hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 18397 len. 24]: `` Ah , so do I , George , '' the old lady returns , shaking her head and parting her folded hands .
Parsing [sent. 18398 len. 21]: `` But if my fears come true , and he has to know it , who will tell him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18399 len. 7]: `` Are these her rooms ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18400 len. 15]: `` These are my Lady 's rooms , just as she left them . ''
Parsing [sent. 18401 len. 37]: `` Why , now , '' says the trooper , glancing round him and speaking in a lower voice , `` I begin to understand how you come to think as you do think , mother .
Parsing [sent. 18402 len. 44]: Rooms get an awful look about them when they are fitted up , like these , for one person you are used to see in them , and that person is away under any shadow , let alone being God knows where . ''
Parsing [sent. 18403 len. 6]: He is not far out .
Parsing [sent. 18404 len. 33]: As all partings foreshadow the great final one , so , empty rooms , bereft of a familiar presence , mournfully whisper what your room and what mine must one day be .
Parsing [sent. 18405 len. 61]: My Lady 's state has a hollow look , thus gloomy and abandoned ; and in the inner apartment , where Mr. Bucket last night made his secret perquisition , the traces of her dresses and her ornaments , even the mirrors accustomed to reflect them when they were a portion of herself , have a desolate and vacant air .
Parsing [sent. 18406 len. 77]: Dark and cold as the wintry day is , it is darker and colder in these deserted chambers than in many a hut that will barely exclude the weather ; and though the servants heap fires in the grates and set the couches and the chairs within the warm glass screens that let their ruddy light shoot through to the furthest corners , there is a heavy cloud upon the rooms which no light will dispel .
Parsing [sent. 18407 len. 19]: The old housekeeper and her son remain until the preparations are complete , and then she returns upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 18408 len. 35]: Volumnia has taken Mrs. Rouncewell 's place in the meantime , though pearl necklaces and rouge pots , however calculated to embellish Bath , are but indifferent comforts to the invalid under present circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 18409 len. 68]: Volumnia , not being supposed to know -LRB- and indeed not knowing -RRB- what is the matter , has found it a ticklish task to offer appropriate observations and consequently has supplied their place with distracting smoothings of the bed-linen , elaborate locomotion on tiptoe , vigilant peeping at her kinsman 's eyes , and one exasperating whisper to herself of , `` He is asleep . ''
Parsing [sent. 18410 len. 21]: In disproof of which superfluous remark Sir Leicester has indignantly written on the slate , `` I am not . ''
Parsing [sent. 18411 len. 27]: Yielding , therefore , the chair at the bedside to the quaint old housekeeper , Volumnia sits at a table a little removed , sympathetically sighing .
Parsing [sent. 18412 len. 17]: Sir Leicester watches the sleet and snow and listens for the returning steps that he expects .
Parsing [sent. 18413 len. 46]: In the ears of his old servant , looking as if she had stepped out of an old picture-frame to attend a summoned Dedlock to another world , the silence is fraught with echoes of her own words , `` who will tell him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18414 len. 26]: He has been under his valet 's hands this morning to be made presentable and is as well got up as the circumstances will allow .
Parsing [sent. 18415 len. 33]: He is propped with pillows , his grey hair is brushed in its usual manner , his linen is arranged to a nicety , and he is wrapped in a responsible dressing-gown .
Parsing [sent. 18416 len. 11]: His eye-glass and his watch are ready to his hand .
Parsing [sent. 18417 len. 32]: It is necessary -- less to his own dignity now perhaps than for her sake -- that he should be seen as little disturbed and as much himself as may be .
Parsing [sent. 18418 len. 16]: Women will talk , and Volumnia , though a Dedlock , is no exceptional case .
Parsing [sent. 18419 len. 17]: He keeps her here , there is little doubt , to prevent her talking somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 18420 len. 20]: He is very ill , but he makes his present stand against distress of mind and body most courageously .
Parsing [sent. 18421 len. 40]: The fair Volumnia , being one of those sprightly girls who can not long continue silent without imminent peril of seizure by the dragon Boredom , soon indicates the approach of that monster with a series of undisguisable yawns .
Parsing [sent. 18422 len. 74]: Finding it impossible to suppress those yawns by any other process than conversation , she compliments Mrs. Rouncewell on her son , declaring that he positively is one of the finest figures she ever saw and as soldierly a looking person , she should think , as what 's his name , her favourite Life Guardsman -- the man she dotes on , the dearest of creatures -- who was killed at Waterloo .
Parsing [sent. 18423 len. 27]: Sir Leicester hears this tribute with so much surprise and stares about him in such a confused way that Mrs. Rouncewell feels it necesary to explain .
Parsing [sent. 18424 len. 18]: `` Miss Dedlock do n't speak of my eldest son , Sir Leicester , but my youngest .
Parsing [sent. 18425 len. 5]: I have found him .
Parsing [sent. 18426 len. 6]: He has come home . ''
Parsing [sent. 18427 len. 9]: Sir Leicester breaks silence with a harsh cry .
Parsing [sent. 18428 len. 3]: `` George ?
Parsing [sent. 18429 len. 10]: Your son George come home , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18430 len. 7]: The old housekeeper wipes her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18431 len. 4]: `` Thank God .
Parsing [sent. 18432 len. 6]: Yes , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 18433 len. 28]: Does this discovery of some one lost , this return of some one so long gone , come upon him as a strong confirmation of his hopes ?
Parsing [sent. 18434 len. 36]: Does he think , `` Shall I not , with the aid I have , recall her safely after this , there being fewer hours in her case than there are years in his ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18435 len. 19]: It is of no use entreating him ; he is determined to speak now , and he does .
Parsing [sent. 18436 len. 15]: In a thick crowd of sounds , but still intelligibly enough to be understood .
Parsing [sent. 18437 len. 12]: `` Why did you not tell me , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18438 len. 25]: `` It happened only yesterday , Sir Leicester , and I doubted your being well enough to be talked to of such things . ''
Parsing [sent. 18439 len. 33]: Besides , the giddy Volumnia now remembers with her little scream that nobody was to have known of his being Mrs. Rouncewell 's son and that she was not to have told .
Parsing [sent. 18440 len. 29]: But Mrs. Rouncewell protests , with warmth enough to swell the stomacher , that of course she would have told Sir Leicester as soon as he got better .
Parsing [sent. 18441 len. 11]: `` Where is your son George , Mrs. Rouncewell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18442 len. 25]: asks Sir Leicester , Mrs. Rouncewell , not a little alarmed by his disregard of the doctor 's injunctions , replies , in London .
Parsing [sent. 18443 len. 6]: `` Where in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18444 len. 13]: Mrs. Rouncewell is constrained to admit that he is in the house .
Parsing [sent. 18445 len. 8]: `` Bring him here to my room .
Parsing [sent. 18446 len. 5]: Bring him directly . ''
Parsing [sent. 18447 len. 13]: The old lady can do nothing but go in search of him .
Parsing [sent. 18448 len. 20]: Sir Leicester , with such power of movement as he has , arranges himself a little to receive him .
Parsing [sent. 18449 len. 24]: When he has done so , he looks out again at the falling sleet and snow and listens again for the returning steps .
Parsing [sent. 18450 len. 31]: A quantity of straw has been tumbled down in the street to deaden the noises there , and she might be driven to the door perhaps without his hearing wheels .
Parsing [sent. 18451 len. 25]: He is lying thus , apparently forgetful of his newer and minor surprise , when the housekeeper returns , accompanied by her trooper son .
Parsing [sent. 18452 len. 30]: Mr. George approaches softly to the bedside , makes his bow , squares his chest , and stands , with his face flushed , very heartily ashamed of himself .
Parsing [sent. 18453 len. 12]: `` Good heaven , and it is really George Rouncewell ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18454 len. 4]: exclaims Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 18455 len. 9]: `` Do you remember me , George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18456 len. 60]: The trooper needs to look at him and to separate this sound from that sound before he knows what he has said , but doing this and being a little helped by his mother , he replies , `` I must have a very bad memory , indeed , Sir Leicester , if I failed to remember you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18457 len. 36]: `` When I look at you , George Rouncewell , '' Sir Leicester observes with difficulty , `` I see something of a boy at Chesney Wold -- I remember well -- very well . ''
Parsing [sent. 18458 len. 23]: He looks at the trooper until tears come into his eyes , and then he looks at the sleet and snow again .
Parsing [sent. 18459 len. 27]: `` I ask your pardon , Sir Leicester , '' says the trooper , `` but would you accept of my arms to raise you up ?
Parsing [sent. 18460 len. 18]: You would lie easier , Sir Leicester , if you would allow me to move you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18461 len. 16]: `` If you please , George Rouncewell ; if you will be so good . ''
Parsing [sent. 18462 len. 26]: The trooper takes him in his arms like a child , lightly raises him , and turns him with his face more towards the window .
Parsing [sent. 18463 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 18464 len. 18]: You have your mother 's gentleness , '' returns Sir Leicester , `` and your own strength .
Parsing [sent. 18465 len. 4]: Thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18466 len. 12]: He signs to him with his hand not to go away .
Parsing [sent. 18467 len. 13]: George quietly remains at the bedside , waiting to be spoken to .
Parsing [sent. 18468 len. 9]: `` Why did you wish for secrecy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18469 len. 10]: It takes Sir Leicester some time to ask this .
Parsing [sent. 18470 len. 55]: `` Truly I am not much to boast of , Sir Leicester , and I -- I should still , Sir Leicester , if you was not so indisposed -- which I hope you will not be long -- I should still hope for the favour of being allowed to remain unknown in general .
Parsing [sent. 18471 len. 24]: That involves explanations not very hard to be guessed at , not very well timed here , and not very creditable to myself .
Parsing [sent. 18472 len. 32]: However opinions may differ on a variety of subjects , I should think it would be universally agreed , Sir Leicester , that I am not much to boast of . ''
Parsing [sent. 18473 len. 19]: `` You have been a soldier , '' observes Sir Leicester , `` and a faithful one . ''
Parsing [sent. 18474 len. 6]: George makes his military how .
Parsing [sent. 18475 len. 28]: `` As far as that goes , Sir Leicester , I have done my duty under discipline , and it was the least I could do . ''
Parsing [sent. 18476 len. 27]: `` You find me , '' says Sir Leicester , whose eyes are much attracted towards him , `` far from well , George Rouncewell . ''
Parsing [sent. 18477 len. 18]: `` I am very sorry both to hear it and to see it , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 18478 len. 7]: `` I am sure you are .
Parsing [sent. 18479 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 18480 len. 16]: In addition to my older malady , I have had a sudden and bad attack .
Parsing [sent. 18481 len. 25]: Something that deadens , '' making an endeavour to pass one hand down one side , `` and confuses , '' touching his lips .
Parsing [sent. 18482 len. 14]: George , with a look of assent and sympathy , makes another bow .
Parsing [sent. 18483 len. 36]: The different times when they were both young men -LRB- the trooper much the younger of the two -RRB- and looked at one another down at Chesney Wold arise before them both and soften both .
Parsing [sent. 18484 len. 38]: Sir Leicester , evidently with a great determination to say , in his own manner , something that is on his mind before relapsing into silence , tries to raise himself among his pillows a little more .
Parsing [sent. 18485 len. 22]: George , observant of the action , takes him in his arms again and places him as he desires to be .
Parsing [sent. 18486 len. 6]: `` Thank you , George .
Parsing [sent. 18487 len. 7]: You are another self to me .
Parsing [sent. 18488 len. 13]: You have often carried my spare gun at Chesney Wold , George .
Parsing [sent. 18489 len. 14]: You are familiar to me in these strange circumstances , very familiar . ''
Parsing [sent. 18490 len. 32]: He has put Sir Leicester 's sounder arm over his shoulder in lifting him up , and Sir Leicester is slow in drawing it away again as he says these words .
Parsing [sent. 18491 len. 39]: `` I was about to add , '' he presently goes on , `` I was about to add , respecting this attack , that it was unfortunately simultaneous with a slight misunderstanding between my Lady and myself .
Parsing [sent. 18492 len. 48]: I do not mean that there was any difference between us -LRB- for there has been none -RRB- , but that there was a misunderstanding of certain circumstances important only to ourselves , which deprives me , for a little while , of my Lady 's society .
Parsing [sent. 18493 len. 16]: She has found it necessary to make a journey -- I trust will shortly return .
Parsing [sent. 18494 len. 8]: Volumnia , do I make myself intelligible ?
Parsing [sent. 18495 len. 16]: The words are not quite under my command in the manner of pronouncing them . ''
Parsing [sent. 18496 len. 25]: Volumnia understands him perfectly , and in truth be delivers himself with far greater plainness than could have been supposed possible a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 18497 len. 19]: The effort by which he does so is written in the anxious and labouring expression of his face .
Parsing [sent. 18498 len. 13]: Nothing but the strength of his purpose enables him to make it .
Parsing [sent. 18499 len. 136]: `` Therefore , Volumnia , I desire to say in your presence -- and in the presence of my old retainer and friend , Mrs. Rouncewell , whose truth and fidelity no one can question , and in the presence of her son George , who comes back like a familiar recollection of my youth in the home of my ancestors at Chesney Wold -- in case I should relapse , in case I should not recover , in case I should lose both my speech and the power of writing , though I hope for better things -- '' The old housekeeper weeping silently ; Volumnia in the greatest agitation , with the freshest bloom on her cheeks ; the trooper with his arms folded and his head a little bent , respectfully attentive .
Parsing [sent. 18500 len. 35]: `` Therefore I desire to say , and to call you all to witness -- beginning , Volumnia , with yourself , most solemnly -- that I am on unaltered terms with Lady Dedlock .
Parsing [sent. 18501 len. 11]: That I assert no cause whatever of complaint against her .
Parsing [sent. 18502 len. 18]: That I have ever had the strongest affection for her , and that I retain it undiminished .
Parsing [sent. 18503 len. 10]: Say this to herself , and to every one .
Parsing [sent. 18504 len. 19]: If you ever say less than this , you will be guilty of deliberate falsehood to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 18505 len. 13]: Volumnia tremblingly protests that she will observe his injunctions to the letter .
Parsing [sent. 18506 len. 43]: `` My Lady is too high in position , too handsome , too accomplished , too superior in most respects to the best of those by whom she is surrounded , not to have her enemies and traducers , I dare say .
Parsing [sent. 18507 len. 37]: Let it be known to them , as I make it known to you , that being of sound mind , memory , and understanding , I revoke no disposition I have made in her favour .
Parsing [sent. 18508 len. 10]: I abridge nothing I have ever bestowed upon her .
Parsing [sent. 18509 len. 41]: I am on unaltered terms with her , and I recall -- having the full power to do it if I were so disposed , as you see -- no act I have done for her advantage and happiness . ''
Parsing [sent. 18510 len. 33]: His formal array of words might have at any other time , as it has often had , something ludicrous in it , but at this time it is serious and affecting .
Parsing [sent. 18511 len. 37]: His noble earnestness , his fidelity , his gallant shielding of her , his generous conquest of his own wrong and his own pride for her sake , are simply honourable , manly , and true .
Parsing [sent. 18512 len. 28]: Nothing less worthy can be seen through the lustre of such qualities in the commonest mechanic , nothing less worthy can be seen in the best-born gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 18513 len. 20]: In such a light both aspire alike , both rise alike , both children of the dust shine equally .
Parsing [sent. 18514 len. 41]: Overpowered by his exertions , he lays his head back on his pillows and closes his eyes for not more than a minute , when he again resumes his watching of the weather and his attention to the muffled sounds .
Parsing [sent. 18515 len. 26]: In the rendering of those little services , and in the manner of their acceptance , the trooper has become installed as necessary to him .
Parsing [sent. 18516 len. 11]: Nothing has been said , but it is quite understood .
Parsing [sent. 18517 len. 23]: He falls a step or two backward to be out of sight and mounts guard a little behind his mother 's chair .
Parsing [sent. 18518 len. 8]: The day is now beginning to decline .
Parsing [sent. 18519 len. 31]: The mist and the sleet into which the snow has all resolved itself are darker , and the blaze begins to tell more vividly upon the room walls and furniture .
Parsing [sent. 18520 len. 49]: The gloom augments ; the bright gas springs up in the streets ; and the pertinacious oil lamps which yet hold their ground there , with their source of life half frozen and half thawed , twinkle gaspingly like fiery fish out of water -- as they are .
Parsing [sent. 18521 len. 49]: The world , which has been rumbling over the straw and pulling at the bell , `` to inquire , '' begins to go home , begins to dress , to dine , to discuss its dear friend with all the last new modes , as already mentioned .
Parsing [sent. 18522 len. 16]: Now does Sir Leicester become worse , restless , uneasy , and in great pain .
Parsing [sent. 18523 len. 32]: Volumnia , lighting a candle -LRB- with a predestined aptitude for doing something objectionable -RRB- , is bidden to put it out again , for it is not yet dark enough .
Parsing [sent. 18524 len. 16]: Yet it is very dark too , as dark as it will be all night .
Parsing [sent. 18525 len. 7]: By and by she tries again .
Parsing [sent. 18526 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 18527 len. 4]: Put it out .
Parsing [sent. 18528 len. 7]: It is not dark enough yet .
Parsing [sent. 18529 len. 25]: His old housekeeper is the first to understand that he is striving to uphold the fiction with himself that it is not growing late .
Parsing [sent. 18530 len. 53]: `` Dear Sir Leicester , my honoured master , '' she softly whispers , `` I must , for your own good , and my duty , take the freedom of begging and praying that you will not lie here in the lone darkness watching and waiting and dragging through the time .
Parsing [sent. 18531 len. 19]: Let me draw the curtains , and light the candles , and make things more comfortable about you .
Parsing [sent. 18532 len. 23]: The church-clocks will strike the hours just the same , Sir Leicester , and the night will pass away just the same .
Parsing [sent. 18533 len. 11]: My Lady will come back , just the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 18534 len. 22]: `` I know it , Mrs. Rouncewell , but I am weak -- and he has been so long gone . ''
Parsing [sent. 18535 len. 9]: `` Not so very long , Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 18536 len. 6]: Not twenty-four hours yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 18537 len. 8]: `` But that is a long time .
Parsing [sent. 18538 len. 9]: Oh , it is a long time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18539 len. 11]: He says it with a groan that wrings her heart .
Parsing [sent. 18540 len. 30]: She knows that this is not a period for bringing the rough light upon him ; she thinks his tears too sacred to be seen , even by her .
Parsing [sent. 18541 len. 34]: Therefore she sits in the darkness for a while without a word , then gently begins to move about , now stirring the fire , now standing at the dark window looking out .
Parsing [sent. 18542 len. 25]: Finally he tells her , with recovered self-command , `` As you say , Mrs. Rouncewell , it is no worse for being confessed .
Parsing [sent. 18543 len. 11]: It is getting late , and they are not come .
Parsing [sent. 18544 len. 5]: Light the room ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18545 len. 19]: When it is lighted and the weather shut out , it is only left to him to listen .
Parsing [sent. 18546 len. 38]: But they find that however dejected and ill he is , he brightens when a quiet pretence is made of looking at the fires in her rooms and being sure that everything is ready to receive her .
Parsing [sent. 18547 len. 18]: Poor pretence as it is , these allusions to her being expected keep up hope within him .
Parsing [sent. 18548 len. 10]: Midnight comes , and with it the same blank .
Parsing [sent. 18549 len. 41]: The carriages in the streets are few , and other late sounds in that neighbourhood there are none , unless a man so very nomadically drunk as to stray into the frigid zone goes brawling and bellowing along the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 18550 len. 21]: Upon this wintry night it is so still that listening to the intense silence is like looking at intense darkness .
Parsing [sent. 18551 len. 29]: If any distant sound be audible in this case , it departs through the gloom like a feeble light in that , and all is heavier than before .
Parsing [sent. 18552 len. 37]: The corporation of servants are dismissed to bed -LRB- not unwilling to go , for they were up all last night -RRB- , and only Mrs. Rouncewell and George keep watch in Sir Leicester 's room .
Parsing [sent. 18553 len. 44]: As the night lags tardily on -- or rather when it seems to stop altogether , at between two and three o'clock -- they find a restless craving on him to know more about the weather , now he can not see it .
Parsing [sent. 18554 len. 56]: Hence George , patrolling regularly every half-hour to the rooms so carefully looked after , extends his march to the hall-door , looks about him , and brings back the best report he can make of the worst of nights , the sleet still falling and even the stone footways lying ankle-deep in icy sludge .
Parsing [sent. 18555 len. 71]: Volumnia , in her room up a retired landing on the stair-case -- the second turning past the end of the carving and gilding , a cousinly room containing a fearful abortion of a portrait of Sir Leicester banished for its crimes , and commanding in the day a solemn yard planted with dried-up shrubs like antediluvian specimens of black tea -- is a prey to horrors of many kinds .
Parsing [sent. 18556 len. 37]: Not last nor least among them , possibly , is a horror of what may befall her little income in the event , as she expresses it , `` of anything happening '' to Sir Leicester .
Parsing [sent. 18557 len. 30]: Anything , in this sense , meaning one thing only ; and that the last thing that can happen to the consciousness of any baronet in the known world .
Parsing [sent. 18558 len. 79]: An effect of these horrors is that Volumnia finds she can not go to bed in her own room or sit by the fire in her own room , but must come forth with her fair head tied up in a profusion of shawl , and her fair form enrobed in drapery , and parade the mansion like a ghost , particularly haunting the rooms , warm and luxurious , prepared for one who still does not return .
Parsing [sent. 18559 len. 75]: Solitude under such circumstances being not to be thought of , Volumnia is attended by her maid , who , impressed from her own bed for that purpose , extremely cold , very sleepy , and generally an injured maid as condemned by circumstances to take office with a cousin , when she had resolved to be maid to nothing less than ten thousand a year , has not a sweet expression of countenance .
Parsing [sent. 18560 len. 44]: The periodical visits of the trooper to these rooms , however , in the course of his patrolling is an assurance of protection and company both to mistress and maid , which renders them very acceptable in the small hours of the night .
Parsing [sent. 18561 len. 74]: Whenever he is heard advancing , they both make some little decorative preparation to receive him ; at other times they divide their watches into short scraps of oblivion and dialogues not wholly free from acerbity , as to whether Miss Dedlock , sitting with her feet upon the fender , was or was not falling into the fire when rescued -LRB- to her great displeasure -RRB- by her guardian genius the maid .
Parsing [sent. 18562 len. 11]: `` How is Sir Leicester now , Mr. George ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18563 len. 10]: inquires Volumnia , adjusting her cowl over her head .
Parsing [sent. 18564 len. 12]: `` Why , Sir Leicester is much the same , miss .
Parsing [sent. 18565 len. 16]: He is very low and ill , and he even wanders a little sometimes . ''
Parsing [sent. 18566 len. 8]: `` Has he asked for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18567 len. 4]: inquires Volumnia tenderly .
Parsing [sent. 18568 len. 14]: `` Why , no , I ca n't say he has , miss .
Parsing [sent. 18569 len. 11]: Not within my hearing , that is to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 18570 len. 12]: `` This is a truly sad time , Mr. George . ''
Parsing [sent. 18571 len. 7]: `` It is indeed , miss .
Parsing [sent. 18572 len. 9]: Had n't you better go to bed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18573 len. 19]: `` You had a deal better go to bed , Miss Dedlock , '' quoth the maid sharply .
Parsing [sent. 18574 len. 5]: But Volumnia answers No !
Parsing [sent. 18575 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 18576 len. 16]: She may be asked for , she may be wanted at a moment 's notice .
Parsing [sent. 18577 len. 20]: She never should forgive herself `` if anything was to happen '' and she was not on the spot .
Parsing [sent. 18578 len. 47]: She declines to enter on the question , mooted by the maid , how the spot comes to be there , and not in her room -LRB- which is nearer to Sir Leicester 's -RRB- , but staunchly declares that on the spot she will remain .
Parsing [sent. 18579 len. 41]: Volumnia further makes a merit of not having `` closed an eye '' -- as if she had twenty or thirty -- though it is hard to reconcile this statement with her having most indisputably opened two within five minutes .
Parsing [sent. 18580 len. 84]: But when it comes to four o'clock , and still the same blank , Volumnia 's constancy begins to fail her , or rather it begins to strengthen , for she now considers that it is her duty to be ready for the morrow , when much may be expected of her , that , in fact , howsoever anxious to remain upon the spot , it may be required of her , as an act of self-devotion , to desert the spot .
Parsing [sent. 18581 len. 20]: So when the trooper reappears with his , `` Had n't you better go to bed , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18582 len. 25]: and when the maid protests , more sharply than before , `` You had a deal better go to bed , Miss Dedlock ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18583 len. 16]: she meekly rises and says , `` Do with me what you think best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18584 len. 38]: Mr. George undoubtedly thinks it best to escort her on his arm to the door of her cousinly chamber , and the maid as undoubtedly thinks it best to hustle her into bed with mighty little ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 18585 len. 22]: Accordingly , these steps are taken ; and now the trooper , in his rounds , has the house to himself .
Parsing [sent. 18586 len. 8]: There is no improvement in the weather .
Parsing [sent. 18587 len. 25]: From the portico , from the eaves , from the parapet , from every ledge and post and pillar , drips the thawed snow .
Parsing [sent. 18588 len. 41]: It has crept , as if for shelter , into the lintels of the great door -- under it , into the corners of the windows , into every chink and crevice of retreat , and there wastes and dies .
Parsing [sent. 18589 len. 40]: It is falling still ; upon the roof , upon the skylight , even through the skylight , and drip , drip , drip , with the regularity of the Ghost 's Walk , on the stone floor below .
Parsing [sent. 18590 len. 44]: The trooper , his old recollections awakened by the solitary grandeur of a great house -- no novelty to him once at Chesney Wold -- goes up the stairs and through the chief rooms , holding up his light at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 18591 len. 90]: Thinking of his varied fortunes within the last few weeks , and of his rustic boyhood , and of the two periods of his life so strangely brought together across the wide intermediate space ; thinking of the murdered man whose image is fresh in his mind ; thinking of the lady who has disappeared from these very rooms and the tokens of whose recent presence are all here ; thinking of the master of the house upstairs and of the foreboding , `` Who will tell him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18592 len. 39]: he looks here and looks there , and reflects how he MIGHT see something now , which it would tax his boldness to walk up to , lay his hand upon , and prove to be a fancy .
Parsing [sent. 18593 len. 29]: But it is all blank , blank as the darkness above and below , while he goes up the great staircase again , blank as the oppressive silence .
Parsing [sent. 18594 len. 11]: `` All is still in readiness , George Rouncewell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18595 len. 10]: `` Quite orderly and right , Sir Leicester . ''
Parsing [sent. 18596 len. 8]: `` No word of any kind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18597 len. 6]: The trooper shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 18598 len. 11]: `` No letter that can possibly have been overlooked ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18599 len. 21]: But he knows there is no such hope as that and lays his head down without looking for an answer .
Parsing [sent. 18600 len. 53]: Very familiar to him , as he said himself some hours ago , George Rouncewell lifts him into easier positions through the long remainder of the blank wintry night , and equally familiar with his unexpressed wish , extinguishes the light and undraws the curtains at the first late break of day .
Parsing [sent. 18601 len. 7]: The day comes like a phantom .
Parsing [sent. 18602 len. 36]: Cold , colourless , and vague , it sends a warning streak before it of a deathlike hue , as if it cried out , `` Look what I am bringing you who watch there !
Parsing [sent. 18603 len. 6]: Who will tell him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18604 len. 34]: Chapter LIX -- Esther 's Narrative It was three o'clock in the morning when the houses outside London did at last begin to exclude the country and to close us in with streets .
Parsing [sent. 18605 len. 41]: We had made our way along roads in a far worse condition than when we had traversed them by daylight , both the fall and the thaw having lasted ever since ; but the energy of my companion never slackened .
Parsing [sent. 18606 len. 27]: It had only been , as I thought , of less assistance than the horses in getting us on , and it had often aided them .
Parsing [sent. 18607 len. 66]: They had stopped exhausted halfway up hills , they had been driven through streams of turbulent water , they had slipped down and become entangled with the harness ; but he and his little lantern had been always ready , and when the mishap was set right , I had never heard any variation in his cool , `` Get on , my lads ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18608 len. 18]: The steadiness and confidence with which he had directed our journey back I could not account for .
Parsing [sent. 18609 len. 21]: Never wavering , he never even stopped to make an inquiry until we were within a few miles of London .
Parsing [sent. 18610 len. 33]: A very few words , here and there , were then enough for him ; and thus we came , at between three and four o'clock in the morning , into Islington .
Parsing [sent. 18611 len. 29]: I will not dwell on the suspense and anxiety with which I reflected all this time that we were leaving my mother farther and farther behind every minute .
Parsing [sent. 18612 len. 41]: I think I had some strong hope that he must be right and could not fail to have a satisfactory object in following this woman , but I tormented myself with questioning it and discussing it during the whole journey .
Parsing [sent. 18613 len. 43]: What was to ensue when we found her and what could compensate us for this loss of time were questions also that I could not possibly dismiss ; my mind was quite tortured by long dwelling on such reflections when we stopped .
Parsing [sent. 18614 len. 11]: We stopped in a high-street where there was a coach-stand .
Parsing [sent. 18615 len. 55]: My companion paid our two drivers , who were as completely covered with splashes as if they had been dragged along the roads like the carriage itself , and giving them some brief direction where to take it , lifted me out of it and into a hackney-coach he had chosen from the rest .
Parsing [sent. 18616 len. 7]: `` Why , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18617 len. 7]: he said as he did this .
Parsing [sent. 18618 len. 7]: `` How wet you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18619 len. 8]: I had not been conscious of it .
Parsing [sent. 18620 len. 42]: But the melted snow had found its way into the carriage , and I had got out two or three times when a fallen horse was plunging and had to be got up , and the wet had penetrated my dress .
Parsing [sent. 18621 len. 41]: I assured him it was no matter , but the driver , who knew him , would not be dissuaded by me from running down the street to his stable , whence he brought an armful of clean dry straw .
Parsing [sent. 18622 len. 19]: They shook it out and strewed it well about me , and I found it warm and comfortable .
Parsing [sent. 18623 len. 24]: `` Now , my dear , '' said Mr. Bucket , with his head in at the window after I was shut up .
Parsing [sent. 18624 len. 10]: `` We 're a-going to mark this person down .
Parsing [sent. 18625 len. 14]: It may take a little time , but you do n't mind that .
Parsing [sent. 18626 len. 11]: You 're pretty sure that I 've got a motive .
Parsing [sent. 18627 len. 5]: Ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18628 len. 31]: I little thought what it was , little thought in how short a time I should understand it better , but I assured him that I had confidence in him .
Parsing [sent. 18629 len. 13]: `` So you may have , my dear , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 18630 len. 7]: `` And I tell you what !
Parsing [sent. 18631 len. 27]: If you only repose half as much confidence in me as I repose in you after what I 've experienced of you , that 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 18632 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 18633 len. 7]: You 're no trouble at all .
Parsing [sent. 18634 len. 37]: I never see a young woman in any station of society -- and I 've seen many elevated ones too -- conduct herself like you have conducted yourself since you was called out of your bed .
Parsing [sent. 18635 len. 27]: You 're a pattern , you know , that 's what you are , '' said Mr. Bucket warmly ; `` you 're a pattern . ''
Parsing [sent. 18636 len. 31]: I told him I was very glad , as indeed I was , to have been no hindrance to him , and that I hoped I should be none now .
Parsing [sent. 18637 len. 41]: `` My dear , '' he returned , `` when a young lady is as mild as she 's game , and as game as she 's mild , that 's all I ask , and more than I expect .
Parsing [sent. 18638 len. 16]: She then becomes a queen , and that 's about what you are yourself . ''
Parsing [sent. 18639 len. 31]: With these encouraging words -- they really were encouraging to me under those lonely and anxious circumstances -- he got upon the box , and we once more drove away .
Parsing [sent. 18640 len. 27]: Where we drove I neither knew then nor have ever known since , but we appeared to seek out the narrowest and worst streets in London .
Parsing [sent. 18641 len. 30]: Whenever I saw him directing the driver , I was prepared for our descending into a deeper complication of such streets , and we never failed to do so .
Parsing [sent. 18642 len. 20]: Sometimes we emerged upon a wider thoroughfare or came to a larger building than the generality , well lighted .
Parsing [sent. 18643 len. 25]: Then we stopped at offices like those we had visited when we began our journey , and I saw him in consultation with others .
Parsing [sent. 18644 len. 23]: Sometimes he would get down by an archway or at a street corner and mysteriously show the light of his little lantern .
Parsing [sent. 18645 len. 23]: This would attract similar lights from various dark quarters , like so many insects , and a fresh consultation would be held .
Parsing [sent. 18646 len. 14]: By degrees we appeared to contract our search within narrower and easier limits .
Parsing [sent. 18647 len. 22]: Single police-officers on duty could now tell Mr. Bucket what he wanted to know and point to him where to go .
Parsing [sent. 18648 len. 33]: At last we stopped for a rather long conversation between him and one of these men , which I supposed to be satisfactory from his manner of nodding from time to time .
Parsing [sent. 18649 len. 15]: When it was finished he came to me looking very busy and very attentive .
Parsing [sent. 18650 len. 24]: `` Now , Miss Summerson , he said to me , `` you wo n't be alarmed whatever comes off , I know .
Parsing [sent. 18651 len. 38]: It 's not necessary for me to give you any further caution than to tell you that we have marked this person down and that you may be of use to me before I know it myself .
Parsing [sent. 18652 len. 22]: I do n't like to ask such a thing , my dear , but would you walk a little way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18653 len. 11]: Of course I got out directly and took his arm .
Parsing [sent. 18654 len. 22]: `` It ai n't so easy to keep your feet , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` but take time . ''
Parsing [sent. 18655 len. 21]: Although I looked about me confusedly and hurriedly as we crossed the street , I thought I knew the place .
Parsing [sent. 18656 len. 7]: `` Are we in Holborn ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18657 len. 4]: I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 18658 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18659 len. 8]: `` Do you know this turning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18660 len. 8]: `` It looks like Chancery Lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 18661 len. 14]: `` And was christened so , my dear , '' said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18662 len. 22]: We turned down it , and as we went shuffling through the sleet , I heard the clocks strike half-past five .
Parsing [sent. 18663 len. 41]: We passed on in silence and as quickly as we could with such a foothold , when some one coming towards us on the narrow pavement , wrapped in a cloak , stopped and stood aside to give me room .
Parsing [sent. 18664 len. 18]: In the same moment I heard an exclamation of wonder and my own name from Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 18665 len. 7]: I knew his voice very well .
Parsing [sent. 18666 len. 51]: It was so unexpected and so -- I do n't know what to call it , whether pleasant or painful -- to come upon it after my feverish wandering journey , and in the midst of the night , that I could not keep back the tears from my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18667 len. 11]: It was like hearing his voice in a strange country .
Parsing [sent. 18668 len. 21]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , that you should be out at this hour , and in such weather ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18669 len. 25]: He had heard from my guardian of my having been called away on some uncommon business and said so to dispense with any explanation .
Parsing [sent. 18670 len. 26]: I told him that we had but just left a coach and were going -- but then I was obliged to look at my companion .
Parsing [sent. 18671 len. 29]: `` Why , you see , Mr. Woodcourt '' -- he had caught the name from me -- `` we are a-going at present into the next street .
Parsing [sent. 18672 len. 4]: Inspector Bucket . ''
Parsing [sent. 18673 len. 20]: Mr. Woodcourt , disregarding my remonstrances , had hurriedly taken off his cloak and was putting it about me .
Parsing [sent. 18674 len. 23]: `` That 's a good move , too , '' said Mr. Bucket , assisting , `` a very good move . ''
Parsing [sent. 18675 len. 8]: `` May I go with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18676 len. 4]: said Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 18677 len. 12]: I do n't know whether to me or to my companion .
Parsing [sent. 18678 len. 6]: `` Why , Lord ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18679 len. 10]: exclaimed Mr. Bucket , taking the answer on himself .
Parsing [sent. 18680 len. 7]: `` Of course you may . ''
Parsing [sent. 18681 len. 20]: It was all said in a moment , and they took me between them , wrapped in the cloak .
Parsing [sent. 18682 len. 12]: `` I have just left Richard , '' said Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 18683 len. 14]: `` I have been sitting with him since ten o'clock last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 18684 len. 11]: `` Oh , dear me , he is ill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18685 len. 16]: `` No , no , believe me ; not ill , but not quite well .
Parsing [sent. 18686 len. 39]: He was depressed and faint -- you know he gets so worried and so worn sometimes -- and Ada sent to me of course ; and when I came home I found her note and came straight here .
Parsing [sent. 18687 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 18688 len. 49]: Richard revived so much after a little while , and Ada was so happy and so convinced of its being my doing , though God knows I had little enough to do with it , that I remained with him until he had been fast asleep some hours .
Parsing [sent. 18689 len. 12]: As fast asleep as she is now , I hope ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18690 len. 48]: His friendly and familiar way of speaking of them , his unaffected devotion to them , the grateful confidence with which I knew he had inspired my darling , and the comfort he was to her ; could I separate all this from his promise to me ?
Parsing [sent. 18691 len. 47]: How thankless I must have been if it had not recalled the words he said to me when he was so moved by the change in my appearance : `` I will accept him as a trust , and it shall be a sacred one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18692 len. 8]: We now turned into another narrow street .
Parsing [sent. 18693 len. 36]: `` Mr. Woodcourt , '' said Mr. Bucket , who had eyed him closely as we came along , `` our business takes us to a law-stationer 's here , a certain Mr. Snagsby 's .
Parsing [sent. 18694 len. 10]: What , you know him , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18695 len. 12]: He was so quick that he saw it in an instant .
Parsing [sent. 18696 len. 19]: `` Yes , I know a little of him and have called upon him at this place . ''
Parsing [sent. 18697 len. 6]: `` Indeed , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18698 len. 4]: said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18699 len. 31]: `` Then you will be so good as to let me leave Miss Summerson with you for a moment while I go and have half a word with him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18700 len. 14]: The last police-officer with whom he had conferred was standing silently behind us .
Parsing [sent. 18701 len. 19]: I was not aware of it until he struck in on my saying I heard some one crying .
Parsing [sent. 18702 len. 12]: `` Do n't be alarmed , miss , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 18703 len. 8]: `` It 's Snagsby 's servant . ''
Parsing [sent. 18704 len. 27]: `` Why , you see , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` the girl 's subject to fits , and has 'em bad upon her to-night .
Parsing [sent. 18705 len. 27]: A most contrary circumstance it is , for I want certain information out of that girl , and she must be brought to reason somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 18706 len. 27]: `` At all events , they would n't be up yet if it was n't for her , Mr. Bucket , '' said the other man .
Parsing [sent. 18707 len. 14]: `` She 's been at it pretty well all night , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 18708 len. 11]: `` Well , that 's true , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 18709 len. 7]: `` My light 's burnt out .
Parsing [sent. 18710 len. 6]: Show yours a moment . ''
Parsing [sent. 18711 len. 23]: All this passed in a whisper a door or two from the house in which I could faintly hear crying and moaning .
Parsing [sent. 18712 len. 21]: In the little round of light produced for the purpose , Mr. Bucket went up to the door and knocked .
Parsing [sent. 18713 len. 22]: The door was opened after he had knocked twice , and he went in , leaving us standing in the street .
Parsing [sent. 18714 len. 30]: `` Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Woodcourt , `` if without obtruding myself on your confidence I may remain near you , pray let me do so . ''
Parsing [sent. 18715 len. 10]: `` You are truly kind , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 18716 len. 25]: `` I need wish to keep no secret of my own from you ; if I keep any , it is another 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 18717 len. 5]: `` I quite understand .
Parsing [sent. 18718 len. 19]: Trust me , I will remain near you only so long as I can fully respect it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18719 len. 11]: `` I trust implicitly to you , '' I said .
Parsing [sent. 18720 len. 13]: `` I know and deeply feel how sacredly you keep your promise .
Parsing [sent. 18721 len. 26]: After a short time the little round of light shone out again , and Mr. Bucket advanced towards us in it with his earnest face .
Parsing [sent. 18722 len. 21]: `` Please to come in , Miss Summerson , '' he said , `` and sit down by the fire .
Parsing [sent. 18723 len. 16]: Mr. Woodcourt , from information I have received I understand you are a medical man .
Parsing [sent. 18724 len. 18]: Would you look to this girl and see if anything can be done to bring her round .
Parsing [sent. 18725 len. 10]: She has a letter somewhere that I particularly want .
Parsing [sent. 18726 len. 34]: It 's not in her box , and I think it must be about her ; but she is so twisted and clenched up that she is difficult to handle without hurting . ''
Parsing [sent. 18727 len. 26]: We all three went into the house together ; although it was cold and raw , it smelt close too from being up all night .
Parsing [sent. 18728 len. 29]: In the passage behind the door stood a scared , sorrowful-looking little man in a grey coat who seemed to have a naturally polite manner and spoke meekly .
Parsing [sent. 18729 len. 14]: `` Downstairs , if you please , Mr. Bucket , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 18730 len. 17]: `` The lady will excuse the front kitchen ; we use it as our workaday sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 18731 len. 24]: The back is Guster 's bedroom , and in it she 's a-carrying on , poor thing , to a frightful extent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18732 len. 19]: We went downstairs , followed by Mr. Snagsby , as I soon found the little man to be .
Parsing [sent. 18733 len. 26]: In the front kitchen , sitting by the fire , was Mrs. Snagsby , with very red eyes and a very severe expression of face .
Parsing [sent. 18734 len. 57]: `` My little woman , '' said Mr. Snagsby , entering behind us , `` to wave -- not to put too fine a point upon it , my dear -- hostilities for one single moment in the course of this prolonged night , here is Inspector Bucket , Mr. Woodcourt , and a lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 18735 len. 20]: She looked very much astonished , as she had reason for doing , and looked particularly hard at me .
Parsing [sent. 18736 len. 65]: `` My little woman , '' said Mr. Snagsby , sitting down in the remotest corner by the door , as if he were taking a liberty , `` it is not unlikely that you may inquire of me why Inspector Bucket , Mr. Woodcourt , and a lady call upon us in Cook 's Court , Cursitor Street , at the present hour .
Parsing [sent. 18737 len. 5]: I do n't know .
Parsing [sent. 18738 len. 7]: I have not the least idea .
Parsing [sent. 18739 len. 22]: If I was to be informed , I should despair of understanding , and I 'd rather not be told . ''
Parsing [sent. 18740 len. 36]: He appeared so miserable , sitting with his head upon his hand , and I appeared so unwelcome , that I was going to offer an apology when Mr. Bucket took the matter on himself .
Parsing [sent. 18741 len. 39]: `` Now , Mr. Snagsby , '' said he , `` the best thing you can do is to go along with Mr. Woodcourt to look after your Guster -- '' `` My Guster , Mr. Bucket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18742 len. 4]: cried Mr. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 18743 len. 9]: `` Go on , sir , go on .
Parsing [sent. 18744 len. 9]: I shall be charged with that next . ''
Parsing [sent. 18745 len. 31]: `` And to hold the candle , '' pursued Mr. Bucket without correcting himself , `` or hold her , or make yourself useful in any way you 're asked .
Parsing [sent. 18746 len. 39]: Which there 's not a man alive more ready to do , for you 're a man of urbanity and suavity , you know , and you 've got the sort of heart that can feel for another .
Parsing [sent. 18747 len. 36]: Mr. Woodcourt , would you be so good as see to her , and if you can get that letter from her , to let me have it as soon as ever you can ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18748 len. 39]: As they went out , Mr. Bucket made me sit down in a corner by the fire and take off my wet shoes , which he turned up to dry upon the fender , talking all the time .
Parsing [sent. 18749 len. 32]: `` Do n't you be at all put out , miss , by the want of a hospitable look from Mrs. Snagsby there , because she 's under a mistake altogether .
Parsing [sent. 18750 len. 34]: She 'll find that out sooner than will be agreeable to a lady of her generally correct manner of forming her thoughts , because I 'm a-going to explain it to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 18751 len. 28]: Here , standing on the hearth with his wet hat and shawls in his hand , himself a pile of wet , he turned to Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 18752 len. 90]: `` Now , the first thing that I say to you , as a married woman possessing what you may call charms , you know -- ` Believe Me , if All Those Endearing , ' and cetrer -- you 're well acquainted with the song , because it 's in vain for you to tell me that you and good society are strangers -- charms -- attractions , mind you , that ought to give you confidence in yourself -- is , that you 've done it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18753 len. 18]: Mrs. Snagsby looked rather alarmed , relented a little and faltered , what did Mr. Bucket mean .
Parsing [sent. 18754 len. 8]: `` What does Mr. Bucket mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18755 len. 52]: he repeated , and I saw by his face that all the time he talked he was listening for the discovery of the letter , to my own great agitation , for I knew then how important it must be ; `` I 'll tell you what he means , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 18756 len. 6]: Go and see Othello acted .
Parsing [sent. 18757 len. 8]: That 's the tragedy for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18758 len. 6]: Mrs. Snagsby consciously asked why .
Parsing [sent. 18759 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18760 len. 4]: said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18761 len. 14]: `` Because you 'll come to that if you do n't look out .
Parsing [sent. 18762 len. 25]: Why , at the very moment while I speak , I know what your mind 's not wholly free from respecting this young lady .
Parsing [sent. 18763 len. 11]: But shall I tell you who this young lady is ?
Parsing [sent. 18764 len. 55]: Now , come , you 're what I call an intellectual woman -- with your soul too large for your body , if you come to that , and chafing it -- and you know me , and you recollect where you saw me last , and what was talked of in that circle .
Parsing [sent. 18765 len. 4]: Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 18766 len. 2]: Yes !
Parsing [sent. 18767 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 18768 len. 9]: This young lady is that young lady . ''
Parsing [sent. 18769 len. 15]: Mrs. Snagsby appeared to understand the reference better than I did at the time .
Parsing [sent. 18770 len. 97]: `` And Toughey -- him as you call Jo -- was mixed up in the same business , and no other ; and the law-writer that you know of was mixed up in the same business , and no other ; and your husband , with no more knowledge of it than your great grandfather , was mixed up -LRB- by Mr. Tulkinghorn , deceased , his best customer -RRB- in the same business , and no other ; and the whole bileing of people was mixed up in the same business , and no other .
Parsing [sent. 18771 len. 30]: And yet a married woman , possessing your attractions , shuts her eyes -LRB- and sparklers too -RRB- , and goes and runs her delicate-formed head against a wall .
Parsing [sent. 18772 len. 8]: Why , I am ashamed of you !
Parsing [sent. 18773 len. 15]: -LRB- I expected Mr. Woodcourt might have got it by this time . -RRB- ''
Parsing [sent. 18774 len. 13]: Mrs. Snagsby shook her head and put her handkerchief to her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18775 len. 6]: `` Is that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18776 len. 5]: said Mr. Bucket excitedly .
Parsing [sent. 18777 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 18778 len. 4]: See what happens .
Parsing [sent. 18779 len. 50]: Another person mixed up in that business and no other , a person in a wretched state , comes here to-night and is seen a-speaking to your maid-servant ; and between her and your maid-servant there passes a paper that I would give a hundred pound for , down .
Parsing [sent. 18780 len. 5]: What do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 18781 len. 64]: You hide and you watch 'em , and you pounce upon that maid-servant -- knowing what she 's subject to and what a little thing will bring 'em on -- in that surprising manner and with that severity that , by the Lord , she goes off and keeps off , when a life may be hanging upon that girl 's words ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18782 len. 23]: He so thoroughly meant what he said now that I involuntarily clasped my hands and felt the room turning away from me .
Parsing [sent. 18783 len. 4]: But it stopped .
Parsing [sent. 18784 len. 17]: Mr. Woodcourt came in , put a paper into his hand , and went away again .
Parsing [sent. 18785 len. 40]: `` Now , Mrs , Snagsby , the only amends you can make , '' said Mr. Bucket , rapidly glancing at it , `` is to let me speak a word to this young lady in private here .
Parsing [sent. 18786 len. 44]: And if you know of any help that you can give to that gentleman in the next kitchen there or can think of any one thing that 's likelier than another to bring the girl round , do your swiftest and best ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18787 len. 14]: In an instant she was gone , and he had shut the door .
Parsing [sent. 18788 len. 15]: `` Now my dear , you 're steady and quite sure of yourself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18789 len. 13]: `` Quite , '' said I. `` Whose writing is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18790 len. 6]: It was my mother 's .
Parsing [sent. 18791 len. 16]: A pencil-writing , on a crushed and torn piece of paper , blotted with wet .
Parsing [sent. 18792 len. 15]: Folded roughly like a letter , and directed to me at my guardian 's .
Parsing [sent. 18793 len. 25]: `` You know the hand , '' he said , `` and if you are firm enough to read it to me , do !
Parsing [sent. 18794 len. 8]: But be particular to a word . ''
Parsing [sent. 18795 len. 11]: It had been written in portions , at different times .
Parsing [sent. 18796 len. 15]: I read what follows : `` I came to the cottage with two objects .
Parsing [sent. 18797 len. 35]: First , to see the dear one , if I could , once more -- but only to see her -- not to speak to her or let her know that I was near .
Parsing [sent. 18798 len. 12]: The other object , to elude pursuit and to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 18799 len. 9]: Do not blame the mother for her share .
Parsing [sent. 18800 len. 23]: The assistance that she rendered me , she rendered on my strongest assurance that it was for the dear one 's good .
Parsing [sent. 18801 len. 6]: You remember her dead child .
Parsing [sent. 18802 len. 17]: The men 's consent I bought , but her help was freely given . '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 18803 len. 4]: I came . '
Parsing [sent. 18804 len. 15]: That was written , '' said my companion , `` when she rested there .
Parsing [sent. 18805 len. 9]: It bears out what I made of it .
Parsing [sent. 18806 len. 5]: I was right . ''
Parsing [sent. 18807 len. 30]: The next was written at another time : `` I have wandered a long distance , and for many hours , and I know that I must soon die .
Parsing [sent. 18808 len. 3]: These streets !
Parsing [sent. 18809 len. 8]: I have no purpose but to die .
Parsing [sent. 18810 len. 21]: When I left , I had a worse , but I am saved from adding that guilt to the rest .
Parsing [sent. 18811 len. 28]: Cold , wet , and fatigue are sufficient causes for my being found dead , but I shall die of others , though I suffer from these .
Parsing [sent. 18812 len. 25]: It was right that all that had sustained me should give way at once and that I should die of terror and my conscience .
Parsing [sent. 18813 len. 9]: `` Take courage , '' said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 18814 len. 10]: `` There 's only a few words more . ''
Parsing [sent. 18815 len. 10]: Those , too , were written at another time .
Parsing [sent. 18816 len. 21]: To all appearance , almost in the dark : `` I have done all I could do to be lost .
Parsing [sent. 18817 len. 13]: I shall be soon forgotten so , and shall disgrace him least .
Parsing [sent. 18818 len. 12]: I have nothing about me by which I can be recognized .
Parsing [sent. 18819 len. 7]: This paper I part with now .
Parsing [sent. 18820 len. 22]: The place where I shall lie down , if I can get so far , has been often in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 18821 len. 2]: Farewell .
Parsing [sent. 18822 len. 3]: Forgive . ''
Parsing [sent. 18823 len. 16]: Mr. Bucket , supporting me with his arm , lowered me gently into my chair .
Parsing [sent. 18824 len. 4]: `` Cheer up !
Parsing [sent. 18825 len. 31]: Do n't think me hard with you , my dear , but as soon as ever you feel equal to it , get your shoes on and be ready . ''
Parsing [sent. 18826 len. 21]: I did as he required , but I was left there a long time , praying for my unhappy mother .
Parsing [sent. 18827 len. 22]: They were all occupied with the poor girl , and I heard Mr. Woodcourt directing them and speaking to her often .
Parsing [sent. 18828 len. 37]: At length he came in with Mr. Bucket and said that as it was important to address her gently , he thought it best that I should ask her for whatever information we desired to obtain .
Parsing [sent. 18829 len. 19]: There was no doubt that she could now reply to questions if she were soothed and not alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 18830 len. 34]: The questions , Mr. Bucket said , were how she came by the letter , what passed between her and the person who gave her the letter , and where the person went .
Parsing [sent. 18831 len. 21]: Holding my mind as steadily as I could to these points , I went into the next room with them .
Parsing [sent. 18832 len. 16]: Mr. Woodcourt would have remained outside , but at my solicitation went in with us .
Parsing [sent. 18833 len. 15]: The poor girl was sitting on the floor where they had laid her down .
Parsing [sent. 18834 len. 17]: They stood around her , though at a little distance , that she might have air .
Parsing [sent. 18835 len. 28]: She was not pretty and looked weak and poor , but she had a plaintive and a good face , though it was still a little wild .
Parsing [sent. 18836 len. 29]: I kneeled on the ground beside her and put her poor head upon my shoulder , whereupon she drew her arm round my neck and burst into tears .
Parsing [sent. 18837 len. 55]: `` My poor girl , '' said I , laying my face against her forehead , for indeed I was crying too , and trembling , `` it seems cruel to trouble you now , but more depends on our knowing something about this letter than I could tell you in an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 18838 len. 22]: She began piteously declaring that she did n't mean any harm , she did n't mean any harm , Mrs. Snagsby !
Parsing [sent. 18839 len. 22]: `` We are all sure of that , '' said I. `` But pray tell me how you got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18840 len. 14]: `` Yes , dear lady , I will , and tell you true .
Parsing [sent. 18841 len. 11]: I 'll tell true , indeed , Mrs. Snagsby . ''
Parsing [sent. 18842 len. 17]: `` I am sure of that , '' said I. `` And how was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18843 len. 44]: `` I had been out on an errand , dear lady -- long after it was dark -- quite late ; and when I came home , I found a common-looking person , all wet and muddy , looking up at our house .
Parsing [sent. 18844 len. 21]: When she saw me coming in at the door , she called me back and said did I live here .
Parsing [sent. 18845 len. 29]: And I said yes , and she said she knew only one or two places about here , but had lost her way and could n't find them .
Parsing [sent. 18846 len. 12]: Oh , what shall I do , what shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 18847 len. 6]: They wo n't believe me !
Parsing [sent. 18848 len. 25]: She did n't say any harm to me , and I did n't say any harm to her , indeed , Mrs. Snagsby ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18849 len. 33]: It was necessary for her mistress to comfort her -- which she did , I must say , with a good deal of contrition -- before she could be got beyond this .
Parsing [sent. 18850 len. 15]: `` She could not find those places , '' said I. `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18851 len. 8]: cried the girl , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 18852 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 18853 len. 5]: Could n't find them .
Parsing [sent. 18854 len. 39]: And she was so faint , and lame , and miserable , Oh so wretched , that if you had seen her , Mr. Snagsby , you 'd have given her half a crown , I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18855 len. 20]: `` Well , Guster , my girl , '' said he , at first not knowing what to say .
Parsing [sent. 18856 len. 7]: `` I hope I should . ''
Parsing [sent. 18857 len. 32]: `` And yet she was so well spoken , '' said the girl , looking at me with wide open eyes , `` that it made a person 's heart bleed .
Parsing [sent. 18858 len. 17]: And so she said to me , did I know the way to the burying ground ?
Parsing [sent. 18859 len. 8]: And I asked her which burying ground .
Parsing [sent. 18860 len. 9]: And she said , the poor burying ground .
Parsing [sent. 18861 len. 20]: And so I told her I had been a poor child myself , and it was according to parishes .
Parsing [sent. 18862 len. 31]: But she said she meant a poor burying ground not very far from here , where there was an archway , and a step , and an iron gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 18863 len. 32]: As I watched her face and soothed her to go on , I saw that Mr. Bucket received this with a look which I could not separate from one of alarm .
Parsing [sent. 18864 len. 8]: `` Oh , dear , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18865 len. 12]: cried the girl , pressing her hair back with her hands .
Parsing [sent. 18866 len. 11]: `` What shall I do , what shall I do !
Parsing [sent. 18867 len. 35]: She meant the burying ground where the man was buried that took the sleeping-stuff -- that you came home and told us of , Mr. Snagsby -- that frightened me so , Mrs. Snagsby .
Parsing [sent. 18868 len. 7]: Oh , I am frightened again .
Parsing [sent. 18869 len. 4]: Hold me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18870 len. 20]: `` You are so much better now , '' sald I. `` Pray , pray tell me more . ''
Parsing [sent. 18871 len. 9]: `` Yes I will , yes I will !
Parsing [sent. 18872 len. 22]: But do n't be angry with me , that 's a dear lady , because I have been so ill . ''
Parsing [sent. 18873 len. 7]: Angry with her , poor soul !
Parsing [sent. 18874 len. 3]: `` There !
Parsing [sent. 18875 len. 8]: Now I will , now I will .
Parsing [sent. 18876 len. 44]: So she said , could I tell her how to find it , and I said yes , and I told her ; and she looked at me with eyes like almost as if she was blind , and herself all waving back .
Parsing [sent. 18877 len. 59]: And so she took out the letter , and showed it me , and said if she was to put that in the post-office , it would be rubbed out and not minded and never sent ; and would I take it from her , and send it , and the messenger would be paid at the house .
Parsing [sent. 18878 len. 20]: And so I said yes , if it was no harm , and she said no -- no harm .
Parsing [sent. 18879 len. 30]: And so I took it from her , and she said she had nothing to give me , and I said I was poor myself and consequently wanted nothing .
Parsing [sent. 18880 len. 12]: And so she said God bless you , and went . ''
Parsing [sent. 18881 len. 19]: `` And did she go -- '' `` Yes , '' cried the girl , anticipating the inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 18882 len. 3]: `` Yes !
Parsing [sent. 18883 len. 9]: She went the way I had shown her .
Parsing [sent. 18884 len. 25]: Then I came in , and Mrs. Snagsby came behind me from somewhere and laid hold of me , and I was frightened . ''
Parsing [sent. 18885 len. 8]: Mr. Woodcourt took her kindly from me .
Parsing [sent. 18886 len. 14]: Mr. Bucket wrapped me up , and immediately we were in the street .
Parsing [sent. 18887 len. 16]: Mr. Woodcourt hesitated , but I said , `` Do n't leave me now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18888 len. 24]: and Mr. Bucket added , `` You 'll be better with us , we may want you ; do n't lose time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18889 len. 10]: I have the most confused impressions of that walk .
Parsing [sent. 18890 len. 39]: I recollect that it was neither night nor day , that morning was dawning but the street-lamps were not yet put out , that the sleet was still falling and that all the ways were deep with it .
Parsing [sent. 18891 len. 11]: I recollect a few chilled people passing in the streets .
Parsing [sent. 18892 len. 36]: I recollect the wet house-tops , the clogged and bursting gutters and water-spouts , the mounds of blackened ice and snow over which we passed , the narrowness of the courts by which we went .
Parsing [sent. 18893 len. 76]: At the same time I remember that the poor girl seemed to be yet telling her story audibly and plainly in my hearing , that I could feel her resting on my arm , that the stained house-fronts put on human shapes and looked at me , that great water-gates seemed to be opening and closing in my head or in the air , and that the unreal things were more substantial than the real .
Parsing [sent. 18894 len. 29]: At last we stood under a dark and miserable covered way , where one lamp was burning over an iron gate and where the morning faintly struggled in .
Parsing [sent. 18895 len. 5]: The gate was closed .
Parsing [sent. 18896 len. 58]: Beyond it was a burial ground -- a dreadful spot in which the night was very slowly stirring , but where I could dimly see heaps of dishonoured graves and stones , hemmed in by filthy houses with a few dull lights in their windows and on whose walls a thick humidity broke out like a disease .
Parsing [sent. 18897 len. 48]: On the step at the gate , drenched in the fearful wet of such a place , which oozed and splashed down everywhere , I saw , with a cry of pity and horror , a woman lying -- Jenny , the mother of the dead child .
Parsing [sent. 18898 len. 41]: I ran forward , but they stopped me , and Mr. Woodcourt entreated me with the greatest earnestness , even with tears , before I went up to the figure to listen for an instant to what Mr. Bucket said .
Parsing [sent. 18899 len. 8]: I did so , as I thought .
Parsing [sent. 18900 len. 9]: I did so , as I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 18901 len. 15]: `` Miss Summerson , you 'll understand me , if you think a moment .
Parsing [sent. 18902 len. 8]: They changed clothes at the cottage . ''
Parsing [sent. 18903 len. 7]: They changed clothes at the cottage .
Parsing [sent. 18904 len. 30]: I could repeat the words in my mind , and I knew what they meant of themselves , but I attached no meaning to them in any other connexion .
Parsing [sent. 18905 len. 16]: `` And one returned , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` and one went on .
Parsing [sent. 18906 len. 25]: And the one that went on only went on a certain way agreed upon to deceive and then turned across country and went home .
Parsing [sent. 18907 len. 5]: Think a moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18908 len. 20]: I could repeat this in my mind too , but I had not the least idea what it meant .
Parsing [sent. 18909 len. 17]: I saw before me , lying on the step , the mother of the dead child .
Parsing [sent. 18910 len. 20]: She lay there with one arm creeping round a bar of the iron gate and seeming to embrace it .
Parsing [sent. 18911 len. 13]: She lay there , who had so lately spoken to my mother .
Parsing [sent. 18912 len. 12]: She lay there , a distressed , unsheltered , senseless creature .
Parsing [sent. 18913 len. 82]: She who had brought my mother 's letter , who could give me the only clue to where my mother was ; she , who was to guide us to rescue and save her whom we had sought so far , who had come to this condition by some means connected with my mother that I could not follow , and might be passing beyond our reach and help at that moment ; she lay there , and they stopped me !
Parsing [sent. 18914 len. 17]: I saw but did not comprehend the solemn and compassionate look in Mr. Woodcourt 's face .
Parsing [sent. 18915 len. 18]: I saw but did not comprehend his touching the other on the breast to keep him back .
Parsing [sent. 18916 len. 16]: I saw him stand uncovered in the bitter air , with a reverence for something .
Parsing [sent. 18917 len. 9]: But my understanding for all this was gone .
Parsing [sent. 18918 len. 14]: I even heard it said between them , `` Shall she go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18919 len. 6]: `` She had better go .
Parsing [sent. 18920 len. 10]: Her hands should be the first to touch her .
Parsing [sent. 18921 len. 9]: They have a higher right than ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 18922 len. 10]: I passed on to the gate and stooped down .
Parsing [sent. 18923 len. 18]: I lifted the heavy head , put the long dank hair aside , and turned the face .
Parsing [sent. 18924 len. 10]: And it was my mother , cold and dead .
Parsing [sent. 18925 len. 13]: Chapter LX -- Perspective I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 18926 len. 19]: From the goodness of all about me I derived such consolation as I can never think of unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 18927 len. 24]: I have already said so much of myself , and so much still remains , that I will not dwell upon my sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 18928 len. 34]: I had an illness , but it was not a long one ; and I would avoid even this mention of it if I could quite keep down the recollection of their sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 18929 len. 9]: I proceed to other passages of my narrative .
Parsing [sent. 18930 len. 30]: During the time of my illness , we were still in London , where Mrs. Woodcourt had come , on my guardian 's invitation , to stay with us .
Parsing [sent. 18931 len. 42]: When my guardian thought me well and cheerful enough to talk with him in our old way -- though I could have done that sooner if he would have believed me -- I resumed my work and my chair beside his .
Parsing [sent. 18932 len. 12]: He had appointed the time himself , and we were alone .
Parsing [sent. 18933 len. 24]: `` Dame Trot , '' said he , receiving me with a kiss , `` welcome to the growlery again , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 18934 len. 10]: I have a scheme to develop , little woman .
Parsing [sent. 18935 len. 22]: I propose to remain here , perhaps for six months , perhaps for a longer time -- as it may be .
Parsing [sent. 18936 len. 12]: Quite to settle here for a while , in short . ''
Parsing [sent. 18937 len. 10]: `` And in the meanwhile leave Bleak House ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18938 len. 8]: said I. `` Aye , my dear ?
Parsing [sent. 18939 len. 17]: Bleak House , '' he returned , `` must learn to take care of itself . ''
Parsing [sent. 18940 len. 24]: I thought his tone sounded sorrowful , but looking at him , I saw his kind face lighted up by its pleasantest smile .
Parsing [sent. 18941 len. 28]: `` Bleak House , '' he repeated -- and his tone did NOT sound sorrowful , I found -- `` must learn to take care of itself .
Parsing [sent. 18942 len. 21]: It is a long way from Ada , my dear , and Ada stands much in need of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18943 len. 30]: `` It 's like you , guardian , '' said I , `` to have been taking that into consideration for a happy surprise to both of us . ''
Parsing [sent. 18944 len. 35]: `` Not so disinterested either , my dear , if you mean to extol me for that virtue , since if you were generally on the road , you could be seldom with me .
Parsing [sent. 18945 len. 26]: And besides , I wish to hear as much and as often of Ada as I can in this condition of estrangement from poor Rick .
Parsing [sent. 18946 len. 14]: Not of her alone , but of him too , poor fellow . ''
Parsing [sent. 18947 len. 13]: `` Have you seen Mr. Woodcourt , this morning , guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18948 len. 12]: `` I see Mr. Woodcourt every morning , Dame Durden . ''
Parsing [sent. 18949 len. 11]: `` Does he still say the same of Richard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18950 len. 5]: `` Just the same .
Parsing [sent. 18951 len. 22]: He knows of no direct bodily illness that he has ; on the contrary , he believes that he has none .
Parsing [sent. 18952 len. 13]: Yet he is not easy about him ; who CAN be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18953 len. 19]: My dear girl had been to see us lately every day , some times twice in a day .
Parsing [sent. 18954 len. 19]: But we had foreseen , all along , that this would only last until I was quite myself .
Parsing [sent. 18955 len. 67]: We knew full well that her fervent heart was as full of affection and gratitude towards her cousin John as it had ever been , and we acquitted Richard of laying any injunctions upon her to stay away ; but we knew on the other hand that she felt it a part of her duty to him to be sparing of her visits at our house .
Parsing [sent. 18956 len. 22]: My guardian 's delicacy had soon perceived this and had tried to convey to her that he thought she was right .
Parsing [sent. 18957 len. 21]: `` Dear , unfortunate , mistaken Richard , '' said I. `` When will he awake from his delusion ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18958 len. 20]: `` He is not in the way to do so now , my dear , '' replied my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 18959 len. 30]: `` The more he suffers , the more averse he will be to me , having made me the principal representative of the great occasion of his suffering . ''
Parsing [sent. 18960 len. 11]: I could not help adding , `` So unreasonably ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18961 len. 25]: `` Ah , Dame Trot , Dame Trot , '' returned my guardian , `` what shall we find reasonable in Jarndyce and Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 18962 len. 49]: Unreason and injustice at the top , unreason and injustice at the heart and at the bottom , unreason and injustice from beginning to end -- if it ever has an end -- how should poor Rick , always hovering near it , pluck reason out of it ?
Parsing [sent. 18963 len. 20]: He no more gathers grapes from thorns or figs from thistles than older men did in old times . ''
Parsing [sent. 18964 len. 25]: His gentleness and consideration for Richard whenever we spoke of him touched me so that I was always silent on this subject very soon .
Parsing [sent. 18965 len. 40]: `` I suppose the Lord Chancellor , and the Vice Chancellors , and the whole Chancery battery of great guns would be infinitely astonished by such unreason and injustice in one of their suitors , '' pursued my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 18966 len. 27]: `` When those learned gentlemen begin to raise moss-roses from the powder they sow in their wigs , I shall begin to be astonished too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 18967 len. 24]: He checked himself in glancing towards the window to look where the wind was and leaned on the back of my chair instead .
Parsing [sent. 18968 len. 8]: `` Well , well , little woman !
Parsing [sent. 18969 len. 7]: To go on , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 18970 len. 14]: This rock we must leave to time , chance , and hopeful circumstance .
Parsing [sent. 18971 len. 8]: We must not shipwreck Ada upon it .
Parsing [sent. 18972 len. 21]: She can not afford , and he can not afford , the remotest chance of another separation from a friend .
Parsing [sent. 18973 len. 27]: Therefore I have particularly begged of Woodcourt , and I now particularly beg of you , my dear , not to move this subject with Rick .
Parsing [sent. 18974 len. 4]: Let it rest .
Parsing [sent. 18975 len. 21]: Next week , next month , next year , sooner or later , he will see me with clearer eyes .
Parsing [sent. 18976 len. 5]: I can wait . ''
Parsing [sent. 18977 len. 22]: But I had already discussed it with him , I confessed ; and so , I thought , had Mr. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 18978 len. 11]: `` So he tells me , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 18979 len. 4]: `` Very good .
Parsing [sent. 18980 len. 24]: He has made his protest , and Dame Durden has made hers , and there is nothing more to be said about it .
Parsing [sent. 18981 len. 7]: Now I come to Mrs. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 18982 len. 10]: How do you like her , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18983 len. 30]: In answer to this question , which was oddly abrupt , I said I liked her very much and thought she was more agreeable than she used to be .
Parsing [sent. 18984 len. 11]: `` I think so too , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 18985 len. 4]: `` Less pedigree ?
Parsing [sent. 18986 len. 13]: Not so much of Morgan ap -- what 's his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18987 len. 26]: That was what I meant , I acknowledged , though he was a very harmless person , even when we had had more of him .
Parsing [sent. 18988 len. 21]: `` Still , upon the whole , he is as well in his native mountains , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 18989 len. 6]: `` I agree with you .
Parsing [sent. 18990 len. 19]: Then , little woman , can I do better for a time than retain Mrs. Woodcourt here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 18991 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 18992 len. 17]: And yet -- My guardian looked at me , waiting for what I had to say .
Parsing [sent. 18993 len. 6]: I had nothing to say .
Parsing [sent. 18994 len. 13]: At least I had nothing in my mind that I could say .
Parsing [sent. 18995 len. 30]: I had an undefined impression that it might have been better if we had had some other inmate , but I could hardly have explained why even to myself .
Parsing [sent. 18996 len. 12]: Or , if to myself , certainly not to anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 18997 len. 51]: `` You see , '' said my guardian , `` our neighbourhood is in Woodcourt 's way , and he can come here to see her as often as he likes , which is agreeable to them both ; and she is familiar to us and fond of you . ''
Parsing [sent. 18998 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 18999 len. 4]: That was undeniable .
Parsing [sent. 19000 len. 8]: I had nothing to say against it .
Parsing [sent. 19001 len. 19]: I could not have suggested a better arrangement , but I was not quite easy in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 19002 len. 7]: Esther , Esther , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 19003 len. 4]: Esther , think !
Parsing [sent. 19004 len. 20]: `` It is a very good plan indeed , dear guardian , and we could not do better . ''
Parsing [sent. 19005 len. 7]: `` Sure , little woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19006 len. 3]: Quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 19007 len. 25]: I had had a moment 's time to think , since I had urged that duty on myself , and I was quite sure .
Parsing [sent. 19008 len. 8]: `` Good , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19009 len. 6]: `` It shall be done .
Parsing [sent. 19010 len. 4]: Carried unanimously . ''
Parsing [sent. 19011 len. 14]: `` Carried unanimously , '' I repeated , going on with my work .
Parsing [sent. 19012 len. 14]: It was a cover for his book-table that I happened to be ornamenting .
Parsing [sent. 19013 len. 16]: It had been laid by on the night preceding my sad journey and never resumed .
Parsing [sent. 19014 len. 13]: I showed it to him now , and he admired it highly .
Parsing [sent. 19015 len. 33]: After I had explained the pattern to him and all the great effects that were to come out by and by , I thought I would go back to our last theme .
Parsing [sent. 19016 len. 31]: `` You said , dear guardian , when we spoke of Mr. Woodcourt before Ada left us , that you thought he would give a long trial to another country .
Parsing [sent. 19017 len. 8]: Have you been advising him since ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19018 len. 10]: `` Yes , little woman , pretty often . ''
Parsing [sent. 19019 len. 9]: `` Has he decided to do so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19020 len. 7]: `` I rather think not . ''
Parsing [sent. 19021 len. 12]: `` Some other prospect has opened to him , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19022 len. 23]: said I. `` Why -- yes -- perhaps , '' returned my guardian , beginning his answer in a very deliberate manner .
Parsing [sent. 19023 len. 27]: `` About half a year hence or so , there is a medical attendant for the poor to be appointed at a certain place in Yorkshire .
Parsing [sent. 19024 len. 32]: It is a thriving place , pleasantly situated -- streams and streets , town and country , mill and moor -- and seems to present an opening for such a man .
Parsing [sent. 19025 len. 58]: I mean a man whose hopes and aims may sometimes lie -LRB- as most men 's sometimes do , I dare say -RRB- above the ordinary level , but to whom the ordinary level will be high enough after all if it should prove to be a way of usefulness and good service leading to no other .
Parsing [sent. 19026 len. 38]: All generous spirits are ambitious , I suppose , but the ambition that calmly trusts itself to such a road , instead of spasmodically trying to fly over it , is of the kind I care for .
Parsing [sent. 19027 len. 7]: It is Woodcourt 's kind . ''
Parsing [sent. 19028 len. 9]: `` And will he get this appointment ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19029 len. 3]: I asked .
Parsing [sent. 19030 len. 30]: `` Why , little woman , '' returned my guardian , smiling , `` not being an oracle , I can not confidently say , but I think so .
Parsing [sent. 19031 len. 34]: His reputation stands very high ; there were people from that part of the country in the shipwreck ; and strange to say , I believe the best man has the best chance .
Parsing [sent. 19032 len. 11]: You must not suppose it to be a fine endowment .
Parsing [sent. 19033 len. 42]: It is a very , very commonplace affair , my dear , an appointment to a great amount of work and a small amount of pay ; but better things will gather about it , it may be fairly hoped . ''
Parsing [sent. 19034 len. 23]: `` The poor of that place will have reason to bless the choice if it falls on Mr. Woodcourt , guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 19035 len. 16]: `` You are right , little woman ; that I am sure they will . ''
Parsing [sent. 19036 len. 20]: We said no more about it , nor did he say a word about the future of Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 19037 len. 28]: But it was the first time I had taken my seat at his side in my mourning dress , and that accounted for it , I considered .
Parsing [sent. 19038 len. 19]: I now began to visit my dear girl every day in the dull dark corner where she lived .
Parsing [sent. 19039 len. 32]: The morning was my usual time , but whenever I found I had an hour or so to spare , I put on my bonnet and bustled off to Chancery Lane .
Parsing [sent. 19040 len. 50]: They were both so glad to see me at all hours , and used to brighten up so when they heard me opening the door and coming in -LRB- being quite at home , I never knocked -RRB- , that I had no fear of becoming troublesome just yet .
Parsing [sent. 19041 len. 9]: On these occasions I frequently found Richard absent .
Parsing [sent. 19042 len. 29]: At other times he would be writing or reading papers in the cause at that table of his , so covered with papers , which was never disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 19043 len. 16]: Sometimes I would come upon him lingering at the door of Mr. Vholes 's office .
Parsing [sent. 19044 len. 15]: Sometimes I would meet him in the neighbourhood lounging about and biting his nails .
Parsing [sent. 19045 len. 27]: I often met him wandering in Lincoln 's Inn , near the place where I had first seen him , oh how different , how different !
Parsing [sent. 19046 len. 29]: That the money Ada brought him was melting away with the candles I used to see burning after dark in Mr. Vholes 's office I knew very well .
Parsing [sent. 19047 len. 48]: It was not a large amount in the beginning , he had married in debt , and I could not fail to understand , by this time , what was meant by Mr. Vholes 's shoulder being at the wheel -- as I still heard it was .
Parsing [sent. 19048 len. 26]: My dear made the best of housekeepers and tried hard to save , but I knew that they were getting poorer and poorer every day .
Parsing [sent. 19049 len. 11]: She shone in the miserable corner like a beautiful star .
Parsing [sent. 19050 len. 12]: She adorned and graced it so that it became another place .
Parsing [sent. 19051 len. 48]: Paler than she had been at home , and a little quieter than I had thought natural when she was yet so cheerful and hopeful , her face was so unshadowed that I half believed she was blinded by her love for Richard to his ruinous career .
Parsing [sent. 19052 len. 15]: I went one day to dine with them while I was under this impression .
Parsing [sent. 19053 len. 16]: As I turned into Symond 's Inn , I met little Miss Flite coming out .
Parsing [sent. 19054 len. 30]: She had been to make a stately call upon the wards in Jarndyce , as she still called them , and had derived the highest gratification from that ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 19055 len. 44]: Ada had already told me that she called every Monday at five o'clock , with one little extra white bow in her bonnet , which never appeared there at any other time , and with her largest reticule of documents on her arm .
Parsing [sent. 19056 len. 5]: `` My dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19057 len. 3]: she began .
Parsing [sent. 19058 len. 4]: `` So delighted !
Parsing [sent. 19059 len. 5]: How do you do !
Parsing [sent. 19060 len. 6]: So glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 19061 len. 11]: And you are going to visit our interesting Jarndyce wards ?
Parsing [sent. 19062 len. 4]: TO be sure !
Parsing [sent. 19063 len. 18]: Our beauty is at home , my dear , and will be charmed to see you . ''
Parsing [sent. 19064 len. 10]: `` Then Richard is not come in yet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19065 len. 20]: said I. `` I am glad of that , for I was afraid of being a little late . ''
Parsing [sent. 19066 len. 14]: `` No , he is not come in , '' returned Miss Flite .
Parsing [sent. 19067 len. 10]: `` He has had a long day in court .
Parsing [sent. 19068 len. 7]: I left him there with Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 19069 len. 9]: You do n't like Vholes , I hope ?
Parsing [sent. 19070 len. 5]: DO N'T like Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 19071 len. 4]: Dan-gerous man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19072 len. 29]: `` I am afraid you see Richard oftener than ever now , '' said I. `` My dearest , '' returned Miss Flite , `` daily and hourly .
Parsing [sent. 19073 len. 15]: You know what I told you of the attraction on the Chancellor 's table ?
Parsing [sent. 19074 len. 15]: My dear , next to myself he is the most constant suitor in court .
Parsing [sent. 19075 len. 9]: He begins quite to amuse our little party .
Parsing [sent. 19076 len. 10]: Ve-ry friendly little party , are we not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19077 len. 18]: It was miserable to hear this from her poor mad lips , though it was no surprise .
Parsing [sent. 19078 len. 36]: `` In short , my valued friend , '' pursued Miss Flite , advancing her lips to my ear with an air of equal patronage and mystery , `` I must tell you a secret .
Parsing [sent. 19079 len. 7]: I have made him my executor .
Parsing [sent. 19080 len. 8]: Nominated , constituted , and appointed him .
Parsing [sent. 19081 len. 4]: In my will .
Parsing [sent. 19082 len. 3]: Ye-es . ''
Parsing [sent. 19083 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19084 len. 24]: said I. `` Ye-es , '' repeated Miss Flite in her most genteel accents , `` my executor , administrator , and assign .
Parsing [sent. 19085 len. 9]: -LRB- Our Chancery phrases , my love . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19086 len. 19]: I have reflected that if I should wear out , he will be able to watch that judgment .
Parsing [sent. 19087 len. 9]: Being so very regular in his attendance . ''
Parsing [sent. 19088 len. 9]: It made me sigh to think of him .
Parsing [sent. 19089 len. 28]: `` I did at one time mean , '' said Miss Flite , echoing the sigh , `` to nominate , constitute , and appoint poor Gridley .
Parsing [sent. 19090 len. 8]: Also very regular , my charming girl .
Parsing [sent. 19091 len. 7]: I assure you , most exemplary !
Parsing [sent. 19092 len. 15]: But he wore out , poor man , so I have appointed his successor .
Parsing [sent. 19093 len. 5]: Do n't mention it .
Parsing [sent. 19094 len. 6]: This is in confidence . ''
Parsing [sent. 19095 len. 25]: She carefully opened her reticule a little way and showed me a folded piece of paper inside as the appointment of which she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 19096 len. 7]: `` Another secret , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 19097 len. 10]: I have added to my collection of birds . ''
Parsing [sent. 19098 len. 7]: `` Really , Miss Flite ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19099 len. 19]: said I , knowing how it pleased her to have her confidence received with an appearance of interest .
Parsing [sent. 19100 len. 13]: She nodded several times , and her face became overcast and gloomy .
Parsing [sent. 19101 len. 4]: `` Two more .
Parsing [sent. 19102 len. 8]: I call them the Wards in Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 19103 len. 9]: They are caged up with all the others .
Parsing [sent. 19104 len. 53]: With Hope , Joy , Youth , Peace , Rest , Life , Dust , Ashes , Waste , Want , Ruin , Despair , Madness , Death , Cunning , Folly , Words , Wigs , Rags , Sheepskin , Plunder , Precedent , Jargon , Gammon , and Spinach ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19105 len. 21]: The poor soul kissed me with the most troubled look I had ever seen in her and went her way .
Parsing [sent. 19106 len. 29]: Her manner of running over the names of her birds , as if she were afraid of hearing them even from her own lips , quite chilled me .
Parsing [sent. 19107 len. 42]: This was not a cheering preparation for my visit , and I could have dispensed with the company of Mr. Vholes , when Richard -LRB- who arrived within a minute or two after me -RRB- brought him to share our dinner .
Parsing [sent. 19108 len. 33]: Although it was a very plain one , Ada and Richard were for some minutes both out of the room together helping to get ready what we were to eat and drink .
Parsing [sent. 19109 len. 17]: Mr. Vholes took that opportunity of holding a little conversation in a low voice with me .
Parsing [sent. 19110 len. 16]: He came to the window where I was sitting and began upon Symond 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 19111 len. 37]: `` A dull place , Miss Summerson , for a life that is not an official one , '' said Mr. Vholes , smearing the glass with his black glove to make it clearer for me .
Parsing [sent. 19112 len. 24]: `` There is not much to see here , '' said I. `` Nor to hear , miss , '' returned Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 19113 len. 22]: `` A little music does occasionally stray in , but we are not musical in the law and soon eject it .
Parsing [sent. 19114 len. 15]: I hope Mr. Jarndyce is as well as his friends could wish him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19115 len. 11]: I thanked Mr. Vholes and said he was quite well .
Parsing [sent. 19116 len. 44]: `` I have not the pleasure to be admitted among the number of his friends myself , '' said Mr. Vholes , `` and I am aware that the gentlemen of our profession are sometimes regarded in such quarters with an unfavourable eye .
Parsing [sent. 19117 len. 35]: Our plain course , however , under good report and evil report , and all kinds of prejudice -LRB- we are the victims of prejudice -RRB- , is to have everything openly carried on .
Parsing [sent. 19118 len. 12]: How do you find Mr. C. looking , Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19119 len. 6]: `` He looks very ill .
Parsing [sent. 19120 len. 4]: Dreadfully anxious . ''
Parsing [sent. 19121 len. 9]: `` Just so , '' said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 19122 len. 49]: He stood behind me with his long black figure reaching nearly to the ceiling of those low rooms , feeling the pimples on his face as if they were ornaments and speaking inwardly and evenly as though there were not a human passion or emotion in his nature .
Parsing [sent. 19123 len. 14]: `` Mr. Woodcourt is in attendance upon Mr. C. , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19124 len. 3]: he resumed .
Parsing [sent. 19125 len. 12]: `` Mr. Woodcourt is his disinterested friend , '' I answered .
Parsing [sent. 19126 len. 12]: `` But I mean in professional attendance , medical attendance . ''
Parsing [sent. 19127 len. 22]: `` That can do little for an unhappy mind , '' said I. `` Just so , '' said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 19128 len. 35]: So slow , so eager , so bloodless and gaunt , I felt as if Richard were wasting away beneath the eyes of this adviser and there were something of the vampire in him .
Parsing [sent. 19129 len. 51]: `` Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Vholes , very slowly rubbing his gloved hands , as if , to his cold sense of touch , they were much the same in black kid or out of it , `` this was an ill-advised marriage of Mr. C. 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 19130 len. 10]: I begged he would excuse me from discussing it .
Parsing [sent. 19131 len. 31]: They had been engaged when they were both very young , I told him -LRB- a little indignantly -RRB- and when the prospect before them was much fairer and brighter .
Parsing [sent. 19132 len. 16]: When Richard had not yielded himself to the unhappy influence which now darkened his life .
Parsing [sent. 19133 len. 10]: `` Just so , '' assented Mr. Vholes again .
Parsing [sent. 19134 len. 36]: `` Still , with a view to everything being openly carried on , I will , with your permission , Miss Summerson , observe to you that I consider this a very ill-advised marriage indeed .
Parsing [sent. 19135 len. 81]: I owe the opinion not only to Mr. C. 's connexions , against whom I should naturally wish to protect myself , but also to my own reputation -- dear to myself as a professional man aiming to keep respectable ; dear to my three girls at home , for whom I am striving to realize some little independence ; dear , I will even say , to my aged father , whom it is my privilege to support . ''
Parsing [sent. 19136 len. 49]: `` It would become a very different marriage , a much happier and better marriage , another marriage altogether , Mr. Vholes , '' said I , `` if Richard were persuaded to turn his back on the fatal pursuit in which you are engaged with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 19137 len. 32]: Mr. Vholes , with a noiseless cough -- or rather gasp -- into one of his black gloves , inclined his head as if he did not wholly dispute even that .
Parsing [sent. 19138 len. 71]: `` Miss Summerson , '' he said , `` it may be so ; and I freely admit that the young lady who has taken Mr. C. 's name upon herself in so ill-advised a manner -- you will I am sure not quarrel with me for throwing out that remark again , as a duty I owe to Mr. C. 's connexions -- is a highly genteel young lady .
Parsing [sent. 19139 len. 34]: Business has prevented me from mixing much with general society in any but a professional character ; still I trust I am competent to perceive that she is a highly genteel young lady .
Parsing [sent. 19140 len. 42]: As to beauty , I am not a judge of that myself , and I never did give much attention to it from a boy , but I dare say the young lady is equally eligible in that point of view .
Parsing [sent. 19141 len. 29]: She is considered so -LRB- I have heard -RRB- among the clerks in the Inn , and it is a point more in their way than in mine .
Parsing [sent. 19142 len. 15]: In reference to Mr. C. 's pursult of his interests -- '' `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 19143 len. 7]: His interests , Mr. Vholes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19144 len. 20]: `` Pardon me , '' returned Mr. Vholes , going on in exactly the same inward and dispassionate manner .
Parsing [sent. 19145 len. 14]: `` Mr. C. takes certain interests under certain wills disputed in the suit .
Parsing [sent. 19146 len. 7]: It is a term we use .
Parsing [sent. 19147 len. 119]: In reference to Mr. C , 's pursuit of his interests , I mentioned to you , Miss Summerson , the first time I had the pleasure of seeing you , in my desire that everything should he openly carried on -- I used those words , for I happened afterwards to note them in my diary , which is producible at any time -- I mentioned to you that Mr. C. had laid down the principle of watching his own interests , and that when a client of mine laid down a principle which was not of an immoral -LRB- that is to say , unlawful -RRB- nature , it devolved upon me to carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 19148 len. 12]: I HAVE carried it out ; I do carry it out .
Parsing [sent. 19149 len. 18]: But I will not smooth things over to any connexion of Mr. C. 's on any account .
Parsing [sent. 19150 len. 14]: As open as I was to Mr. Jarndyce , I am to you .
Parsing [sent. 19151 len. 23]: I regard it in the light of a professional duty to be so , though it can be charged to no one .
Parsing [sent. 19152 len. 46]: I openly say , unpalatable as it may be , that I consider Mr. C. 's affairs in a very bad way , that I consider Mr. C. himself in a very bad way , and that I regard this as an exceedingly ill-advised marriage .
Parsing [sent. 19153 len. 6]: Am I here , sir ?
Parsing [sent. 19154 len. 38]: Yes , I thank you ; I am here , Mr. C. , and enjoying the pleasure of some agreeable conversation with Miss Summerson , for which I have to thank you very much , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19155 len. 19]: He broke off thus in answer to Richard , who addressed him as he came into the room .
Parsing [sent. 19156 len. 35]: By this time I too well understood Mr. Vholes 's scrupulous way of saving himself and his respectability not to feel that our worst fears did but keep pace with his client 's progress .
Parsing [sent. 19157 len. 17]: We sat down to dinner , and I had an opportunity of observing Richard , anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 19158 len. 49]: I was not disturbed by Mr. Vholes -LRB- who took off his gloves to dine -RRB- , though he sat opposite to me at the small table , for I doubt if , looking up at all , he once removed his eyes from his host 's face .
Parsing [sent. 19159 len. 34]: I found Richard thin and languid , slovenly in his dress , abstracted in his manner , forcing his spirits now and then , and at other intervals relapsing into a dull thoughtfulness .
Parsing [sent. 19160 len. 23]: About his large bright eyes that used to be so merry there was a wanness and a restlessness that changed them altogether .
Parsing [sent. 19161 len. 11]: 1 can not use the expression that he looked old .
Parsing [sent. 19162 len. 28]: There is a ruin of youth which is not like age , and into such a ruin Richard 's youth and youthful beauty had all fallen away .
Parsing [sent. 19163 len. 30]: He ate little and seemed indifferent what it was , showed himself to be much more impatient than he used to be , and was quick even with Ada .
Parsing [sent. 19164 len. 42]: I thought at first that his old light-hearted manner was all gone , but it shone out of him sometimes as I had occasionally known little momentary glimpses of my own old face to look out upon me from the glass .
Parsing [sent. 19165 len. 26]: His laugh had not quite left him either , but it was like the echo of a joyful sound , and that is always sorrowful .
Parsing [sent. 19166 len. 28]: Yet he was as glad as ever , in his old affectionate way , to have me there , and we talked of the old times pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 19167 len. 24]: These did not appear to be interesting to Mr. Vholes , though he occasionally made a gasp which I believe was his smile .
Parsing [sent. 19168 len. 21]: He rose shortly after dinner and said that with the permission of the ladies he would retire to his office .
Parsing [sent. 19169 len. 9]: `` Always devoted to business , Vholes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19170 len. 3]: cried Richard .
Parsing [sent. 19171 len. 23]: `` Yes , Mr. C. , '' he returned , `` the interests of clients are never to be neglected , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19172 len. 28]: They are paramount in the thoughts of a professional man like myself , who wishes to preserve a good name among his fellow-practitioners and society at large .
Parsing [sent. 19173 len. 36]: My denying myself the pleasure of the present agreeable conversation may not be wholly irrespective of your own interests , Mr. C. '' Richard expressed himself quite sure of that and lighted Mr. Vholes out .
Parsing [sent. 19174 len. 38]: On his return he told us , more than once , that Vholes was a good fellow , a safe fellow , a man who did what he pretended to do , a very good fellow indeed !
Parsing [sent. 19175 len. 18]: He was so defiant about it that it struck me he had begun to doubt Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 19176 len. 35]: Then he threw himself on the sofa , tired out ; and Ada and I put things to rights , for they had no other servant than the woman who attended to the chambers .
Parsing [sent. 19177 len. 39]: My dear girl had a cottage piano there and quietly sat down to sing some of Richard 's favourites , the lamp being first removed into the next room , as he complained of its hurting his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19178 len. 22]: I sat between them , at my dear girl 's side , and felt very melancholy listening to her sweet voice .
Parsing [sent. 19179 len. 16]: I think Richard did too ; I think he darkened the room for that reason .
Parsing [sent. 19180 len. 25]: She had been singing some time , rising between whiles to bend over him and speak to him , when Mr. Woodcourt came in .
Parsing [sent. 19181 len. 31]: Then he sat down by Richard and half playfully , half earnestly , quite naturally and easily , found out how he felt and where he had been all day .
Parsing [sent. 19182 len. 34]: Presently he proposed to accompany him in a short walk on one of the bridges , as it was a moonlight airy night ; and Richard readily consenting , they went out together .
Parsing [sent. 19183 len. 17]: They left my dear girl still sitting at the piano and me still sitting beside her .
Parsing [sent. 19184 len. 14]: When they were gone out , I drew my arm round her waist .
Parsing [sent. 19185 len. 34]: She put her left hand in mine -LRB- I was sitting on that side -RRB- , but kept her right upon the keys , going over and over them without striking any note .
Parsing [sent. 19186 len. 35]: `` Esther , my dearest , '' she said , breaking silence , `` Richard is never so well and I am never so easy about him as when he is with Allan Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 19187 len. 9]: We have to thank you for that . ''
Parsing [sent. 19188 len. 51]: I pointed out to my darling how this could scarcely be , because Mr. Woodcourt had come to her cousin John 's house and had known us all there , and because he had always liked Richard , and Richard had always liked him , and -- and so forth .
Parsing [sent. 19189 len. 25]: `` All true , '' said Ada , `` but that he is such a devoted friend to us we owe to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 19190 len. 20]: I thought it best to let my dear girl have her way and to say no more about it .
Parsing [sent. 19191 len. 6]: So I said as much .
Parsing [sent. 19192 len. 11]: I said it lightly , because I felt her trembling .
Parsing [sent. 19193 len. 22]: `` Esther , my dearest , I want to be a good wife , a very , very good wife indeed .
Parsing [sent. 19194 len. 6]: You shall teach me . ''
Parsing [sent. 19195 len. 3]: I teach !
Parsing [sent. 19196 len. 42]: I said no more , for I noticed the hand that was fluttering over the keys , and I knew that it was not I who ought to speak , that it was she who had something to say to me .
Parsing [sent. 19197 len. 15]: `` When I married Richard I was not insensible to what was before him .
Parsing [sent. 19198 len. 41]: I had been perfectly happy for a long time with you , and I had never known any trouble or anxiety , so loved and cared for , but I understood the danger he was in , dear Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 19199 len. 11]: `` I know , I know , my darling . ''
Parsing [sent. 19200 len. 52]: `` When we were married I had some little hope that I might be able to convince him of his mistake , that he might come to regard it in a new way as my husband and not pursue it all the more desperately for my sake -- as he does .
Parsing [sent. 19201 len. 20]: But if I had not had that hope , I would have married him just the same , Esther .
Parsing [sent. 19202 len. 5]: Just the same ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19203 len. 38]: In the momentary firmness of the hand that was never still -- a firmness inspired by the utterance of these last words , and dying away with them -- I saw the confirmation of her earnest tones .
Parsing [sent. 19204 len. 25]: `` You are not to think , my dearest Esther , that I fail to see what you see and fear what you fear .
Parsing [sent. 19205 len. 10]: No one can understand him better than I do .
Parsing [sent. 19206 len. 20]: The greatest wisdom that ever lived in the world could scarcely know Richard better than my love does . ''
Parsing [sent. 19207 len. 24]: She spoke so modestly and softly and her trembling hand expressed such agitation as it moved to and fro upon the silent notes !
Parsing [sent. 19208 len. 6]: My dear , dear girl !
Parsing [sent. 19209 len. 10]: `` I see him at his worst every day .
Parsing [sent. 19210 len. 7]: I watch him in his sleep .
Parsing [sent. 19211 len. 8]: I know every change of his face .
Parsing [sent. 19212 len. 37]: But when I married Richard I was quite determined , Esther , if heaven would help me , never to show him that I grieved for what he did and so to make him more unhappy .
Parsing [sent. 19213 len. 17]: I want him , when he comes home , to find no trouble in my face .
Parsing [sent. 19214 len. 18]: I want him , when he looks at me , to see what he loved in me .
Parsing [sent. 19215 len. 13]: I married him to do this , and this supports me . ''
Parsing [sent. 19216 len. 6]: I felt her trembling more .
Parsing [sent. 19217 len. 21]: I waited for what was yet to come , and I now thought I began to know what it was .
Parsing [sent. 19218 len. 10]: `` And something else supports me , Esther . ''
Parsing [sent. 19219 len. 5]: She stopped a minute .
Parsing [sent. 19220 len. 11]: Stopped speaking only ; her hand was still in motion .
Parsing [sent. 19221 len. 21]: `` I look forward a little while , and I do n't know what great aid may come to me .
Parsing [sent. 19222 len. 41]: When Richard turns his eyes upon me then , there may be something lying on my breast more eloquent than I have been , with greater power than mine to show him his true course and win him back . ''
Parsing [sent. 19223 len. 5]: Her hand stopped now .
Parsing [sent. 19224 len. 14]: She clasped me in her arms , and I clasped her in mine .
Parsing [sent. 19225 len. 16]: `` If that little creature should fail too , Esther , I still look forward .
Parsing [sent. 19226 len. 51]: I look forward a long while , through years and years , and think that then , when I am growing old , or when I am dead perhaps , a beautiful woman , his daughter , happily married , may be proud of him and a blessing to him .
Parsing [sent. 19227 len. 49]: Or that a generous brave man , as handsome as he used to be , as hopeful , and far more happy , may walk in the sunshine with him , honouring his grey head and saying to himself , ' I thank God this is my father !
Parsing [sent. 19228 len. 13]: Ruined by a fatal inheritance , and restored through me ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 19229 len. 18]: Oh , my sweet girl , what a heart was that which beat so fast against me !
Parsing [sent. 19230 len. 16]: `` These hopes uphold me , my dear Esther , and I know they will .
Parsing [sent. 19231 len. 19]: Though sometimes even they depart from me before a dread that arises when I look at Richard . ''
Parsing [sent. 19232 len. 14]: I tried to cheer my darling , and asked her what it was .
Parsing [sent. 19233 len. 19]: Sobbing and weeping , she replied , `` That he may not live to see his child . ''
Parsing [sent. 19234 len. 25]: Chapter LXI -- A Discovery The days when I frequented that miserable corner which my dear girl brightened can never fade in my remembrance .
Parsing [sent. 19235 len. 41]: I never see it , and I never wish to see it now ; I have been there only once since , but in my memory there is a mournful glory shining on the place which will shine for ever .
Parsing [sent. 19236 len. 12]: Not a day passed without my going there , of course .
Parsing [sent. 19237 len. 26]: At first I found Mr. Skimpole there , on two or three occasions , idly playing the piano and talking in his usual vivacious strain .
Parsing [sent. 19238 len. 43]: Now , besides my very much mistrusting the probability of his being there without making Richard poorer , I felt as if there were something in his careless gaiety too inconsistent with what I knew of the depths of Ada 's life .
Parsing [sent. 19239 len. 12]: I clearly perceived , too , that Ada shared my feelings .
Parsing [sent. 19240 len. 25]: I therefore resolved , after much thinking of it , to make a private visit to Mr. Skimpole and try delicately to explain myself .
Parsing [sent. 19241 len. 12]: My dear girl was the great consideration that made me bold .
Parsing [sent. 19242 len. 14]: I set off one morning , accompanied by Charley , for Somers Town .
Parsing [sent. 19243 len. 43]: As I approached the house , I was strongly inclined to turn back , for I felt what a desperate attempt it was to make an impression on Mr. Skimpole and how extremely likely it was that he would signally defeat me .
Parsing [sent. 19244 len. 15]: However , I thought that being there , I would go through with it .
Parsing [sent. 19245 len. 59]: I knocked with a trembling hand at Mr. Skimpole 's door -- literally with a hand , for the knocker was gone -- and after a long parley gained admission from an Irishwoman , who was in the area when I knocked , breaking up the lid of a water-butt with a poker to light the fire with .
Parsing [sent. 19246 len. 23]: Mr. Skimpole , lying on the sofa in his room , playing the flute a little , was enchanted to see me .
Parsing [sent. 19247 len. 10]: Now , who should receive me , he asked .
Parsing [sent. 19248 len. 10]: Who would I prefer for mistress of the ceremonies ?
Parsing [sent. 19249 len. 16]: Would I have his Comedy daughter , his Beauty daughter , or his Sentiment daughter ?
Parsing [sent. 19250 len. 14]: Or would I have all the daughters at once in a perfect nosegay ?
Parsing [sent. 19251 len. 22]: I replied , half defeated already , that I wished to speak to himself only if he would give me leave .
Parsing [sent. 19252 len. 9]: ` My dear Miss Summerson , most joyfully !
Parsing [sent. 19253 len. 26]: Of course , '' he said , bringing his chair nearer mine and breaking into his fascinating smile , of course it 's not business .
Parsing [sent. 19254 len. 6]: Then it 's pleasure ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19255 len. 21]: I said it certainly was not business that I came upon , but it was not quite a pleasant matter .
Parsing [sent. 19256 len. 23]: `` Then , my dear Miss Summerson , '' said he with the frankest gaiety , `` do n't allude to it .
Parsing [sent. 19257 len. 13]: Why should you allude to anything that is NOT a pleasant matter ?
Parsing [sent. 19258 len. 4]: I never do .
Parsing [sent. 19259 len. 17]: And you are a much pleasanter creature , in every point of view , than I .
Parsing [sent. 19260 len. 27]: You are perfectly pleasant ; I am imperfectly pleasant ; then , if I never allude to an unpleasant matter , how much less should you !
Parsing [sent. 19261 len. 15]: So that 's disposed of , and we will talk of something else . ''
Parsing [sent. 19262 len. 19]: Although I was embarrassed , I took courage to intimate that I still wished to pursue the subject .
Parsing [sent. 19263 len. 28]: `` I should think it a mistake , '' said Mr. Skimpole with his airy laugh , `` if I thought Miss Summerson capable of making one .
Parsing [sent. 19264 len. 6]: But I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19265 len. 52]: `` Mr. Skimpole , '' said I , raising my eyes to his , `` I have so often heard you say that you are unacquainted with the common affairs of life -- '' `` Meaning our three banking-house friends , L , S , and who 's the junior partner ?
Parsing [sent. 19266 len. 3]: D ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19267 len. 6]: said Mr. Skimpole , brightly .
Parsing [sent. 19268 len. 9]: `` Not an idea of them ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 19269 len. 19]: -- That perhaps , '' I went on , `` you will excuse my boldness on that account .
Parsing [sent. 19270 len. 17]: I think you ought most seriously to know that Richard is poorer than he was . ''
Parsing [sent. 19271 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19272 len. 4]: said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 19273 len. 10]: `` So am I , they tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 19274 len. 8]: `` And in very embarrassed circumstances . ''
Parsing [sent. 19275 len. 7]: `` Parallel case , exactly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19276 len. 8]: said Mr. Skimpole with a delighted countenance .
Parsing [sent. 19277 len. 90]: `` This at present naturally causes Ada much secret anxiety , and as I think she is less anxious when no claims are made upon her by visitors , and as Richard has one uneasiness always heavy on his mind , it has occurred to me to take the liberty of saying that -- if you would -- not -- '' I was coming to the point with great difficulty when he took me by both hands and with a radiant face and in the liveliest way anticipated it .
Parsing [sent. 19278 len. 5]: `` Not go there ?
Parsing [sent. 19279 len. 12]: Certainly not , my dear Miss Summerson , most assuredly not .
Parsing [sent. 19280 len. 6]: Why SHOULD I go there ?
Parsing [sent. 19281 len. 10]: When I go anywhere , I go for pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 19282 len. 15]: I do n't go anywhere for pain , because I was made for pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 19283 len. 9]: Pain comes to ME when it wants me .
Parsing [sent. 19284 len. 22]: Now , I have had very little pleasure at our dear Richard 's lately , and your practical sagacity demonstrates why .
Parsing [sent. 19285 len. 30]: Our young friends , losing the youthful poetry which was once so captivating in them , begin to think , ` This is a man who wants pounds . '
Parsing [sent. 19286 len. 22]: So I am ; I always want pounds ; not for myself , but because tradespeople always want them of me .
Parsing [sent. 19287 len. 30]: Next , our young friends begin to think , becoming mercenary , ` This is the man who HAD pounds , who borrowed them , ' which I did .
Parsing [sent. 19288 len. 5]: I always borrow pounds .
Parsing [sent. 19289 len. 27]: So our young friends , reduced to prose -LRB- which is much to be regretted -RRB- , degenerate in their power of imparting pleasure to me .
Parsing [sent. 19290 len. 10]: Why should I go to see them , therefore ?
Parsing [sent. 19291 len. 3]: Absurd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19292 len. 26]: Through the beaming smile with which he regarded me as he reasoned thus , there now broke forth a look of disinterested benevolence quite astonishing .
Parsing [sent. 19293 len. 58]: `` Besides , '' he said , pursuing his argument in his tone of light-hearted conviction , `` if I do n't go anywhere for pain -- which would be a perversion of the intention of my being , and a monstrous thing to do -- why should I go anywhere to be the cause of pain ?
Parsing [sent. 19294 len. 22]: If I went to see our young friends in their present ill-regulated state of mind , I should give them pain .
Parsing [sent. 19295 len. 8]: The associations with me would be disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 19296 len. 37]: They might say , ` This is the man who had pounds and who ca n't pay pounds , ' which I ca n't , of course ; nothing could be more out of the question !
Parsing [sent. 19297 len. 17]: Then kindness requires that I should n't go near them -- and I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 19298 len. 11]: He finished by genially kissing my hand and thanking me .
Parsing [sent. 19299 len. 19]: Nothing but Miss Summerson 's fine tact , he said , would have found this out for him .
Parsing [sent. 19300 len. 28]: I was much disconcerted , but I reflected that if the main point were gained , it mattered little how strangely he perverted everything leading to it .
Parsing [sent. 19301 len. 23]: I had determined to mention something else , however , and I thought I was not to be put off in that .
Parsing [sent. 19302 len. 60]: `` Mr. Skimpole , '' said I , `` I must take the liberty of saying before I conclude my visit that I was much surprised to learn , on the best authority , some little time ago , that you knew with whom that poor boy left Bleak House and that you accepted a present on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 19303 len. 31]: I have not mentioned it to my guardian , for I fear it would hurt him unnecessarily ; but I may say to you that I was much surprised . ''
Parsing [sent. 19304 len. 3]: `` No ?
Parsing [sent. 19305 len. 9]: Really surprised , my dear Miss Summerson ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19306 len. 9]: he returned inquiringly , raising his pleasant eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 19307 len. 5]: `` Greatly surprised . ''
Parsing [sent. 19308 len. 40]: He thought about it for a little while with a highly agreeable and whimsical expression of face , then quite gave it up and said in his most engaging manner , `` You know what a child I am .
Parsing [sent. 19309 len. 4]: Why surprised ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19310 len. 50]: I was reluctant to enter minutely into that question , but as he begged I would , for he was really curious to know , I gave him to understand in the gentlest words I could use that his conduct seemed to involve a disregard of several moral obligations .
Parsing [sent. 19311 len. 19]: He was much amused and interested when he heard this and said , `` No , really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19312 len. 4]: with ingenuous simplicity .
Parsing [sent. 19313 len. 11]: `` You know I do n't intend to be responsible .
Parsing [sent. 19314 len. 6]: I never could do it .
Parsing [sent. 19315 len. 20]: Responsibility is a thing that has always been above me -- or below me , '' said Mr. Skimpole .
Parsing [sent. 19316 len. 51]: `` I do n't even know which ; but as I understand the way in which my dear Miss Summerson -LRB- always remarkable for her practical good sense and clearness -RRB- puts this case , I should imagine it was chiefly a question of money , do you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19317 len. 9]: I incautiously gave a qualified assent to this .
Parsing [sent. 19318 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19319 len. 22]: Then you see , '' said Mr. Skimpole , shaking his head , `` I am hopeless of understanding it . ''
Parsing [sent. 19320 len. 24]: I suggested , as I rose to go , that it was not right to betray my guardian 's confidence for a bribe .
Parsing [sent. 19321 len. 27]: `` My dear Miss Summerson , '' he returned with a candid hilarity that was all his own , `` I ca n't be bribed . ''
Parsing [sent. 19322 len. 7]: `` Not by Mr. Bucket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19323 len. 9]: said I. `` No , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 19324 len. 5]: `` Not by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 19325 len. 9]: I do n't attach any value to money .
Parsing [sent. 19326 len. 33]: I do n't care about it , I do n't know about it , I do n't want it , I do n't keep it -- it goes away from me directly .
Parsing [sent. 19327 len. 7]: How can I be bribed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19328 len. 21]: I showed that I was of a different opinion , though I had not the capacity for arguing the question .
Parsing [sent. 19329 len. 30]: `` On the contrary , '' said Mr. Skimpole , `` I am exactly the man to be placed in a superior position in such a case as that .
Parsing [sent. 19330 len. 14]: I am above the rest of mankind in such a case as that .
Parsing [sent. 19331 len. 12]: I can act with philosophy in such a case as that .
Parsing [sent. 19332 len. 15]: I am not warped by prejudices , as an Italian baby is by bandages .
Parsing [sent. 19333 len. 8]: I am as free as the air .
Parsing [sent. 19334 len. 13]: I feel myself as far above suspicion as Caesar 's wife . ''
Parsing [sent. 19335 len. 40]: Anything to equal the lightness of his manner and the playful impartiality with which he seemed to convince himself , as he tossed the matter about like a ball of feathers , was surely never seen in anybody else !
Parsing [sent. 19336 len. 10]: `` Observe the case , my dear Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 19337 len. 21]: Here is a boy received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Parsing [sent. 19338 len. 17]: The boy being in bed , a man arrives -- like the house that Jack built .
Parsing [sent. 19339 len. 27]: Here is the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Parsing [sent. 19340 len. 31]: Here is a bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Parsing [sent. 19341 len. 35]: Here is the Skimpole who accepts the bank-note produced by the man who demands the boy who is received into the house and put to bed in a state that I strongly object to .
Parsing [sent. 19342 len. 5]: Those are the facts .
Parsing [sent. 19343 len. 3]: Very well .
Parsing [sent. 19344 len. 8]: Should the Skimpole have refused the note ?
Parsing [sent. 19345 len. 9]: WHY should the Skimpole have refused the note ?
Parsing [sent. 19346 len. 11]: Skimpole protests to Bucket , ` What 's this for ?
Parsing [sent. 19347 len. 19]: I do n't understand it , it is of no use to me , take it away . '
Parsing [sent. 19348 len. 8]: Bucket still entreats Skimpole to accept it .
Parsing [sent. 19349 len. 16]: Are there reasons why Skimpole , not being warped by prejudices , should accept it ?
Parsing [sent. 19350 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 19351 len. 4]: Skimpole perceives them .
Parsing [sent. 19352 len. 4]: What are they ?
Parsing [sent. 19353 len. 66]: Skimpole reasons with himself , this is a tamed lynx , an active police-officer , an intelligent man , a person of a peculiarly directed energy and great subtlety both of conception and execution , who discovers our friends and enemies for us when they run away , recovers our property for us when we are robbed , avenges us comfortably when we are murdered .
Parsing [sent. 19354 len. 39]: This active police-officer and intelligent man has acquired , in the exercise of his art , a strong faith in money ; he finds it very useful to him , and he makes it very useful to society .
Parsing [sent. 19355 len. 34]: Shall I shake that faith in Bucket because I want it myself ; shall I deliberately blunt one of Bucket 's weapons ; shall I positively paralyse Bucket in his next detective operation ?
Parsing [sent. 19356 len. 3]: And again .
Parsing [sent. 19357 len. 34]: If it is blameable in Skimpole to take the note , it is blameable in Bucket to offer the note -- much more blameable in Bucket , because he is the knowing man .
Parsing [sent. 19358 len. 35]: Now , Skimpole wishes to think well of Bucket ; Skimpole deems it essential , in its little place , to the general cohesion of things , that he SHOULD think well of Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 19359 len. 10]: The state expressly asks him to trust to Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 19360 len. 4]: And he does .
Parsing [sent. 19361 len. 8]: And that 's all he does ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19362 len. 16]: I had nothing to offer in reply to this exposition and therefore took my leave .
Parsing [sent. 19363 len. 31]: Mr. Skimpole , however , who was in excellent spirits , would not hear of my returning home attended only by `` Little Coavinses , '' and accompanied me himself .
Parsing [sent. 19364 len. 41]: He entertained me on the way with a variety of delightful conversation and assured me , at parting , that he should never forget the fine tact with which I had found that out for him about our young friends .
Parsing [sent. 19365 len. 24]: As it so happened that I never saw Mr. Skimpole again , I may at once finish what I know of his history .
Parsing [sent. 19366 len. 38]: A coolness arose between him and my guardian , based principally on the foregoing grounds and on his having heartlessly disregarded my guardian 's entreaties -LRB- as we afterwards learned from Ada -RRB- in reference to Richard .
Parsing [sent. 19367 len. 16]: His being heavily in my guardian 's debt had nothing to do with their separation .
Parsing [sent. 19368 len. 47]: He died some five years afterwards and left a diary behind him , with letters and other materials towards his life , which was published and which showed him to have been the victim of a combination on the part of mankind against an amiable child .
Parsing [sent. 19369 len. 29]: It was considered very pleasant reading , but I never read more of it myself than the sentence on which I chanced to light on opening the book .
Parsing [sent. 19370 len. 24]: It was this : `` Jarndyce , in common with most other men I have known , is the incarnation of selfishness . ''
Parsing [sent. 19371 len. 28]: And now I come to a part of my story touching myself very nearly indeed , and for which I was quite unprepared when the circumstance occurred .
Parsing [sent. 19372 len. 41]: Whatever little lingerings may have now and then revived in my mind associated with my poor old face had only revived as belonging to a part of my life that was gone -- gone like my infancy or my childhood .
Parsing [sent. 19373 len. 25]: I have suppressed none of my many weaknesses on that subject , but have written them as faithfully as my memory has recalled them .
Parsing [sent. 19374 len. 33]: And I hope to do , and mean to do , the same down to the last words of these pages , which I see now not so very far before me .
Parsing [sent. 19375 len. 31]: The months were gliding away , and my dear girl , sustained by the hopes she had confided in me , was the same beautiful star in the miserable corner .
Parsing [sent. 19376 len. 46]: Richard , more worn and haggard , haunted the court day after day , listlessly sat there the whole day long when he knew there was no remote chance of the suit being mentioned , and became one of the stock sights of the place .
Parsing [sent. 19377 len. 18]: I wonder whether any of the gentlemen remembered him as he was when he first went there .
Parsing [sent. 19378 len. 34]: So completely was he absorbed in his fixed idea that he used to avow in his cheerful moments that he should never have breathed the fresh air now `` but for Woodcourt . ''
Parsing [sent. 19379 len. 52]: It was only Mr. Woodcourt who could occasionally divert his attention for a few hours at a time and rouse him , even when he sunk into a lethargy of mind and body that alarmed us greatly , and the returns of which became more frequent as the months went on .
Parsing [sent. 19380 len. 20]: My dear girl was right in saying that he only pursued his errors the more desperately for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 19381 len. 35]: I have no doubt that his desire to retrieve what he had lost was rendered the more intense by his grief for his young wife , and became like the madness of a gamester .
Parsing [sent. 19382 len. 13]: I was there , as I have mentioned , at all hours .
Parsing [sent. 19383 len. 34]: When I was there at night , I generally went home with Charley in a coach ; sometimes my guardian would meet me in the neighbourhood , and we would walk home together .
Parsing [sent. 19384 len. 12]: One evening he had arranged to meet me at eight o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 19385 len. 71]: I could not leave , as I usually did , quite punctually at the time , for I was working for my dear girl and had a few stitches more to do to finish what I was about ; but it was within a few minutes of the hour when I bundled up my little work-basket , gave my darling my last kiss for the night , and hurried downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 19386 len. 11]: Mr. Woodcourt went with me , as it was dusk .
Parsing [sent. 19387 len. 30]: When we came to the usual place of meeting -- it was close by , and Mr. Woodcourt had often accompanied me before -- my guardian was not there .
Parsing [sent. 19388 len. 19]: We waited half an hour , walking up and down , but there were no signs of him .
Parsing [sent. 19389 len. 28]: We agreed that he was either prevented from coming or that he had come and gone away , and Mr. Woodcourt proposed to walk home with me .
Parsing [sent. 19390 len. 23]: It was the first walk we had ever taken together , except that very short one to the usual place of meeting .
Parsing [sent. 19391 len. 10]: We spoke of Richard and Ada the whole way .
Parsing [sent. 19392 len. 41]: I did not thank him in words for what he had done -- my appreciation of it had risen above all words then -- but I hoped he might not be without some understanding of what I felt so strongly .
Parsing [sent. 19393 len. 22]: Arriving at home and going upstairs , we found that my guardian was out and that Mrs. Woodcourt was out too .
Parsing [sent. 19394 len. 62]: We were in the very same room into which I had brought my blushing girl when her youthful lover , now her so altered husband , was the choice of her young heart , the very same room from which my guardian and I had watched them going away through the sunlight in the fresh bloom of their hope and promise .
Parsing [sent. 19395 len. 19]: We were standing by the opened window looking down into the street when Mr. Woodcourt spoke to me .
Parsing [sent. 19396 len. 10]: I learned in a moment that he loved me .
Parsing [sent. 19397 len. 15]: I learned in a moment that my scarred face was all unchanged to him .
Parsing [sent. 19398 len. 22]: I learned in a moment that what I had thought was pity and compassion was devoted , generous , faithful love .
Parsing [sent. 19399 len. 15]: Oh , too late to know it now , too late , too late .
Parsing [sent. 19400 len. 9]: That was the first ungrateful thought I had .
Parsing [sent. 19401 len. 3]: Too late .
Parsing [sent. 19402 len. 62]: `` When I returned , '' he told me , `` when I came back , no richer than when I went away , and found you newly risen from a sick bed , yet so inspired by sweet consideration for others and so free from a selfish thought -- '' `` Oh , Mr. Woodcourt , forbear , forbear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19403 len. 4]: I entreated him .
Parsing [sent. 19404 len. 9]: `` I do not deserve your high praise .
Parsing [sent. 19405 len. 12]: I had many selfish thoughts at that time , many ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19406 len. 28]: `` Heaven knows , beloved of my life , '' said he , `` that my praise is not a lover 's praise , but the truth .
Parsing [sent. 19407 len. 31]: You do not know what all around you see in Esther Summerson , how many hearts she touches and awakens , what sacred admiration and what love she wins . ''
Parsing [sent. 19408 len. 29]: `` Oh , Mr. Woodcourt , '' cried I , `` it is a great thing to win love , it is a great thing to win love !
Parsing [sent. 19409 len. 55]: I am proud of it , and honoured by it ; and the hearing of it causes me to shed these tears of mingled joy and sorrow -- joy that I have won it , sorrow that I have not deserved it better ; but I am not free to think of yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 19410 len. 40]: I said it with a stronger heart , for when he praised me thus and when I heard his voice thrill with his belief that what he said was true , I aspired to be more worthy of it .
Parsing [sent. 19411 len. 8]: It was not too late for that .
Parsing [sent. 19412 len. 22]: Although I closed this unforeseen page in my life to-night , I could be worthier of it all through my life .
Parsing [sent. 19413 len. 33]: And it was a comfort to me , and an impulse to me , and I felt a dignity rise up within me that was derived from him when I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 19414 len. 5]: He broke the silence .
Parsing [sent. 19415 len. 65]: `` I should poorly show the trust that I have in the dear one who will evermore be as dear to me as now '' -- and the deep earnestness with which he said it at once strengthened me and made me weep -- `` if , after her assurance that she is not free to think of my love , I urged it .
Parsing [sent. 19416 len. 28]: Dear Esther , let me only tell you that the fond idea of you which I took abroad was exalted to the heavens when I came home .
Parsing [sent. 19417 len. 26]: I have always hoped , in the first hour when I seemed to stand in any ray of good fortune , to tell you this .
Parsing [sent. 19418 len. 13]: I have always feared that I should tell it you in vain .
Parsing [sent. 19419 len. 9]: My hopes and fears are both fulfilled to-night .
Parsing [sent. 19420 len. 4]: I distress you .
Parsing [sent. 19421 len. 6]: I have said enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 19422 len. 28]: Something seemed to pass into my place that was like the angel he thought me , and I felt so sorrowful for the loss he had sustained !
Parsing [sent. 19423 len. 24]: I wished to help him in his trouble , as I had wished to do when he showed that first commiseration for me .
Parsing [sent. 19424 len. 23]: `` Dear Mr. Woodcourt , '' said I , `` before we part to-night , something is left for me to say .
Parsing [sent. 19425 len. 38]: I never could say it as I wish -- I never shall -- but -- '' I had to think again of being more deserving of his love and his affliction before I could go on . ''
Parsing [sent. 19426 len. 20]: -- I am deeply sensible of your generosity , and I shall treasure its remembrance to my dying hour .
Parsing [sent. 19427 len. 33]: I know full well how changed I am , I know you are not unacquainted with my history , and I know what a noble love that is which is so faithful .
Parsing [sent. 19428 len. 31]: What you have said to me could have affected me so much from no other lips , for there are none that could give it such a value to me .
Parsing [sent. 19429 len. 6]: It shall not be lost .
Parsing [sent. 19430 len. 7]: It shall make me better . ''
Parsing [sent. 19431 len. 13]: He covered his eyes with his hand and turned away his head .
Parsing [sent. 19432 len. 10]: How could I ever be worthy of those tears ?
Parsing [sent. 19433 len. 65]: `` If , in the unchanged intercourse we shall have together -- in tending Richard and Ada , and I hope in many happier scenes of life -- you ever find anything in me which you can honestly think is better than it used to be , believe that it will have sprung up from to-night and that I shall owe it to you .
Parsing [sent. 19434 len. 39]: And never believe , dear dear Mr. Woodcourt , never believe that I forget this night or that while my heart beats it can be insensible to the pride and joy of having been beloved by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 19435 len. 8]: He took my hand and kissed it .
Parsing [sent. 19436 len. 13]: He was like himself again , and I felt still more encouraged .
Parsing [sent. 19437 len. 27]: `` I am induced by what you said just now , '' said I , `` to hope that you have succeeded in your endeavour . ''
Parsing [sent. 19438 len. 8]: `` I have , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 19439 len. 27]: `` With such help from Mr. Jarndyce as you who know him so well can imagine him to have rendered me , I have succeeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 19440 len. 27]: `` Heaven bless him for it , '' said I , giving him my hand ; `` and heaven bless you in all you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19441 len. 33]: `` I shall do it better for the wish , '' he answered ; `` it will make me enter on these new duties as on another sacred trust from you . ''
Parsing [sent. 19442 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19443 len. 3]: Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19444 len. 15]: I exclaimed involuntarily , `` What will he do when you are gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19445 len. 25]: `` I am not required to go yet ; I would not desert him , dear Miss Summerson , even if I were . ''
Parsing [sent. 19446 len. 15]: One other thing I felt it needful to touch upon before he left me .
Parsing [sent. 19447 len. 20]: I knew that I should not be worthier of the love I could not take if I reserved it .
Parsing [sent. 19448 len. 52]: `` Mr. Woodcourt , '' said I , `` you will be glad to know from my lips before I say good night that in the future , which is clear and bright before me , I am most happy , most fortunate , have nothing to regret or desire . ''
Parsing [sent. 19449 len. 12]: It was indeed a glad hearing to him , he replied .
Parsing [sent. 19450 len. 64]: `` From my childhood I have been , '' said I , `` the object of the untiring goodness of the best of human beings , to whom I am so bound by every tie of attachment , gratitude , and love , that nothing I could do in the compass of a life could express the feelings of a single day . ''
Parsing [sent. 19451 len. 10]: `` I share those feelings , '' he returned .
Parsing [sent. 19452 len. 8]: `` You speak of Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 19453 len. 26]: `` You know his virtues well , '' said I , `` but few can know the greatness of his character as I know it .
Parsing [sent. 19454 len. 30]: All its highest and best qualities have been revealed to me in nothing more brightly than in the shaping out of that future in which I am so happy .
Parsing [sent. 19455 len. 48]: And if your highest homage and respect had not been his already -- which I know they are -- they would have been his , I think , on this assurance and in the feeling it would have awakened in you towards him for my sake . ''
Parsing [sent. 19456 len. 11]: He fervently replied that indeed indeed they would have been .
Parsing [sent. 19457 len. 7]: I gave him my hand again .
Parsing [sent. 19458 len. 12]: `` Good night , '' I said , `` Good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 19459 len. 22]: `` The first until we meet to-morrow , the second as a farewell to this theme between us for ever . ''
Parsing [sent. 19460 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 19461 len. 7]: `` Good night ; good-bye . ''
Parsing [sent. 19462 len. 15]: He left me , and I stood at the dark window watching the street .
Parsing [sent. 19463 len. 41]: His love , in all its constancy and generosity , had come so suddenly upon me that he had not left me a minute when my fortitude gave way again and the street was blotted out by my rushing tears .
Parsing [sent. 19464 len. 10]: But they were not tears of regret and sorrow .
Parsing [sent. 19465 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 19466 len. 43]: He had called me the beloved of his life and had said I would be evermore as dear to him as I was then , and I felt as if my heart would not hold the triumph of having heard those words .
Parsing [sent. 19467 len. 8]: My first wild thought had died away .
Parsing [sent. 19468 len. 31]: It was not too late to hear them , for it was not too late to be animated by them to be good , true , grateful , and contented .
Parsing [sent. 19469 len. 11]: How easy my path , how much easier than his !
Parsing [sent. 19470 len. 17]: Chapter LXII -- Another Discovery I had not the courage to see any one that night .
Parsing [sent. 19471 len. 23]: I had not even the courage to see myself , for I was afraid that my tears might a little reproach me .
Parsing [sent. 19472 len. 25]: I went up to my room in the dark , and prayed in the dark , and lay down in the dark to sleep .
Parsing [sent. 19473 len. 22]: I had no need of any light to read my guardian 's letter by , for I knew it by heart .
Parsing [sent. 19474 len. 35]: I took it from the place where I kept it , and repeated its contents by its own clear light of integrity and love , and went to sleep with it on my pillow .
Parsing [sent. 19475 len. 17]: I was up very early in the morning and called Charley to come for a walk .
Parsing [sent. 19476 len. 21]: We bought flowers for the breakfast-table , and came back and arranged them , and were as busy as possible .
Parsing [sent. 19477 len. 49]: We were so early that I had a good time still for Charley 's lesson before breakfast ; Charley -LRB- who was not in the least improved in the old defective article of grammar -RRB- came through it with great applause ; and we were altogether very notable .
Parsing [sent. 19478 len. 21]: When my guardian appeared he said , `` Why , little woman , you look fresher than your flowers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19479 len. 24]: And Mrs. Woodcourt repeated and translated a passage from the Mewlinnwillinwodd expressive of my being like a mountain with the sun upon it .
Parsing [sent. 19480 len. 22]: This was all so pleasant that I hope it made me still more like the mountain than I had been before .
Parsing [sent. 19481 len. 30]: After breakfast I waited my opportunity and peeped about a little until I saw my guardian in his own room -- the room of last night -- by himself .
Parsing [sent. 19482 len. 19]: Then I made an excuse to go in with my housekeeping keys , shutting the door after me .
Parsing [sent. 19483 len. 7]: `` Well , Dame Durden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19484 len. 17]: said my guardian ; the post had brought him several letters , and he was writing .
Parsing [sent. 19485 len. 6]: `` You want money ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19486 len. 12]: `` No , indeed , I have plenty in hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 19487 len. 21]: `` There never was such a Dame Durden , '' said my guardian , `` for making money last . ''
Parsing [sent. 19488 len. 16]: He had laid down his pen and leaned back in his chair looking at me .
Parsing [sent. 19489 len. 23]: I have often spoken of his bright face , but I thought I had never seen it look so bright and good .
Parsing [sent. 19490 len. 24]: There was a high happiness upon it which made me think , `` He has been doing some great kindness this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 19491 len. 28]: `` There never was , '' said my guardian , musing as he smiled upon me , `` such a Dame Durden for making money last . ''
Parsing [sent. 19492 len. 9]: He had never yet altered his old manner .
Parsing [sent. 19493 len. 65]: I loved it and him so much that when I now went up to him and took my usual chair , which was always put at his side -- for sometimes I read to him , and sometimes I talked to him , and sometimes I silently worked by him -- I hardly liked to disturb it by laying my hand on his breast .
Parsing [sent. 19494 len. 11]: But I found I did not disturb it at all .
Parsing [sent. 19495 len. 16]: `` Dear guardian , '' said I , `` I want to speak to you .
Parsing [sent. 19496 len. 8]: Have I been remiss in anything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19497 len. 9]: `` Remiss in anything , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19498 len. 24]: `` Have I not been what I have meant to be since -- I brought the answer to your letter , guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19499 len. 13]: `` You have been everything I could desire , my love . ''
Parsing [sent. 19500 len. 14]: `` I am very glad indeed to hear that , '' I returned .
Parsing [sent. 19501 len. 17]: `` You know , you said to me , was this the mistress of Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 19502 len. 7]: And I said , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 19503 len. 12]: `` Yes , '' said my guardian , nodding his head .
Parsing [sent. 19504 len. 24]: He had put his arm about me as if there were something to protect me from and looked in my face , smiling .
Parsing [sent. 19505 len. 20]: `` Since then , '' said I , `` we have never spoken on the subject except once . ''
Parsing [sent. 19506 len. 20]: `` And then I said Bleak House was thinning fast ; and so it was , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 19507 len. 18]: `` And I said , '' I timidly reminded him , `` but its mistress remained . ''
Parsing [sent. 19508 len. 19]: He still held me in the same protecting manner and with the same bright goodness in his face .
Parsing [sent. 19509 len. 27]: `` Dear guardian , '' said I , `` I know how you have felt all that has happened , and how considerate you have been .
Parsing [sent. 19510 len. 30]: As so much time has passed , and as you spoke only this morning of my being so well again , perhaps you expect me to renew the subject .
Parsing [sent. 19511 len. 7]: Perhaps I ought to do so .
Parsing [sent. 19512 len. 13]: I will be the mistress of Bleak House when you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 19513 len. 18]: `` See , '' he returned gaily , `` what a sympathy there must be between us !
Parsing [sent. 19514 len. 20]: I have had nothing else , poor Rick excepted -- it 's a large exception -- in my mind .
Parsing [sent. 19515 len. 11]: When you came in , I was full of it .
Parsing [sent. 19516 len. 13]: When shall we give Bleak House its mistress , little woman ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19517 len. 6]: `` When you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 19518 len. 5]: `` Next month ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19519 len. 8]: `` Next month , dear guardian . ''
Parsing [sent. 19520 len. 61]: `` The day on which I take the happiest and best step of my life -- the day on which I shall be a man more exulting and more enviable than any other man in the world -- the day on which I give Bleak House its little mistress -- shall be next month then , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19521 len. 24]: I put my arms round his neck and kissed him just as I had done on the day when I brought my answer .
Parsing [sent. 19522 len. 29]: A servant came to the door to announce Mr. Bucket , which was quite unnecessary , for Mr. Bucket was already looking in over the servant 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 19523 len. 56]: `` Mr. Jarndyce and Miss Summerson , '' said he , rather out of breath , `` with all apologies for intruding , WILL you allow me to order up a person that 's on the stairs and that objects to being left there in case of becoming the subject of observations in his absence ?
Parsing [sent. 19524 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 19525 len. 16]: Be so good as chair that there member in this direction , will you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19526 len. 9]: said Mr. Bucket , beckoning over the banisters .
Parsing [sent. 19527 len. 34]: This singular request produced an old man in a black skull-cap , unable to walk , who was carried up by a couple of bearers and deposited in the room near the door .
Parsing [sent. 19528 len. 18]: Mr. Bucket immediately got rid of the bearers , mysteriously shut the door , and bolted it .
Parsing [sent. 19529 len. 40]: `` Now you see , Mr. Jarndyce , '' he then began , putting down his hat and opening his subject with a flourish of his well-remembered finger , `` you know me , and Miss Summerson knows me .
Parsing [sent. 19530 len. 12]: This gentleman likewise knows me , and his name is Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 19531 len. 20]: The discounting line is his line principally , and he 's what you may call a dealer in bills .
Parsing [sent. 19532 len. 15]: That 's about what YOU are , you know , ai n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19533 len. 21]: said Mr. Bucket , stopping a little to address the gentleman in question , who was exceedingly suspicious of him .
Parsing [sent. 19534 len. 20]: He seemed about to dispute this designation of himself when he was seized with a violent fit of coughing .
Parsing [sent. 19535 len. 9]: `` Now , moral , you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19536 len. 8]: said Mr. Bucket , improving the accident .
Parsing [sent. 19537 len. 22]: `` Do n't you contradict when there ai n't no occasion , and you wo n't be took in that way .
Parsing [sent. 19538 len. 11]: Now , Mr. Jarndyce , I address myself to you .
Parsing [sent. 19539 len. 34]: I 've been negotiating with this gentleman on behalf of Sir Leicester Dedlock , Baronet , and one way and another I 've been in and out and about his premises a deal .
Parsing [sent. 19540 len. 33]: His premises are the premises formerly occupied by Krook , marine store dealer -- a relation of this gentleman 's that you saw in his life-time if I do n't mistake ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19541 len. 8]: My guardian replied , `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 19542 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 19543 len. 31]: You are to understand , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` that this gentleman he come into Krook 's property , and a good deal of magpie property there was .
Parsing [sent. 19544 len. 8]: Vast lots of waste-paper among the rest .
Parsing [sent. 19545 len. 11]: Lord bless you , of no use to nobody ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19546 len. 67]: The cunning of Mr. Bucket 's eye and the masterly manner in which he contrived , without a look or a word against which his watchful auditor could protest , to let us know that he stated the case according to previous agreement and could say much more of Mr. Smallweed if he thought it advisable , deprived us of any merit in quite understanding him .
Parsing [sent. 19547 len. 23]: His difficulty was increased by Mr. Smallweed 's being deaf as well as suspicious and watching his face with the closest attention .
Parsing [sent. 19548 len. 30]: `` Among them odd heaps of old papers , this gentleman , when he comes into the property , naturally begins to rummage , do n't you see ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19549 len. 4]: said Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 19550 len. 4]: `` To which ?
Parsing [sent. 19551 len. 15]: Say that again , '' cried Mr. Smallweed in a shrill , sharp voice .
Parsing [sent. 19552 len. 9]: `` To rummage , '' repeated Mr. Bucket .
Parsing [sent. 19553 len. 33]: `` Being a prudent man and accustomed to take care of your own affairs , you begin to rummage among the papers as you have come into ; do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19554 len. 11]: `` Of course I do , '' cried Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 19555 len. 25]: `` Of course you do , '' said Mr. Bucket conversationally , `` and much to blame you would be if you did n't .
Parsing [sent. 19556 len. 54]: And so you chance to find , you know , '' Mr. Bucket went on , stooping over him with an air of cheerful raillery which Mr. Smallweed by no means reciprocated , `` and so you chance to find , you know , a paper with the signature of Jarndyce to it .
Parsing [sent. 19557 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19558 len. 14]: Mr. Smallweed glanced with a troubled eye at us and grudgingly nodded assent .
Parsing [sent. 19559 len. 35]: `` And coming to look at that paper at your full leisure and convenience -- all in good time , for you 're not curious to read it , and why should you be ?
Parsing [sent. 19560 len. 15]: -- what do you find it to be but a will , you see .
Parsing [sent. 19561 len. 54]: That 's the drollery of it , '' said Mr. Bucket with the same lively air of recalling a joke for the enjoyment of Mr. Smallweed , who still had the same crest-fallen appearance of not enjoying it at all ; `` what do you find it to be but a will ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19562 len. 22]: `` I do n't know that it 's good as a will or as anything else , '' snarled Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 19563 len. 60]: Mr. Bucket eyed the old man for a moment -- he had slipped and shrunk down in his chair into a mere bundle -- as if he were much disposed to pounce upon him ; nevertheless , he continued to bend over him with the same agreeable air , keeping the corner of one of his eyes upon us .
Parsing [sent. 19564 len. 33]: `` Notwithstanding which , '' said Mr. Bucket , `` you get a little doubtful and uncomfortable in your mind about it , having a very tender mind of your own . ''
Parsing [sent. 19565 len. 3]: `` Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 19566 len. 12]: What do you say I have got of my own ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19567 len. 10]: asked Mr. Smallweed with his hand to his ear .
Parsing [sent. 19568 len. 7]: `` A very tender mind . ''
Parsing [sent. 19569 len. 3]: `` Ho !
Parsing [sent. 19570 len. 10]: Well , go on , '' said Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 19571 len. 105]: `` And as you 've heard a good deal mentioned regarding a celebrated Chancery will case of the same name , and as you know what a card Krook was for buying all manner of old pieces of furniter , and books , and papers , and what not , and never liking to part with 'em , and always a-going to teach himself to read , you begin to think -- and you never was more correct in your born days -- ` Ecod , if I do n't look about me , I may get into trouble regarding this will . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 19572 len. 24]: `` Now , mind how you put it , Bucket , '' cried the old man anxiously with his hand at his ear .
Parsing [sent. 19573 len. 10]: `` Speak up ; none of your brimstone tricks .
Parsing [sent. 19574 len. 10]: Pick me up ; I want to hear better .
Parsing [sent. 19575 len. 11]: Oh , Lord , I am shaken to bits ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19576 len. 11]: Mr. Bucket had certainly picked him up at a dart .
Parsing [sent. 19577 len. 25]: However , as soon as he could be heard through Mr. Smallweed 's coughing and his vicious ejaculations of `` Oh , my bones !
Parsing [sent. 19578 len. 4]: Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 19579 len. 8]: I 've no breath in my body !
Parsing [sent. 19580 len. 15]: I 'm worse than the chattering , clattering , brimstone pig at home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19581 len. 11]: Mr. Bucket proceeded in the same convivial manner as before .
Parsing [sent. 19582 len. 29]: `` So , as I happen to be in the habit of coming about your premises , you take me into your confidence , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19583 len. 61]: I think it would be impossible to make an admission with more ill will and a worse grace than Mr. Smallweed displayed when he admitted this , rendering it perfectly evident that Mr. Bucket was the very last person he would have thought of taking into his confidence if he could by any possibility have kept him out of it .
Parsing [sent. 19584 len. 75]: `` And I go into the business with you -- very pleasant we are over it ; and I confirm you in your well-founded fears that you will get yourself into a most precious line if you do n't come out with that there will , '' said Mr. Bucket emphatically ; `` and accordingly you arrange with me that it shall be delivered up to this present Mr. Jarndyce , on no conditions .
Parsing [sent. 19585 len. 29]: If it should prove to be valuable , you trusting yourself to him for your reward ; that 's about where it is , ai n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19586 len. 17]: `` That 's what was agreed , '' Mr. Smallweed assented with the same bad grace .
Parsing [sent. 19587 len. 55]: `` In consequence of which , '' said Mr. Bucket , dismissing his agreeable manner all at once and becoming strictly businesslike , `` you 've got that will upon your person at the present time , and the only thing that remains for you to do is just to out with it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19588 len. 54]: Having given us one glance out of the watching corner of his eye , and having given his nose one triumphant rub with his forefinger , Mr. Bucket stood with his eyes fastened on his confidential friend and his hand stretched forth ready to take the paper and present it to my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19589 len. 42]: It was not produced without much reluctance and many declarations on the part of Mr. Smallweed that he was a poor industrious man and that he left it to Mr. Jarndyce 's honour not to let him lose by his honesty .
Parsing [sent. 19590 len. 47]: Little by little he very slowly took from a breast-pocket a stained , discoloured paper which was much singed upon the outside and a little burnt at the edges , as if it had long ago been thrown upon a fire and hastily snatched off again .
Parsing [sent. 19591 len. 24]: Mr. Bucket lost no time in transferring this paper , with the dexterity of a conjuror , from Mr. Smallweed to Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 19592 len. 26]: As he gave it to my guardian , he whispered behind his fingers , `` Had n't settled how to make their market of it .
Parsing [sent. 19593 len. 6]: Quarrelled and hinted about it .
Parsing [sent. 19594 len. 8]: I laid out twenty pound upon it .
Parsing [sent. 19595 len. 27]: First the avaricious grandchildren split upon him on account of their objections to his living so unreasonably long , and then they split on one another .
Parsing [sent. 19596 len. 2]: Lord !
Parsing [sent. 19597 len. 45]: There ai n't one of the family that would n't sell the other for a pound or two , except the old lady -- and she 's only out of it because she 's too weak in her mind to drive a bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 19598 len. 50]: `` Mr Bucket , '' said my guardian aloud , `` whatever the worth of this paper may be to any one , my obligations are great to you ; and if it be of any worth , I hold myself bound to see Mr. Smallweed remunerated accordingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 19599 len. 21]: `` Not according to your merits , you know , '' said Mr. Bucket in friendly explanation to Mr. Smallweed .
Parsing [sent. 19600 len. 9]: `` Do n't you be afraid of that .
Parsing [sent. 19601 len. 6]: According to its value . ''
Parsing [sent. 19602 len. 12]: `` That is what I mean , '' said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19603 len. 17]: `` You may observe , Mr. Bucket , that I abstain from examining this paper myself .
Parsing [sent. 19604 len. 25]: The plain truth is , I have forsworn and abjured the whole business these many years , and my soul is sick of it .
Parsing [sent. 19605 len. 36]: But Miss Summerson and I will immediately place the paper in the hands of my solicitor in the cause , and its existence shall be made known without delay to all other parties interested . ''
Parsing [sent. 19606 len. 21]: `` Mr. Jarndyce ca n't say fairer than that , you understand , '' observed Mr. Bucket to his fellow-visitor .
Parsing [sent. 19607 len. 40]: `` And it being now made clear to you that nobody 's a-going to be wronged -- which must be a great relief to YOUR mind -- we may proceed with the ceremony of chairing you home again . ''
Parsing [sent. 19608 len. 34]: He unbolted the door , called in the bearers , wished us good morning , and with a look full of meaning and a crook of his finger at parting went his way .
Parsing [sent. 19609 len. 18]: We went our way too , which was to Lincoln 's Inn , as quickly as possible .
Parsing [sent. 19610 len. 26]: Mr. Kenge was disengaged , and we found him at his table in his dusty room with the inexpressive-looking books and the piles of papers .
Parsing [sent. 19611 len. 30]: Chairs having been placed for us by Mr. Guppy , Mr. Kenge expressed the surprise and gratification he felt at the unusual sight of Mr. Jarndyce in his office .
Parsing [sent. 19612 len. 17]: He turned over his double eye-glass as he spoke and was more Conversation Kenge than ever .
Parsing [sent. 19613 len. 75]: `` I hope , '' said Mr. Kenge , `` that the genial influence of Miss Summerson , '' he bowed to me , `` may have induced Mr. Jarndyce , '' he bowed to him , `` to forego some little of his animosity towards a cause and towards a court which are -- shall I say , which take their place in the stately vista of the pillars of our profession ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19614 len. 37]: `` I am inclined to think , '' returned my guardian , `` that Miss Summerson has seen too much of the effects of the court and the cause to exert any influence in their favour .
Parsing [sent. 19615 len. 14]: Nevertheless , they are a part of the occasion of my being here .
Parsing [sent. 19616 len. 30]: Mr. Kenge , before I lay this paper on your desk and have done with it , let me tell you how it has come into my hands . ''
Parsing [sent. 19617 len. 7]: He did so shortly and distinctly .
Parsing [sent. 19618 len. 32]: `` It could not , sir , '' said Mr. Kenge , `` have been stated more plainly and to the purpose if it had been a case at law . ''
Parsing [sent. 19619 len. 19]: `` Did you ever know English law , or equity either , plain and to the purpose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19620 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19621 len. 6]: `` Oh , fie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19622 len. 4]: said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 19623 len. 43]: At first he had not seemed to attach much importance to the paper , but when he saw it he appeared more interested , and when he had opened and read a little of it through his eye-glass , he became amazed .
Parsing [sent. 19624 len. 19]: `` Mr. Jarndyce , '' he said , looking off it , `` you have perused this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19625 len. 5]: `` Not I ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19626 len. 4]: returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19627 len. 26]: `` But , my dear sir , '' said Mr. Kenge , `` it is a will of later date than any in the suit .
Parsing [sent. 19628 len. 11]: It appears to be all in the testator 's handwriting .
Parsing [sent. 19629 len. 7]: It is duly executed and attested .
Parsing [sent. 19630 len. 27]: And even if intended to be cancelled , as might possibly be supposed to be denoted by these marks of fire , it is NOT cancelled .
Parsing [sent. 19631 len. 9]: Here it is , a perfect instrument ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19632 len. 4]: `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19633 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19634 len. 8]: `` What is that to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19635 len. 5]: `` Mr. Guppy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19636 len. 8]: cried Mr. Kenge , raising his voice .
Parsing [sent. 19637 len. 10]: `` I beg your pardon , Mr. Jarndyce . ''
Parsing [sent. 19638 len. 4]: `` Sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 19639 len. 8]: `` Mr. Vholes of Symond 's Inn .
Parsing [sent. 19640 len. 3]: My compliments .
Parsing [sent. 19641 len. 4]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 19642 len. 7]: Glad to speak with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 19643 len. 4]: Mr. Guppy disappeared .
Parsing [sent. 19644 len. 13]: `` You ask me what is this to you , Mr. Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 19645 len. 47]: If you had perused this document , you would have seen that it reduces your interest considerably , though still leaving it a very handsome one , still leaving it a very handsome one , '' said Mr. Kenge , waving his hand persuasively and blandly .
Parsing [sent. 19646 len. 32]: `` You would further have seen that the interests of Mr. Richard Carstone and of Miss Ada Clare , now Mrs. Richard Carstone , are very materially advanced by it . ''
Parsing [sent. 19647 len. 38]: `` Kenge , '' said my guardian , `` if all the flourishing wealth that the suit brought into this vile court of Chancery could fall to my two young cousins , I should be well contented .
Parsing [sent. 19648 len. 19]: But do you ask ME to believe that any good is to come of Jarndyce and Jarndyce ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19649 len. 8]: `` Oh , really , Mr. Jarndyce !
Parsing [sent. 19650 len. 4]: Prejudice , prejudice .
Parsing [sent. 19651 len. 16]: My dear sir , this is a very great country , a very great country .
Parsing [sent. 19652 len. 15]: Its system of equity is a very great system , a very great system .
Parsing [sent. 19653 len. 5]: Really , really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19654 len. 11]: My guardian said no more , and Mr. Vholes arrived .
Parsing [sent. 19655 len. 11]: He was modestly impressed by Mr. Kenge 's professional eminence .
Parsing [sent. 19656 len. 9]: `` How do you do , Mr. Vholes ?
Parsing [sent. 19657 len. 20]: Willl you be so good as to take a chair here by me and look over this paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19658 len. 15]: Mr. Vholes did as he was asked and seemed to read it every word .
Parsing [sent. 19659 len. 15]: He was not excited by it , but he was not excited by anything .
Parsing [sent. 19660 len. 32]: When he had well examined it , he retired with Mr. Kenge into a window , and shading his mouth with his black glove , spoke to him at some length .
Parsing [sent. 19661 len. 37]: I was not surprised to observe Mr. Kenge inclined to dispute what he said before he had said much , for I knew that no two people ever did agree about anything in Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 19662 len. 50]: But he seemed to get the better of Mr. Kenge too in a conversation that sounded as if it were almost composed of the words `` Receiver -- General , '' `` Accountant -- General , '' `` report , '' `` estate , '' and `` costs . ''
Parsing [sent. 19663 len. 17]: When they had finished , they came back to Mr. Kenge 's table and spoke aloud .
Parsing [sent. 19664 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 19665 len. 16]: But this is a very remarkable document , Mr. Vholes , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 19666 len. 10]: Mr. Vholes said , `` Very much so . ''
Parsing [sent. 19667 len. 15]: `` And a very important document , Mr. Vholes , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 19668 len. 11]: Again Mr. Vholes said , `` Very much so . ''
Parsing [sent. 19669 len. 42]: `` And as you say , Mr. Vholes , when the cause is in the paper next term , this document will be an unexpected and interesting feature in it , '' said Mr. Kenge , looking loftily at my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19670 len. 28]: Mr. Vholes was gratified , as a smaller practitioner striving to keep respectable , to be confirmed in any opinion of his own by such an authority .
Parsing [sent. 19671 len. 37]: `` And when , '' asked my guardian , rising after a pause , during which Mr. Kenge had rattled his money and Mr. Vholes had picked his pimples , `` when is next term ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19672 len. 17]: `` Next term , Mr. Jarndyce , will be next month , '' said Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 19673 len. 43]: `` Of course we shall at once proceed to do what is necessary with this document and to collect the necessary evidence concerning it ; and of course you will receive our usual notification of the cause being in the paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 19674 len. 15]: `` To which I shall pay , of course , my usual attention . ''
Parsing [sent. 19675 len. 39]: `` Still bent , my dear sir , '' said Mr. Kenge , showing us through the outer office to the door , `` still bent , even with your enlarged mind , on echoing a popular prejudice ?
Parsing [sent. 19676 len. 14]: We are a prosperous community , Mr. Jarndyce , a very prosperous community .
Parsing [sent. 19677 len. 16]: We are a great country , Mr. Jarndyce , we are a very great country .
Parsing [sent. 19678 len. 22]: This is a great system , Mr. Jarndyce , and would you wish a great country to have a little system ?
Parsing [sent. 19679 len. 7]: Now , really , really ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19680 len. 42]: He said this at the stair-head , gently moving his right hand as if it were a silver trowel with which to spread the cement of his words on the structure of the system and consolidate it for a thousand ages .
Parsing [sent. 19681 len. 53]: Chapter LXIII -- Steel and Iron George 's Shooting Gallery is to let , and the stock is sold off , and George himself is at Chesney Wold attending on Sir Leicester in his rides and riding very near his bridle-rein because of the uncertain hand with which he guides his horse .
Parsing [sent. 19682 len. 8]: But not to-day is George so occupied .
Parsing [sent. 19683 len. 15]: He is journeying to-day into the iron country farther north to look about him .
Parsing [sent. 19684 len. 55]: As he comes into the iron country farther north , such fresh green woods as those of Chesney Wold are left behind ; and coal pits and ashes , high chimneys and red bricks , blighted verdure , scorching fires , and a heavy never-lightening cloud of smoke become the features of the scenery .
Parsing [sent. 19685 len. 21]: Among such objects rides the trooper , looking about him and always looking for something he has come to find .
Parsing [sent. 19686 len. 61]: At last , on the black canal bridge of a busy town , with a clang of iron in it , and more fires and more smoke than he has seen yet , the trooper , swart with the dust of the coal roads , checks his horse and asks a workman does he know the name of Rouncewell thereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 19687 len. 20]: `` Why , master , '' quoth the workman , `` do I know my own name ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 19688 len. 13]: 'T is so well known here , is it , comrade ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19689 len. 4]: asks the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 19690 len. 4]: `` Rouncewell 's ?
Parsing [sent. 19691 len. 2]: Ah !
Parsing [sent. 19692 len. 5]: You 're right . ''
Parsing [sent. 19693 len. 9]: `` And where might it be now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19694 len. 9]: asks the trooper with a glance before him .
Parsing [sent. 19695 len. 12]: `` The bank , the factory , or the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19696 len. 6]: the workman wants to know .
Parsing [sent. 19697 len. 3]: `` Hum !
Parsing [sent. 19698 len. 31]: Rouncewell 's is so great apparently , '' mutters the trooper , stroking his chin , `` that I have as good as half a mind to go back again .
Parsing [sent. 19699 len. 10]: Why , I do n't know which I want .
Parsing [sent. 19700 len. 14]: Should I find Mr. Rouncewell at the factory , do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19701 len. 42]: `` Tai n't easy to say where you 'd find him -- at this time of the day you might find either him or his son there , if he 's in town ; but his contracts take him away . ''
Parsing [sent. 19702 len. 6]: And which is the factory ?
Parsing [sent. 19703 len. 11]: Why , he sees those chimneys -- the tallest ones !
Parsing [sent. 19704 len. 6]: Yes , he sees THEM .
Parsing [sent. 19705 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19706 len. 46]: Let him keep his eye on those chimneys , going on as straight as ever he can , and presently he 'll see 'em down a turning on the left , shut in by a great brick wall which forms one side of the street .
Parsing [sent. 19707 len. 5]: That 's Rouncewell 's .
Parsing [sent. 19708 len. 14]: The trooper thanks his informant and rides slowly on , looking about him .
Parsing [sent. 19709 len. 39]: He does not turn back , but puts up his horse -LRB- and is much disposed to groom him too -RRB- at a public-house where some of Rouncewell 's hands are dining , as the ostler tells him .
Parsing [sent. 19710 len. 20]: Some of Rouncewell 's hands have just knocked off for dinner-time and seem to be invading the whole town .
Parsing [sent. 19711 len. 17]: They are very sinewy and strong , are Rouncewell 's hands -- a little sooty too .
Parsing [sent. 19712 len. 137]: He comes to a gateway in the brick wall , looks in , and sees a great perplexity of iron lying about in every stage and in a vast variety of shapes -- in bars , in wedges , in sheets ; in tanks , in boilers , in axles , in wheels , in cogs , in cranks , in rails ; twisted and wrenched into eccentric and perverse forms as separate parts of machinery ; mountains of it broken up , and rusty in its age ; distant furnaces of it glowing and bubbling in its youth ; bright fireworks of it showering about under the blows of the steam-hammer ; red-hot iron , white-hot iron , cold-black iron ; an iron taste , an iron smell , and a Babel of iron sounds .
Parsing [sent. 19713 len. 15]: `` This is a place to make a man 's head ache too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19714 len. 11]: says the trooper , looking about him for a counting-house .
Parsing [sent. 19715 len. 5]: `` Who comes here ?
Parsing [sent. 19716 len. 11]: This is very like me before I was set up .
Parsing [sent. 19717 len. 13]: This ought to be my nephew , if likenesses run in families .
Parsing [sent. 19718 len. 6]: Your servant , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 19719 len. 5]: `` Yours , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19720 len. 8]: Are you looking for any one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19721 len. 4]: `` Excuse me .
Parsing [sent. 19722 len. 8]: Young Mr. Rouncewell , I believe ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19723 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 19724 len. 10]: `` I was looking for your father , sir .
Parsing [sent. 19725 len. 10]: I wish to have a word with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 19726 len. 35]: The young man , telling him he is fortunate in his choice of a time , for his father is there , leads the way to the office where he is to be found .
Parsing [sent. 19727 len. 15]: `` Very like me before I was set up -- devilish like me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19728 len. 7]: thinks the trooper as he follows .
Parsing [sent. 19729 len. 16]: They come to a building in the yard with an office on an upper floor .
Parsing [sent. 19730 len. 15]: At sight of the gentleman in the office , Mr. George turns very red .
Parsing [sent. 19731 len. 11]: `` What name shall I say to my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19732 len. 5]: asks the young man .
Parsing [sent. 19733 len. 21]: George , full of the idea of iron , in desperation answers `` Steel , '' and is so presented .
Parsing [sent. 19734 len. 36]: He is left alone with the gentleman in the office , who sits at a table with account-books before him and some sheets of paper blotted with hosts of figures and drawings of cunning shapes .
Parsing [sent. 19735 len. 17]: It is a bare office , with bare windows , looking on the iron view below .
Parsing [sent. 19736 len. 27]: Tumbled together on the table are some pieces of iron , purposely broken to be tested at various periods of their service , in various capacities .
Parsing [sent. 19737 len. 34]: There is iron-dust on everything ; and the smoke is seen through the windows rolling heavily out of the tall chimneys to mingle with the smoke from a vaporous Babylon of other chimneys .
Parsing [sent. 19738 len. 23]: `` I am at your service , Mr. Steel , '' says the gentleman when his visitor has taken a rusty chair .
Parsing [sent. 19739 len. 58]: `` Well , Mr. Rouncewell , '' George replies , leaning forward with his left arm on his knee and his hat in his hand , and very chary of meeting his brother 's eye , `` I am not without my expectations that in the present visit I may prove to be more free than welcome .
Parsing [sent. 19740 len. 36]: I have served as a dragoon in my day , and a comrade of mine that I was once rather partial to was , if I do n't deceive myself , a brother of yours .
Parsing [sent. 19741 len. 28]: I believe you had a brother who gave his family some trouble , and ran away , and never did any good but in keeping away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19742 len. 23]: `` Are you quite sure , '' returns the ironmaster in an altered voice , `` that your name is Steel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19743 len. 8]: The trooper falters and looks at him .
Parsing [sent. 19744 len. 18]: His brother starts up , calls him by his name , and grasps him by both hands .
Parsing [sent. 19745 len. 9]: `` You are too quick for me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19746 len. 12]: cries the trooper with the tears springing out of his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19747 len. 11]: `` How do you do , my dear old fellow ?
Parsing [sent. 19748 len. 19]: I never could have thought you would have been half so glad to see me as all this .
Parsing [sent. 19749 len. 16]: How do you do , my dear old fellow , how do you do ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19750 len. 29]: They shake hands and embrace each other over and over again , the trooper still coupling his `` How do you do , my dear old fellow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19751 len. 22]: with his protestation that he never thought his brother would have been half so glad to see him as all this !
Parsing [sent. 19752 len. 35]: `` So far from it , '' he declares at the end of a full account of what has preceded his arrival there , `` I had very little idea of making myself known .
Parsing [sent. 19753 len. 26]: I thought if you took by any means forgivingly to my name I might gradually get myself up to the point of writing a letter .
Parsing [sent. 19754 len. 25]: But I should not have been surprised , brother , if you had considered it anything but welcome news to hear of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 19755 len. 22]: `` We will show you at home what kind of news we think it , George , '' returns his brother .
Parsing [sent. 19756 len. 25]: `` This is a great day at home , and you could not have arrived , you bronzed old soldier , on a better .
Parsing [sent. 19757 len. 33]: I make an agreement with my son Watt to-day that on this day twelvemonth he shall marry as pretty and as good a girl as you have seen in all your travels .
Parsing [sent. 19758 len. 19]: She goes to Germany to-morrow with one of your nieces for a little polishing up in her education .
Parsing [sent. 19759 len. 19]: We make a feast of the event , and you will be made the hero of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 19760 len. 21]: Mr. George is so entirely overcome at first by this prospect that he resists the proposed honour with great earnestness .
Parsing [sent. 19761 len. 84]: Being overborne , however , by his brother and his nephew -- concerning whom he renews his protestations that he never could have thought they would have been half so glad to see him -- he is taken home to an elegant house in all the arrangements of which there is to be observed a pleasant mixture of the originally simple habits of the father and mother with such as are suited to their altered station and the higher fortunes of their children .
Parsing [sent. 19762 len. 49]: Here Mr. George is much dismayed by the graces and accomplishments of his nieces that are and by the beauty of Rosa , his niece that is to be , and by the affectionate salutations of these young ladies , which he receives in a sort of dream .
Parsing [sent. 19763 len. 27]: He is sorely taken aback , too , by the dutiful behaviour of his nephew and has a woeful consciousness upon him of being a scapegrace .
Parsing [sent. 19764 len. 46]: However , there is great rejoicing and a very hearty company and infinite enjoyment , and Mr. George comes bluff and martial through it all , and his pledge to be present at the marriage and give away the bride is received with universal favour .
Parsing [sent. 19765 len. 55]: A whirling head has Mr. George that night when he lies down in the state-bed of his brother 's house to think of all these things and to see the images of his nieces -LRB- awful all the evening in their floating muslins -RRB- waltzing , after the German manner , over his counterpane .
Parsing [sent. 19766 len. 48]: The brothers are closeted next morning in the ironmaster 's room , where the elder is proceeding , in his clear sensible way , to show how he thinks he may best dispose of George in his business , when George squeezes his hand and stops him .
Parsing [sent. 19767 len. 30]: `` Brother , I thank you a million times for your more than brotherly welcome , and a million times more to that for your more than brotherly intentions .
Parsing [sent. 19768 len. 6]: But my plans are made .
Parsing [sent. 19769 len. 19]: Before I say a word as to them , I wish to consult you upon one family point .
Parsing [sent. 19770 len. 32]: How , '' says the trooper , folding his arms and looking with indomitable firmness at his brother , `` how is my mother to be got to scratch me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19771 len. 17]: `` I am not sure that I understand you , George , '' replies the ironmaster .
Parsing [sent. 19772 len. 17]: `` I say , brother , how is my mother to be got to scratch me ?
Parsing [sent. 19773 len. 10]: She must be got to do it somehow . ''
Parsing [sent. 19774 len. 14]: `` Scratch you out of her will , I think you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19775 len. 6]: `` Of course I do .
Parsing [sent. 19776 len. 25]: In short , '' says the trooper , folding his arms more resolutely yet , `` I mean -- TO -- scratch me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19777 len. 23]: `` My dear George , '' returns his brother , `` is it so indispensable that you should undergo that process ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19778 len. 3]: `` Quite !
Parsing [sent. 19779 len. 2]: Absolutely !
Parsing [sent. 19780 len. 14]: I could n't be guilty of the meanness of coming back without it .
Parsing [sent. 19781 len. 11]: I should never be safe not to be off again .
Parsing [sent. 19782 len. 20]: I have not sneaked home to rob your children , if not yourself , brother , of your rights .
Parsing [sent. 19783 len. 8]: I , who forfeited mine long ago !
Parsing [sent. 19784 len. 16]: If I am to remain and hold up my head , I must be scratched .
Parsing [sent. 19785 len. 2]: Come .
Parsing [sent. 19786 len. 24]: You are a man of celebrated penetration and intelligence , and you can tell me how it 's to be brought about . ''
Parsing [sent. 19787 len. 34]: `` I can tell you , George , '' replies the ironmaster deliberately , `` how it is not to be brought about , which I hope may answer the purpose as well .
Parsing [sent. 19788 len. 17]: Look at our mother , think of her , recall her emotion when she recovered you .
Parsing [sent. 19789 len. 24]: Do you believe there is a consideration in the world that would induce her to take such a step against her favourite son ?
Parsing [sent. 19790 len. 28]: Do you believe there is any chance of her consent , to balance against the outrage it would be to her -LRB- loving dear old lady ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 19791 len. 4]: to propose it ?
Parsing [sent. 19792 len. 8]: If you do , you are wrong .
Parsing [sent. 19793 len. 4]: No , George !
Parsing [sent. 19794 len. 14]: You must make up your mind to remain UNscratched , I think . ''
Parsing [sent. 19795 len. 23]: There is an amused smile on the ironmaster 's face as he watches his brother , who is pondering , deeply disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 19796 len. 19]: `` I think you may manage almost as well as if the thing were done , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 19797 len. 6]: `` How , brother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19798 len. 29]: `` Being bent upon it , you can dispose by will of anything you have the misfortune to inherit in any way you like , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 19799 len. 6]: `` That 's true ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19800 len. 7]: says the trooper , pondering again .
Parsing [sent. 19801 len. 29]: Then he wistfully asks , with his hand on his brother 's , `` Would you mind mentioning that , brother , to your wife and family ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19802 len. 6]: `` Not at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 19803 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 19804 len. 32]: You would n't object to say , perhaps , that although an undoubted vagabond , I am a vagabond of the harum-scarum order , and not of the mean sort ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19805 len. 10]: The ironmaster , repressing his amused smile , assents .
Parsing [sent. 19806 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 19807 len. 3]: Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 19808 len. 45]: It 's a weight off my mind , '' says the trooper with a heave of his chest as he unfolds his arms and puts a hand on each leg , `` though I had set my heart on being scratched , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19809 len. 36]: The brothers are very like each other , sitting face to face ; but a certain massive simplicity and absence of usage in the ways of the world is all on the trooper 's side .
Parsing [sent. 19810 len. 22]: `` Well , '' he proceeds , throwing off his disappointment , `` next and last , those plans of mine .
Parsing [sent. 19811 len. 27]: You have been so brotherly as to propose to me to fall in here and take my place among the products of your perseverance and sense .
Parsing [sent. 19812 len. 5]: I thank you heartily .
Parsing [sent. 19813 len. 29]: It 's more than brotherly , as I said before , and I thank you heartily for it , '' shaking him a long time by the hand .
Parsing [sent. 19814 len. 34]: `` But the truth is , brother , I am a -- I am a kind of a weed , and it 's too late to plant me in a regular garden . ''
Parsing [sent. 19815 len. 33]: `` My dear George , '' returns the elder , concentrating his strong steady brow upon him and smiling confidently , `` leave that to me , and let me try . ''
Parsing [sent. 19816 len. 5]: George shakes his head .
Parsing [sent. 19817 len. 24]: `` You could do it , I have not a doubt , if anybody could ; but it 's not to be done .
Parsing [sent. 19818 len. 7]: Not to be done , sir !
Parsing [sent. 19819 len. 55]: Whereas it so falls out , on the other hand , that I am able to be of some trifle of use to Sir Leicester Dedlock since his illness -- brought on by family sorrows -- and that he would rather have that help from our mother 's son than from anybody else . ''
Parsing [sent. 19820 len. 64]: `` Well , my dear George , '' returns the other with a very slight shade upon his open face , `` if you prefer to serve in Sir Leicester Dedlock 's household brigade -- '' `` There it is , brother , '' cries the trooper , checking him , with his hand upon his knee again ; `` there it is !
Parsing [sent. 19821 len. 15]: You do n't take kindly to that idea ; I do n't mind it .
Parsing [sent. 19822 len. 11]: You are not used to being officered ; I am .
Parsing [sent. 19823 len. 19]: Everything about you is in perfect order and discipline ; everything about me requires to be kept so .
Parsing [sent. 19824 len. 21]: We are not accustomed to carry things with the same hand or to look at 'em from the same point .
Parsing [sent. 19825 len. 37]: I do n't say much about my garrison manners because I found myself pretty well at my ease last night , and they would n't be noticed here , I dare say , once and away .
Parsing [sent. 19826 len. 34]: But I shall get on best at Chesney Wold , where there 's more room for a weed than there is here ; and the dear old lady will be made happy besides .
Parsing [sent. 19827 len. 10]: Therefore I accept of Sir Leicester Dedlock 's proposals .
Parsing [sent. 19828 len. 38]: When I come over next year to give away the bride , or whenever I come , I shall have the sense to keep the household brigade in ambuscade and not to manoeuvre it on your ground .
Parsing [sent. 19829 len. 22]: I thank you heartily again and am proud to think of the Rouncewells as they 'll be founded by you . ''
Parsing [sent. 19830 len. 32]: `` You know yourself , George , '' says the elder brother , returning the grip of his hand , `` and perhaps you know me better than I know myself .
Parsing [sent. 19831 len. 4]: Take your way .
Parsing [sent. 19832 len. 16]: So that we do n't quite lose one another again , take your way . ''
Parsing [sent. 19833 len. 7]: `` No fear of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19834 len. 4]: returns the trooper .
Parsing [sent. 19835 len. 34]: `` Now , before I turn my horse 's head homewards , brother , I will ask you -- if you 'll be so good -- to look over a letter for me .
Parsing [sent. 19836 len. 29]: I brought it with me to send from these parts , as Chesney Wold might be a painful name just now to the person it 's written to .
Parsing [sent. 19837 len. 29]: I am not much accustomed to correspondence myself , and I am particular respecting this present letter because I want it to be both straightforward and delicate . ''
Parsing [sent. 19838 len. 102]: Herewith he hands a letter , closely written in somewhat pale ink but in a neat round hand , to the ironmaster , who reads as follows : Miss Esther Summerson , A communication having been made to me by Inspector Bucket of a letter to myself being found among the papers of a certain person , I take the liberty to make known to you that it was but a few lines of instruction from abroad , when , where , and how to deliver an enclosed letter to a young and beautiful lady , then unmarried , in England .
Parsing [sent. 19839 len. 6]: I duly observed the same .
Parsing [sent. 19840 len. 52]: I further take the liberty to make known to you that it was got from me as a proof of handwriting only and that otherwise I would not have given it up , as appearing to be the most harmless in my possession , without being previously shot through the heart .
Parsing [sent. 19841 len. 56]: I further take the liberty to mention that if I could have supposed a certain unfortunate gentleman to have been in existence , I never could and never would have rested until I had discovered his retreat and shared my last farthing with him , as my duty and my inclination would have equally been .
Parsing [sent. 19842 len. 59]: But he was -LRB- officially -RRB- reported drowned , and assuredly went over the side of a transport-ship at night in an Irish harbour within a few hours of her arrival from the West Indies , as I have myself heard both from officers and men on board , and know to have been -LRB- officially -RRB- confirmed .
Parsing [sent. 19843 len. 56]: I further take the liberty to state that in my humble quality as one of the rank and file , I am , and shall ever continue to be , your thoroughly devoted and admiring servant and that I esteem the qualities you possess above all others far beyond the limits of the present dispatch .
Parsing [sent. 19844 len. 26]: I have the honour to be , GEORGE `` A little formal , '' observes the elder brother , refolding it with a puzzled face .
Parsing [sent. 19845 len. 15]: `` But nothing that might not be sent to a pattern young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19846 len. 4]: asks the younger .
Parsing [sent. 19847 len. 6]: `` Nothing at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 19848 len. 16]: Therefore it is sealed and deposited for posting among the iron correspondence of the day .
Parsing [sent. 19849 len. 20]: This done , Mr. George takes a hearty farewell of the family party and prepares to saddle and mount .
Parsing [sent. 19850 len. 60]: His brother , however , unwilling to part with him so soon , proposes to ride with him in a light open carriage to the place where he will bait for the night , and there remain with him until morning , a servant riding for so much of the journey on the thoroughbred old grey from Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 19851 len. 28]: The offer , being gladly accepted , is followed by a pleasant ride , a pleasant dinner , and a pleasant breakfast , all in brotherly communion .
Parsing [sent. 19852 len. 31]: Then they once more shake hands long and heartily and part , the ironmaster turning his face to the smoke and fires , and the trooper to the green country .
Parsing [sent. 19853 len. 36]: Early in the afternoon the subdued sound of his heavy military trot is heard on the turf in the avenue as he rides on with imaginary clank and jingle of accoutrements under the old elm-trees .
Parsing [sent. 19854 len. 40]: Chapter LXIV -- Esther 's Narrative Soon after I had that convertion with my guardian , he put a sealed paper in my hand one morning and said , `` This is for next month , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 19855 len. 8]: I found in it two hundred pounds .
Parsing [sent. 19856 len. 15]: I now began very quietly to make such preparations as I thought were necessary .
Parsing [sent. 19857 len. 32]: Regulating my purchases by my guardian 's taste , which I knew very well of course , I arranged my wardrobe to please him and hoped I should be highly successful .
Parsing [sent. 19858 len. 31]: I did it all so quietly because I was not quite free from my old apprehension that Ada would be rather sorry and because my guardian was so quiet himself .
Parsing [sent. 19859 len. 21]: I had no doubt that under all the circumstances we should be married in the most private and simple manner .
Parsing [sent. 19860 len. 26]: Perhaps I should only have to say to Ada , `` Would you like to come and see me married to-morrow , my pet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19861 len. 29]: Perhaps our wedding might even be as unpretending as her own , and I might not find it necessary to say anything about it until it was over .
Parsing [sent. 19862 len. 15]: I thought that if I were to choose , I would like this best .
Parsing [sent. 19863 len. 9]: The only exception I made was Mrs. Woodcourt .
Parsing [sent. 19864 len. 22]: I told her that I was going to be married to my guardian and that we had been engaged some time .
Parsing [sent. 19865 len. 4]: She highly approved .
Parsing [sent. 19866 len. 25]: She could never do enough for me and was remarkably softened now in comparison with what she had been when we first knew her .
Parsing [sent. 19867 len. 39]: There was no trouble she would not have taken to have been of use to me , but I need hardly say that I only allowed her to take as little as gratified her kindness without tasking it .
Parsing [sent. 19868 len. 25]: Of course this was not a time to neglect my guardian , and of course it was not a time for neglecting my darling .
Parsing [sent. 19869 len. 28]: So I had plenty of occupation , which I was glad of ; and as to Charley , she was absolutely not to be seen for needlework .
Parsing [sent. 19870 len. 59]: To surround herself with great heaps of it -- baskets full and tables full -- and do a little , and spend a great deal of time in staring with her round eyes at what there was to do , and persuade herself that she was going to do it , were Charley 's great dignities and delights .
Parsing [sent. 19871 len. 31]: Meanwhile , I must say , I could not agree with my guardian on the subject of the will , and I had some sanguine hopes of Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 19872 len. 16]: Which of us was right will soon appear , but I certainly did encourage expectations .
Parsing [sent. 19873 len. 44]: In Richard , the discovery gave occasion for a burst of business and agitation that buoyed him up for a little time , but he had lost the elasticity even of hope now and seemed to me to retain only its feverish anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 19874 len. 65]: From something my guardian said one day when we were talking about this , I understood that my marriage would not take place until after the term-time we had been told to look forward to ; and I thought the more , for that , how rejoiced I should be if I could be married when Richard and Ada were a little more prosperous .
Parsing [sent. 19875 len. 25]: The term was very near indeed when my guardian was called out of town and went down into Yorkshire on Mr. Woodcourt 's business .
Parsing [sent. 19876 len. 13]: He had told me beforehand that his presence there would be necessary .
Parsing [sent. 19877 len. 44]: I had just come in one night from my dear girl 's and was sitting in the midst of all my new clothes , looking at them all around me and thinking , when a letter from my guardian was brought to me .
Parsing [sent. 19878 len. 32]: It asked me to join him in the country and mentioned by what stage-coach my place was taken and at what time in the morning I should have to leave town .
Parsing [sent. 19879 len. 15]: It added in a postscript that I would not be many hours from Ada .
Parsing [sent. 19880 len. 31]: I expected few things less than a journey at that tinae , but I was ready for it in half an hour and set off as appointed early next morning .
Parsing [sent. 19881 len. 52]: I travelled all day , wondering all day what I could be wanted for at such a distance ; now I thought it might be for this purpose , and now I thought it might be for that purpose , but I was never , never , never near the truth .
Parsing [sent. 19882 len. 19]: It was night when I came to my journey 's end and found my guardian waiting for me .
Parsing [sent. 19883 len. 33]: This was a great relief , for towards evening I had begun to fear -LRB- the more so as his letter was a very short one -RRB- that he might be ill .
Parsing [sent. 19884 len. 43]: However , there he was , as well as it was possible to be ; and when I saw his genial face again at its brightest and best , I said to myself , he has been doing some other great kindness .
Parsing [sent. 19885 len. 25]: Not that it required much penetration to say that , because I knew that his being there at all was an act of kindness .
Parsing [sent. 19886 len. 38]: Supper was ready at the hotel , and when we were alone at table he said , `` Full of curiosity , no doubt , little woman , to know why I have brought you here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19887 len. 30]: `` Well , guardian , '' said I , `` without thinking myself a Fatima or you a Blue Beard , I am a little curious about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 19888 len. 28]: `` Then to ensure your night 's rest , my love , '' he returned gaily , `` I wo n't wait until to-morrow to tell you .
Parsing [sent. 19889 len. 37]: I have very much wished to express to Woodcourt , somehow , my sense of his humanity to poor unfortunate Jo , his inestimable services to my young cousins , and his value to us all .
Parsing [sent. 19890 len. 35]: When it was decided that he should settle here , it came into my head that I might ask his acceptance of some unpretending and suitable little place to lay his own head in .
Parsing [sent. 19891 len. 37]: I therefore caused such a place to be looked out for , and such a place was found on very easy terms , and I have been touching it up for him and making it habitable .
Parsing [sent. 19892 len. 37]: However , when I walked over it the day before yesterday and it was reported ready , I found that I was not housekeeper enough to know whether things were all as they ought to be .
Parsing [sent. 19893 len. 24]: So I sent off for the best little housekeeper that could possibly be got to come and give me her advice and opinion .
Parsing [sent. 19894 len. 18]: And here she is , '' said my guardian , `` laughing and crying both together ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19895 len. 12]: Because he was so dear , so good , so admirable .
Parsing [sent. 19896 len. 19]: I tried to tell him what I thought of him , but I could not articulate a word .
Parsing [sent. 19897 len. 6]: `` Tut , tut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19898 len. 4]: said my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 19899 len. 11]: `` You make too much of it , little woman .
Parsing [sent. 19900 len. 14]: Why , how you sob , Dame Durden , how you sob ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19901 len. 17]: `` It is with exquisite pleasure , guardian -- with a heart full of thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 19902 len. 9]: `` Well , well , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 19903 len. 8]: `` I am delighted that you approve .
Parsing [sent. 19904 len. 5]: I thought you would .
Parsing [sent. 19905 len. 16]: I meant it as a pleasant surprise for the little mistress of Bleak House . ''
Parsing [sent. 19906 len. 8]: I kissed him and dried my eyes .
Parsing [sent. 19907 len. 6]: `` I know now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19908 len. 15]: said I. `` I have seen this in your face a long while . ''
Parsing [sent. 19909 len. 11]: `` No ; have you really , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19910 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 19911 len. 13]: `` What a Dame Durden it is to read a face ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19912 len. 24]: He was so quaintly cheerful that I could not long be otherwise , and was almost ashamed of having been otherwise at all .
Parsing [sent. 19913 len. 9]: When I went to bed , I cried .
Parsing [sent. 19914 len. 28]: I am bound to confess that I cried ; but I hope it was with pleasure , though I am not quite sure it was with pleasure .
Parsing [sent. 19915 len. 10]: I repeated every word of the letter twice over .
Parsing [sent. 19916 len. 31]: A most beautiful summer morning succeeded , and after breakfast we went out arm in arm to see the house of which I was to give my mighty housekeeping opinion .
Parsing [sent. 19917 len. 47]: We entered a flower-garden by a gate in a side wall , of which he had the key , and the first thing I saw was that the beds and flowers were all laid out according to the manner of my beds and flowers at home .
Parsing [sent. 19918 len. 37]: `` You see , my dear , '' observed my guardian , standing still with a delighted face to watch my looks , `` knowing there could be no better plan , I borrowed yours . ''
Parsing [sent. 19919 len. 127]: We went on by a pretty little orchard , where the cherries were nestling among the green leaves and the shadows of the apple-trees were sporting on the grass , to the house itself -- a cottage , quite a rustic cottage of doll 's rooms ; but such a lovely place , so tranquil and so beautiful , with such a rich and smiling country spread around it ; with water sparkling away into the distance , here all overhung with summer-growth , there turning a humming mill ; at its nearest point glancing through a meadow by the cheerful town , where cricket-players were assembling in bright groups and a flag was flying from a white tent that rippled in the sweet west wind .
Parsing [sent. 19920 len. 86]: And still , as we went through the pretty rooms , out at the little rustic verandah doors , and underneath the tiny wooden colonnades garlanded with woodbine , jasmine , and honey-suckle , I saw in the papering on the walls , in the colours of the furniture , in the arrangement of all the pretty objects , MY little tastes and fancies , MY little methods and inventions which they used to laugh at while they praised them , my odd ways everywhere .
Parsing [sent. 19921 len. 40]: I could not say enough in admiration of what was all so beautiful , but one secret doubt arose in my mind when I saw this , I thought , oh , would he be the happier for it !
Parsing [sent. 19922 len. 20]: Would it not have been better for his peace that I should not have been so brought before him ?
Parsing [sent. 19923 len. 31]: Because although I was not what he thought me , still he loved me very dearly , and it might remind him mournfully of what be believed he had lost .
Parsing [sent. 19924 len. 51]: I did not wish him to forget me -- perhaps he might not have done so , without these aids to his memory -- but my way was easier than his , and I could have reconciled myself even to that so that he had been the happier for it .
Parsing [sent. 19925 len. 49]: `` And now , little woman , '' said my guardian , whom I had never seen so proud and joyful as in showing me these things and watching my appreciation of them , `` now , last of all , for the name of this house . ''
Parsing [sent. 19926 len. 10]: `` What is it called , dear guardian ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19927 len. 49]: `` My child , '' said he , `` come and see , '' He took me to the porch , which he had hitherto avoided , and said , pausing before we went out , `` My dear child , do n't you guess the name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19928 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19929 len. 3]: said I .
Parsing [sent. 19930 len. 17]: We went out of the porch and he showed me written over it , Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 19931 len. 55]: He led me to a seat among the leaves close by , and sitting down beside me and taking my hand in his , spoke to me thus , `` My darling girl , in what there has been between us , I have , I hope , been really solicitous for your happiness .
Parsing [sent. 19932 len. 37]: When I wrote you the letter to which you brought the answer , '' smiling as he referred to it , `` I had my own too much in view ; but I had yours too .
Parsing [sent. 19933 len. 37]: Whether , under different circumstances , I might ever have renewed the old dream I sometimes dreamed when you were very young , of making you my wife one day , I need not ask myself .
Parsing [sent. 19934 len. 17]: I did renew it , and I wrote my letter , and you brought your answer .
Parsing [sent. 19935 len. 11]: You are following what I say , my child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19936 len. 18]: I was cold , and I trembled violently , but not a word he uttered was lost .
Parsing [sent. 19937 len. 41]: As I sat looking fixedly at him and the sun 's rays descended , softly shining through the leaves upon his bare head , I felt as if the brightness on him must be like the brightness of the angels .
Parsing [sent. 19938 len. 12]: `` Hear me , my love , but do not speak .
Parsing [sent. 19939 len. 8]: It is for me to speak now .
Parsing [sent. 19940 len. 22]: When it was that I began to doubt whether what I had done would really make you happy is no matter .
Parsing [sent. 19941 len. 14]: Woodcourt came home , and I soon had no doubt at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 19942 len. 16]: I clasped him round the neck and hung my bead upon his breast and wept .
Parsing [sent. 19943 len. 20]: `` Lie lightly , confidently here , my child , '' said he , pressing me gently to him .
Parsing [sent. 19944 len. 10]: `` I am your guardian and your father now .
Parsing [sent. 19945 len. 5]: Rest confidently here . ''
Parsing [sent. 19946 len. 31]: Soothingly , like the gentle rustling of the leaves ; and genially , like the ripening weather ; and radiantly and beneficently , like the sunshine , he went on .
Parsing [sent. 19947 len. 8]: `` Understand me , my dear girl .
Parsing [sent. 19948 len. 30]: I had no doubt of your being contented and happy with me , being so dutiful and so devoted ; but I saw with whom you would be happier .
Parsing [sent. 19949 len. 33]: That I penetrated his secret when Dame Durden was blind to it is no wonder , for I knew the good that could never change in her better far than she did .
Parsing [sent. 19950 len. 2]: Well !
Parsing [sent. 19951 len. 29]: I have long been in Allan Woodcourt 's confidence , although he was not , until yesterday , a few hours before you came here , in mine .
Parsing [sent. 19952 len. 61]: But I would not have my Esther 's bright example lost ; I would not have a jot of my dear girl 's virtues unobserved and unhonoured ; I would not have her admitted on sufferance into the line of Morgan ap -- Kerrig , no , not for the weight in gold of all the mountains in Wales ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19953 len. 16]: He stopped to kiss me on the forehead , and I sobbed and wept afresh .
Parsing [sent. 19954 len. 16]: For I felt as if I could not bear the painful delight of his praise .
Parsing [sent. 19955 len. 6]: `` Hush , little woman !
Parsing [sent. 19956 len. 13]: Do n't cry ; this is to be a day of joy .
Parsing [sent. 19957 len. 18]: I have looked forward to it , '' he said exultingly , `` for months on months !
Parsing [sent. 19958 len. 15]: A few words more , Dame Trot , and I have said my say .
Parsing [sent. 19959 len. 22]: Determined not to throw away one atom of my Esther 's worth , I took Mrs. Woodcourt into a separate confidence .
Parsing [sent. 19960 len. 29]: ` Now , madam , ' said I , ' I clearly perceive -- and indeed I know , to boot -- that your son loves my ward .
Parsing [sent. 19961 len. 53]: I am further very sure that my ward loves your son , but will sacrifice her love to a sense of duty and affection , and will sacrifice it so completely , so entirely , so religiously , that you should never suspect it though you watched her night and day . '
Parsing [sent. 19962 len. 14]: Then I told her all our story -- ours -- yours and mine .
Parsing [sent. 19963 len. 21]: ` Now , madam , ' said I , ` come you , knowing this , and live with us .
Parsing [sent. 19964 len. 58]: Come you , and see my child from hour to hour ; set what you see against her pedigree , which is this , and this ' -- for I scorned to mince it -- ` and tell me what is the true legitimacy when you shall have quite made up your mind on that subject . '
Parsing [sent. 19965 len. 47]: Why , honour to her old Welsh blood , my dear , '' cried my guardian with enthusiasm , `` I believe the heart it animates beats no less warmly , no less admiringly , no less lovingly , towards Dame Durden than my own ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19966 len. 24]: He tenderly raised my head , and as I clung to him , kissed me in his old fatherly way again and again .
Parsing [sent. 19967 len. 15]: What a light , now , on the protecting manner I had thought about !
Parsing [sent. 19968 len. 6]: `` One more last word .
Parsing [sent. 19969 len. 49]: When Allan Woodcourt spoke to you , my dear , he spoke with my knowledge and consent -- but I gave him no encouragement , not I , for these surprises were my great reward , and I was too miserly to part with a scrap of it .
Parsing [sent. 19970 len. 15]: He was to come and tell me all that passed , and he did .
Parsing [sent. 19971 len. 7]: I have no more to say .
Parsing [sent. 19972 len. 19]: My dearest , Allan Woodcourt stood beside your father when he lay dead -- stood beside your mother .
Parsing [sent. 19973 len. 5]: This is Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 19974 len. 25]: This day I give this house its little mistress ; and before God , it is the brightest day in all my life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19975 len. 8]: He rose and raised me with him .
Parsing [sent. 19976 len. 6]: We were no longer alone .
Parsing [sent. 19977 len. 21]: My husband -- I have called him by that name full seven happy years now -- stood at my side .
Parsing [sent. 19978 len. 24]: `` Allan , '' said my guardian , `` take from me a willing gift , the best wife that ever man had .
Parsing [sent. 19979 len. 15]: What more can I say for you than that I know you deserve her !
Parsing [sent. 19980 len. 10]: Take with her the little home she brings you .
Parsing [sent. 19981 len. 19]: You know what she will make it , Allan ; you know what she has made its namesake .
Parsing [sent. 19982 len. 13]: Let me share its felicity sometimes , and what do I sacrifice ?
Parsing [sent. 19983 len. 5]: Nothing , nothing . ''
Parsing [sent. 19984 len. 41]: He kissed me once again , and now the tears were in his eyes as he said more softly , `` Esther , my dearest , after so many years , there is a kind of parting in this too .
Parsing [sent. 19985 len. 11]: I know that my mistake has caused you some distress .
Parsing [sent. 19986 len. 24]: Forgive your old guardian , in restoring him to his old place in your affections ; and blot it out of your memory .
Parsing [sent. 19987 len. 7]: Allan , take my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 19988 len. 34]: He moved away from under the green roof of leaves , and stopping in the sunlight outside and turning cheerfully towards us , said , `` I shall be found about here somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 19989 len. 12]: It 's a west wind , little woman , due west !
Parsing [sent. 19990 len. 36]: Let no one thank me any more , for I am going to revert to my bachelor habits , and if anybody disregards this warning , I 'll run away and never come back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 19991 len. 22]: What happiness was ours that day , what joy , what rest , what hope , what gratitude , what bliss !
Parsing [sent. 19992 len. 32]: We were to be married before the month was out , but when we were to come and take possession of our own house was to depend on Richard and Ada .
Parsing [sent. 19993 len. 9]: We all three went home together next day .
Parsing [sent. 19994 len. 26]: As soon as we arrived in town , Allan went straight to see Richard and to carry our joyful news to him and my darling .
Parsing [sent. 19995 len. 59]: Late as it was , I meant to go to her for a few minutes before lying down to sleep , but I went home with my guardian first to make his tea for him and to occupy the old chair by his side , for I did not like to think of its being empty so soon .
Parsing [sent. 19996 len. 60]: When we came home we found that a young man had called three times in the course of that one day to see me and that having been told on the occasion of his third call that I was not expected to return before ten o'clock at night , he had left word that he would call about then .
Parsing [sent. 19997 len. 8]: He had left his card three times .
Parsing [sent. 19998 len. 3]: Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 19999 len. 44]: As I naturally speculated on the object of these visits , and as I always associated something ludicrous with the visitor , it fell out that in laughing about Mr. Guppy I told my guardian of his old proposal and his subsequent retraction .
Parsing [sent. 20000 len. 18]: `` After that , '' said my guardian , `` we will certainly receive this hero . ''
Parsing [sent. 20001 len. 27]: So instructions were given that Mr. Guppy should be shown in when he came again , and they were scarcely given when he did come again .
Parsing [sent. 20002 len. 25]: He was embarrassed when he found my guardian with me , but recovered himself and said , `` How de do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20003 len. 9]: `` How do you do , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20004 len. 4]: returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20005 len. 15]: `` Thank you , sir , I am tolerable , '' returned Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 20006 len. 26]: `` Will you allow me to introduce my mother , Mrs. Guppy of the Old Street Road , and my particular friend , Mr. Weevle .
Parsing [sent. 20007 len. 25]: That is to say , my friend has gone by the name of Weevle , but his name is really and truly Jobling . ''
Parsing [sent. 20008 len. 14]: My guardian begged them to be seated , and they all sat down .
Parsing [sent. 20009 len. 15]: `` Tony , '' said Mr. Guppy to his friend after an awkward silence .
Parsing [sent. 20010 len. 8]: `` Will you open the case ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20011 len. 12]: `` Do it yourself , '' returned the friend rather tartly .
Parsing [sent. 20012 len. 71]: `` Well , Mr. Jarndyce , sir , '' Mr. Guppy , after a moment 's consideration , began , to the great diversion of his mother , which she displayed by nudging Mr. Jobling with her elbow and winking at me in a most remarkable manner , `` I had an idea that I should see Miss Summerson by herself and was not quite prepared for your esteemed presence .
Parsing [sent. 20013 len. 21]: But Miss Summerson has mentioned to you , perhaps , that something has passed between us on former occasions ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20014 len. 23]: `` Miss Summerson , '' returned my guardian , smiling , `` has made a communication to that effect to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 20015 len. 13]: `` That , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` makes matters easier .
Parsing [sent. 20016 len. 24]: Sir , I have come out of my articles at Kenge and Carboy 's , and I believe with satisfaction to all parties .
Parsing [sent. 20017 len. 56]: I am now admitted -LRB- after undergoing an examination that 's enough to badger a man blue , touching a pack of nonsense that he do n't want to know -RRB- on the roll of attorneys and have taken out my certificate , if it would be any satisfaction to you to see it . ''
Parsing [sent. 20018 len. 12]: `` Thank you , Mr. Guppy , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20019 len. 20]: `` I am quite willing -- I believe I use a legal phrase -- to admit the certificate . ''
Parsing [sent. 20020 len. 16]: Mr. Guppy therefore desisted from taking something out of his pocket and proceeded without it .
Parsing [sent. 20021 len. 90]: I have no capital myself , but my mother has a little property which takes the form of an annuity '' -- here Mr. Guppy 's mother rolled her head as if she never could sufficiently enjoy the observation , and put her handkerchief to her mouth , and again winked at me -- `` and a few pounds for expenses out of pocket in conducting business will never be wanting , free of interest , which is an advantage , you know , '' said Mr. Guppy feelingly .
Parsing [sent. 20022 len. 10]: `` Certainly an advantage , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20023 len. 24]: `` I HAVE some connexion , '' pursued Mr. Guppy , `` and it lays in the direction of Walcot Square , Lambeth .
Parsing [sent. 20024 len. 49]: I have therefore taken a ` ouse in that locality , which , in the opinion of my friends , is a hollow bargain -LRB- taxes ridiculous , and use of fixtures included in the rent -RRB- , and intend setting up professionally for myself there forthwith . ''
Parsing [sent. 20025 len. 25]: Here Mr. Guppy 's mother fell into an extraordinary passion of rolling her head and smiling waggishly at anybody who would look at her .
Parsing [sent. 20026 len. 28]: `` It 's a six-roomer , exclusive of kitchens , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` and in the opinion of my friends , a commodious tenement .
Parsing [sent. 20027 len. 39]: When I mention my friends , I refer principally to my friend Jobling , who I believe has known me , '' Mr. Guppy looked at him with a sentimental air , `` from boyhood 's hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 20028 len. 12]: Mr. Jobling confirmed this with a sliding movement of his legs .
Parsing [sent. 20029 len. 27]: `` My friend Jobling will render me his assistance in the capacity of clerk and will live in the ` ouse , '' said Mr. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 20030 len. 35]: `` My mother will likewise live in the ` ouse when her present quarter in the Old Street Road shall have ceased and expired ; and consequently there will be no want of society .
Parsing [sent. 20031 len. 33]: My friend Jobling is naturally aristocratic by taste , and besides being acquainted with the movements of the upper circles , fully backs me in the intentions I am now developing . ''
Parsing [sent. 20032 len. 19]: Mr. Jobling said `` Certainly '' and withdrew a little from the elbow of Mr Guppy 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 20033 len. 68]: `` Now , I have no occasion to mention to you , sir , you being in the confidence of Miss Summerson , '' said Mr. Guppy , '' -LRB- mother , I wish you 'd be so good as to keep still -RRB- , that Miss Summerson 's image was formerly imprinted on my ` eart and that I made her a proposal of marriage . ''
Parsing [sent. 20034 len. 11]: `` That I have heard , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20035 len. 31]: `` Circumstances , '' pursued Mr. Guppy , `` over which I had no control , but quite the contrary , weakened the impression of that image for a time .
Parsing [sent. 20036 len. 19]: At which time Miss Summerson 's conduct was highly genteel ; I may even add , magnanimous . ''
Parsing [sent. 20037 len. 12]: My guardian patted me on the shoulder and seemed much amused .
Parsing [sent. 20038 len. 30]: `` Now , sir , '' said Mr. Guppy , `` I have got into that state of mind myself that I wish for a reciprocity of magnanimous behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 20039 len. 23]: I wish to prove to Miss Summerson that I can rise to a heighth of which perhaps she hardly thought me capable .
Parsing [sent. 20040 len. 20]: I find that the image which I did suppose had been eradicated from my ` eart is NOT eradicated .
Parsing [sent. 20041 len. 49]: Its influence over me is still tremenjous , and yielding to it , I am willing to overlook the circumstances over which none of us have had any control and to renew those proposals to Miss Summerson which I had the honour to make at a former period .
Parsing [sent. 20042 len. 24]: I beg to lay the ` ouse in Walcot Square , the business , and myself before Miss Summerson for her acceptance . ''
Parsing [sent. 20043 len. 12]: `` Very magnanimous indeed , sir , '' observed my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20044 len. 20]: `` Well , sir , '' replied Mr. Guppy with candour , `` my wish is to BE magnanimous .
Parsing [sent. 20045 len. 30]: I do not consider that in making this offer to Miss Summerson I am by any means throwing myself away ; neither is that the opinion of my friends .
Parsing [sent. 20046 len. 35]: Still , there are circumstances which I submit may be taken into account as a set off against any little drawbacks of mine , and so a fair and equitable balance arrived at . ''
Parsing [sent. 20047 len. 32]: `` I take upon myself , sir , '' said my guardian , laughing as he rang the bell , `` to reply to your proposals on behalf of Miss Summerson .
Parsing [sent. 20048 len. 21]: She is very sensible of your handsome intentions , and wishes you good evening , and wishes you well . ''
Parsing [sent. 20049 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20050 len. 8]: said Mr. Guppy with a blank look .
Parsing [sent. 20051 len. 17]: `` Is that tantamount , sir , to acceptance , or rejection , or consideration ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20052 len. 14]: `` To decided rejection , if you please , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20053 len. 29]: Mr. Guppy looked incredulously at his friend , and at his mother , who suddenly turned very angry , and at the floor , and at the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 20054 len. 4]: `` Indeed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20055 len. 3]: said he .
Parsing [sent. 20056 len. 39]: `` Then , Jobling , if you was the friend you represent yourself , I should think you might hand my mother out of the gangway instead of allowing her to remain where she ai n't wanted . ''
Parsing [sent. 20057 len. 12]: But Mrs. Guppy positively refused to come out of the gangway .
Parsing [sent. 20058 len. 7]: She would n't hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 20059 len. 21]: `` Why , get along with you , '' said she to my guardian , `` what do you mean ?
Parsing [sent. 20060 len. 9]: Ai n't my son good enough for you ?
Parsing [sent. 20061 len. 8]: You ought to be ashamed of yourself .
Parsing [sent. 20062 len. 6]: Get out with you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20063 len. 27]: `` My good lady , '' returned my guardian , `` it is hardly reasonable to ask me to get out of my own room . ''
Parsing [sent. 20064 len. 13]: `` I do n't care for that , '' said Mrs. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 20065 len. 6]: `` Get out with you .
Parsing [sent. 20066 len. 18]: If we ai n't good enough for you , go and procure somebody that is good enough .
Parsing [sent. 20067 len. 7]: Go along and find 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 20068 len. 26]: I was quite unprepared for the rapid manner in which Mrs. Guppy 's power of jocularity merged into a power of taking the profoundest offence .
Parsing [sent. 20069 len. 18]: `` Go along and find somebody that 's good enough for you , '' repeated Mrs. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 20070 len. 5]: `` Get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20071 len. 23]: Nothing seemed to astonish Mr. Guppy 's mother so much and to make her so very indignant as our not getting out .
Parsing [sent. 20072 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you get out ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20073 len. 4]: said Mrs. Guppy .
Parsing [sent. 20074 len. 9]: `` What are you stopping here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20075 len. 34]: `` Mother , '' interposed her son , always getting before her and pushing her back with one shoulder as she sidled at my guardian , `` WILL you hold your tongue ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20076 len. 14]: `` No , William , '' she returned , `` I wo n't !
Parsing [sent. 20077 len. 11]: Not unless he gets out , I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20078 len. 76]: However , Mr. Guppy and Mr. Jobling together closed on Mr. Guppy 's mother -LRB- who began to be quite abusive -RRB- and took her , very much against her will , downstairs , her voice rising a stair higher every time her figure got a stair lower , and insisting that we should immediately go and find somebody who was good enough for us , and above all things that we should get out .
Parsing [sent. 20079 len. 30]: Chapter LXV -- Beginning the World The term had commenced , and my guardian found an intimation from Mr. Kenge that the cause would come on in two days .
Parsing [sent. 20080 len. 29]: As I had sufficient hopes of the will to be in a flutter about it , Allan and I agreed to go down to the court that morning .
Parsing [sent. 20081 len. 32]: Richard was extremely agitated and was so weak and low , though his illness was still of the mind , that my dear girl indeed had sore occasion to be supported .
Parsing [sent. 20082 len. 25]: But she looked forward -- a very little way now -- to the help that was to come to her , and never drooped .
Parsing [sent. 20083 len. 12]: It was at Westminster that the cause was to come on .
Parsing [sent. 20084 len. 33]: It had come on there , I dare say , a hundred times before , but I could not divest myself of an idea that it MIGHT lead to some result now .
Parsing [sent. 20085 len. 30]: We left home directly after breakfast to be at Westminster Hall in good time and walked down there through the lively streets -- so happily and strangely it seemed !
Parsing [sent. 20086 len. 3]: -- together .
Parsing [sent. 20087 len. 23]: As we were going along , planning what we should do for Richard and Ada , I heard somebody calling `` Esther !
Parsing [sent. 20088 len. 4]: My dear Esther !
Parsing [sent. 20089 len. 3]: Esther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20090 len. 49]: And there was Caddy Jellyby , with her head out of the window of a little carriage which she hired now to go about in to her pupils -LRB- she had so many -RRB- , as if she wanted to embrace me at a hundred yards ' distance .
Parsing [sent. 20091 len. 29]: I had written her a note to tell her of all that my guardian had done , but had not had a moment to go and see her .
Parsing [sent. 20092 len. 107]: Of course we turned back , and the affectionate girl was in that state of rapture , and was so overjoyed to talk about the night when she brought me the flowers , and was so determined to squeeze my face -LRB- bonnet and all -RRB- between her hands , and go on in a wild manner altogether , calling me all kinds of precious names , and telling Allan I had done I do n't know what for her , that I was just obliged to get into the little carriage and caln her down by letting her say and do exactly what she liked .
Parsing [sent. 20093 len. 71]: Allan , standing at the window , was as pleased as Caddy ; and I was as pleased as either of them ; and I wonder that I got away as I did , rather than that I came off laughing , and red , and anything but tidy , and looking after Caddy , who looked after us out of the coach-window as long as she could see us .
Parsing [sent. 20094 len. 27]: This made us some quarter of an hour late , and when we came to Westminster Hall we found that the day 's business was begun .
Parsing [sent. 20095 len. 35]: Worse than that , we found such an unusual crowd in the Court of Chancery that it was full to the door , and we could neither see nor hear what was passing within .
Parsing [sent. 20096 len. 21]: It appeared to be something droll , for occasionally there was a laugh and a cry of `` Silence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20097 len. 18]: It appeared to be something interesting , for every one was pushing and striving to get nearer .
Parsing [sent. 20098 len. 67]: It appeared to be something that made the professional gentlemen very merry , for there were several young counsellors in wigs and whiskers on the outside of the crowd , and when one of them told the others about it , they put their hands in their pockets , and quite doubled themselves up with laughter , and went stamping about the pavement of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 20099 len. 14]: We asked a gentleman by us if he knew what cause was on .
Parsing [sent. 20100 len. 7]: He told us Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 20101 len. 12]: We asked him if he knew what was doing in it .
Parsing [sent. 20102 len. 26]: He said really , no he did not , nobody ever did , but as well as he could make out , it was over .
Parsing [sent. 20103 len. 5]: Over for the day ?
Parsing [sent. 20104 len. 4]: we asked him .
Parsing [sent. 20105 len. 9]: No , he said , over for good .
Parsing [sent. 20106 len. 4]: Over for good !
Parsing [sent. 20107 len. 17]: When we heard this unaccountable answer , we looked at one another quite lost in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 20108 len. 24]: Could it be possible that the will had set things right at last and that Richard and Ada were going to be rich ?
Parsing [sent. 20109 len. 8]: It seemed too good to be true .
Parsing [sent. 20110 len. 4]: Alas it was !
Parsing [sent. 20111 len. 35]: Our suspense was short , for a break-up soon took place in the crowd , and the people came streaming out looking flushed and hot and bringing a quantity of bad air with them .
Parsing [sent. 20112 len. 26]: Still they were all exceedingly amused and were more like people coming out from a farce or a juggler than from a court of justice .
Parsing [sent. 20113 len. 78]: We stood aside , watching for any countenance we knew , and presently great bundles of paper began to be carried out -- bundles in bags , bundles too large to be got into any bags , immense masses of papers of all shapes and no shapes , which the bearers staggered under , and threw down for the time being , anyhow , on the Hall pavement , while they went back to bring out more .
Parsing [sent. 20114 len. 6]: Even these clerks were laughing .
Parsing [sent. 20115 len. 31]: We glanced at the papers , and seeing Jarndyce and Jarndyce everywhere , asked an official-looking person who was standing in the midst of them whether the cause was over .
Parsing [sent. 20116 len. 20]: Yes , he said , it was all up with it at last , and burst out laughing too .
Parsing [sent. 20117 len. 32]: At this juncture we perceived Mr. Kenge coming out of court with an affable dignity upon him , listening to Mr. Vholes , who was deferential and carried his own bag .
Parsing [sent. 20118 len. 9]: Mr. Vholes was the first to see us .
Parsing [sent. 20119 len. 12]: `` Here is Miss Summerson , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 20120 len. 6]: `` And Mr. Woodcourt . ''
Parsing [sent. 20121 len. 5]: `` Oh , indeed !
Parsing [sent. 20122 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 20123 len. 3]: Truly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20124 len. 13]: said Mr. Kenge , raising his hat to me with polished politeness .
Parsing [sent. 20125 len. 6]: `` How do you do ?
Parsing [sent. 20126 len. 5]: Glad to see you .
Parsing [sent. 20127 len. 7]: Mr. Jarndyce is not here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20128 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 20129 len. 9]: He never came there , I reminded him .
Parsing [sent. 20130 len. 40]: `` Really , '' returned Mr. Kenge , `` it is as well that he is NOT here to-day , for his -- shall I say , in my good friend 's absence , his indomitable singularity of opinion ?
Parsing [sent. 20131 len. 18]: -- might have been strengthened , perhaps ; not reasonably , but might have been strengthened . ''
Parsing [sent. 20132 len. 9]: `` Pray what has been done to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20133 len. 3]: asked Allan .
Parsing [sent. 20134 len. 7]: `` I beg your pardon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20135 len. 7]: said Mr. Kenge with excessive urbanity .
Parsing [sent. 20136 len. 8]: `` What has been done to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20137 len. 11]: `` What has been done , '' repeated Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 20138 len. 4]: `` Quite so .
Parsing [sent. 20139 len. 2]: Yes .
Parsing [sent. 20140 len. 11]: Why , not much has been done ; not much .
Parsing [sent. 20141 len. 23]: We have been checked -- brought up suddenly , I would say -- upon the -- shall I term it threshold ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20142 len. 12]: `` Is this will considered a genuine document , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20143 len. 3]: said Allan .
Parsing [sent. 20144 len. 8]: `` Will you tell us that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20145 len. 30]: `` Most certainly , if I could , '' said Mr. Kenge ; `` but we have not gone into that , we have not gone into that . ''
Parsing [sent. 20146 len. 22]: `` We have not gone into that , '' repeated Mr. Vholes as if his low inward voice were an echo .
Parsing [sent. 20147 len. 47]: `` You are to reflect , Mr. Woodcourt , '' observed Mr. Kenge , using his silver trowel persuasively and smoothingly , `` that this has been a great cause , that this has been a protracted cause , that this has been a complex cause .
Parsing [sent. 20148 len. 17]: Jarndyce and Jarndyce has been termed , not inaptly , a monument of Chancery practice . ''
Parsing [sent. 20149 len. 15]: `` And patience has sat upon it a long time , '' said Allan .
Parsing [sent. 20150 len. 19]: `` Very well indeed , sir , '' returned Mr. Kenge with a certain condeseending laugh he had .
Parsing [sent. 20151 len. 4]: `` Very well !
Parsing [sent. 20152 len. 57]: You are further to reflect , Mr. Woodcourt , '' becoming dignified almost to severity , `` that on the numerous difficulties , contingencies , masterly fictions , and forms of procedure in this great cause , there has been expended study , ability , eloquence , knowledge , intellect , Mr. Woodcourt , high intellect .
Parsing [sent. 20153 len. 44]: For many years , the -- a -- I would say the flower of the bar , and the -- a -- I would presume to add , the matured autumnal fruits of the woolsack -- have been lavished upon Jarndyce and Jarndyce .
Parsing [sent. 20154 len. 35]: If the public have the benefit , and if the country have the adornment , of this great grasp , it must be paid for in money or money 's worth , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 20155 len. 15]: `` Mr. Kenge , '' said Allan , appearing enlightened all in a moment .
Parsing [sent. 20156 len. 8]: `` Excuse me , our time presses .
Parsing [sent. 20157 len. 17]: Do I understand that the whole estate is found to have been absorbed in costs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20158 len. 3]: `` Hem !
Parsing [sent. 20159 len. 9]: I believe so , '' returned Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 20160 len. 10]: `` Mr. Vholes , what do YOU say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20161 len. 10]: `` I believe so , '' said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 20162 len. 12]: `` And that thus the suit lapses and melts away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20163 len. 8]: `` Probably , '' returned Mr. Kenge .
Parsing [sent. 20164 len. 5]: `` Mr. Vholes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20165 len. 8]: `` Probably , '' said Mr. Vholes .
Parsing [sent. 20166 len. 18]: `` My dearest life , '' whispered Allan , `` this will break Richard 's heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20167 len. 54]: There was such a shock of apprehension in his face , and he knew Richard so perfectly , and I too had seen so much of his gradual decay , that what my dear girl had said to me in the fullness of her foreboding love sounded like a knell in my ears .
Parsing [sent. 20168 len. 29]: `` In case you should be wanting Mr. C. , sir , '' said Mr. Vholes , coming after us , `` you 'll find him in court .
Parsing [sent. 20169 len. 9]: I left him there resting himself a little .
Parsing [sent. 20170 len. 12]: Good day , sir ; good day , Miss Summerson . ''
Parsing [sent. 20171 len. 76]: As he gave me that slowly devouring look of his , while twisting up the strings of his bag before he hastened with it after Mr. Kenge , the benignant shadow of whose conversational presence he seemed afraid to leave , he gave one gasp as if he had swallowed the last morsel of his client , and his black buttoned-up unwholesome figure glided away to the low door at the end of the Hall .
Parsing [sent. 20172 len. 25]: `` My dear love , '' said Allan , `` leave to me , for a little while , the charge you gave me .
Parsing [sent. 20173 len. 15]: Go home with this intelligence and come to Ada 's by and by ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20174 len. 32]: I would not let him take me to a coach , but entreated him to go to Richard without a moment 's delay and leave me to do as he wished .
Parsing [sent. 20175 len. 18]: Hurrying home , I found my guardian and told him gradually with what news I had returned .
Parsing [sent. 20176 len. 33]: `` Little woman , '' said he , quite unmoved for himself , `` to have done with the suit on any terms is a greater blessing than I had looked for .
Parsing [sent. 20177 len. 7]: But my poor young cousins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20178 len. 16]: We talked about them all the morning and discussed what it was possible to do .
Parsing [sent. 20179 len. 19]: In the afternoon my guardian walked with me to Symond 's Inn and left me at the door .
Parsing [sent. 20180 len. 4]: I went upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 20181 len. 38]: When my darling heard my footsteps , she came out into the small passage and threw her arms round my neck , but she composed herself direcfly and said that Richard had asked for me several times .
Parsing [sent. 20182 len. 21]: Allan had found him sitting in the corner of the court , she told me , like a stone figure .
Parsing [sent. 20183 len. 24]: On being roused , he had broken away and made as if he would have spoken in a fierce voice to the judge .
Parsing [sent. 20184 len. 18]: He was stopped by his mouth being full of blood , and Allan had brought him home .
Parsing [sent. 20185 len. 15]: He was lying on a sofa with his eyes closed when I went in .
Parsing [sent. 20186 len. 27]: There were restoratives on the table ; the room was made as airy as possible , and was darkened , and was very orderly and quiet .
Parsing [sent. 20187 len. 8]: Allan stood behind him watching him gravely .
Parsing [sent. 20188 len. 38]: His face appeared to me to be quite destitute of colour , and now that I saw him without his seeing me , I fully saw , for the first time , how worn away he was .
Parsing [sent. 20189 len. 15]: But he looked handsomer than I had seen him look for many a day .
Parsing [sent. 20190 len. 9]: I sat down by his side in silence .
Parsing [sent. 20191 len. 31]: Opening his eyes by and by , he said in a weak voice , but with his old smile , `` Dame Durden , kiss me , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20192 len. 21]: It was a great comfort and surprise to me to find him in his low state cheerful and looking forward .
Parsing [sent. 20193 len. 20]: He was happier , he said , in our intended marriage than he could find words to tell me .
Parsing [sent. 20194 len. 29]: My husband had been a guardian angel to him and Ada , and he blessed us both and wished us all the joy that life could yield us .
Parsing [sent. 20195 len. 27]: I almost felt as if my own heart would have broken when I saw him take my husband 's hand and hold it to his breast .
Parsing [sent. 20196 len. 31]: We spoke of the future as much as possible , and he said several times that he must be present at our marriage if he could stand upon his feet .
Parsing [sent. 20197 len. 12]: Ada would contrive to take him , somehow , he said .
Parsing [sent. 20198 len. 9]: `` Yes , surely , dearest Richard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20199 len. 32]: But as my darling answered him thus hopefully , so serene and beautiful , with the help that was to come to her so near -- I knew -- I knew !
Parsing [sent. 20200 len. 22]: It was not good for him to talk too much , and when he was silent , we were silent too .
Parsing [sent. 20201 len. 27]: Sitting beside him , I made a pretence of working for my dear , as he had always been used to joke about my being busy .
Parsing [sent. 20202 len. 13]: Ada leaned upon his pillow , holding his head upon her arm .
Parsing [sent. 20203 len. 23]: He dozed often , and whenever he awoke without seeing him , said first of all , `` Where is Woodcourt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20204 len. 20]: Evening had come on when I lifted up my eyes and saw my guardian standing in the little hall .
Parsing [sent. 20205 len. 9]: `` Who is that , Dame Durden ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20206 len. 4]: Richard asked me .
Parsing [sent. 20207 len. 19]: The door was behind him , but he had observed in my face that some one was there .
Parsing [sent. 20208 len. 22]: I looked to Allan for advice , and as he nodded `` Yes , '' bent over Richard and told him .
Parsing [sent. 20209 len. 22]: My guardian saw what passed , came softly by me in a moment , and laid his hand on Richard 's .
Parsing [sent. 20210 len. 23]: `` Oh , sir , '' said Richard , `` you are a good man , you are a good man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20211 len. 9]: and burst into tears for the first time .
Parsing [sent. 20212 len. 23]: My guardian , the picture of a good man , sat down in my place , keeping his hand on Richard 's .
Parsing [sent. 20213 len. 22]: `` My dear Rick , '' said he , `` the clouds have cleared away , and it is bright now .
Parsing [sent. 20214 len. 5]: We can see now .
Parsing [sent. 20215 len. 11]: We were all bewildered , Rick , more or less .
Parsing [sent. 20216 len. 3]: What matters !
Parsing [sent. 20217 len. 10]: And how are you , my dear boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20218 len. 16]: `` I am very weak , sir , but I hope I shall be stronger .
Parsing [sent. 20219 len. 8]: I have to begin the world . ''
Parsing [sent. 20220 len. 9]: `` Aye , truly ; well said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20221 len. 4]: cried my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20222 len. 20]: `` I will not begin it in the old way now , '' said Richard with a sad smile .
Parsing [sent. 20223 len. 10]: `` I have learned a lesson now , sir .
Parsing [sent. 20224 len. 21]: It was a hard one , but you shall be assured , indeed , that I have learned it . ''
Parsing [sent. 20225 len. 24]: `` Well , well , '' said my guardian , comforting him ; `` well , well , well , dear boy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20226 len. 37]: `` I was thinking , sir , '' resumed Richard , `` that there is nothing on earth I should so much like to see as their house -- Dame Durden 's and Woodcourt 's house .
Parsing [sent. 20227 len. 28]: If I could be removed there when I begin to recover my strength , I feel as if I should get well there sooner than anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 20228 len. 36]: `` Why , so have I been thinking too , Rick , '' said my guardian , `` and our little woman likewise ; she and I have been talking of it this very day .
Parsing [sent. 20229 len. 9]: I dare say her husband wo n't object .
Parsing [sent. 20230 len. 6]: What do you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20231 len. 20]: Richard smiled and lifted up his arm to touch him as he stood behind the head of the couch .
Parsing [sent. 20232 len. 26]: `` I say nothing of Ada , '' said Richard , `` but I think of her , and have thought of her very much .
Parsing [sent. 20233 len. 4]: Look at her !
Parsing [sent. 20234 len. 31]: See her here , sir , bending over this pillow when she has so much need to rest upon it herself , my dear love , my poor girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20235 len. 13]: He clasped her in his arms , and none of us spoke .
Parsing [sent. 20236 len. 22]: He gradually released her , and she looked upon us , and looked up to heaven , and moved her lips .
Parsing [sent. 20237 len. 33]: `` When I get down to Bleak House , '' said Richard , `` I shall have much to tell you , sir , and you will have much to show me .
Parsing [sent. 20238 len. 9]: You will go , wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20239 len. 7]: `` Undoubtedly , dear Rick . ''
Parsing [sent. 20240 len. 14]: `` Thank you ; like you , like you , '' said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 20241 len. 8]: `` But it 's all like you .
Parsing [sent. 20242 len. 21]: They have been telling me how you planned it and how you remembered all Esther 's familiar tastes and ways .
Parsing [sent. 20243 len. 13]: It will be like coming to the old Bleak House again . ''
Parsing [sent. 20244 len. 13]: `` And you will come there too , I hope , Rick .
Parsing [sent. 20245 len. 21]: I am a solitary man now , you know , and it will be a charity to come to me .
Parsing [sent. 20246 len. 11]: A charity to come to me , my love ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20247 len. 24]: he repeated to Ada as he gently passed his hand over her golden hair and put a lock of it to his lips .
Parsing [sent. 20248 len. 17]: -LRB- I think he vowed within himself to cherish her if she were left alone . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 20249 len. 8]: `` It was a troubled dream ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20250 len. 11]: said Richard , clasping both my guardian 's hands eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 20251 len. 10]: `` Nothing more , Rick ; nothing more . ''
Parsing [sent. 20252 len. 32]: `` And you , being a good man , can pass it as such , and forgive and pity the dreamer , and be lenient and encouraging when he wakes ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20253 len. 5]: `` Indeed I can .
Parsing [sent. 20254 len. 10]: What am I but another dreamer , Rick ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20255 len. 8]: `` I will begin the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20256 len. 9]: said Richard with a light in his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 20257 len. 23]: My husband drew a little nearer towards Ada , and I saw him solemnly lift up his hand to warn my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20258 len. 60]: `` When shall I go from this place to that pleasant country where the old times are , where I shall have strength to tell what Ada has been to me , where I shall be able to recall my many faults and blindnesses , where I shall prepare myself to be a guide to my unborn child ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20259 len. 3]: said Richard .
Parsing [sent. 20260 len. 7]: `` When shall I go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20261 len. 15]: `` Dear Rick , when you are strong enough , '' returned my guardian .
Parsing [sent. 20262 len. 7]: `` Ada , my darling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20263 len. 8]: He sought to raise himself a little .
Parsing [sent. 20264 len. 19]: Allan raised him so that she could hold him on her bosom , which was what he wanted .
Parsing [sent. 20265 len. 11]: `` I have done you many wrongs , my own .
Parsing [sent. 20266 len. 30]: I have fallen like a poor stray shadow on your way , I have married you to poverty and trouble , I have scattered your means to the winds .
Parsing [sent. 20267 len. 17]: You will forgive me all this , my Ada , before I begin the world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20268 len. 12]: A smile irradiated his face as she bent to kiss him .
Parsing [sent. 20269 len. 27]: He slowly laid his face down upon her bosom , drew his arms closer round her neck , and with one parting sob began the world .
Parsing [sent. 20270 len. 9]: Not this world , oh , not this !
Parsing [sent. 20271 len. 7]: The world that sets this right .
Parsing [sent. 20272 len. 29]: When all was still , at a late hour , poor crazed Miss Flite came weeping to me and told me she had given her birds their liberty .
Parsing [sent. 20273 len. 29]: Chapter LXVI -- Down in Lincolnshire There is a hush upon Chesney Wold in these altered days , as there is upon a portion of the family history .
Parsing [sent. 20274 len. 43]: The story goes that Sir Leicester paid some who could have spoken out to hold their peace ; but it is a lame story , feebly whispering and creeping about , and any brighter spark of life it shows soon dies away .
Parsing [sent. 20275 len. 63]: It is known for certain that the handsome Lady Dedlock lies in the mausoleum in the park , where the trees arch darkly overhead , and the owl is heard at night making the woods ring ; but whence she was brought home to be laid among the echoes of that solitary place , or how she died , is all mystery .
Parsing [sent. 20276 len. 85]: Some of her old friends , principally to be found among the peachy-cheeked charmers with the skeleton throats , did once occasionally say , as they toyed in a ghastly manner with large fans -- like charmers reduced to flirting with grim death , after losing all their other beaux -- did once occasionally say , when the world assembled together , that they wondered the ashes of the Dedlocks , entombed in the mausoleum , never rose against the profanation of her company .
Parsing [sent. 20277 len. 16]: But the dead-and-gone Dedlocks take it very calmly and have never been known to object .
Parsing [sent. 20278 len. 31]: Up from among the fern in the hollow , and winding by the bridle-road among the trees , comes sometimes to this lonely spot the sound of horses ' hoofs .
Parsing [sent. 20279 len. 34]: Then may be seen Sir Leicester -- invalided , bent , and almost blind , but of worthy presence yet -- riding with a stalwart man beside him , constant to his bridle-rein .
Parsing [sent. 20280 len. 42]: When they come to a certain spot before the mausoleum-door , Sir Leicester 's accustomed horse stops of his own accord , and Sir Leicester , pulling off his hat , is still for a few moments before they ride away .
Parsing [sent. 20281 len. 27]: War rages yet with the audacious Boythorn , though at uncertain intervals , and now hotly , and now coolly , flickering like an unsteady fire .
Parsing [sent. 20282 len. 84]: The truth is said to be that when Sir Leicester came down to Lincolnshire for good , Mr. Boythorn showed a manifest desire to abandon his right of way and do whatever Sir Leicester would , which Sir Leicester , conceiving to be a condescension to his illness or misfortune , took in such high dudgeon , and was so magnificently aggrieved by , that Mr. Boythorn found himself under the necessity of committing a flagrant trespass to restore his neighbour to himself .
Parsing [sent. 20283 len. 60]: Similarly , Mr. Boythorn continues to post tremendous placards on the disputed thoroughfare and -LRB- with his bird upon his head -RRB- to hold forth vehemently against Sir Leicester in the sanctuary of his own home ; similarly , also , he defies him as of old in the little church by testifying a bland unconsciousness of his existence .
Parsing [sent. 20284 len. 41]: But it is whispered that when he is most ferocious towards his old foe , he is really most considerate , and that Sir Leicester , in the dignity of being implacable , little supposes how much he is humoured .
Parsing [sent. 20285 len. 38]: As little does he think how near together he and his antagonist have suffered in the fortunes of two sisters , and his antagonist , who knows it now , is not the man to tell him .
Parsing [sent. 20286 len. 11]: So the quarrel goes on to the satisfaction of both .
Parsing [sent. 20287 len. 53]: In one of the lodges of the park -- that lodge within sight of the house where , once upon a time , when the waters were out down in Lincolnshire , my Lady used to see the keeper 's child -- the stalwart man , the trooper formerly , is housed .
Parsing [sent. 20288 len. 31]: Some relics of his old calling hang upon the walls , and these it is the chosen recreation of a little lame man about the stable-yard to keep gleaming bright .
Parsing [sent. 20289 len. 44]: A busy little man he always is , in the polishing at harness-house doors , of stirrup-irons , bits , curb-chains , harness bosses , anything in the way of a stable-yard that will take a polish , leading a life of friction .
Parsing [sent. 20290 len. 25]: A shaggy little damaged man , withal , not unlike an old dog of some mongrel breed , who has been considerably knocked about .
Parsing [sent. 20291 len. 8]: He answers to the name of Phil .
Parsing [sent. 20292 len. 58]: A goodly sight it is to see the grand old housekeeper -LRB- harder of hearing now -RRB- going to church on the arm of her son and to observe -- which few do , for the house is scant of company in these times -- the relations of both towards Sir Leicester , and his towards them .
Parsing [sent. 20293 len. 68]: They have visitors in the high summer weather , when a grey cloak and umbrella , unknown to Chesney Wold at other periods , are seen among the leaves ; when two young ladies are occasionally found gambolling in sequestered saw-pits and such nooks of the park ; and when the smoke of two pipes wreathes away into the fragrant evening air from the trooper 's door .
Parsing [sent. 20294 len. 57]: Then is a fife heard trolling within the lodge on the inspiring topic of the `` British Grenadiers '' ; and as the evening closes in , a gruff inflexible voice is heard to say , while two men pace together up and down , `` But I never own to it before the old girl .
Parsing [sent. 20295 len. 6]: Discipline must be maintained . ''
Parsing [sent. 20296 len. 45]: The greater part of the house is shut up , and it is a show-house no longer ; yet Sir Leicester holds his shrunken state in the long drawing-room for all that , and reposes in his old place before my Lady 's picture .
Parsing [sent. 20297 len. 32]: Closed in by night with broad screens , and illumined only in that part , the light of the drawing-room seems gradually contracting and dwindling until it shall be no more .
Parsing [sent. 20298 len. 41]: A little more , in truth , and it will be all extinguished for Sir Leicester ; and the damp door in the mausoleum which shuts so tight , and looks so obdurate , will have opened and received him .
Parsing [sent. 20299 len. 62]: Volumnia , growing with the flight of time pinker as to the red in her face , and yellower as to the white , reads to Sir Leicester in the long evenings and is driven to various artifices to conceal her yawns , of which the chief and most efficacious is the insertion of the pearl necklace between her rosy lips .
Parsing [sent. 20300 len. 65]: Long-winded treatises on the Buffy and Boodle question , showing how Buffy is immaculate and Boodle villainous , and how the country is lost by being all Boodle and no Buffy , or saved by being all Buffy and no Boodle -LRB- it must be one of the two , and can not be anything else -RRB- , are the staple of her reading .
Parsing [sent. 20301 len. 53]: Sir Leicester is not particular what it is and does not appear to follow it very closely , further than that he always comes broad awake the moment Volumnia ventures to leave off , and sonorously repeating her last words , begs with some displeasure to know if she finds herself fatigued .
Parsing [sent. 20302 len. 55]: However , Volumnia , in the course of her bird-like hopping about and pecking at papers , has alighted on a memorandum concerning herself in the event of `` anything happening '' to her kinsman , which is handsome compensation for an extensive course of reading and holds even the dragon Boredom at bay .
Parsing [sent. 20303 len. 54]: The cousins generally are rather shy of Chesney Wold in its dullness , but take to it a little in the shooting season , when guns are heard in the plantations , and a few scattered beaters and keepers wait at the old places of appointment for low-spirited twos and threes of cousins .
Parsing [sent. 20304 len. 47]: The debilitated cousin , more debilitated by the dreariness of the place , gets into a fearful state of depression , groaning under penitential sofa-pillows in his gunless hours and protesting that such fernal old jail 's -- nough t ` sew fler up -- frever .
Parsing [sent. 20305 len. 45]: The only great occasions for Volumnia in this changed aspect of the place in Lincolnshire are those occasions , rare and widely separated , when something is to be done for the county or the country in the way of gracing a public ball .
Parsing [sent. 20306 len. 61]: Then , indeed , does the tuckered sylph come out in fairy form and proceed with joy under cousinly escort to the exhausted old assembly-room , fourteen heavy miles off , which , during three hundred and sixty-four days and nights of every ordinary year , is a kind of antipodean lumber-room full of old chairs and tables upside down .
Parsing [sent. 20307 len. 50]: Then , indeed , does she captivate all hearts by her condescension , by her girlish vivacity , and by her skipping about as in the days when the hideous old general with the mouth too full of teeth had not cut one of them at two guineas each .
Parsing [sent. 20308 len. 21]: Then does she twirl and twine , a pastoral nymph of good family , through the mazes of the dance .
Parsing [sent. 20309 len. 17]: Then do the swains appear with tea , with lemonade , with sandwiches , with homage .
Parsing [sent. 20310 len. 16]: Then is she kind and cruel , stately and unassuming , various , beautifully wilful .
Parsing [sent. 20311 len. 66]: Then is there a singular kind of parallel between her and the little glass chandeliers of another age embellishing that assembly-room , which , with their meagre stems , their spare little drops , their disappointing knobs where no drops are , their bare little stalks from which knobs and drops have both departed , and their little feeble prismatic twinkling , all seem Volumnias .
Parsing [sent. 20312 len. 41]: For the rest , Lincolnshire life to Volumnia is a vast blank of overgrown house looking out upon trees , sighing , wringing their hands , bowing their heads , and casting their tears upon the window-panes in monotonous depressions .
Parsing [sent. 20313 len. 45]: A labyrinth of grandeur , less the property of an old family of human beings and their ghostly likenesses than of an old family of echoings and thunderings which start out of their hundred graves at every sound and go resounding through the building .
Parsing [sent. 20314 len. 32]: A waste of unused passages and staircases in which to drop a comb upon a bedroom floor at night is to send a stealthy footfall on an errand through the house .
Parsing [sent. 20315 len. 49]: A place where few people care to go about alone , where a maid screams if an ash drops from the fire , takes to crying at all times and seasons , becomes the victim of a low disorder of the spirits , and gives warning and departs .
Parsing [sent. 20316 len. 4]: Thus Chesney Wold .
Parsing [sent. 20317 len. 99]: With so much of itself abandoned to darkness and vacancy ; with so little change under the summer shining or the wintry lowering ; so sombre and motionless always -- no flag flying now by day , no rows of lights sparkling by night ; with no family to come and go , no visitors to be the souls of pale cold shapes of rooms , no stir of life about it -- passion and pride , even to the stranger 's eye , have died away from the place in Lincolnshire and yielded it to dull repose .
Parsing [sent. 20318 len. 22]: Chapter LXVII -- The Close of Esther 's Narrative Full seven happy years I have been the mistress of Bleak House .
Parsing [sent. 20319 len. 32]: The few words that I have to add to what I have written are soon penned ; then I and the unknown friend to whom I write will part for ever .
Parsing [sent. 20320 len. 9]: Not without much dear remembrance on my side .
Parsing [sent. 20321 len. 12]: Not without some , I hope , on his or hers .
Parsing [sent. 20322 len. 17]: They gave my darling into my arms , and through many weeks I never left her .
Parsing [sent. 20323 len. 23]: The little child who was to have done so much was born before the turf was planted on its father 's grave .
Parsing [sent. 20324 len. 21]: It was a boy ; and I , my husband , and my guardian gave him his father 's name .
Parsing [sent. 20325 len. 25]: The help that my dear counted on did come to her , though it came , in the eternal wisdom , for another purpose .
Parsing [sent. 20326 len. 27]: Though to bless and restore his mother , not his father , was the errand of this baby , its power was mighty to do it .
Parsing [sent. 20327 len. 40]: When I saw the strength of the weak little hand and how its touch could heal my darling 's heart and raised hope within her , I felt a new sense of the goodness and the tenderness of God .
Parsing [sent. 20328 len. 26]: They throve , and by degrees I saw my dear girl pass into my country garden and walk there with her infant in her arms .
Parsing [sent. 20329 len. 5]: I was married then .
Parsing [sent. 20330 len. 8]: I was the happiest of the happy .
Parsing [sent. 20331 len. 19]: It was at this time that my guardian joined us and asked Ada when she would come home .
Parsing [sent. 20332 len. 23]: `` Both houses are your home , my dear , '' said he , `` but the older Bleak House claims priority .
Parsing [sent. 20333 len. 21]: When you and my boy are strong enough to do it , come and take possession of your home . ''
Parsing [sent. 20334 len. 11]: Ada called him `` her dearest cousin , John . ''
Parsing [sent. 20335 len. 12]: But he said , no , it must be guardian now .
Parsing [sent. 20336 len. 21]: He was her guardian henceforth , and the boy 's ; and he had an old association with the name .
Parsing [sent. 20337 len. 14]: So she called him guardian , and has called him guardian ever since .
Parsing [sent. 20338 len. 9]: The children know him by no other name .
Parsing [sent. 20339 len. 11]: I say the children ; I have two little daughters .
Parsing [sent. 20340 len. 62]: It is difficult to believe that Charley -LRB- round-eyed still , and not at all grammatical -RRB- is married to a miller in our neighbourhood ; yet so it is ; and even now , looking up from my desk as I write early in the morning at my summer window , I see the very mill beginning to go round .
Parsing [sent. 20341 len. 39]: I hope the miller will not spoil Charley ; but he is very fond of her , and Charley is rather vain of such a match , for he is well to do and was in great request .
Parsing [sent. 20342 len. 46]: So far as my small maid is concerned , I might suppose time to have stood for seven years as still as the mill did half an hour ago , since little Emma , Charley 's sister , is exactly what Charley used to be .
Parsing [sent. 20343 len. 29]: As to Tom , Charley 's brother , I am really afraid to say what he did at school in ciphering , but I think it was decimals .
Parsing [sent. 20344 len. 30]: He is apprenticed to the miller , whatever it was , and is a good bashful fellow , always falling in love with somebody and being ashamed of it .
Parsing [sent. 20345 len. 40]: Caddy Jellyby passed her very last holidays with us and was a dearer creature than ever , perpetually dancing in and out of the house with the children as if she had never given a dancing-lesson in her life .
Parsing [sent. 20346 len. 23]: Caddy keeps her own little carriage now instead of hiring one , and lives full two miles further westward than Newman Street .
Parsing [sent. 20347 len. 21]: She works very hard , her husband -LRB- an excellent one -RRB- being lame and able to do very little .
Parsing [sent. 20348 len. 19]: Still , she is more than contented and does all she has to do with all her heart .
Parsing [sent. 20349 len. 25]: Mr. Jellyby spends his evenings at her new house with his head against the wall as he used to do in her old one .
Parsing [sent. 20350 len. 31]: I have heard that Mrs. Jellyby was understood to suffer great mortification from her daughter 's ignoble marriage and pursuits , but I hope she got over it in time .
Parsing [sent. 20351 len. 65]: She has been disappointed in Borrioboola -- Gha , which turned out a failure in consequence of the king of Boorioboola wanting to sell everybody -- who survived the climate -- for rum , but she has taken up with the rights of women to sit in Parliament , and Caddy tells me it is a mission involving more correspondence than the old one .
Parsing [sent. 20352 len. 10]: I had almost forgotten Caddy 's poor little girl .
Parsing [sent. 20353 len. 15]: She is not such a mite now , but she is deaf and dumb .
Parsing [sent. 20354 len. 34]: I believe there never was a better mother than Caddy , who learns , in her scanty intervals of leisure , innumerable deaf and dumb arts to soften the affliction of her child .
Parsing [sent. 20355 len. 22]: As if I were never to have done with Caddy , I am reminded here of Peepy and old Mr. Turveydrop .
Parsing [sent. 20356 len. 12]: Peepy is in the Custom House , and doing extremely well .
Parsing [sent. 20357 len. 31]: Old Mr. Turveydrop , very apoplectic , still exhibits his deportment about town , still enjoys himself in the old manner , is still believed in in the old way .
Parsing [sent. 20358 len. 29]: He is constant in his patronage of Peepy and is understood to have bequeathed him a favourite French clock in his dressing-room -- which is not his property .
Parsing [sent. 20359 len. 42]: With the first money we saved at home , we added to our pretty house by throwing out a little growlery expressly for my guardian , which we inaugurated with great splendour the next time he came down to see us .
Parsing [sent. 20360 len. 33]: I try to write all this lightly , because my heart is full in drawing to an end , but when I write of him , my tears will have their way .
Parsing [sent. 20361 len. 18]: I never look at him but I hear our poor dear Richard calling him a good man .
Parsing [sent. 20362 len. 32]: To Ada and her pretty boy , he is the fondest father ; to me he is what he has ever been , and what name can I give to that ?
Parsing [sent. 20363 len. 28]: He is my husband 's best and dearest friend , he is our children 's darling , he is the object of our deepest love and veneration .
Parsing [sent. 20364 len. 32]: Yet while I feel towards him as if he were a superior being , I am so familiar with him and so easy with him that I almost wonder at myself .
Parsing [sent. 20365 len. 66]: I have never lost my old names , nor has he lost his ; nor do I ever , when he is with us , sit in any other place than in my old chair at his side , Dame Trot , Dame Durden , Little Woman -- all just the same as ever ; and I answer , `` Yes , dear guardian ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20366 len. 4]: just the same .
Parsing [sent. 20367 len. 30]: I have never known the wind to be in the east for a single moment since the day when he took me to the porch to read the name .
Parsing [sent. 20368 len. 35]: I remarked to him once that the wind seemed never in the east now , and he said , no , truly ; it had finally departed from that quarter on that very day .
Parsing [sent. 20369 len. 11]: I think my darling girl is more beautiful than ever .
Parsing [sent. 20370 len. 33]: The sorrow that has been in her face -- for it is not there now -- seems to have purified even its innocent expression and to have given it a diviner quality .
Parsing [sent. 20371 len. 49]: Sometimes when I raise my eyes and see her in the black dress that she still wears , teaching my Richard , I feel -- it is difficult to express -- as if it were so good to know that she remembers her dear Esther in her prayers .
Parsing [sent. 20372 len. 6]: I call him my Richard !
Parsing [sent. 20373 len. 14]: But he says that he has two mamas , and I am one .
Parsing [sent. 20374 len. 20]: We are not rich in the bank , but we have always prospered , and we have quite enough .
Parsing [sent. 20375 len. 15]: I never walk out with my husband but I hear the people bless him .
Parsing [sent. 20376 len. 21]: I never go into a house of any degree but I hear his praises or see them in grateful eyes .
Parsing [sent. 20377 len. 30]: I never lie down at night but I know that in the course of that day he has alleviated pain and soothed some fellow-creature in the time of need .
Parsing [sent. 20378 len. 31]: I know that from the beds of those who were past recovery , thanks have often , often gone up , in the last hour , for his patient ministration .
Parsing [sent. 20379 len. 7]: Is not this to be rich ?
Parsing [sent. 20380 len. 11]: The people even praise me as the doctor 's wife .
Parsing [sent. 20381 len. 22]: The people even like me as I go about , and make so much of me that I am quite abashed .
Parsing [sent. 20382 len. 13]: I owe it all to him , my love , my pride !
Parsing [sent. 20383 len. 19]: They like me for his sake , as I do everything I do in life for his sake .
Parsing [sent. 20384 len. 46]: A night or two ago , after bustling about preparing for my darling and my guardian and little Richard , who are coming to-morrow , I was sitting out in the porch of all places , that dearly memorable porch , when Allan came home .
Parsing [sent. 20385 len. 17]: So he said , `` My precious little woman , what are you doing here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20386 len. 30]: And I said , `` The moon is shining so brightly , Allan , and the night is so delicious , that I have been sitting here thinking . ''
Parsing [sent. 20387 len. 12]: `` What have you been thinking about , my dear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20388 len. 4]: said Allan then .
Parsing [sent. 20389 len. 7]: `` How curious you are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 20390 len. 15]: said I. `` I am almost ashamed to tell you , but I will .
Parsing [sent. 20391 len. 15]: I have been thinking about my old looks -- such as they were . ''
Parsing [sent. 20392 len. 15]: `` And what have you been thinking about THEM , my busy bee ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20393 len. 3]: said Allan .
Parsing [sent. 20394 len. 29]: `` I have been thinking that I thought it was impossible that you COULD have loved me any better , even if I had retained them . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 20395 len. 8]: ` Such as they were ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20396 len. 5]: said Allan , laughing .
Parsing [sent. 20397 len. 10]: `` Such as they were , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 20398 len. 26]: `` My dear Dame Durden , '' said Allan , drawing my arm through his , `` do you ever look in the glass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20399 len. 13]: `` You know I do ; you see me do it . ''
Parsing [sent. 20400 len. 16]: `` And do n't you know that you are prettier than you ever were ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20401 len. 17]: `` I did not know that ; I am not certain that I know it now .
Parsing [sent. 20402 len. 61]: But I know that my dearest little pets are very pretty , and that my darling is very beautiful , and that my husband is very handsome , and that my guardian has the brightest and most benevolent face that ever was seen , and that they can very well do without much beauty in me -- even supposing -- .
