Parsing [sent. 1 len. 15]: CYNTHIA 'S CHAUFFEUR By LOUIS TRACY The scene opens in London on Derby day .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 27]: A lovely American girl and her English chaperon had engaged a chauffeur to take them in his car on a thousand miles run for ten days .
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 32]: On his way to keep the appointment the car met with an accident , and a young Englishman , the son of an earl , happened to be in the vicinity .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 50]: The chauffeur had once been in his employ , and when he saw his distress at the possible loss of a good customer he thought it would be a fine lark to go himself , in the guise of a chauffeur , and take the ladies on their journey .
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 23]: The girl was beautiful and the pseudo chauffeur was young and romantic , and one of the strangest of love stories began .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 17]: CHAPTER I THE HIRED CAR Derby Day fell that year on the first Wednesday in June .
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 28]: By a whim of the British climate , the weather was fine ; in fact , no rain had fallen on southern England since the previous Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 27]: Wise after the event , the newspapers published cheerful `` forecasts , '' and certain daring `` experts '' discussed the probabilities of a heat wave .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 34]: So London , on that bright Wednesday morning , was agog with excitement over its annual holiday ; and at such a time London is the gayest and liveliest city in the world .
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 15]: And then , wholly independent of the weather , there was the Great Question .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 35]: From the hour when the first ` bus rumbled Citywards until some few seconds before three o'clock in the afternoon the mass of the people seemed to find delight in asking and answering it .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 12]: The Question was ever the same ; but the answer varied .
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 15]: In its way , the Question formed a tribute to the advance of democracy .
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 14]: It caused strangers to exchange opinions and pleasantries in crowded trains and omnibuses .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 9]: It placed peers and commoners on an equality .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 15]: During some part of the day it completely eclipsed all other topics of conversation .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 42]: Thus , young Lord Medenham made no pretense of shirking it while he stood on the steps of his father 's mansion in Cavendish Square and watched his chauffeur stowing a luncheon basket beneath the front seat of the Mercury 38 .
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 29]: `` You know a bit about racing , Tomkinson , '' he said , smiling at the elderly butler who had brought the basket out of the house .
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 8]: `` What 's going to win ? ''
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 25]: `` The King 's horse , my lord , '' replied Tomkinson , with the unctuous conviction of a prelate laying down a dogma .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 10]: `` Is it as sure as all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 7]: `` Yes , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 7]: `` Well , I hope so .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 17]: You are on a sovereign -- By gad , you really are , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 20]: Tomkinson was far too keenly alive to the monetary side of the transaction to pay heed to the quip .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 9]: His portly figure curved in a superb bow .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 11]: `` Thank you , my lord , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 10]: `` Remind me this evening if you are right .
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 13]: I shall not forget to damn you if you are wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 10]: Tomkinson ignored the chance of error and its consequences .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 10]: `` Your lordship will be home for dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 9]: `` Yes , I have no other engagement .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 6]: All ready , Dale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 24]: for the chauffeur was in his seat , and the engine was purring with the placid hum of a machine in perfect tune .
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 23]: Tomkinson moved grandly down the steps , ushered Viscount Medenham into the car , and watched its graceful swoop into Holles Street .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 11]: `` Times have changed , '' said he to himself .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 38]: `` Twenty years ago , when I first came here , his lordship 's father would have given _ me _ a tip , and he would n't have been coming home for dinner , neether . ''
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 11]: By that last fatal word Tomkinson betrayed the cloven hoof .
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 23]: At least , he was no prelate -- and his assumption of the prophetic r√¥le would soon be put to the test .
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 8]: But he had answered the Great Question .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 15]: The Mercury crossed Oxford Street and insinuated itself into the aristocratic narrowness of Mayfair .
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 15]: It stopped in Curzon Street , opposite a house gay with flowers in window-boxes .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 7]: The Viscount looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 7]: `` How far to Epsom ? ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: he asked over Dale 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 30]: `` About sixteen miles by the direct road , my lord , but it will be best to go round by Kingston and avoid the worst of the traffic .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 11]: We ought to allow an hour for the run . ''
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 5]: `` An hour ! ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 11]: `` We are not in France now , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 14]: The police here would have spasms if they saw the car extended . ''
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 4]: Lord Medenham sighed .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 11]: `` We must reason with them , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 5]: `` But not to-day .
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 8]: Lady St. Maur declares she is nervous .
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 10]: Of course , she does n't know our Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 22]: After to-day 's experience it will be quite another matter when I take her to Brighton for lunch on Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 4]: Dale said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 59]: He had met his employer at Marseilles in October , when Lord Medenham landed from Africa ; during the preceding twelve months his license had been indorsed three times for exceeding the speed limit on the Brighton Road , and he had paid # 40 in fines and costs to various petty sessional courts in Surrey and Sussex .
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 7]: Sunday , therefore , promised developments .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 21]: Medenham seemed to think that his aunt , Lady St. Maur , would be waiting for him on the doorstep .
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 24]: As no matronly figure materialized in that locality , he alighted , and obeyed a brass-lettered injunction to `` knock and ring . ''
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 23]: Then he disappeared inside the house , and remained there so long that Dale 's respect for the law began to weaken .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 31]: The chauffeur had been given a racing certainty for the first race ; the hour was nearing twelve , and every road leading to Epsom Downs would surely be congested .
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 17]: His lordship came out , alone , and it was clear that the unexpected had happened .
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 5]: `` Nice thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 18]: he said , with the closest semblance to a growl that his good-natured drawl was capable of .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 9]: `` The whole show is busted , Dale .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 20]: Her ladyship is in bed with her annual bilious attack -- comes of eating forced strawberries , she says .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 5]: And she adores strawberries .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 13]: So do I. There 's pounds of 'em in that luncheon basket .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 8]: Who 's going to eat 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 41]: Dale foresaw no difficulties in that respect , but he did realize at once that his master cared little about racing , and , so far as Epsom was concerned , would abandon the day 's excursion without a pang .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 4]: He grew desperate .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 24]: But , being something of a stoic , he kept his feelings in check , and played a card that could hardly fail .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 24]: `` You will find plenty of youngsters on the hill who will be glad of them , my lord , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 8]: `` You do n't tell me so !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 5]: Kiddies at the Derby !
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 5]: Well , why not ?
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 21]: It shows what a stranger I am in my own land that I should never have seen the blessed race .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 19]: Right ahead then , Dale ; we must back the King 's horse and arrange a school treat .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 7]: But I 'll take the wheel .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 9]: Can you tuck your legs over that basket ?
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 11]: I 'm not going to sit alone in the tonneau .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 5]: And , who knows ?
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 11]: -- we may pick up someone on the road . ''
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 12]: Starting on the switch , the car sprang off towards Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 6]: Dale sighed in his relief .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 24]: With ordinary luck , they ought to reach Epsom before one o'clock , and racing did not begin till half an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 40]: He left wholly out of reckoning the mysterious element in human affairs that allots adventures to the adventurous , though close association with Viscount Medenham during the past nine months ought to have taught him the wisdom of caution .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 62]: Several chapters of a very interesting book might be supplied by his lordship 's motoring experiences on the Continent , and these would only supplement the still more checkered biography of one who , at the close of the Boer War , elected to shoot his way home through the Mid-African haunts of big game rather than return by orthodox troopship .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 37]: On the face of things , it was absurd to imagine that a self-confessed wanderer should be permitted to see his first Derby in the sacrosanct company of a stout aunt and a well-filled luncheon basket .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 37]: Even Medenham 's recording angel must have smiled at the conceit , though doubtless shaking a grave head when the announcement of the Dowager 's indisposition revealed the first twist from the path of good intent .
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 30]: As for Lady St. Maur , she declared long afterwards that the whole amazing entanglement could be traced distinctly to her fondness for the ducal fruit raised under glass .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 59]: A cherry-stone lodged in the vermiform appendix of an emperor has more than once played strange pranks with the map of Europe , so it is not surprising that a strawberry , subtly bestowed in a place well adapted to the exercise of its fell skill , should be able to convulse a section of the British peerage .
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 25]: Be that as it may , the hap that put Medenham in control of his Mercury unquestionably led to the next turn in events .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 26]: A man driving a high-powered car watches the incidents of the road more closely than the same individual lounging at ease in the back seat .
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 23]: Hence , his lordship 's attention was caught instantly by a touring car drawn up close to the curb in Down Street .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 17]: That short thoroughfare forms , as it were , a backwash for the traffic of Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 37]: At the moment it held no other vehicle than the two automobiles , and it required no second look at the face of the driver of the motionless car to discover that something was seriously amiss .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 8]: Anger and despair struggled there for predominance .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 21]: Richard the Third of England must have given just such a glance at his last horse foundered on Bosworth Field .
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 10]: Medenham never passed another motorist in trouble without stopping .
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 6]: `` Anything the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 20]: he asked , when the Mercury was halted with the ease of a trained athlete poised in suspended motion .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 4]: `` Everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 9]: The chauffeur snapped out the word without turning .
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 14]: He was a man devoid of faith , or hope , or charity .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 6]: `` Can I help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 8]: `` Can you h -- l ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 5]: came the surly response .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 18]: Thereupon , many viscounts would have swept on into Piccadilly without further parley -- not so Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 10]: He scrutinized the soldierly figure , the half-averted face .
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 23]: `` You must be hard hit , Simmonds , before you would answer me in that fashion , '' said he quietly .
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 9]: Simmonds positively jumped when he heard his name .
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 14]: He wheeled round , raised his cap , and broke into stuttering excuse .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 41]: `` I beg your lordship 's pardon -- I had n't the least notion -- '' These two had not met since they discussed Boer trenches and British generals during a momentary halt on the Tugela slope of Spion Kop .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 15]: Medenham remembered the fact , and forgave a good deal on account of it .
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 22]: `` I have seen you look far less worried under a plunging fire from a pom-pom , '' he said cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 7]: `` Now , what is it ?
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 6]: Wires out of order ? ''
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 6]: `` No , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 8]: That would n't bother me very long .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 13]: It 's a regular smash this time -- transmission shaft snapped . ''
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 18]: `` I was run into by a railway van , and forced against a street refuge . ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 21]: `` Well , if it was not your fault -- '' `` Oh , I can claim damages right enough .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 6]: I have plenty of witnesses .
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 16]: Even the driver of the van could only say that one of his horses slipped .
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 9]: It 's the delay I 'm jibbing at .
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 28]: I hate to disappoint my customers , and this accident may cost me three hundred pounds , and a business of my own into the bargain . ''
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 4]: `` By gad !
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 5]: That sounds rather stiff .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 6]: What 's the hurry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 10]: `` This is my own car , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 16]: Early in the spring I was lucky enough to fall in with a rich American .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 26]: I was driving for a company then , but he offered me three hundred pounds , money down , for a three months ' contract .
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 16]: Straightaway I bought this car for five hundred , and it is half paid for .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 54]: Now the same gentleman writes from Paris that I am to take his daughter and another lady on a thousand miles ' run for ten days , and he says he is prepared to hire me and the car for the balance of another period of three months on the same terms . ''
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 13]: `` But the ladies will be reasonable when you explain matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 13]: `` Ladies are never reasonable , my lord -- especially young ones .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 25]: I have met Miss Vanrenen only once , but she struck me as one who was very much accustomed to having her own way .
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 11]: And she has planned this tour to the last minute .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 52]: Any other day I might have hired a car , and picked up my own somewhere on the road , but on Derby Day and in fine weather -- '' Simmonds spread wide his hands in sheer inability to find words that would express the hopelessness of retrieving his shattered fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 20]: Dale was fidgeting , fingering taps and screws unnecessarily , but Medenham was pondering his former trooper 's plight .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 16]: He refused to admit that the position was quite so bad as it was painted .
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 33]: `` Oh , come now , '' said he , `` I 'll give you a tow to the nearest repair shop , and a word from me will expedite the business .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 22]: Meanwhile , you must jump into a hansom and appeal to the sympathies of Miss -- Vanrenen , is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 13]: `` No use , my lord , '' was the stubborn answer .
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 19]: `` I am very much obliged to you , but I would not dream of detaining you . ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 8]: `` Simmonds , you are positively cantankerous .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 7]: I can spare the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 18]: `` The first race is at 1.30 , my lord , '' muttered Dale , greatly daring .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 3]: Medenham laughed .
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 6]: `` You , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 12]: `` Someone has given you a tip , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 10]: Dale flushed under this direct analysis of his feelings .
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 4]: He grinned sheepishly .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 20]: `` I am told that Eyot ca n't lose the first race , my lord , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 10]: And how much do you mean to speculate ? ''
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 8]: `` A sovereign , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 5]: `` Hand it over .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 8]: I will lay you starting price . ''
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 36]: Somewhat taken aback , though nothing said or done by Viscount Medenham could really surprise him , Dale 's leather garments creaked and groaned while he produced the coin , which his master duly pocketed .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 42]: `` Now , Simmonds , '' went on the pleasant , lazy voice , `` you see how I have comforted Dale by taking his money ; wo n't you tell me what is the real obstacle that blocks the way ?
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 11]: Are you afraid to face this imperious young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 6]: `` No , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 11]: No man can provide against an accident of this sort .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 10]: But Miss Vanrenen will lose all confidence in me .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 16]: The arrangement was that to-day 's spin should be a short one -- to Brighton .
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 25]: I was to take the ladies to Epsom in time for the Derby , and then we were to run quietly to the Metropole .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 17]: Miss Vanrenen made such a point of seeing the race that she will be horribly disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 16]: There is an American horse entered -- '' `` By gad , another gambler ! ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 4]: Simmonds laughed grimly .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 38]: `` I do n't think Miss Vanrenen knows much about racing , my lord , but the owner of Grimalkin is a friend of her father 's , and he is confident about winning this year . ''
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 7]: `` I am beginning to understand .
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 11]: You are in a fix of sorts , Simmonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 7]: `` Yes , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 7]: `` And what is your plan ?
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 7]: I suppose you have one . ''
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 12]: `` I have sent for a boy messenger , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 14]: When he arrives I shall write -- Oh , here he is . ''
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 9]: Viscount Medenham descended leisurely and lit a cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 23]: Dale , the stoic , folded his arms and looked fixedly at the press of vehicles passing the end of the street .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 29]: Vivid memories of Lord Medenham 's chivalrous courtesy -- his lordship 's dashed tomfoolery he called it -- warned him that life was about to assume new interests .
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 35]: The boy messenger , summoned telephonically by a sympathetic maid-servant in a neighboring house , guessed that the gentleman standing on the pavement owned the `` motor-car '' to which he had been directed .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 12]: Here were two cars , but the boy did not hesitate .
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 3]: He saluted .
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 9]: `` Messenger , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 9]: `` This way , '' intervened Simmonds curtly .
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 8]: I want you , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 14]: `` You know Sevastopolo 's , the cigarette shop in Bond Street ? ''
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 17]: `` Take this card there , and ask him to dispatch the order at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 16]: Meanwhile he was writing : `` Kindly send 1,000 Salonikas to 91 Cavendish Square . ''
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 4]: Simmonds looked anxious .
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 17]: He was not a smooth-spoken fellow , but he did not wish to offend Lord Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 17]: `` Would your lordship mind if I sent the boy to the Savoy Hotel first ? ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 4]: he asked nervously .
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 15]: `` It is rather late , and Miss Vanrenen will be expecting me . ''
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 11]: `` What time are you due at the Savoy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 29]: `` We were to start at twelve o'clock , but the ladies ' luggage had to be strapped on , and -- '' `` Ah , the deuce !
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 5]: That sounds formidable . ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 18]: `` Of course they must stow everything into the canvas trunks I supplied , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 19]: Medenham stooped and examined the screws which fastened an iron grid at the back of the broken-down vehicle .
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 22]: `` Whip open the tool box , Dale , and transfer that arrangement to my car , '' he said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 6]: `` Make it fit somehow .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 45]: I do n't approve of damaged paintwork , nor of weight behind the driving-wheels for that matter , but time presses , and the ladies might shy at a request to repack their belongings into my kit-bags , even if I were carrying them .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 21]: Now , Simmonds , give me the route , if you know it , and hand over your road maps .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 13]: I mean to take your place until your car is put right .
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 7]: Wire me where to expect you .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 14]: You ought to be ship-shape in three days , at the utmost . ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 10]: `` My lord -- '' began the overwhelmed Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 33]: `` I 'll see you hanged as high as Haman before I hand over my Mercury to you , if that is what you are thinking of , '' said Medenham sharply .
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 12]: `` Why , man , she is built like a watch .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 10]: It would take you a month to understand her .
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 11]: Now , you boy , be off to Sevastopolo 's .
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 12]: Where can I buy a chauffeur 's kit , Simmonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 8]: `` Your lordship is really too kind .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 12]: I could n't think of permitting it , '' muttered Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 12]: `` What , then -- do you refuse my assistance ? ''
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 9]: `` It is n't that , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 39]: I am awfully grateful -- '' `` Are you afraid that I shall run off with Miss Vanrenen -- hold her to ransom -- send Black Hand letters to her father , and that sort of thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 24]: `` From what little I have seen of Miss Vanrenen she is much more likely to run off with you , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 11]: But -- '' `` You 're growing incoherent , Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 12]: For goodness ' sake tell me where I am to go .
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 38]: You can safely leave all the rest to me , and we have n't a minute to lose if I am to secure any sort of a decent motoring kit before I turn up at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 6]: Pull yourself together , man .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 5]: Action front and fire !
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 15]: Guns unlimbered and first range-finder dispatched in nineteen seconds -- eh , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 5]: Simmonds squared his shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 20]: He had been a driver in the Royal Artillery before he joined Viscount Medenham 's troop of Imperial Yeomanry .
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 6]: There was no further argument .
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 19]: Dale , Oriental in phlegm now that Eyot was safely backed , was already unscrewing the luggage carrier .
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 24]: Half an hour later , the Mercury curled with sinuous grace out of the busy Strand into the courtyard of the Savoy Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 30]: The inclosure snorted with motors , the air was _ petrolis√© _ , all the world of the hotel was going , or had already gone , to Epsom .
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 32]: One quick glance at the lines of traffic showed Medenham that the Swiss Rear-Admiral on duty would not allow him to remain an unnecessary instant in front of the actual doorway .
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 24]: He swung his car to the exit side , crept in behind a departing taxicab , and grabbed a hurrying boy in buttons .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 12]: `` You listen to me , boy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 9]: The boy remarked that his hearing was perfect .
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 15]: `` Well , go to Miss Vanrenen and say that her motor is waiting .
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 22]: Seize a porter , and do not leave him until he has brought two canvas trunks from the lady 's rooms .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 19]: Help him to strap them on the grid , and I 'll give each of you half-a-crown . ''
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 4]: The boy vanished .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 10]: Never before had a chauffeur addressed him so convincingly .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 44]: Medenham , standing by the side of the car , was deep in the contours of a road map of Sussex when a sweet if somewhat petulant voice , apparently at his elbow , complained that its owner could not see Simmonds anywhere .
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 4]: He turned instantly .
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 29]: A slim , straight-figured girl , wearing a dust-cloak and motor veil , had come out from the Savoy Court doorway and was scrutinizing every automobile in sight .
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 18]: Near her was a short , stout woman whose personality seemed to be strangely familiar to Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 46]: He never forgot anyone , and this lady was certainly not one of his acquaintances ; nevertheless , her features , her robin-like strut , her very amplitude of girth and singular rotundity of form , came definitely within the net of his retentive memory .
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 28]: To be sure , he gave her but brief survey , since her companion , in all likelihood Miss Vanrenen , might quite reasonably attract his attention .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 31]: Indeed , she would find favor in the eyes of any young man , let alone one who had such cause as Viscount Medenham to be interested in her appearance .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 34]: In her amazingly lovely face the haughty beauty of an aristocrat was softened by a touch of that piquant femininity which the well-bred American girl seems to bring from Paris with her clothes .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 56]: A mass of dark brown hair framed a forehead , nose , and mouth of almost Grecian regularity , while her firmly modeled chin , slightly more pronounced in type , would hint at unusual strength of character were not the impression instantly dispelled by the changing lights in a pair of marvelously blue eyes .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 33]: In the course of a single second Medenham found himself comparing them to blue diamonds , to the azure depths of a sunlit sea , to the exquisite tint of the myosotis .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 11]: Then he swallowed his surprise , and lifted his cap .
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 11]: `` May I ask if you are Miss Vanrenen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 6]: The blue eyes met his .
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 19]: For the first time in his life he was thrilled to the core by a woman 's glance .
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 29]: She answered with a smile , an approving smile , perhaps , for the viscount looked very smart in his tight-fitting uniform , but none the less wondering .
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 9]: `` Then I am here instead of Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 31]: His car was put out of commission an hour ago by a brutal railway van , and will not be ready for the road during the next day or two .
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 10]: May I offer my services in the meantime ? ''
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 15]: The girl 's astonished gaze traveled from Medenham to the spick and span automobile .
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 28]: For the moment he had forgotten his r√¥le , and each word he uttered deepened her bewilderment , which grew stronger when she looked at the Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 38]: The sleek coachwork and spotless leather upholstery , the shining brass fittings and glistening wings , every visible detail in fact , gave good promise of the excellence of the engine stowed away beneath the square bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 13]: Evidently Miss Vanrenen had cultivated the habit of gathering information rapidly . ''
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 6]: _ This _ car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 11]: she exclaimed , with a delightful lifting of arched eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 15]: `` Yes , you will not be disappointed in it , I assure you .
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 28]: I am doing Simmonds a friendly turn in taking his place , so I hope the slight accident will not make any difference to your plans . ''
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 14]: `` But -- why has not Simmonds himself come to explain matters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 17]: `` He could not leave his car , which is in a side street off Piccadilly .
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 34]: He would have sent a note , but he remembered that you had never seen his handwriting , so , as a proof of my genuineness , he gave me your itinerary . ''
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 14]: Medenham produced a closely-written sheet of note-paper , which Miss Vanrenen presumably recognized .
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 23]: She turned to her stout companion , who had been summing up car and chauffeur with careful eyes since Medenham first spoke .
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 12]: `` What do _ you _ think , Mrs. Devar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 21]: When he heard the name , Medenham was so amazed that the last vestige of chauffeurism vanished from his manner .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 15]: `` You do n't mean to say you are Jimmy Devar 's mother ? ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 3]: he gasped .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 5]: Mrs. Devar positively jumped .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 14]: If a look could have slain he would have fallen then and there .
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 12]: As it was , she tried to freeze him to death .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 18]: `` Do I understand that you are speaking of Captain Devar , of Horton 's Horse ? ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 8]: she said , aloof as an iceberg .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' said he coolly , though regretting the lapse .
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 23]: He had stupidly brought about an awkward incident , and must remember in future not to address either lady as an equal .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 18]: `` I was not aware that my son was on familiar terms with the chauffeur fraternity . ''
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 10]: `` Sorry , but the name slipped out unawares .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 19]: Captain Devar is , or used to be , very easy-going in his ways , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 7]: `` So it would seem . ''
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 8]: She turned her back on him disdainfully .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 37]: `` In the circumstances , Cynthia , '' she said , `` I am inclined to believe that we ought to make further inquiries before we exchange cars , and drivers , in this fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 8]: `` But what is to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 20]: All our arrangements are made -- our rooms ordered -- I have even sent father each day 's address .
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 12]: If we cancel everything by telegraph he will be alarmed . ''
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 15]: `` Oh , I did not mean that , '' protested the lady hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 11]: It was evident that she hardly knew what to say .
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 9]: Medenham 's wholly unexpected query had unnerved her .
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 7]: `` Is there any alternative ? ''
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 11]: demanded Cynthia ruefully , glancing from one to the other .
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 19]: `` It is rather late to hire another car to-day , I admit -- '' began Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 14]: `` It would be quite impossible , madam , '' put in Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 21]: `` This is Derby Day , and there is not a motor to be obtained in London except a taxicab .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 19]: It was sheer good luck for Simmonds that he was able to secure me as his deputy . ''
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 11]: He thanked his stars for that word `` madam . ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 26]: Certainly the mere sound of it seemed to soothe Mrs. Devar 's jarred nerves , and the appearance of the Mercury was even more reassuring .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 18]: `` Ah , well , '' she said , `` we are not traveling into the wilds .
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 12]: If desirable , we can always return to town by train .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 12]: By the way , chauffeur , what is your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 6]: For an instant Medenham hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 35]: Then he took the plunge , strong in the belief that a half-forgotten transaction between himself and `` Jimmy '' Devar would prevent that impecunious warrior from discussing him freely in the family circle .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 9]: `` George Augustus Fitzroy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 23]: Mrs. Devar 's brows knitted ; she was regaining her self-possession , and a sarcastic smile now chased away a perplexing thought .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 30]: She was about to say something when Cynthia Vanrenen broke in excitedly : `` I declare to goodness if the hotel people have not fastened on our boxes already .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 12]: They seem to know our minds better than we do ourselves .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 26]: And here is the man with the wraps ... Please be careful with that camera ... Yes , put it there , with the glasses .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 8]: What are you doing , Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 15]: for Medenham was discharging his obligations to the boy in buttons and a porter .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 13]: `` Paying my debts , '' said he , smiling at her .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 12]: `` Of course you realize that I pay all expenses ? ''
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 19]: she said , with just the requisite note of hauteur in her voice that the situation called for .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 16]: `` This is entirely a personal matter , I assure you , Miss Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 14]: Medenham could not help smiling ; he stooped and felt a tire unnecessarily .
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 4]: Cynthia was puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 23]: She wrote that evening to Irma Norris , her cousin in Philadelphia -- `` Fitzroy is a new line in chauffeurs . ''
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 11]: `` By the way , where is your trunk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 4]: she demanded suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 24]: `` I came away unexpectedly , so I have arranged that it shall be sent to Brighton by rail , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 10]: Apparently , there was nothing more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 15]: The two ladies seated themselves , and the car sped out into the Strand .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 47]: They watched the driver 's adroit yet scrupulously careful dealing with the traffic , and Cynthia , at least , quickly grasped the essential fact that the six cylinders worked with a silent power that held cheap every other vehicle passed or overtaken on the road .
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 17]: `` It is a lovely automobile , '' she murmured with a little sigh of satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 14]: `` Quite an up-to-date car , I fancy , '' agreed her friend .
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 20]: `` I do n't understand how this man , Fitzroy , can afford to use it for hiring purposes .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 10]: Yet , that is his affair -- not mine .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 5]: I rather like him .
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 5]: Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 17]: `` His manners are somewhat off-hand , but such persons are given to aping their superiors .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 10]: George Augustus Fitzroy , too -- it is ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 30]: Fitzroy is the family name of the Earls of Fairholme , and their eldest sons have been christened George Augustus ever since the beginning of the eighteenth century . ''
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 28]: `` The name seems to fit our chauffeur all right , and I guess he has as good a claim to it as any other man . ''
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 31]: Cynthia was apt to flaunt the Stars and Stripes when Mrs. Devar aired her class conventions , and the older woman had the tact to agree with a careless nod .
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 26]: Nevertheless , had Cynthia Vanrenen known how strictly accurate was her comment she would have been the most astounded girl in London at that minute .
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 35]: The Viscountcy , of course , was nothing more than a courtesy title ; in the cold eye of the law , Medenham 's full legal name was that which Mrs. Devar deemed ridiculous .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 42]: As events shaped themselves , it was of the utmost importance to Cynthia , and to Medenham , and to several other persons who had not yet risen above their common horizon , that Mrs. Devar 's sneer should pass unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 54]: Though that lady herself was not fashioned of the softer human clay which expresses its strenuous emotions by fainting fits or hysteria , some such feminine expedient would certainly have prevented her from going another hundred yards along the south road had some wizard told her how nearly she had guessed the truth .
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 13]: But the luck of the born adventurer saved Medenham from premature exposure .
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 28]: `` I dare all '' was the motto of his house , and it was fated to be tested in full measure ere he saw London again .
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 11]: Of these considerations the purring Mercury neither knew nor cared .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 37]: She sang the song of the free highway , and sped through the leafy lanes of Surrey with a fine disregard for Acts of Parliament and the `` rules and regulations therein made and provided . ''
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 30]: Soon after one o'clock , however , she was compelled to climb the road to the downs in meek agreement with two lines of toiling chars-√†-bancs and laboring motors .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 40]: Just to show her mettle when the opportunity offered , she took the steep hill opposite the stands with a greyhound rush that vastly disconcerted a policeman who told Medenham to `` hurry up out of the dip . ''
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 44]: Then , having found a clear space , she dozed for a while , and Cynthia , like a true-born American , began the day 's business by giving the answer before either of her companions even thought of putting the Great Question .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 6]: `` Grimalkin will win ! ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 8]: `` Mr. Deane told my father so .
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 10]: I want to play Grimalkin for ten dollars ! ''
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 32]: CHAPTER II THE FIRST DAY 'S RUN Though Medenham was no turf devotee , he formed distinctly unfavorable conclusions as to the financial stability of the bawling bookmakers near at hand .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 29]: `` If you wish to do any betting , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said , `` give me the money and I will invest it for you .
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 5]: There is no hurry .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 10]: The Derby will not be run till three o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 14]: We have an hour and a half in which to study form . ''
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 21]: For the life of him he could not imitate the complete annihilation of self practiced by the well-bred English servant .
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 42]: The American girl missed the absence of this trait far less than the other woman , but , by this time , even Mrs. Devar began to accept Medenham 's good-humored assumption of equality as part of the day 's amusement .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 6]: Cynthia handed him a card .
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 18]: She had bought three while they were crawling up the hill behind a break-load of jeering Cockneys .
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 9]: `` What will win the first race ? ''
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 19]: `` Father says you men often hear more than the owners about the real performances of horses . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 6]: Medenham tried to look knowing .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 9]: He thanked his stars for Dale 's information .
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 13]: `` I am told Eyot has a chance , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 12]: `` Well , put me a sovereign on Eyot , please .
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 12]: Are _ you _ playing the ponies , Mrs. Devar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 34]: That lady , being quick-witted , took care not to offend Cynthia by pretending not to understand , though it set Medenham 's teeth on edge to hear a racehorse called a pony .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 10]: She opened a gold purse and produced a coin .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 13]: `` I do n't mind risking a little , '' she tittered .
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 51]: Medenham found , however , that she also had handed him a sovereign , and his conscience smote him , for he guessed already , with accuracy as it happened , that she was Miss Vanrenen 's paid chaperon during the absence of the girl 's father on the Continent .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 18]: `` Personally , I am a duffer in matters connected with the turf , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 25]: `` A friend of mine -- a chauffeur -- mentioned Eyot -- '' `` Oh , that is all right , '' laughed Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 12]: `` I like the color -- Eau de Nil and white .
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 2]: Look !
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 5]: There he goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 36]: She had good eyes , as well as pretty ones , else she could not have distinguished the silk jacket worn by the rider of a horse cantering at that moment along the cleared course .
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 46]: Crowded coaches , four rows deep , lined the rails near the judge 's box , and the gay-hued parasols of their feminine occupants almost completely blocked the view , a distant one in any case , owing to the width of the intervening valley .
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 6]: Medenham raised no further protest .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 40]: He walked to a stand where a press of people betokened the presence of a popular layer of odds , found that Eyot 's price was chalked up at five to one , and backed him for four pounds .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 37]: He had to push and elbow his way through a struggling crowd ; immediately after the bet was made , Eyot 's quotation was reduced by two points in response to signals tick-tacked from the inclosures .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 26]: This , of course , argued a decided following for Dale 's selection , and these eleventh hour movements in the turf market are illuminative .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 19]: Before he got back to the car there was a mighty shout of `` They 're off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 17]: and he saw Cynthia Vanrenen stand on the seat to watch the race through her glasses .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 7]: Mrs. Devar stood up , too .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 32]: Both women were so intent on the troop of horses now streaming over the crest of the six-furlong course that he was able to stare his fill without attracting their attention .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 33]: `` I like Cynthia , '' he said to himself , `` though I shall be in a deuce of a mess if I meet her anywhere after this piece of masquerading .
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 21]: Not much chance of that , I expect , seeing that Dad and I go to Scotland early in July .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 11]: But what a bore to tumble across Jimmy 's mater !
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 22]: I hope it is not a case of ` like mother like son , ' because Jimmy is the limit . ''
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 18]: A strange roar , gathering force and volume each instant , rose from a hundred thousand throats .
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 14]: Soon the shout became insistent , and Cynthia Vanrenen yielded to its magnetism .
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 5]: `` Eyot wins ! ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 4]: she cried delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 11]: `` Yes , none of them can catch him now .
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 10]: Go on , jockey -- do n't look round !
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 16]: Oh , if I were your master I 'd give you such a talking to .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 2]: Ah-h-h !
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 11]: We 've won , Mrs. Devar -- we 've won !
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 6]: Just think of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 8]: `` How much , I wonder ? ''
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 11]: Mrs. Devar , though excited , had the calculating habit .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 17]: `` Five pounds each , '' said Medenham , who had approached unnoticed during the tumult .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 5]: Cynthia 's eyes sparkled .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 4]: `` Five pounds !
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 16]: Why , I heard some betting person over there offering only three to one . ''
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 20]: It was a task beyond his powers to curb an unruly tongue in the presence of this emancipated schoolgirl .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 7]: He met her ebullient mood halfway .
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 17]: `` I have evidently beaten the market -- that is , if I get the money .
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 3]: Horrible thought !
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 6]: I may be welshed ! ''
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 10]: He strode back rapidly to the bookmaker 's stand .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 11]: `` What do you think of our chauffeur now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 37]: cried Cynthia radiantly , for the winning of those few sovereigns was a real joy to her , and the shadow of the welsher had no terrors , since she did not know what Medenham meant .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 22]: `` He improves on acquaintance , '' admitted Mrs. Devar , thawing a little under the influence of a successful tip .
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 11]: He soon returned , and handed them six sovereigns apiece .
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 14]: `` My man paid up like a Briton , '' he said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 32]: `` I have no reliable information as to the next race , so what do you ladies say if we lunch quietly before we attack the ring for the Derby ? ''
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 6]: There was an awkward pause .
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 20]: The air of Epsom Downs is stimulating , especially after one has found the winner of the first race .
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 14]: `` We have not brought anything to eat , '' admitted Cynthia ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 29]: `` We ordered some sandwiches before leaving the hotel , and we mean to stop for tea at some old-world hotel in Reigate which Mrs. Devar recommends . ''
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 15]: `` Unfortunately I was not hungry at sandwich time , '' sighed Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 20]: `` If it comes to that , neither was I , whereas I have a most unromantic appetite now .
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 12]: But what can do , as the Babus say in India .
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 16]: I am rather inclined to doubt the quality of anything we can buy here . ''
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 6]: Medenham 's face lit up .
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 4]: `` India ! ''
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 8]: `` Have you been to India ? ''
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 6]: `` Yes , have you ?
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 11]: My father and I passed last cold weather there . ''
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 44]: Warned by a sudden expansion of Mrs. Devar 's prominent eyes , he gave a quick turn to a dangerous topic , since it was in Calcutta that the gallant ex-captain of Horton 's Horse had `` borrowed '' fifty pounds from him .
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 29]: Naturally , the lady omitted the telltale prefix to her son 's rank , but it was unquestionably true that the British army had dispensed with his services .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 29]: `` I was only thinking that acquaintance with the East , Miss Vanrenen , would prepare you for the mysterious workings of Kismet , '' said Medenham lightly .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 27]: `` When I came across Simmonds this morning I was bewailing the fact that my respected aunt had fallen ill and could not accompany me to-day .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 13]: May I offer you the luncheon which I provided for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 34]: He withdrew the wicker basket from its nook beneath the front seat ; before his astonished guests could utter a protest , it was opened , and he was deftly unpacking the contents .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 27]: `` But that is _ your _ luncheon , '' protested Cynthia , finding it incumbent on her to say something by way of polite refusal .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 10]: `` And his aunt 's , my dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 44]: In those few words Mrs. Devar conveyed skepticism as to the aunt and ready acceptance of the proffered fare ; but Medenham paid no heed ; he had discovered that the napkins , cutlery , even the plates , bore the family crest .
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 17]: The silver , too , was of a quality that could not fail to evoke comment .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 7]: `` Well , here goes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 6]: he growled under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 20]: `` If I come a purler it will not be for the first time where women are concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 13]: He laughed as he produced some lobster in aspic and a chicken .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 21]: `` It is jolly useful to have as a friend a butler in a big house , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 19]: `` I did n't know what Tomkinson had given me , but these confections look all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 15]: Mrs. Devar 's glance dwelt on the crest the instant she took a plate .
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 7]: She smiled in her superior way .
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 23]: While Medenham was wrestling with the cork of a bottle of claret she whispered : `` This is screamingly funny , Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 8]: I have solved the riddle at last .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 17]: Our chauffeur is using his master 's car and his master 's eatables as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 17]: `` Do n't care a cent , '' said Cynthia , who found the lobster admirable .
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 23]: `` But if any inquiry is made and our names are mixed up in it , Mr. Vanrenen may be angry . ''
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 8]: `` Father would be tickled to death .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 17]: I shall insist on paying for everything , of course , and my responsibility ends there .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 18]: No , thank you -- '' this to Medenham who was offering her a glass of wine .
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 6]: `` I drink water only .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 5]: Have you any ? ''
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 27]: Mrs. Devar took the wine , and Medenham fished in the basket for the St. Galmier , since Lady St. Maur cultivated gout with her biliousness .
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 6]: she murmured after a sip .
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 7]: `` What is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 3]: asked Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 6]: `` Perfect , my dear .
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 4]: Such a bouquet !
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 42]: I wonder what house it came from , '' and she pondered the crest again , but in vain , for heraldry is an exact science , and the greater part of her education had been given by a hard world .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 22]: She did not fail , therefore , to notice that three persons were catered for by the packer of the basket .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 19]: An unknown upper housemaid was already suspect , and now she added mentally `` some shop-girl friend . ''
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 10]: The climax was reached when Medenham staged the strawberries .
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 44]: Cynthia , to whom the good things of the table were commonplaces , ate them and was thankful , but Mrs. Devar made another note : `` Ten shillings a basket , at the very least ; and _ three baskets _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 17]: A deep , booming yell from the mob proclaimed that the second race was in progress .
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 30]: `` I ca n't see a thing unless I am perched on the seat , and if I stand up I shall upset the crockery , '' announced Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 9]: `` But I am not interested yet awhile .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 10]: If Grimalkin wins I shall shout myself hoarse . ''
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 14]: `` He has n't a ghost of a chance , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 7]: `` Oh , but he has .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 17]: Mr. Deane told my father -- '' `` But Tomkinson told me , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 3]: `` Tomkinson .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 7]: Is that your butler friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 10]: He says the King 's horse will win . ''
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 17]: `` Surely the owner of Grimalkin must know more about the race than a butler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 16]: `` You would not think so , Miss Vanrenen , if you knew Tomkinson . ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 7]: `` Where is he butler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 5]: asked Mrs. Devar suavely .
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 16]: `` I forget for the moment , madam , '' replied Medenham with equal suavity .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 6]: The lady waived the retort .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 8]: She was sure of her ground now .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 18]: `` In any case , I imagine that both Mr. Deane and this Tomkinson may be mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 31]: I am told that a horse trained locally has a splendid chance -- let me see -- yes , here it is : the Honorable Charles Fenton 's Vendetta . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 42]: It was well that those bulging steel-gray eyes were bent over the card , or they could not have failed to catch the flicker of amazement that swept across Medenham 's sun-browned face when he heard the name of his cousin .
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 28]: He had not been in England a full week as yet , and he happened not to have read a list of probable starters for the Derby .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 72]: He had glanced at the programme during breakfast that morning , but some remark made by the Earl caused him to lay down the newspaper , and , when next he picked it up , he became interested in an article on the Cape to Cairo railway , written by someone who had not the remotest notion of the difficulties to be surmounted before that very desirable line can be constructed .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 13]: Cynthia , however , was watching him , and she laughed gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 17]: `` Ah , Fitzroy , you had n't heard of Vendetta before , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 12]: `` Confess now -- your faith in Tomkinson is shaken . ''
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 15]: `` Vendetta certainly does sound like war to the knife , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 13]: `` It is twenty to one , '' purred Mrs. Devar complacently .
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 27]: `` I shall risk the five pounds I won on the first race , and it will be very nice if I receive a hundred . ''
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 13]: `` I stick to Old Glory , '' announced the valiant Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 516 len. 56]: `` The King for me , '' declared Medenham , though he realized , without any knowledge of the merits of the horses engaged , that the Honorable Charles was not the sort of man to run a three-year-old in the Derby merely for the sake of seeing his racing colors flashing in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 517 len. 14]: Mrs. Devar kept to her word , and handed over the five pounds .
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 55]: Cynthia staked seven , the five she had won and the ten dollars of her original intent : whereupon Medenham said that he must cross the course and make these bets in the ring -- would the ladies raise any objection to his absence , as he could not return until after the race ?
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 22]: No , they were quite content to remain in the car , so he repacked the luncheon basket and left them .
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 6]: Vendetta won by three lengths .
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 33]: Medenham had secured twenty-five to one , and the bookmaker who paid him added the genial advice : `` Put that little lot where the flies ca n't get at it . ''
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 25]: The man could afford to be affable , seeing that the bet was the only one in his book against the horse 's name .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 37]: The King 's horse and Grimalkin were the public favorites , but both were hopelessly shut in at Tattenham Corner , and neither showed in the front rank at any stage of a fast run race .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 25]: When Medenham climbed the hill again , hot and uncomfortable in his leather clothing , Mrs. Devar actually welcomed him with an expansive smile .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 9]: `` What odds did you get me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 11]: she cried , as soon as he was within earshot .
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 15]: `` A hundred and twenty-five pounds to five , madam , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 6]: `` Oh , what luck !
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 11]: You must keep the odd five pounds , Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 6]: `` No , thank you .
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 12]: I hedged on Vendetta , so I am still winning . ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 8]: `` But really , I insist . ''
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 8]: He handed her a bundle of notes .
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 28]: `` You will find a hundred and thirty pounds there , '' he said , and she understood that his refusal to accept her money was final .
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 36]: She was intensely surprised that he had given her so much more than she expected , and the first unworthy thought was succeeded by a second -- how dared this impudent chauffeur decline her bounty ?
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 5]: Cynthia pouted at him .
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 11]: `` Your Tomkinson is a fraud , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 11]: `` Your Grimalkin was well named , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 13]: `` That remark is very cutting , I suppose , Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 5]: `` Oh , no .
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 14]: I merely meant to convey that a cat is not a racehorse . ''
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 16]: `` Poor fellow , '' mused Cynthia , `` he is vexed because he lost .
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 26]: I must make it up to him somehow , but he is such an extraordinary person , I hardly dare suggest such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 10]: She began to adjust her veil and dust coat .
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 26]: `` If you are ready , Mrs. Devar , '' she said , `` I think we ought to hit the pike for Brighton . ''
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 4]: Mrs. Devar laughed .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 16]: Fitzroy evidently understood , as he had taken his seat and the engine was humming .
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 10]: `` Americanisms are most fascinating , '' she vowed .
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 12]: `` I wish you would use more of them , Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 5]: I love them . ''
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 18]: Cynthia was slightly ruffled , though if pressed for a reason she could hardly have given one .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 22]: `` Slang is useful occasionally , but I am trying to cure myself of the habit , '' she said tartly .
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 8]: `` A picturesque phrase is always pardonable .
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 7]: Oh , is this quite safe ?
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 24]: -- '' The Mercury , finding an opening , had shot down the hill with a smooth celerity that alarmed the older woman .
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 5]: Cynthia leaned back composedly .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 22]: `` Fitzroy means to reach the road before the police stop the traffic for the next race , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 41]: Then , after a pause , she added : `` I wish we could keep this car for the rest of our tour , yet I suppose I ought not to interfere in the arrangement father made with Simmonds . ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 4]: Mrs. Devar frowned .
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 37]: Her momentary tremor had fled , and she had every cause to regard with uneasiness the threatened substitution during the forthcoming ten days , of this quite impossible Fitzroy for that very chauffeur-like person , Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 62]: Her acquaintance with Peter Vanrenen and his daughter was sufficiently intimate to warn her that Cynthia 's least desire was granted by her indulgent parent ; in fact , Cynthia would have been hopelessly spoilt were it not for a combination of those happy chances which seem to conspire at times in the creation of the American girl at her best .
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 25]: She was devoted to her father , her nature was bright and cheerful , and she had a heart that bubbled over with kindliness .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 9]: Mrs. Devar chose the right line of attack .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 10]: She resolved to appeal to the girl 's sympathies .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 23]: `` I am afraid it would be a rather cruel thing to deprive Simmonds of his engagement , '' she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 45]: `` He has bought a car , I understand , on the strength of the contract with Mr. Vanrenen -- '' `` That does n't cut any ice -- I mean there would be no ill effect for Simmonds , '' explained Cynthia hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 23]: `` Father will meet us in London at the end of our run , and Simmonds could come to us then . ''
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 5]: The steel-gray eyes narrowed .
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 8]: Their owner was compelled to decide quickly .
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 21]: As opposition was useless , she laughed , with the careless ease of one who was in no way concerned .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 26]: `` Do n't you think , '' she said , `` that if your father sees this car Simmonds will be dispensed with somehow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: Cynthia nodded .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 5]: The argument was unanswerable .
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 39]: They were crossing the course at a walking pace ; at that point a sort of passage was kept clear by the police for the convenience of those occupants of the stands who wished to visit the paddock .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 32]: The owner of Vendetta , having been congratulated by royalty , was taking some friends to admire the horse during the rubbing-down process , when his glance suddenly fell on Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 9]: Though amazed , he was not rendered speechless .
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 10]: `` Well , I 'm -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 21]: But the Mercury possessed a singularly loud and clear motor-horn , and the voice of the Honorable Charles was drowned .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 7]: Still , his gestures were eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 30]: Quite obviously , he was saying to a man whose arm he caught : `` Did you ever in your life see anybody more like George than that chauffeur ?
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 9]: Why , damme , it is Medenham ! ''
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 8]: So Mrs. Devar lost a golden opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 24]: She knew Fenton by sight , and her shrewd wits must have set her on the right track had she witnessed his bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 31]: Being a pretentious person , however , and not able to afford the up-keep of a motor , she was enjoying the surprise of two well-dressed women who recognized her .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 15]: Then the car leaped forward again , and she scored a dearly won triumph .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 20]: At this crisis Medenham 's scrutiny of the road map provided by Simmonds for the tour was well repaid .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 39]: He turned sharp to the right past the back of the stands , and was fortunate in finding enough clear road to render pursuit by his elderly cousin a vain thing , even if it were thought of .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 23]: The Mercury had to cross the caravan zone carefully , but once Tattenham Corner was reached the way lay open to Reigate .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 17]: Through a land of gorse and heather they sped until they came to the famous hill .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 20]: They ran down in a noiseless flight that caused Cynthia to experience the sensation of being borne on wings .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 17]: `` I imagine that aeroplaning is something like this , '' she confided to her companion .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 10]: `` If it is , it must be enjoyable .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 30]: I do n't suppose , at my time of life , I shall ever try to navigate the air in one of those frail contrivances pictured in the newspapers .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 16]: But I was nearly tempted to go up in a balloon two years ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 14]: Cynthia stole a glance at Mrs. Devar 's rotund figure , and laughed .
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 21]: She could not help it , though she flushed furiously at what she deemed an involuntary rudeness on her part .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 30]: `` Oh , it sounds funny , I have no doubt , '' said the other , placidly good-tempered , `` but I really meant it at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 11]: You have met Count Edouard Marigny , I fancy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 8]: `` Yes , in Paris last month .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 7]: In fact -- '' Cynthia hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 19]: She had scarcely recovered from the excitement of the racing and was not choosing her words quite happily .
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 10]: Mrs. Devar , still sugary , ended the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 17]: `` In fact , it was he who recommended me to Mr. Vanrenen as your chaperon .
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 13]: Yes , my dear , Monsieur Marigny and I are old friends .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 13]: He and my son are inseparable when Captain Devar is in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 50]: Well , as I was saying , the Count offered to take me up in his balloon , L'Etoile , and I was ready to go , but the weather became stormy and an ascent from the Velo was impossible , or highly dangerous , at any rate . ''
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 32]: Mrs. Devar cultivated the high-pitched voice that she regarded as the hall-mark of good breeding , and , in that silent rush downhill , Medenham could not avoid hearing each syllable .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 39]: It was eminently pleasing to listen to Cynthia 's praise of his car , and he was wroth with the other woman for wrenching the girl 's thoughts away so promptly from a topic dear to his heart .
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 13]: Therein he erred , for the gods were being kind to him .
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 25]: Little recking how valuable was the information he had just been given , he slackened speed somewhat , and leaned back in the seat .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 14]: `` We are nearing Reigate now , '' he remarked with half-turned head .
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 12]: `` The town begins on the other side of that tunnel .
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 12]: Which inn do you wish to stop at for tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 16]: `` It seems to me that I have barely ended lunch , '' said Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 22]: `` Shall we cut out your old-world Reigate inn , Mrs. Devar , and take tea at Crawley or Handcross ? ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 5]: `` By all means .
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 12]: How well you know the names of the towns and villages .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 12]: Yet you have never before visited this part of England . ''
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 14]: `` We Americans are nothing if not thorough , '' answered the girl .
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 18]: `` I would not be happy if I failed to look up our route on the map .
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 22]: More than that , I note the name of each river we cross and try to identify every range of hills .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 10]: You must test me and count my mistakes . ''
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 14]: Mrs. Devar spread her hands in a gesture copied from her French acquaintances .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 12]: `` My dear , I am the most ignorant person geographically .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 23]: I remember how that delightful Count Edouard laughed when I asked him if the Loire joined the Seine above or below Paris .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 13]: It seems that I was thinking of the Oise all the time .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 12]: The Marchioness of Belfort told me of my error afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 9]: Cynthia laughed merrily , but made no reply .
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 13]: Medenham bent over the levers and the car danced on through Reigate .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 11]: Mrs. Devar impressed him as a despicable type of tuft-hunter .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 91]: His acquaintance with the species was not extensive ; he had read of elderly dowagers who eked out their slender means by introducing the daughters of rich Americans to English society , and the thing was not in itself wholly indefensible ; but he felt sure that Cynthia Vanrenen needed no such social sponsor , while the mere bracketing of Count Edouard Marigny with `` Jimmy '' Devar caused him to regard this unknown Frenchman with a suspicion that was already active enough so far as Mrs. Devar was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 8]: And the Marchioness of Belfort , too !
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 11]: A decrepit old cadger with an infallible system for roulette !
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 9]: Perhaps his mood communicated itself to the accelerator .
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 36]: At any rate , the Mercury seemed to sympathize , and it was a lucky hazard that kept the glorious stretch of road between Reigate and Crawley free of police traps on that memorable Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 54]: The car simply leaped out of Surrey into Sussex , the undulating parklands on both sides of the smooth highway appearing to float past in stately procession , and there was a fine gleam in Cynthia 's blue eyes when the first check to a splendid run came in the outskirts of Crawley .
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 10]: She leaned forward and tapped him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 10]: `` Tea here , please , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 38]: Then she added , as if it were an afterthought : `` If you promise to let her rip in that style after we reach the open country again I shall sit on the front seat . ''
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 9]: The words were almost whispered into his ear .
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 24]: Certainly they were not meant to enlighten Mrs. Devar , and Medenham , turning , found his face very near the girl 's .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 29]: `` I 'm bribed , '' he answered , and not until both were settled back in their seats did they realize that either had said anything unusual .
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 32]: Medenham , however , took his cup of tea _ √† la chauffeur _ , helping himself to bread and butter from a plate deposited on the bonnet by a waiting-maid .
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 21]: When the ladies reappeared from the interior of a roadside restaurant he was in his place , ready to start .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 20]: He did not offer to put them in the car , adjust their wraps , and close the door .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 33]: If Miss Vanrenen liked to keep her promise , that was her affair , but no action on his part would hint of prior knowledge that she intended to ride in front .
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 25]: Nevertheless , he could not repress a smile when he heard Mrs. Devar 's distinctly chilly , `` Oh , not at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 15]: in response to Cynthia 's polite apology for deserting her until they neared Brighton .
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 18]: Somehow , the car underwent a subtle change when the girl took her seat by his side .
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 14]: From a machine quivering with life and power it became a triumphal chariot .
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 40]: By sheer perfection of mechanical energy it had bridged the gulf that lay between the millionaire 's daughter and the hired man , since there could be no question that Cynthia Vanrenen placed Viscount Medenham in no other category .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 59]: Indeed , his occasional lapses from the demeanor of a lower social grade might well have earned him her marked disfavor , and , as there was no shred of personal vanity in his character , he gave all the credit to the sentient creature of steel and iron that was so ready to respond to his touch .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 14]: Swayed by an unconscious telepathy , the girl almost interpreted his unspoken thought .
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 23]: She watched his deft manipulation of levers and brakes , and fancied that his hands dwelt on the steering-wheel with a caress .
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 29]: `` You have a real lovely automobile , Fitzroy , '' she said , `` and I have a sort of notion that you are devoted to it .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 11]: May I ask -- is it your own car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 7]: I bought it six months ago .
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 34]: I learnt to drive in France , and , as soon as I heard of the new American engine , I -- er -- could n't rest until I had tried it . ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 24]: He was on the point of saying something wholly different , but managed to twist the second half of the sentence in time .
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 36]: What would Miss Vanrenen have thought had he continued : `` I sent my chauffeur to England , and , on receipt of his report , I had this car shipped within a week ? ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 27]: There are problems too deep for speculation when a man is guiding a ton of palpitating metal along a hedge-lined road at forty miles an hour .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 4]: This was one .
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 20]: Cynthia , knowing nothing of any `` new American engine , '' would die rather than confess her ignorance .
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 11]: Moreover , she was pondering a problem of her own .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 16]: If it was not his master 's car he might be open to a bargain .
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 13]: `` Simmonds is an old friend of yours , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 10]: `` Yes , I have known him some years .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 8]: We were in South Africa together . ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 10]: `` In the war , do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 4]: `` How dreadful !
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 7]: Have you ever killed anybody ? ''
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 12]: `` Not with petrol , I am happy to state . ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 6]: There was an eloquent pause .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 16]: Cynthia examined his reply , and discovered that it covered a good deal of ground .
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 14]: Perhaps , too , it conveyed the least little bit of a snub .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 7]: Hence , her tone stiffened perceptibly .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 51]: `` I mentioned Simmonds , '' she explained , `` because I think my father might arrange -- to the satisfaction of all parties , of course -- that you should carry through this present tour , while Simmonds would come into our service when we return to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 3]: Medenham laughed .
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 28]: In its way , the compliment was graceful and well meant , but the utter absurdity of his position was now thrust upon him with overwhelming force .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 39]: `` I am very much obliged to you , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said , venturing to look once more into those alluring eyes , so shy , so daring , so divinely wise and childishly candid .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 30]: `` If circumstances permitted , there is nothing I would like better than to take you through this Paradise of a June England ; but it is quite impossible .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 23]: Simmonds must bring his car to Bristol , as I positively can not be absent from town longer than three days . ''
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 5]: Cynthia did not pout .
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 47]: She nodded appreciation of the weighty if undescribed business that called Fitzroy and his Mercury back to London , but in her heart she mused on the strangeness of things , and wondered if this smiling land produced many chauffeurs who lauded it in such phrases .
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 27]: Up and down Handcross Hill they whirred , treating that respectable eminence as if it were a snow bump in the path of a flying toboggan .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 41]: Medenham had roamed the South Downs as a boy , and he was able now to point out Chanctonbury Ring , the Devil 's Dyke , Ditchling Beacon , and the rest of the round-shouldered giants that guard the Weald .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 39]: In the mellow light of a superlatively fine afternoon the Downs wore their gayest raiment of blue and purple , red and green -- decked , too , with ribands of white roads and ruffs of rose-laden hedges .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 60]: Cynthia forgot many times , and he hardly ever remembered , that he was a chauffeur , and the miles , too , were disregarded until the sea sparkled in their eyes as they emerged from the great gap which the Devil forebore to use when he planned to swamp a land of churches by cutting the famous dyke .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 29]: Then the girl awoke from a day-dream , and the car was stopped on the pretense that this marvelous landscape must be viewed in silence and at rest .
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 30]: She rejoined Mrs. Devar , and began instantly to expatiate on the beauties of Sussex , so Medenham ran slowly down the hill through Patcham and Preston into Brighton .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 59]: And there , sitting in the wide porch of the Hotel Metropole , was a slim , handsome Frenchman , who sprang up with all the vivacity of his race when the Mercury drew up at the foot of the steps , dusty after its long run , but circumspect as though it had just quitted the garage .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 7]: `` Mrs. Devar , Miss Vanrenen !
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 6]: what a delightful surprise ! ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 13]: cried the stranger with an accompaniment of wide smiles and hat flourishing .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 10]: `` Who would have thought of meeting you here ?
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 24]: _ Voyez _ , _ donc _ , I was moping in solitude when suddenly the sky opens and you appear . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 23]: _ De√¶ ex machin√¢ _ , in fact , Monsieur Marigny , '' said Cynthia , shaking hands with this overjoyed gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 9]: Mrs. Devar , not understanding , cackled loudly .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 32]: `` We 've had a lovely run from town , Count Edouard , '' she gushed , `` and it is just too awfully nice of you to be in Brighton .
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 19]: Now , _ do n't _ say you have made all sorts of engagements for the evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 34]: `` Such as they are they go by the board , dear lady , '' said the gallant Count , who had good teeth , and showed them in a succession of grins .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 24]: `` Ten to-morrow morning , Fitzroy , '' said Cynthia , turning on the steps as she was about to enter the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 5]: He lifted his cap .
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 14]: `` The car will be ready , Miss Vanrenen , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 30]: He got down , and scowled , yes , actually scowled , at a porter who was hauling too strongly at the straps and buckles of the dust-covered trunks .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 24]: `` Damage the car 's paint and I 'll raise bigger blisters on yours , '' was what he said to the man .
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 29]: But his thoughts were of Count Edouard Marigny , and , like the people 's discussion of the Derby , they took the form of question and answer .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 10]: `` When is a coincidence not a coincidence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 4]: he asked himself .
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 11]: `` When it is prearranged , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 33]: Then he drove round to the yard at the rear of the hotel , where Dale awaited him , for Medenham would intrust the cleaning of the car to no other hands .
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 17]: `` You 've booked my room at the Grand Hotel and taken my bag there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 7]: `` Yes , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 29]: `` Make these people give you the key when the door is locked for the night , and bring the car to my hotel at nine o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 10]: He hurried away , and Dale looked after him .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 14]: `` Something must ha ' worried his lordship , '' said the man .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 13]: `` First time I 've ever seen him in a bad temper .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 6]: An ' what about Eyot ?
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 7]: Three to one the paper says .
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 11]: P'raps he 'll think of it in the morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 33]: CHAPTER III SOME EMOTIONS -- WITHOUT A MORAL Not until he was dressing , and the contents of his pockets were spread on a table , did Medenham remember Dale 's commission .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 25]: It was quite true , as he told Mrs. Devar , that he had backed Vendetta for a small stake on his own account .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 18]: But that was an afterthought , and the bet was made with another bookmaker at reduced odds .
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 43]: Altogether , including the few sovereigns in his possession at the beginning of the day , he counted nearly fifty pounds in gold , an exceptionally large amount to be carried in England , where considerations of weight alone render banknotes preferable .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 24]: He slipped Dale 's money into an envelope , and took thirty pounds to be exchanged for notes by the hotel 's cashier .
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 34]: At the same time he wrote a telegram to his father , destroying two drafts before he evolved something that left his story untold while quieting any scruples as to lack of candor .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 42]: It was not that the Earl would resent his unexpected disappearance after nearly four years ' absence from home , because father and son had met in South Africa during the war , and were together in Cannes and Paris subsequently .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 10]: His difficulty was to explain this freak journey satisfactorily .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 19]: The Earl of Fairholme held feudal views anent the place occupied in the world by the British aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 52]: His own hot youth was crowded with episodes that Medenham might regard with disdain , yet he would be shocked out of his well-fed cynicism by the notion that his son was gallivanting round the country as the chauffeur of an unconventional American girl and a middle-aged harpy like Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 7]: So Medenham 's message was non-committal .
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 9]: Aunt Susan was unable to come Epsom to-day .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 9]: Have taken car to Brighton , and Bournemouth .
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 6]: Home Saturday , perhaps earlier .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 2]: GEORGE .
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 11]: Of course , he meant to fill in details verbally .
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 27]: It was possible in conversation to impart a jesting turn to an adventure which would be unconvincing and ambiguous in the bald phrases of a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 34]: Then he dined , filled a cigarette case from the box of Salonikas which Tomkinson had not omitted to pack with his clothes , and strolled out , bare-headed , to enrich Dale .
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 26]: He could trust his man absolutely , and was quite sure that the Mercury would then be in the drying stage after a thorough cleaning .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 19]: Thus far he was justified , but he had not counted on the pride of the born mechanic .
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 44]: Though the car was housed for the night , when he entered the garage the hood was off , and Dale was annoying two brothers of the craft by explaining the superiority of _ his _ engine to every other type of engine .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 25]: All three were bent over the cylinders , and Dale was saying : `` Just take a squint at them valves , will you ?
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 8]: -- ever seen anything like 'em before ?
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 6]: Of course you have n't .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 8]: Do n't look like valves , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 15]: Can you break 'em , can you warp 'em , can you pit 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 9]: D'ye twig how the mixture reaches the cylinder ?
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 14]: None of your shoulders or kinks to choke it up -- is there ?
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 8]: -- and the same with the exhaust .
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 19]: Would you ever have a mushroom valve again after you 've once cast your peepers over this arrangement ?
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 33]: Now , if I took up areonotting -- if _ I _ wanted to fly the Channel -- '' He stopped abruptly , having seen his master standing in the open doorway .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 24]: `` By gad , Dale , '' cried Medenham , `` I have never heard your tongue wagging in that fashion before . ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 4]: Dale was flustered .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 16]: `` Beg pardon , my lord , but I was only -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 9]: `` Only using the cut-out , I fancy .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 10]: Come here , I want you a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 12]: The other chauffeurs suddenly discovered that they had urgent business elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 3]: They vanished .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 7]: Dale thought it necessary to explain .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 35]: `` One of them chaps has a new French car , my lord , and he was blowing so loudly about it that I had to take him down a peg or two . ''
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 4]: Medenham grew interested .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 15]: Like every keen motorist , he could `` talk shop '' at all times .
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 7]: `` What sort of car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 9]: `` A 59 Du Vallon , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 25]: It is the first of its class in England , and I rather think his guv ` nor is running it on show . ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 3]: `` Indeed .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 7]: Who is _ he _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 8]: `` A count Somebody-or-other , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 14]: I did hear his name -- '' `` Not Count Edouard Marigny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 11]: said Medenham , with a sharp emphasis that startled Dale .
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 8]: `` That 's him , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 10]: I hope I have n't done anything wrong . ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 28]: Medenham , early in life , had formed the habit of not expressing his feelings when really vexed , and it stood him in good stead now .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 25]: Dale 's blunder was almost irreparable , yet he could not find it in his heart to blame the man for being an enthusiast .
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 18]: `` You have put me in a deuce of a fix , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 9]: `` This Frenchman is acquainted with Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 16]: He knows she is here , and will probably see her off in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 15]: If his chauffeur recognizes the car he will be sure to speak of it .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 8]: That gives the whole show away . ''
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 20]: `` I 'm very sorry , my lord -- '' `` Dash it all , there you go again .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 8]: But it is largely my own fault .
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 17]: I ought to have warned you , though I little expected this sort of a mix-up .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 16]: In future , Dale , while this trip lasts , you must forget my title .
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 50]: Look here , I have brought you your winnings over Eyot -- ca n't you rig up some sort of a yarn that I am a sporting friend of yours , and that you were just trying to be funny when you addressed me as ` my lord ' ?
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 23]: If you have an opportunity , tell Count Marigny 's man that your job is taken temporarily by a driver named Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 13]: By the way , is the chauffeur a Frenchman , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 8]: `` No , my l -- . ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 14]: Dale caught Medenham 's eye , a very cold eye at that instant .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 5]: `` No , sir .
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 11]: He 's just a fitter from the London agency . ''
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 9]: `` Well , we must trust to luck .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 20]: He may not remember me in my chauffeur 's kit , which is beastly uncomfortable , by the way .
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 8]: I must get you a summer rig .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 11]: Here is your money -- five to one I took .
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 17]: Do n't lose sight of those two fellows , and spend this half sovereign on them .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 30]: If you can fill that chap with beer to-night he may have a head in the morning that will keep him in bed too late to cause any mischief .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 20]: When we meet in Bournemouth and Bristol , say nothing to anybody about either the car or me . ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 27]: Dale was a model of sobriety , but the excitement of `` fives '' when he looked for `` threes '' was too much for him .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 22]: `` I 'll tank him all right , my l -- , I mean , sir , '' he vowed cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 12]: Medenham lit a new cigarette and strolled out of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 15]: From the corner of his eye he saw Marigny 's helper looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 25]: Without undue exaggeration , he craned his neck , rounded his shoulders , and carried himself with the listless air of a Piccadilly idler .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 47]: He reflected , too , that a bare-headed man in evening dress would not readily be identified with a leather-coated chauffeur , and Dale , he hoped , was sufficiently endowed with mother wit to frame a story plausible enough to account for his unforeseen appearance .
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 32]: On the whole , the position was not so bad as it seemed in that first moment when the owner of the 59 Du Vallon was revealed in the handsome Count .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 15]: In any event , what did it matter if his harmless subterfuge were revealed ?
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 12]: The girl would surely laugh , while Mrs. Devar would squirm .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 14]: So now for a turn along the front , and then to bed .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 17]: It was a perfect June evening , the fitting sequel to a day of unbroken sunshine .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 45]: A marvelous amber light hovered beyond the level line of the sea to the west ; an exquisite blue suffused the horizon from south to east , deepening from sapphire to ultramarine as it blended with the soft shadows of a summer 's night .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 48]: He found himself comparing the sky 's southeasterly tint with the azure depths of Cynthia Vanrenen 's eyes , but he shook off that fantasy quickly , crossed the roadway and promenade , and , propping himself against the railings , turned a resolute back on romance .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 46]: He did not gain a great deal by this maneuver , since his next active thought was centered in a species of quest for the particular window among all those storeyed rows through which Cynthia Vanrenen might even then be gazing at the shining ocean .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 6]: He looked at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 3]: Half-past nine .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 14]: `` I am behaving like a blithering idiot , '' he told himself .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 28]: `` Miss Vanrenen and her friends are either on the pier listening to the band , or sitting over their coffee in the glass cage behind there .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 12]: I 'll wire Simmonds in the morning to hurry up . ''
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 16]: A man descended the steps of the hotel and walked straight across King 's Road .
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 34]: A light gray overcoat , thrown wide on his shoulders , gave a lavish display of frilled shirt , and a gray Homburg hat was set rakishly on one side of his head .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 36]: In the half light Medenham at once discerned the regular , waxen-skinned features of Count Marigny , and during the next few seconds it really seemed as if the Frenchman were making directly for him .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 42]: But another man , short , rotund , very erect of figure , and strutting in gait , came from the interior of a `` shelter '' that stood a little to the right of Medenham 's position on the rails .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 10]: `` Hello , Marigny , '' said he jauntily .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 8]: The Count looked back towards the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 5]: His tubby acquaintance chuckled .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 11]: The effort squeezed an eyeglass out of his right eye .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 9]: `` Aie pas peur , mon vieux ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 7]: cried he in very colloquial French .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 21]: `` My mother sent a note to say that the fair Cynthia has retired to her room to write letters .
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 9]: I have been waiting here ten minutes . ''
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 20]: Now , it chanced that Medenham 's widespread touring in France had rubbed up his knowledge of the language .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 49]: It is ever the ear that needs training more than the tongue , and in all likelihood he would not have caught the exact meaning of the words were it not for the hap of recent familiarity with the accents of all sorts and conditions of French-speaking folk .
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 5]: `` Jimmy Devar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 13]: he breathed , and his amazement lost him Marigny 's muttered answer .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 21]: But he heard Devar 's confident outburst as the two walked off together in the direction of the West Pier .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 11]: `` You are growing positively nervous , my dear Edouard .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 3]: And why ?
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 6]: The affair arranges itself admirably .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 17]: I shall be always on hand , ready to turn up exactly at the right moment .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 40]: What the deuce , this is the luck of a lifetime ... '' The squeaky , high-pitched voice -- a masculine variant of Mrs. Devar 's ultra-fashionable intonation -- died away midst the chatter and laughter of other promenaders .
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 35]: Medenham 's first impulse was to follow and listen , since Devar had yielded to the common delusion of imagining that none except his companion on the sea-front that night understood a foreign language .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 21]: But he swept the notion aside ere it had well presented itself as a means of solving an astounding puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 19]: `` No , dash it all , I 'm not a private detective , '' he muttered angrily .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 6]: `` Why should I interfere ?
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 11]: Confound Simmonds , and d -- n that railway van !
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 25]: I have a good mind to hand the car over to Dale in the morning and return to town by the first train . ''
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 32]: If he really meant what he said he ought to have gone back to his hotel , played billiards for an hour , and sought his bedroom with an easy conscience .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 62]: He was debating the point when the conceit intruded itself that Cynthia 's pretty head was at that moment bent over a writing-table in a certain well-lighted corner apartment of the second floor , so he compromised with his half-formed intent , whisked round to face the sea again , and lighted another cigarette from the glowing end of its predecessor .
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 14]: Some part of his unaccountable irritation took wings with the cloud of smoke .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 15]: `` Blessed if I can tell why I should worry , '' he communed .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 50]: `` Never saw the girl before to-day ... shall never see her again if I put Dale in charge ... Her father must be a special sort of fool , though , to trust her to the care of the Devar woman ... What was it that rotter said ?
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 9]: -- ` The affair arranges itself admirably . '
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 10]: And he would be ` always on hand . '
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 5]: What is arranging itself ?
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 24]: ... And why should Jimmy Devar be ready , if need be , ` to turn up exactly at the right moment ? '
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 15]: I suppose the answer to the first bit of the acrostic is simple enough .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 20]: Cynthia Vanrenen is to become the Countess Marigny , and the Devar gang stands in on the cash proceeds .
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 6]: Oh , a nice scheme !
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 9]: This Frenchman is posted as to the tour .
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 21]: By the most curious of coincidences he will reappear at Bournemouth , or Bristol , or in the Wye Valley .
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 11]: What more natural than a day 's run in company ?
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 8]: ... Ah , I 've got it !
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 50]: Jimmy is to come along when Marigny thinks that Cynthia will take a seat in the 59 Du Vallon for a change -- just to try the new French car ... By gad , I shall have a word to say there ... Steady , now , George Augustus !
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 13]: Woa , my boy ; keep a tight hand on the reins .
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 15]: Why in thunder should you concern yourself with the wretched business , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 7]: It was a marvelously still night .
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 19]: Beneath him , on an asphalted path nearly level with the stone-strewed beach , passed a young couple .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 9]: The man 's voice came up to him .
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 27]: `` Jones expects to be taken into partnership after this season , and I am pretty certain to be given the management of the woolen department .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 38]: If that comes off , no more long hours in the shop for you , Lucy , but a nice little house up there on the hill , just as quick as we can find it . ''
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 35]: `` Oh , Charlie dear , I shall never be tired then ... '' A black arm was suddenly silhouetted across the shoulders of a white blouse , whose wearer received a reassuring hug .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 59]: `` Let 's reckon up , '' said the owner of the arm -- `` July , August , September -- three months , sweetheart ... '' Medenham had never given a thought to marrying until his father hinted at the notion during dinner the previous evening , and he had laughed at it , being absolutely heart-whole .
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 43]: There was something irresistibly comical then about the Earl 's bland theory that Fairholme House needed a sprightly viscountess , yet now , twenty-four hours later , he could extract no shred of humor from the idyl of a draper 's assistant .
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 16]: It seemed to be a perfectly natural thing that these lovers should talk of mating .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 38]: Of what else should they whisper on this midsummer 's night , when the gloaming already bore the promise of dawn , and the glory of the sea and sky spread quiet harmonies through the silent air ?
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 36]: Perhaps he sighed as he turned away , but his own evidence on that point would be inconclusive , since the first object his wondering eyes dwelt on was the graceful figure of Cynthia Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 7]: There was no possibility of error .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 30]: An arc lamp blazed overhead , and , to make assurance doubly sure , his recognition of Cynthia was obviously duplicated by Cynthia 's recognition of her deputy chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 12]: In the girl 's case some degree of surprise was justified .
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 30]: It is a truism of social life that far more distinctiveness is attached to the seemingly democratic severity of evening dress than to any other class of masculine garniture .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 17]: Medenham now looked exactly what he was -- a man born and bred in the purple .
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 13]: No one could possibly mistake this well-groomed soldier for Dale or Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 28]: His clever , resourceful face , his erect carriage , the very suggestion of mess uniform conveyed by his clothing , told of lineage and a career .
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 34]: He might , in sober earnest , have been compelled to earn a living by driving a motor-car , but no freak of fortune could rob him of his birthright as an aristocrat .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 15]: Of course , Cynthia was easily first in the effort to recover disturbed wits .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 21]: `` Like myself , you have been tempted out by this beautiful night , Mr. Fitzroy , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 27]: Then `` Mr. '' was a concession to his attire ; somehow she imagined it would savor of presumption if she addressed him as an inferior .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 30]: She could not define her mental attitude in words , but her quick intelligence responded to its subtle influence as a mirrored lake records the passing of a breeze .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 14]: Very dainty and self-possessed she looked as she stood there smiling at him .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 9]: Her motor dust-coat was utilized as a wrap .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 26]: Beneath it she wore a white muslin dress of a studied simplicity that , to another woman 's assessing gaze , would reveal its expensiveness .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 45]: She had tied a veil of delicate lace around her hair and under her chin , and Medenham noted , with a species of awe , that her eyes , so vividly blue in daylight , were now dark as the sky at night .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 6]: And he was strangely tongue-tied .
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 14]: He found nothing to say until after a pause that verged on awkwardness .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 5]: Then he floundered badly .
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 24]: `` I am prepared to vouch for any explanation so long as it brings you here , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 5]: Cynthia wanted to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 38]: It was sufficiently ridiculous to be compelled , as it were , to treat a paid servant as an equal , but it savored of madness to find him verging on the perilous borderland of a flirtation .
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 15]: `` Do you wish , then , to consult me on any matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 7]: she asked , with American directness .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 14]: `` I was standing here and thinking of you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 8]: `` Perhaps that accounts for your appearance .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 59]: Since you have visited India you may have heard that the higher Buddhists , when they are anxious that another person shall act according to their desire , remain motionless in front of that person 's residence and concentrate ardent thought on their fixed intent ... Sitting in _ dhurma _ on a man , they call it .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 11]: I suppose the same principle applies to a woman . ''
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 19]: `` It follows that you are a higher Buddhist , and that you willed I should come out .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 11]: Your theory of sitting on the door-mat , is it ?
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 21]: wobbles a bit in practice , because I really ran downstairs to tell Mrs. Devar something I had forgotten previously .
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 10]: Not finding her , I decided on a stroll .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 16]: Instead of crossing the road I walked up to the left a couple of blocks .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 20]: Then I noticed the pier , and meant to have a look at it before returning to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 14]: Anyhow , you wanted me , Mr. Fitzroy , and here I am .
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 8]: What can I do for you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 37]: Her tone of light raillery , supplemented by that truly daring adaptation of the method of gaining a cause favored by the esoteric philosophy of the East , went far to restore Medenham 's wandering faculties .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 17]: `` I wanted to ask you a few questions , Miss Vanrenen , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 11]: `` Pray do , as they say in Boston . ''
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 8]: But he was not quite himself yet .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 15]: He noticed that the lights were extinguished in the corner of the second floor .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 7]: `` Is that your room ? ''
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 7]: he asked , pointing to it .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 10]: Her air of blank amazement supplied a further tonic .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 5]: `` Queer thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 5]: `` I thought so .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 8]: More of the occult , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 13]: But I really wished to speak to you about Mrs. Devar . ''
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 5]: Cynthia was obviously relieved .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 5]: `` Dear me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 12]: `` You two have taken a violent dislike to each other .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 59]: You see , Mr. Fitzroy , we Americans are rather pleased than otherwise if a man acts and speaks like a gentleman even though he has to earn a living by hustling an automobile , but your sure-enough British dames exact a kind of servility from a chauffeur that does n't seem to fit in with your make-up .
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 37]: Servility is a hard word , but it is the best I can throw on the screen at the moment , and I 'm real sorry if I have hurt your feelings by using it . ''
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 3]: Medenham smiled .
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 26]: Each instant his calmer judgment showed more and more clearly that he could not offer any valid excuse for interference in the girl 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 45]: For all he knew to the contrary , she might be tremulous with delight at the prospect of becoming a French countess ; if that were so , the fact that he disapproved of Mrs. Devar 's matchmaking tactics would be received very coldly .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 20]: Cynthia 's natural interpretation of his allusion to her chaperon offered a means of escape from a difficult position .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 13]: `` I am greatly obliged by your hint , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 40]: `` Not that my lack of good manners is of much account , seeing that I am only a stop gap for the courtly Simmonds , but I shall endeavor to profit by it in my next situation . ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 17]: `` Now you are getting at me , '' cried Cynthia , her eyes sparkling somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 22]: `` Do you know , Mr. Fitzroy , I am inclined to think you are not a chauffeur at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 23]: `` I assure you there is not a man living who understands my special type of car better , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 13]: `` That is n't what I mean , so do n't wriggle .
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 36]: You met Simmonds when he was in trouble , and just offered to take his place for a day or so , thereby doing him a good turn -- is n't that the truth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 11]: `` And you are not in the automobile business ? ''
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 10]: `` I am , for the time being . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 10]: `` Well , I am glad to hear it .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 28]: I was shy of telling you when we reached the hotel , but you understand , of course , that I pay your expenses during this trip .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 26]: The arrangement with Simmonds was that my father ante 'd for petrol and allowed twelve shillings a day for the chauffeur 's meals and lodgings .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 5]: Is that satisfactory ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 29]: `` Quite satisfactory , Miss Vanrenen , '' said Medenham , fully alive to the girl 's effective ruse for the re-establishment of matters on a proper footing .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 12]: `` So you do n't need to worry about Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 35]: In any event , since you refused my offer to hire you for the tour , you will not see a great deal of her , '' she went on , a trifle hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 17]: `` There only remains one other point , '' he said , trying to help her .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 14]: `` Would you mind giving me Mr. Vanrenen 's address in Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 18]: `` He is staying at the Ritz -- but why do you want to know that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 35]: she demanded with a sudden lifting of eyebrows , for the hope was strong in her that he might be induced to change his plans so far as the next nine days were concerned .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 24]: `` A man in my present position ought always to ascertain the whereabouts of millionaires interested in motoring , '' he answered promptly .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 18]: `` And now , pardon me for advising you not to walk towards the pier alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 4]: `` Gracious me !
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 4]: Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 46]: `` There is a certain class of boisterous holiday-maker who might annoy you -- not by downright ill-behavior , but by exercising a crude humor which is deemed peculiarly suitable to the seaside , though it would be none the less distressing to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 25]: `` In the States that sort of man gets shot , '' she said , and her cheeks glowed with a rush of color .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 25]: `` Here , on the contrary , he often takes the young lady 's arm and walks off with her , '' persisted Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 12]: `` I 'm going to that pier , '' she announced .
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 12]: `` Guess you 'd better escort me , Mr. Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 14]: `` Fate closes every door in my face , '' he said sadly .
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 13]: `` I can not go with you -- in that direction . ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 9]: `` Well , of all the odd people !
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 11]: -- why not that way , if any other ? ''
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 27]: `` Because Count Edouard Marigny , the gentleman whose name I could not help overhearing to-day , has just gone there -- with another man . ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 11]: `` Have you a grudge against him , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 31]: `` I never set eyes on him before six o'clock this evening , but I imagine you would not care to have him see you walking with your chauffeur . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 20]: Cynthia looked up and down the broad sea front , with its thousands of lamps and droves of promenaders .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 18]: `` At last I am beginning to size up this dear little island , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 55]: `` I may go with you to a racetrack , I may sit by your side for days in an automobile , I may even eat your luncheon and drink your aunt 's St. Galmier , but I may not ask you to accompany me a hundred yards from my hotel to a pier .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 7]: Very well , I 'll quit .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 11]: But before I go , do tell me one thing .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 13]: Did you really mean to bring your aunt to Epsom to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 18]: `` A mother 's sister sort of aunt -- a nice old lady with white hair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 14]: `` One would almost fancy you had met her , Miss Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 8]: `` Perhaps I may , some day .
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 16]: Father and I are going to Scotland for a month from the twelfth of August .
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 13]: After that we shall be in the Savoy Hotel about six weeks .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 7]: Bring her to see me . ''
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 30]: Medenham almost jumped when he heard of the projected visit to the Highlands , but some demon of mischief urged him to say : `` Let 's reckon up .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 16]: July , August , September -- three months -- '' He stopped with a jerk .
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 27]: Cynthia , already aware of some vague power she possessed of stirring this man 's emotions , did not fail to detect his air of restraint .
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 20]: `` It is n't a proposition that calls for such a lot of calculation , '' she said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Mr. Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 7]: I hope you are punctual morning-time .
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 21]: When there is a date to be kept , I 'm a regular alarm clock , my father says . ''
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 11]: She sped across the road , and into the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 59]: Then Medenham noticed how dark it had become -- reminded him of the tropics , he thought -- and made for his own caravanserai , while his brain was busy with a number of disturbing but nebulous problems that seemed to be pronounced in character yet singularly devoid of a beginning , a middle , or an end .
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 14]: Indeed , so puzzling and contradictory were they that he soon fell asleep .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 14]: When he rose at seven o'clock next morning the said problems had vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 46]: They must have been part and parcel with the glamor of a June night , and a starlit sky , and the blue depths of the sea and of a girl 's eyes , for the wizard sun had dispelled them long ere he awoke .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 8]: But he did not telegraph to Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 28]: Dale brought the car to the Grand Hotel in good time , and Medenham ran it some distance along the front before drawing up at the Metropole .
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 47]: By that means he dissipated any undue curiosity that might be experienced by some lounger on the pavement who happened to notice the change of chauffeurs , while he avoided a prolonged scrutiny by the visitors already packed in chairs on both sides of the porch .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 31]: He kept his face hidden during the luggage strapping process , and professed not to be aware of Cynthia 's presence until she bade him a cheery `` Good-morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 27]: Of course , Marigny was there , and Mrs. Devar gushed loudly for the benefit of the other people while settling herself comfortably in the tonneau .
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 20]: `` It was awfully devey of you , Count Edouard , to enliven our first evening away from town .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 14]: No such good fortune awaits us in Bournemouth , I am afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 36]: `` If I am to accept that charming reference as applying to myself , I can only say that _ my _ good fortune has exhausted itself already , madame , '' said the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 9]: `` When do you return to London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 13]: `` About the end of next week , '' put in Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 27]: `` And your father -- that delightful Monsieur Vanrenen , '' said the Count , breaking into French , `` he will join you there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 12]: My father and I are seldom separated a whole fortnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 12]: `` Then I shall have the pleasure of seeing you there .
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 15]: I go to-day to Salisbury -- after that , to Hereford and Liverpool . ''
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 12]: `` Why , we shall be in Hereford one day soon .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 8]: What fun if we met again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 24]: Marigny looked to heaven , or as far in the direction popularly assigned to heaven as the porch of the Metropole would permit .
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 24]: He was framing a suitable speech , but the Mercury shot out into the open road with a noiseless celerity that disconcerted him .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 9]: Medenham at once slackened speed and leaned back .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 26]: `` I 'm very sorry , '' he said , `` but I clean forgot to ask if you were quite ready to start . ''
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 3]: Cynthia laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 11]: `` Go right ahead , Fitzroy , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 10]: `` Guess the Count is pretty mad , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 25]: He was telling us last night that his Du Vallon is the only car that can hit up twenty at the first buzz . ''
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 9]: `` Unpardonable rudeness , '' murmured Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 8]: `` On the Count 's part ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 5]: asked the girl demurely .
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 16]: `` No , of course not -- on the part of this chauffeur person . ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 13]: `` Oh , I like him , '' was the candid answer .
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 16]: `` He is a chauffeur of moods , but he can make this car hum .
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 14]: He and I had quite a long chat last night after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 6]: Mrs. Devar sat up quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 8]: `` After dinner -- last night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 12]: `` Yes -- I ran into him outside the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 6]: `` At what time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 5]: `` About ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 25]: I came to the lounge , but you had vanished , and the wonderful light on the sea drew me out of doors . ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 6]: `` My dear Cynthia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 16]: `` Well , go on ; that sounds like the beginning of a letter . ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 9]: Mrs. Devar suddenly determined not to feel scandalized .
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 6]: `` Ah , well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 43]: she sighed , `` one must relax a little when touring , but you Americans have such free and easy manners that we staid Britons are apt to lose our breath occasionally when we hear of something out of the common . ''
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 38]: `` From what Fitzroy said when I told him I was going as far as the pier unaccompanied it seems to me that you staid Britons can be freer if not easier , '' retorted Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 5]: Her friend smiled sourly .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 15]: `` If he disapproved he was right , I admit , '' she purred .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 6]: Cynthia withheld any further confidences .
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 7]: `` What a splendid morning ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 11]: `` England is marvelously attractive on a day like this .
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 8]: And now , where is the map ?
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 10]: I did n't look up our route yesterday evening .
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 5]: But Fitzroy has it .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 17]: We lunch at Winchester , I know , and there I see my first English Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 15]: Father advised me to leave St. Paul 's until I visit it with him .
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 27]: He says it is the most perfect building in the world architecturally , but that no one would realize it unless the facts were pointed out .
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 23]: When we were in Rome he said that St. Peter 's , grand as it is , is all wrong in construction .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 13]: The thrust downwards from the dome is false , it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 45]: `` Really , '' said Mrs. Devar , who had just caught sight of Lady Somebody-or-other at the window of a house in Hove , and hoped that her ladyship 's eyes were sufficiently good to distinguish at least one occupant of the car .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 20]: `` Yes ; and Sir Christopher Wren mixed beams of oak with the stonework of his pillars , too .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 21]: It gave them strength , he believed , though Michael Angelo had probably never heard of such a thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 8]: `` You do n't say so . ''
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 11]: The other woman had traveled far on similar conversational counters .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 22]: They would have failed with Cynthia , but the girl had opened the map , and talk lagged for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 45]: Leaving the coast at Shoreham , Medenham turned the car northward at Bramber , with its stone-roofed cottages gilded with lichen , its tiny gardens gay with flowers , and the ruins of its twelfth-century castle frowning from the crest of an elm-clothed hill .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 88]: Two miles to the northwest they came upon ancient Steyning , now a sleepy country town , but of greater importance than Bath or Birmingham or Southampton in the days of the Confessor , and redolent of the past by reason of its church , with an early Norman chancel , its houses bearing stone moldings and window mullions of the Elizabethan period , and its quaint street names , such as Dog Lane , Sheep-pen Street , and Chantry Green , where two martyrs were burnt .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 67]: Thence the way lay through the leafy wonderland of West Sussex , when the Mercury crept softly through Midhurst and Petersfield into Hampshire , and so to Winchester , where Cynthia , enraptured with the cathedral , used up a whole reel of films , and bought some curios carved out of oak imbedded in the walls when the Conqueror held England in his firm grip .
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 34]: They lunched at a genuine old coaching-house in the main street , and Medenham persuaded the girl to turn aside from Salisbury in order to pass through the heart of the New Forest .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 32]: She sat with him in front then , and their talk dealt more with the magnificent scenery than with personal matters until they reached Ringwood , where they halted for tea .
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 17]: Before alighting at the inn there she asked him where he meant to stay in Bournemouth .
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 8]: He answered the one question by another .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 13]: `` You put up at the Bath Hotel , I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 15]: Someone told me it was more like a Florentine picture gallery than a hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 5]: Is that true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 17]: `` I have not been to Florence , but the picture gallery notion is all right .
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 45]: When I was a youngster I came here often , and my -- my people always -- well , you see -- '' He nibbled his mustache in dismay , for it was hard to keep up a pretense when Cynthia was so near .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 7]: She ended the sentence for him .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 8]: `` You came to the Bath Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 7]: Why not stay there to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 15]: `` I would like it very much , if you have no objection . ''
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 5]: `` Just the opposite .
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 18]: But -- please forgive me for touching on money matters -- the charges may be rather dear .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 19]: Wo n't you let me tell the head waiter to -- to include your bill with ours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 24]: `` On the strict condition that you deduct twelve shillings from my account , '' he said , stealing a glance at her .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 11]: `` I shall be quite business-like , I promise . ''
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 17]: She was smiling at the landscape , or at some fancy that took her , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 64]: But it followed that a messenger was sent for Dale to the hostelry where he had booked a room for his master , and that Mrs. Devar , after one stony and indignant glare , whispered to Cynthia in the dining-room : `` Can that man in evening dress , sitting alone near the window , by any possibility be our chauffeur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' laughed the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 5]: `` That is Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 10]: Say , does n't he look fine and dandy ?
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 14]: Do n't you wish he was with us -- to order the wine ?
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 14]: And , by the way , is there a pier at Bournemouth ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 16]: CHAPTER IV SHADOWS -- WITH OCCASIONAL GLEAMS Mrs. Devar ate her soup in petrified silence .
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 60]: Among the diners were at least two peers and a countess , all of whom she knew slightly ; at no other time during the last twenty years would she have missed such an opportunity of impressing the company in general and her companion in particular by waddling from table to table and greeting these acquaintances with shrill volubility .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 9]: But to-night she was beginning to be alarmed .
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 35]: Her youthful prot√©g√©e was carrying democratic training too far ; it was quite possible that a request to modify an unconventional freedom of manner where Fitzroy was concerned would meet with a blank refusal .
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 29]: That threatened a real difficulty in the near future , and she was much perturbed by being called on to decide instantly on a definite course of action .
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 16]: Too strong a line might have worse consequences than a _ laissez faire _ attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 78]: As matters stood , the girl was eminently plastic , her naturally gentle disposition inducing respect for the opinions and wishes of an older and more experienced woman , yet there was a fearlessness , a frank candor of thought , in Cynthia 's character that awed and perplexed Mrs. Devar , in whom the unending struggle to keep afloat in the swift and relentless torrent of social existence had atrophied every sense save that of self-preservation .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 25]: An open rupture , such as she feared might take place if she asserted her shadowy authority , was not to be dreamed of .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 6]: What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 13]: Small wonder , then , that she should tackle her fish vindictively .
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 15]: `` Are you angry because Fitzroy is occupying the same hotel as ourselves ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 5]: asked Cynthia at last .
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 36]: The girl had amused herself by watching the small coteries of stiff and starched Britons scattered throughout the room ; she was endeavoring to classify the traveled and the untraveled by varying degrees of frigidity .
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 13]: As it happened , she was wholly wrong in her rough analysis .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 20]: The Englishman who has wandered over the map is , if anything , more self-contained than his stay-at-home brother .
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 34]: He is often a stranger in his own land , and the dozen most reserved men present that evening were probably known by name and deed throughout the widest bounds of the empire .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 20]: But , though eyes and brain were busy , she could not help noticing Mrs. Devar 's taciturn mood .
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 47]: That a born gossip , a retailer of personal reminiscences confined exclusively to `` the best people , '' should eat stolidly for five consecutive minutes , seemed somewhat of a miracle , and Cynthia , as was her habit , came straight to the point .
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 27]: Mrs. Devar managed to smile , pouting her lips in wry mockery of the suggestion that a chauffeur 's affairs should cause her any uneasiness whatsoever .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 14]: `` I was really thinking of our tour , '' she lied glibly .
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 11]: `` I am so sorry you missed seeing Salisbury Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 7]: Why was the route altered ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 37]: `` Because Fitzroy remarked that the cathedral would always remain at Salisbury , whereas a perfect June day in the New Forest does not come once in a blue moon when one really wants it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 19]: `` For a person of his class he appears to say that sort of thing rather well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 9]: Cynthia 's arched eyebrows were raised a little .
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 12]: `` Why do you invariably insist on the class distinction ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 23]: `` I have always been taught that in England the barrier of rank is being broken down more and more every day .
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 11]: Your society is the easiest in the world to enter .
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 39]: You tolerate people in the highest circles who would certainly suffer from cold feet if they showed up too prominently in New York or Philadelphia ; is n't it rather out of fashion to be so exclusive ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 20]: `` Our aristocracy has such an assured position that it can afford to unbend , '' quoted the other .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 7]: `` Oh , is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 39]: I heard my father say the other day that it has often made him tired to see the way in which some of your titled nonentities grovel before a Lithuanian Jew who is a power on the Rand .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 12]: But unbending is a different thing to groveling , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 20]: Mrs. Devar sighed , yet she gave a moment 's scrutiny to a wine-list brought by the head waiter .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 16]: `` A small bottle of 61 , please , '' she said in an undertone .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 10]: Then she sighed again , deprecating the Vanrenen directness .
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 21]: `` Unfortunately , my dear , few of our set can avoid altogether the worship of the golden calf . ''
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 9]: Cynthia thrust an obstinate chin into the argument .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 21]: `` People will do things for bread and butter that they would shy at if independent , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 43]: `` I can understand the calf proposition much more easily than the snobbishness that would forbid a gentleman like Fitzroy from eating a meal in the same apartment as his employers , simply because he earns money by driving an automobile . ''
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 29]: In her earnestness , Cynthia had gone just a little beyond the bounds of fair comment , and Mrs. Devar was quick to seize the advantage thus offered .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 21]: `` From some points of view , Fitzroy and I are in the same boat , '' she said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 23]: `` Still , I can not agree that it is snobbish to regard a groom or a coachman as a social inferior .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 42]: I have been told that there are several broken-down gentlemen driving omnibuses in London , but that is no reason why one should ask one of them to dinner , even though his taste in wine might be beyond dispute . ''
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 8]: Cynthia had already regretted her impulsive outburst .
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 21]: Her vein of romance was imbedded in a rock of good sense , and she took the implied reproof penitently .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 17]: `` I am afraid my sympathies rather ran away with my manners , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 5]: `` Please forgive me .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 13]: I really did n't mean to charge you with being a snob .
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 10]: The absurdity of the statement carries its own refutation .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 25]: I spoke in general terms , and I am willing to admit that I was wrong in asking the man to come here to-night .
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 7]: But the incident happened quite naturally .
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 26]: He mentioned the fact that he often stayed in the hotel as a boy -- '' `` Very probably , '' agreed Mrs. Devar cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 10]: `` We are all subject to ups and downs .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 30]: For my part , I was speaking _ √† la _ chaperon , my sole thought being to safeguard you from the disagreeable busy-bodies who misconstrue one 's motives .
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 11]: And now , let us talk of something more amusing .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 24]: You see that woman in old rose brocade -- she is sitting with a bald-headed man at the third table on your left .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 21]: Well , that is the Countess of Porthcawl , and the man with her is Roger Ducrot , the banker .
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 7]: Porthcawl is a most complaisant husband .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 10]: He never comes within a thousand miles of Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 22]: She is awfully nice ; clever , and witty , and the rest of it -- quite a man 's woman .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 18]: We are sure to meet her in the lounge after dinner and I will introduce you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 7]: Cynthia said she would be delighted .
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 33]: Reading between the lines of Mrs. Devar 's description , it was not easy to comprehend the distinction that forbade friendship with Fitzroy while offering it with Millicent , Countess of Porthcawl .
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 12]: But the girl was resolved not to open a new rift .
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 26]: In her heart she longed for the day that would reunite her to her father ; meanwhile , Mrs. Devar must be dealt with gently .
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 17]: Despite its tame ending , this unctuous discussion on social ethics led to wholly unforeseen results .
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 41]: The allusion to a possible pier at Bournemouth meant more than Mrs. Devar imagined , but Cynthia resisted the allurements of another entrancing evening , went early to her room , and wrote duty letters for a couple of hours .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 32]: The excuse served to cut short her share of the Countess 's brilliant conversation , though Mr. Ducrot tried to make himself very agreeable when he heard the name of Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 38]: Medenham , standing in the hall , suddenly came face to face with Lady Porthcawl , who was endowed with an unerring eye for minute shades of distinction in the evening dress garments of the opposite sex .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 38]: Her correspondence consisted largely of picture postcards , and she had just purchased some stamps from the hall porter when she saw Medenham take a telegram from the rack where it had been reposing since the afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 13]: It was , she knew , addressed to `` Viscount Medenham . ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 12]: That , and her recollection of his father , banished doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 4]: `` George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 36]: she cried , with a charming air of having found the one man whom she was longing to meet , `` do n't say I 've grown so old that you have forgotten me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 32]: He started , rather more violently than might be looked for in a shikari whose nerves had been tested in many a ticklish encounter with other members of the cat tribe .
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 38]: In fact , he had just been disturbed by coming across the unexpected telegram , wherein Simmonds assured his lordship that the rejuvenated car would arrive at the College Green Hotel , Bristol , on Friday evening .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 45]: At the very moment that he realized the imminence of Cynthia 's disappearance into the void it was doubly disconcerting to be hailed by a woman who knew his world so intimately that it would be folly to smile vacantly at her presumed mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 30]: Some glint of annoyance must have leaped to his eyes , for the lively countess glanced around with a mimic fright that testified to her skill as an actress .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 5]: `` Good gracious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 10]: she whispered , `` have I given you away ?
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 20]: I could n't guess you were here under a _ nom de voyage _ -- now , could I ?
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 13]: -- when that telegram has been staring at everybody for hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 24]: `` You have misinterpreted my amazement , Lady Porthcawl , '' he said , spurred into self-possession by the hint at an intrigue .
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 16]: `` I could not believe that time would turn back even for a pretty woman .
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 21]: You look younger than ever , though I have not seen you for -- '' `` Oh , hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 11]: `` Do n't spoil your nice speech by counting years .
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 7]: When did you arrive in England ?
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 6]: Are you alone -- really ?
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 10]: You 've grown quite a man in your jungles .
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 7]: Will you come to the lounge ?
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 13]: I want ever so much to have a long talk with you .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 39]: Mr. Ducrot is there -- the financier , you know -- but I have left him safely anchored alongside Maud Devar -- a soft-furred old pussie who is clawing me now behind my back , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 6]: Have you ever met her ?
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 27]: Wiggy Devar she was christened in Monte , because an excited German leaned over her at the tables one night and things happened to her coiffure .
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 39]: And to show you how broad-minded I am , I 'll get her to bring downstairs the sweetest and daintiest American ing√©nue you 'd find between here and Chicago , even if you went by way of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 13]: Cynthia Vanrenen is her name , daughter of _ the _ Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 15]: He made , not a pile , but a pyramid , out of Milwaukees .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 34]: She is _ it _ -- a pukka Gibson girl , quite ducky , with the dearest bit of an accent , and Mamma Devar is gadding around with her in a mo-car .
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 4]: Do come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 17]: Medenham was able to pick and choose where he listed in answering this hail of words .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 23]: `` I 'm awfully sorry , '' he said , `` but the telegram I have just received affects all my plans .
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 7]: I must hurry away this instant .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 7]: When will you be in town ?
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 22]: Then I shall call , praying meanwhile that there may be no Ducrots or Devars there to blight a glorious gossip .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 21]: If you bring me up to date as to affairs in Park Lane I 'll reciprocate about the giddy equator .
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 14]: How -- or perhaps I ought to say where -- is Porthcawl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 20]: `` In China , '' snapped her ladyship , fully alive to Medenham 's polite evasion of her blandishments .
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 17]: `` By gad , '' he laughed , `` that is a long way from Bournemouth .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 4]: Well , good-bye .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 9]: Keep me a date in Clarges Street . ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 13]: `` Clarges Street is off the map , '' she said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 12]: `` It 's South Belgravia , verging on Pimlico , nowadays .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 16]: That is why Porthcawl is in China ... and it explains Ducrot , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 25]: An unconscious bitterness crept into the smooth voice ; Medenham , who hated confidences from the butterfly type of woman , nevertheless pitied her .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 22]: `` Tell me where you live and I 'll come round and hear all about it , '' he said sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 16]: She gave him an address , and suddenly smiled on him with a yearning tenderness .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 20]: She watched his tall figure as he strode down the hill towards the town to keep an imaginary appointment .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 34]: `` He used to be a nice boy , '' she sighed , `` and now he is a man ... Heigh-ho , you 're a back number , Millie , dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 20]: But she was her own bright self when she returned to the bald-headed Ducrot and the bewigged Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 9]: `` What a small world it is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 3]: she vowed .
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 10]: `` I ran across Medenham in the hall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 11]: The banker 's shining forehead wrinkled in a reflective frown .
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 4]: `` Medenham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 7]: `` Fairholme 's eldest son . ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 4]: Mrs. Devar chortled .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 5]: `` Such fun ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 10]: `` Our chauffeur calls himself George Augustus Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 5]: `` How odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 4]: agreed Countess Millicent .
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 7]: `` You people speak in riddles .
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 7]: Who or what is odd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 3]: asked Ducrot .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 15]: `` Oh , do n't worry , but listen to that adorable waltz . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 43]: Ducrot 's polished dome compared badly with the bronzed skin of the nice boy who had grown to be a man , so her ladyship 's rebellious tongue sought safety in silence , since she could not afford to quarrel with him .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 16]: It is certainly true that the gods make mad those whom they mean to destroy .
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 56]: Never was woman nearer to a momentous discovery than Mrs. Devar at that instant , but her active brain was plotting how best to develop a desirable acquaintance in Roger Ducrot , financier , and she missed utterly the astounding possibility that Viscount Medenham and George Augustus Fitzroy might be one and the same person .
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 19]: In any other conditions Millicent Porthcawl 's sharp wits could scarcely have failed to ferret out the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 22]: Even if Cynthia were present it was almost a foregone conclusion that the girl would have told how Fitzroy joined her .
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 51]: The luncheon provided for a missing aunt , the crest on the silver and linen , the style of the Mercury , a chance allusion to this somewhat remarkable chauffeur 's knowledge of the South Downs and of Bournemouth , would surely have put her ladyship on the right track .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 38]: From sheer enjoyment of an absurd situation she would have caused Fitzroy to be summoned then and there , if only to see Wiggy Devar 's crestfallen face on learning that she had entertained a viscount unawares .
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 56]: But the violins were singing the Valse Bleu , and Cynthia was upstairs , longing for an excuse to venture forth into the night , and three people , at least , in the crowded lounge were thinking of anything but the amazing oddity that had puzzled Ducrot , who did not con his Burke .
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 15]: Medenham , of course , realized that he had been vouchsafed another narrow escape .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 12]: What the morrow might bring forth he neither knew nor cared .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 34]: The one disconcerting fact that already shaped itself in the mists of the coming day was Simmonds tearing breathlessly along the Bath Road during the all too brief hours between morn and evening .
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 14]: It is not to be wondered at if he read Cynthia 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 43]: There is a language without code or symbol known to all young men and maidens -- a language that pierces stout walls and leaps wide valleys -- and that unlettered tongue whispered the hope that the girl might saunter towards the pier .
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 13]: He turned forthwith into the public gardens , and quickened his pace .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 12]: Arrived at the pier , he glanced up at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 28]: Of girls there were many on cliff and roadway , girls summer-like in attire , girls slender of waist and airy of tread , but no Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 21]: He went on the pier , and met more than one pair of bright eyes , but not Cynthia 's .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 63]: Then he made off in a fume to Dale 's lodging , secured a linen dust-coat which the man happened to have with him , returned to the hotel , and hurried unseen to his room , an easy matter in the Royal Bath , where many staircases twine deviously to the upper floors , and brilliantly decorated walls dazzle the stranger .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 24]: He counted on the exigencies of Lady Porthcawl 's toilette stopping a too early appearance in the morning , and he was right .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 35]: At ten o'clock , when Cynthia and Mrs. Devar came out , the men lounging near the porch were too interested in the girl and the car to bestow a glance on the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 12]: Ducrot was there , bland and massive in a golf suit .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 42]: He pestered Cynthia with inquiries as to the exact dates when her father would be in London , and Medenham did not hesitate to cut short the banker 's awkward gallantries by throwing the Mercury into her stride with a whirl .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 27]: `` By Jove , Ducrot , '' said someone , `` your pretty friend 's car jumped off like a gee-gee under the starting gate . ''
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 20]: `` If that chauffeur of hers was mine , I 'd boot him , '' was the wrathful reply .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 3]: `` Why ?
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 6]: What 's he done ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 10]: `` He strikes me as an impudent puppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 9]: `` Anyhow , he can swing a motor .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 4]: See that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 19]: for the Mercury had executed a corkscrew movement between several vehicles with the sinuous grace of a greyhound .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 32]: Now it was Mrs. Devar , and not Cynthia , who leaned forward and said pleasantly : `` You seem to be in a hurry to leave Bournemouth , Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 18]: `` I am not enamored of bricks and mortar on a fine morning , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 19]: `` Well , I have full confidence in you , but do n't embroil us with the police .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 13]: We have a good deal to see to-day , I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 9]: Then he heard the strenuous voice addressing Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 15]: `` Millicent Porthcawl says that Glastonbury is heavenly , and Wells a peaceful dream .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 22]: I visited Cheddar once , some years ago , but it rained , and I felt like a watery cheese . ''
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 59]: Lady Porthcawl 's commendation ought to have sanctified Glastonbury and Wells -- Mrs. Devar 's blue-moldy joke might even have won a smile -- but Cynthia was preoccupied ; strange that she , too , should be musing of Simmonds and a hurrying car , for Medenham had told her that the transfer would take place at Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 28]: She was only twenty-two , and her very extensive knowledge of the world had been obtained by three years of travel and constant association with her father .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 11]: But her lines had always been cast in pleasant places .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 25]: She had no need to deny herself any of the delights that life has to offer to youth and good health and unlimited means .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 14]: The discovery that friendship called for discretion came now almost as a shock .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 35]: It seemed to be a stupid social law that barred the way when she wished to enjoy the company of a well-favored man whom fate had placed at her disposal for three whole days .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 25]: Herself a blue-blooded American , descendant of old Dutch and New England families , she was quite able to discriminate between reality and sham .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 52]: Mrs. Devar , she was sure , was a pinchbeck aristocrat ; Count Edouard Marigny might have sprung from many generations of French gentlemen , but her paid chauffeur was his superior in every respect save one -- since , to all appearance , Marigny was rich and Fitzroy was poor .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 41]: Curiously enough , the man whose alert shoulders and well-poised head were ever in view as the car hummed joyously through the pine woods had taken on something of the mere mechanic in aspect since donning that serviceable linen coat .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 5]: The garment was weather-stained .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 63]: It bore records of over-lubrication , of struggles with stiff outer covers , of rain and mud -- that bird-lime type of mud peculiar to French military roads in the Alpes Maritimes -- while a zealous detective might have found traces of the black and greasy deposit that collects on the door handles and side rails of P. L. M. railway carriages .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 13]: Medenham borrowed it because of the intolerable heat of the leather jacket .
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 43]: Its distinctive character became visible when he viewed it in the June sunshine , and he wore it as a substitute for sackcloth , since he , no less than Cynthia , recognized that a dangerous acquaintance was drawing to an end .
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 46]: So Dale 's coat imposed a shield , as it were , between the two , but the man drove with little heed to the witching scenery that Dorset unfolded at each turn of the road , and the woman sat distrait , almost downcast .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 6]: Mrs. Devar was smugly complacent .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 10]: Difficulties that loomed large overnight were now vague shadows .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 26]: When the Mercury stopped in front of a comfortable inn at Yeovil it was she , and not Cynthia , who suggested a social departure .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 16]: `` This seems to be the only place in the town where luncheon is provided .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 23]: You had better leave the car in charge of a stableman , and join us , Fitzroy , '' she said graciously .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 23]: `` Thank you , madam , '' said Medenham , rousing himself from a reverie , `` I prefer to remain here .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 27]: The hotel people will look after my slight wants , as I dislike the notion of anyone tampering with the engine while I am absent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 9]: `` Is it so delicate , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 30]: asked Cynthia , with a smile that he hardly understood , since he could not know how thoroughly he had routed Mrs. Devar 's theories of the previous night .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 7]: `` No , far from it .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 27]: But its very simplicity challenges examination , and an inquisitive clodhopper can effect more damage in a minute than I can repair in an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 11]: His gruff tone was music in Mrs. Devar 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 12]: She actually sighed her relief , but explained the lapse instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 15]: `` I do hope there is something nice to eat , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 9]: `` This wonderful air makes one dreadfully hungry .
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 17]: When our tour is ended , Cynthia , I shall have to bant for months . ''
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 5]: The fare was excellent .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 21]: Under its stimulating influence Miss Vanrenen forgot her vapors and elected for the front seat during the run to Glastonbury .
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 5]: Medenham thawed , too .
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 82]: By chance their talk turned to wayside flowers , and he let the Mercury creep through a high-banked lane , all ablaze with wild roses and honeysuckle , while he pointed out the blue field scabious , the pink and cream meadow-sweet , the samphire , the milk-wort and the columbine , the campions in the cornland , and the yellow vetchling that ran up the hillside towards one of the wooded `` islands '' peculiar to the center of Somerset .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 28]: Cynthia listened , and , if she marveled , betrayed no hint of surprise that a chauffeur should have such a store of the woodman 's craft .
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 25]: Medenham , aware only of a rapt audience of one , threw disguise to the breeze created by the car when the pace quickened .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 79]: He told of the Glastonbury Thorn , and how it was brought to the west country by no less a gardener than Joseph of Arimathea , and how St. Patrick was born in the Isle of Avallon , so called because its apple-orchards bore golden fruit , and how the very name of Glastonbury is derived from the crystal water that hemmed the isle -- `` Please let me intrude one little question , '' murmured the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 9]: `` I am very ignorant of some things .
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 14]: What has ` Avallon ' got to do with ` apples ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 4]: `` Ha ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 20]: cried Medenham , warming to his subject and retarding speed again , `` that opens up a wide field .
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 14]: In Celtic mythology Avallon is Ynys yr Afallon , the Island of Apples .
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 14]: It is the Land of the Blessed , where Morgana holds her court .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 46]: Great heroes like King Arthur and Ogier le Dane were carried there after death , and , as apples were the only first-rate fruit known to the northern nations , a place where they grew in luscious abundance came to be regarded as the soul-kingdom .
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 33]: Merlin says that fairyland is full of apple trees -- '' `` I believe it is , '' cried Cynthia , nudging his arm and pointing to an orchard in full bloom .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 33]: Mrs. Devar could hear little and understand less of what they were saying ; but the nudge was eloquent ; her steel-blue eyes narrowed , and she thrust her face between them .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 11]: `` We must n't dawdle on the road , Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 23]: Bristol is still a long way off , and we have so much to see -- Glastonbury , Wells , Cheddar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 13]: Though Cynthia was vexed by the interruption she did not show it .
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 53]: Indeed , she was aware of her companion 's strange reiteration of the towns to be visited , since Mrs. Devar had already admitted a special weakness in geography , and during the trip from Brighton to Bournemouth was quite unable to name a town , a county , or a landmark .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 25]: But the queer thought of a moment was dispelled by sight of the ruins of St. Dunstan 's monastery appearing above a low wall .
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 25]: In front of the broken arches and tottering walls grew some apple trees so old and worn that no blossom decked their gnarled branches .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 9]: Unbidden tears glistened in the girl 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 17]: `` If I lived here I would plant a new orchard , '' she said tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 24]: `` I think Guinevere would like it , and you say she is buried with her king in St. Joseph 's Chapel . ''
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 7]: Medenham had suddenly grown stern again .
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 22]: He glanced at her , and then made great business with brakes and levers , for Mrs. Devar was still inquisitive .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 23]: `` There is a fine old Pilgrims ' Inn , the George , in the main street , '' he said jerkily .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 16]: `` I propose to stop there ; the entrance to the Abbey is exactly opposite .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 33]: In the George they will show you a room in which Henry the Eighth slept , and I would recommend you to get a guide for half an hour at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 6]: `` Must we walk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 5]: demanded Mrs. Devar plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 10]: `` Yes , if you wish to see anything .
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 19]: But one could throw a stone over the chief show places , they are so close together . ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 49]: So Cynthia was shown the Alfred Jewel , and Celtic dice-boxes carefully loaded for the despoiling of Roman legionaries or an unwary Phoenician , and heard the story of the Holy Grail from the lips of an ancient who lent credence to the legend by his venerable appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 39]: Mixed up with the imposing ruins and the glory of St. Joseph 's Chapel was a visit to the butcher 's at the corner of the street , where the veteran proudly exhibited a duck with four feet .
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 28]: He then called Cynthia 's attention to the carved panels of the George Hotel , and pointed out a fine window , bayed on each successive story .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 22]: She had almost forgotten the wretched duck when he mentioned a two-headed calf which was on view at a neighboring dairy .
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 21]: Mrs. Devar showed signs of interest , so Cynthia tipped the old man hurriedly , and ran to the car .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 37]: `` I shall come here -- some other time , '' she gasped , and it thrilled her to believe that Fitzroy understood , though he had heard no word of quadruped fowl or bicipital monster .
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 6]: At Wells Medenham pitied her .
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 37]: He bribed a policeman to guard the Mercury , and when Mrs. Devar saw that more walking was expected of her she elected to sit in the tonneau and admire the west front of the cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 28]: `` Lady Porthcawl tells me it is a masterpiece , '' she chirped shrilly , `` so I want to take it in at my leisure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 16]: Once more , therefore , did Medenham allow himself a half hour of real abandonment .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 42]: He warned Cynthia that she must not endeavor to appreciate the architecture ; with the hauteur of conscious genius , Wells refuses to allow anyone to absorb its true grandeur until it has been seen many times and in all lights .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 28]: So he hied her to the exquisite Lady Chapel , and to the Chapter-House Stairs , and to Peter Lightfoot 's quaint old clock in the transept .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 63]: Then , by some alchemy worked on a lodgekeeper , he led her to the gardens of the Bishop 's palace , and showed her the real Glastonbury Thorn , and even persuaded one of the swans in the moat to ring the bell attached to the wall whereby each morning for many a year the royal birds have obtained their breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 40]: There is no lovelier garden in England than that of Wells Palace , and Cynthia was so rapt in it that even Medenham had to pull out his watch and remind her of dusty roads leading to far-off Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 33]: Mrs. Devar looked so sour when they came from an inspection of one of the seven wells to which the town owes its name that Cynthia weakened and sat by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 21]: Thereupon Medenham made amends for lost time by exceeding the speed limit along every inch of the run to Cheddar .
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 41]: Of course he had to crawl through the narrow streets of the little town , above which the bare crests of the Mendips give such slight promise of the glorious gorge that cuts through their massiveness from south to north .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 14]: Even at the very lip of the magnificent canyon the outlook is deceptive .
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 61]: Perhaps it is that the eye is caught by the flaring advertisements of the stalactite caves , or that baser emotions are awakened by the sight of cozy tea-gardens -- of one in particular , where a cascade tumbles headlong from the black rocks , and a tree-shaded lawn offers rest and coolness after hours passed in the hot sun .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 45]: Be that as it may , `` tea '' had a welcome sound , and Medenham , who had lunched on bread and beer and pickles , was glad to halt at the entrance of the inn that boasted a waterfall in its grounds .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 16]: The road was narrow , and packed with chars-√†-bancs awaiting their hordes of noisy trippers .
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 16]: Some of the men were tipsy , and Medenham feared for the Mercury 's paint .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 14]: To the left of the hotel lay a spacious yard that looked inviting .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 33]: He backed in there when the ladies had alighted , and ran alongside an automobile on which `` Paris '' and `` speed '' were written in characters legible to the motorist .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 11]: A chauffeur was lounging against the stable wall and smoking .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 17]: `` Hello , '' said Medenham affably , `` what sort of car is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 11]: `` A 59 Du Vallon , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 10]: Then the man 's face lit up with curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 12]: `` Yours is a New Mercury , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 11]: `` Was that car at Brighton on Wednesday night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 22]: `` Yes , '' growled Medenham ; he knew what to expect , and his face was grim beneath the tan .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 13]: `` But you were not driving it , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 11]: `` A chap named Dale was in charge then . ''
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 7]: `` Oh , is that it ?
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 10]: You 've brought two ladies here just now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 3]: `` Good !
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 11]: My guv ` nor 's on the lookout for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 23]: He did n't tell me so , but he made sure they had n't passed this way when we turned up . ''
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 7]: `` And when was that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 9]: asked Medenham , feeling unaccountably sick at heart .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 5]: `` Soon after lunch .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 5]: Ran here from Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 17]: There 's a bad bit of road over the Mendips , but the rest is fine .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 14]: I s ` pose we 'll all be hiking back there to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 31]: `` Most probably , '' agreed Medenham , who said least when he was most disturbed ; at that moment he could cheerfully have wrung Count Edouard Marigny 's neck .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 29]: CHAPTER V A FLURRY ON THE MENDIPS It is a contrariety of human nature that men devoted to venturesome forms of sport should often be tender-hearted as children .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 71]: Lord Medenham , who had done some slaying in his time , once risked his life to save a favorite horse from a Ganges quicksand , and his right arm still bore the furrows plowed in it by claws that would have torn his spaniel to pieces in a Kashmir gully had he not thrust the empty barrels of a .450 Express rifle down the throat of an enraged bear .
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 41]: In each case , a moment 's delay to secure his own safety meant the sacrifice of a friend , but safety won at such a price would have galled him worse than the spinning of a coin with death .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 35]: Wholly apart from considerations that he was strangely unwilling to acknowledge , even to his own heart , he now resented Marigny 's cold-blooded pursuit of an unsuspecting girl mainly because of its unfairness .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 43]: Were Cynthia Vanrenen no more to him than the hundreds of pretty women he would meet during a brief London season he would still have wished to rescue her from the money-hunting gang which had marked her down as an easy prey .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 11]: But he had been vouchsafed glimpses into her white soul .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 34]: That night at Brighton , and again to-day in the cloistered depths of the cathedral at Wells , she had admitted him to the rare intimacy of those who commune deeply in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 16]: It was not that he dared yet to think of a love confessed and reciprocated .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 47]: The prince in disguise is all very well in a fairy tale ; in England of the twentieth century he is an anachronism ; and Medenham would as soon think of shearing a limb as of profiting by the chance that threw Cynthia in his way .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 35]: Of course , a less scrupulous wooer might have devised a hundred plausible methods of revealing his identity -- was not Mrs. Devar , marriage-broker and adroit sycophant , ready to hand and purchasable ?
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 36]: -- and there was small room for doubt that a girl 's natural vanity would be fluttered into a blaze of romance by learning that her chauffeur was heir to an old and well-endowed peerage .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 17]: But honor forbade , nor might he dream of winning her affections while flying false colors .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 20]: True , it would not be his fault if they did not come together again in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 24]: He meant to forestall any breach of confidence on the part of Simmonds by writing a full explanation of events to Cynthia herself .
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 56]: If his harmless escapade were presented in its proper light , their next meeting should be fraught with laughter rather than reproaches ; and then -- well , then , he might urge a timid plea that his repute as a careful pilot during those three memorable days was no bad recommendation for a permanency !
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 13]: But now , in a flash , the entire perspective had changed .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 16]: The Frenchman and Mrs. Devar , between them , threatened to upset his best-laid plans .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 33]: It was one thing to guess the nature of the sordid compact revealed at Brighton ; it was quite another to be brought face to face with its active development at Cheddar .
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 10]: The intervening hours had disintegrated all his pet theories .
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 18]: In a word , the difference lay in himself -- before and after close companionship with Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 27]: It must not be imagined that Medenham indulged in this species of self-analysis while fetching a pail of water to replace the wastage from the condenser .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 25]: He was merely in a very bad temper , and could not trust himself to speak until he had tended to his belov√®d engine .
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 28]: He determined to set doubt at rest forthwith by the simple expedient of finding Miss Vanrenen , and seeing whether or not Marigny had waylaid her already .
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 22]: `` Keep an eye on my machine for a minute , '' he said to the guardian of the Du Vallon .
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 11]: `` By the way , is Captain Devar here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 13]: he added , since Devar 's presence might affect his own actions .
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 13]: `` Oh , you know _ him _ , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 4]: cried the other .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 10]: `` No , he did n't come with us .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 6]: We left him at Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 8]: He 's a bird , the captain .
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 14]: Played some johnny at billiards last night for a quid , and won .
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 26]: He told the guv ` nor this morning that there is another game fixed for to-day , and you ought to have seen him wink .
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 17]: It 's long odds again ' the Bristol gent , or I 'm very much mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 23]: Yes , I 'll keep any amatoor paws off your car , and off my own as well , you bet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 18]: To pass from the stable yard to the garden it was not necessary to enter the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 21]: A short path , shaded by trellis-laden creepers and climbing roses , led to a rustic bridge over the stream .
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 25]: When Medenham had gone halfway he saw the two women sitting with Marigny at a table placed well apart from other groups of tea-drinkers .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 37]: They were talking animatedly , the Count smiling and profuse of gesture , while Cynthia listened with interest to what was seemingly a convincing statement of the fortunate hazard that led to his appearance at Cheddar .
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 21]: The Frenchman was too skilled a stalker of shy game to pretend a second time that the meeting was accidental .
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 11]: Mrs. Devar 's shrill accents traveled clearly across the lawn .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 28]: `` Just fancy that ... finding James at Bath , and persuading him to come to Bristol on the chance that we might all dine together to-night !
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 17]: Naughty boy he is -- why did n't he run out here in your car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 5]: Count Edouard said something .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 4]: `` Business ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 12]: she cackled , `` I am glad to hear of it .
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 21]: James is too much of a gad-about to earn money , but people are always asking him to their houses .
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 8]: He is a _ dear _ fellow .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 11]: I am sure you will like him , Cynthia . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 5]: Medenham had heard enough .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 43]: He noted that the table was gay with cut flowers , and a neat waitress had evidently been detailed by the management to look after these distinguished guests ; Marigny 's stage setting for his first decisive move was undoubtedly well contrived .
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 25]: It was delightfully pastoral -- a charming bit of rural England -- and , as such , eminently calculated to impress an American visitor .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 26]: Cynthia poured out a cup of tea , heaped a plate with cakes and bread and butter , and gave some instructions to the waitress .
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 6]: Medenham knew what that meant .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 24]: He hurried back by the way he had come , and found that Marigny 's chauffeur had lifted the bonnet off the Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 19]: `` More I see of this engine the more I like it -- What 's your h.p. ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 18]: asked the man , who clearly regarded the Mercury 's driver as a brother in the craft .
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 4]: `` 38 . ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 8]: `` Looks a sixty , every inch .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 12]: I wonder if you could hold my car at Brooklands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 18]: `` Perhaps not , but I may give you some dust to swallow over the Mendips . ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 4]: The chauffeur grinned .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 22]: `` Of course you 'd say that , but it all depends on what the guv ` nor means to do .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 27]: He 's a dare-devil at the wheel , I can tell you , an ' never says a word to me when I let things rip .
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 9]: But he 's up to some game to-day .
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 17]: He 's fair crazy about that girl you have in tow -- what 's her name ?
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 7]: Vanrenen , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 33]: `` Yes , '' said Medenham , replacing the hood after a critical glance at the wires , though he hardly thought that this sturdy mechanic would play any tricks on him .
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 10]: `` Which of you men is called Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 8]: demanded a serving-maid , carrying a tray .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 7]: `` I , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 36]: `` Here , Miss , '' broke in the other , `` my name 's Smith , plain Smith , but I can do with a sup o ' tea as well as anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 22]: `` Ask Miss Vanrenen to give you another cup for Count Marigny 's chauffeur , '' said Medenham to the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 12]: `` Oh , he 's a count , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 5]: said the waitress saucily .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 13]: `` My , is n't he mashed on the young one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 7]: `` Who would n't be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 3]: declared Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 16]: `` She 's the sort of girl a fellow ` ud leave home for . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 8]: `` Fine feathers go a long way .
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 23]: There 's as good as her in the world , '' came the retort , not without a favorable glance at Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 12]: `` Meanwhile the tea is getting cold , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: `` Dear me , you need n't hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 11]: Her ma is goin ' to write half-a-dozen picture postcards .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 5]: But what a voice !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 8]: The old girl drowns the waterfall . ''
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 5]: The waitress flounced off .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 22]: She was pretty , and no wandering chauffeur had ever before turned aside the arrows of her bright eyes so heedlessly .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 9]: `` Then you have seen Miss Vanrenen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 7]: inquired Medenham , sipping his tea .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 4]: `` Ra-ther ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 3]: said Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 25]: `` Saw her in Paris , at the Ritz , when my people sent me over there to learn the mechanism of this car .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 41]: The Count was always hanging about , and I thought he wanted the old man to buy a Du Vallon , but it 's all Lombard Street to a china orange that he was after the daughter the whole time .
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 6]: I do n't blame him .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 6]: She 's a regular daisy .
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 7]: But you ought to know best .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 11]: How do _ you _ get on with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 4]: `` Capitally . ''
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 10]: `` Why did Dale and you swop jobs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 32]: `` Oh , a mere matter of arrangement , '' said Medenham , who realized that Smith would blurt out every item of information that he possessed if allowed to talk .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 14]: `` He 's a corker , is Dale , '' mused the other .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 28]: `` I can do with a pint or two meself when the day 's work is finished an ' the car safely locked up for the night .
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 4]: But that Dale !
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 7]: he 's a walkin ' beer-barrel .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 5]: Lord love a duck !
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 11]: what a soakin ' he gev ' me in Brighton .
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 36]: Some lah-di-dah toff swaggered into the garage that evenin ' , and handed Dale a fiver -- five golden quidlets , if you please -- which my nibs had won on a horse at Epsom .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 22]: I must say , though , Dale did the thing handsome -- quart bottles o ' Bass opened every ten minutes .
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 20]: Thank you , my dear '' -- this to the waitress , `` next to beer give me tea .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 24]: Now , my boss , bein ' a Frenchy , wo n't touch eether -- wine an ' corfee are his specials . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 26]: `` He seemed to be enjoying his tea when I caught sight of him in the garden a little while ago , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 9]: `` That 's his artfulness , my boy .
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 5]: You wait a bit .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 29]: You 'll see something before you reach Bristol to-night ; anyway , you 'll hear something , which amounts to pretty much the same in the end . ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 15]: `` They 're just off to the caves , '' put in the girl .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 12]: `` While Mrs. Devar writes her postcards , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 4]: said Medenham innocently .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 9]: Is that the old party with the hair ?
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 10]: I thought she was the young lady 's mother .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 6]: She 's gone with them .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 10]: She looks that sort of meddler -- not half .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 18]: Two 's company an ' three 's none is my motto , cave or no cave . ''
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 11]: She tried her most bewitching smile on Medenham this time .
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 21]: It was a novel experience to be the recipient of a serving-maid 's marked favor , and it embarrassed him .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 13]: Smith , his mouth full of currant bun , spluttered with laughter .
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 9]: `` A fair offer , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 13]: `` You two dodge outside and see which cave the aristocracy chooses .
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 11]: Then you can take a turn round the other one .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 9]: I 'll watch the cars all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 8]: The girl suddenly blushed and looked demure .
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 19]: A sweet voice said quietly : `` We shall remain here half an hour or more , Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 23]: I thought I would tell you in case you wished to smoke -- or occupy your time in any other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 9]: The pause was eloquent : Cynthia had heard .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 18]: `` Thank you , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said , affecting to glance at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 5]: He felt thoroughly nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 47]: She would surely think he had been flirting with this rosy-cheeked servant , and he might never have an opportunity of telling her that his sole reason for encouraging the conversation lay in his anxiety to learn as much as possible about Marigny and his associates .
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: `` My , ai n't she smart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 8]: said the girl when Cynthia had gone .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 12]: Medenham put his hand in his pocket and gave her half-a-crown .
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 14]: `` They have forgotten to tip you , Gertie , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 22]: Without heeding a stare of astonishment strongly tinctured with indignation , he stooped in unnecessary scrutiny of the Mercury 's tires .
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 6]: The minx tossed her head .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 21]: `` Some folks are as grand as their missuses , '' she remarked , and went back to her garden .
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 5]: But Smith looked puzzled .
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 25]: Medenham , no good actor at any time , had dropped too quickly the air of camaraderie which had been a successful passport hitherto .
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 23]: His voice , his manner , the courtly insolence of the maid 's dismissal , evoked vague memories in Smith 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 30]: The square-shouldered , soldierly figure did not quite fit into the picture , but he seemed to hear that same authoritative voice speaking to Dale in the Brighton garage .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 21]: -LSB- Illustration : `` You may occupy your time in any way you wish , Fitzroy , '' said Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 13]: _ Page 102 _ -RSB- The conceit was absurd , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 20]: Chauffeurs do not swagger through the world dressing for dinner each night and distributing gold in their leisure moments .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 39]: But Smith 's bump of inquisitiveness was well developed , as the phrenologists say , and he was already impressed by the fact that no firm could afford to send out for hire a car like Medenham 's .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 10]: `` Funny thing , '' he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 11]: `` I seem to have met you somewhere or other .
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 7]: Who do you work for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 4]: `` Myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 11]: Medenham caught the note of bewilderment , and was warned .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 17]: He straightened himself with a smile , though it cost him an effort to look cheerful .
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 6]: `` Have a cigarette ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 8]: `` Do n't mind if I do .
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 3]: Thanks . ''
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 26]: Then , after a pause , and some puffing and tasting : `` Sorry , old man , but this baccy ai n't my sort .
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 4]: It tastes queer .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 4]: What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 4]: Flor de Cabbagio ?
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 8]: Here , take one of mine ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 57]: Medenham , in chastened mood , accepted a `` five a penny '' cigarette , and saw Smith throw away the exquisite brand that Sevastopolo , of Bond Street , supplied to those customers only who knew the price paid by connoisseurs for the leaf grown on one small hillside above the sun-steeped bay of Salonika .
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 23]: `` Yes , '' he agreed , bravely poisoning the helpless atmosphere , `` this is better suited to the occasion . ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 9]: `` A bit of all right , eh ?
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 16]: I ca n't stand the Count 's cigarettes eether -- French rubbish , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 13]: An ' the money they run into -- well , there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 14]: `` But if he is a rich man -- '' `` Rich ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 5]: Smith exploded with merriment .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 45]: `` If he had what he owes he might worry along for a year or so , but , you mark my words , if he does n't -- Well , it 's no business of mine , only just keep your eyes open .
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 9]: You 're going through with this tour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 28]: `` I -- believe so , '' said Medenham slowly -- and thus he took the great resolution which till that moment was dim in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 29]: `` In that case we 'll be having a jaw some other time , and then , mebbe , we 'll both be older an ' wiser . ''
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 33]: Notwithstanding the community of taste established by Smith 's weeds , the man was still furtively racking his brains to account for certain discrepancies in his new acquaintance 's bearing and address .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 12]: Medenham 's hands , for instance , were too well kept .
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 9]: His boots were of too good a quality .
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 18]: His reindeer driving gloves , discarded and lying on the front seat , were far too costly .
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 13]: The disreputable linen coat might hide many details , but not these .
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 17]: Every now and then Smith wanted to say `` sir , '' and he wondered why .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 33]: Medenham was sure that at the back of Smith 's head lay some scheme , some arranged trick , some artifice of intrigue that would find its opportunity between Cheddar and Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 36]: The distance was not great -- perhaps eighteen miles -- by a fairly direct second-class road , and on this fine June evening it was still safe to count on three long hours of daylight .
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 24]: It was doubly irritating , therefore , to think that by his own lack of diplomacy he had almost forfeited Smith 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 49]: Twice had the man been on the very brink of revelation , for he was one of those happy-go-lucky beings not fitted for the safeguarding of secrets , yet on each occasion his tongue faltered in subconscious knowledge that he was about to betray his master 's affairs .
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 27]: Feeling that Dale would have managed this part of the day 's adventures far better than himself , Medenham took his seat and touched the switch .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 30]: `` We have to make Bristol by seven o'clock , so I shall pull out in front ; I suppose Count Marigny will give the ladies the road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 4]: he remarked casually .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 7]: Smith was listening to the engine .
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 11]: `` Runs like a watch , do n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 5]: was his admiring cry .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 14]: `` And almost as quietly , so you heard what I said . ''
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 25]: `` Oh , I hear lots , but I reckon it a good plan to keep my mouth shut , '' grinned the other .
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 27]: `` Exactly what you have failed to do , '' thought Medenham , though he nodded pleasantly , and , with a `` So long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 6]: passed out of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 10]: Smith went to the exit and looked after him .
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 9]: The man 's face wore a good-humored sneer .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 35]: It was as though he said : `` You wait a bit , my dandy shuffer -- you ai n't through with his Countship yet -- not by any manner o ' means . ''
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 10]: And Medenham did wait , till nearly seven o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 17]: He saw Cynthia and her companions come out of Gough 's Cave and enter Cox 's .
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 18]: These fairy grottoes of nature 's own contriving were well worthy of close inspection , he knew .
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 30]: Nowhere else in the world can stalactites that droop from the roof , stalagmites that spring from the floor , be seen in such perfection of form and tint .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 57]: But he fretted and fumed because Cynthia was immured too long in their ice-cold recesses , and when , at last , she reappeared from the second cavern and halted near a stall to purchase some curios , impatience mastered him , and he brought the car slowly on until she turned and looked at him .
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 5]: He raised his cap .
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 17]: `` The gorge is the finest thing in Cheddar , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 13]: `` You ought to see it while the light is strong . ''
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 11]: `` We are going now , '' she answered coldly .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 18]: `` Monsieur Marigny will take me to Bristol , and you will follow with Mrs. Devar . ''
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 24]: He did not flinch from her steadfast gaze , though those blue eyes of hers seemed definitely to forbid any expression of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 16]: Yet there was a challenge in them , too , and he accepted it meekly .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 20]: `` I was hoping that I might have the pleasure of driving you this evening , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 19]: `` The run through the pass is very interesting , and I know every inch of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 19]: He fancied that she was conscious of some mistake , and eager to atone if in the wrong .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 21]: She hesitated , yielded almost , but Mrs. Devar broke in angrily : `` We have decided differently , Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 26]: I have some few postcards to dispatch , and Count Marigny has kindly promised to run slowly up the hill until we overtake him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 23]: `` Yes , you ought to have waited in the yard of the inn for orders , '' said the ever-smiling Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 12]: `` My car can hardly pass yours in this narrow road .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 26]: Back a bit to one side , there 's a good fellow , and , when we have gone , pull up to the door .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 5]: Come , Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 14]: I am fierce to show you the paces of a Du Vallon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 21]: The concluding sentences were in French , but Count Edouard spoke idiomatic English fluently and with a rather fascinating accent .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 17]: Cynthia , slightly ruffled by her own singular lack of purpose , made no further demur .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 37]: The three walked off down the hill , and Medenham could only obey in a chill rage that , were Marigny able to gauge its intensity , might have given him `` furiously to think . ''
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 10]: In a few minutes the Du Vallon scurried by .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 20]: Smith was driving , and there was a curious smirk on his red face as he glanced at Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 32]: Cynthia sat in the tonneau with the Frenchman , who drew her attention to the limestone cliffs in such wise that she did not even see the Mercury as she passed .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 15]: Medenham muttered something under his breath , and reversed slowly back to the inn .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 5]: He consulted his watch .
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 23]: `` I 'll give the postcard writer ten minutes -- then I shall jar her nerves badly , '' he promised himself .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 16]: Those minutes were slow-footed , but at last he closed the watch with a snap .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 14]: He called to a waitress visible at the end of a long passage .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 10]: The girl happened to be his friend of tea-time .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 11]: `` Would you like to earn another half crown ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 22]: She had wit enough to grasp essentials , and it was abundantly clear that this man was not her lawful quarry .
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 9]: `` Yes -- sir , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 31]: `` Take it , then , and tell the elderly lady belonging to my party -- she is somewhere inside -- that Fitzroy says he can not wait any longer .
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 10]: Use those exact words -- and be quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 4]: The girl vanished .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 9]: An irate yet dignified Mrs. Devar came out .
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 10]: `` Do I understand -- '' she began wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 7]: `` I hope so , madam .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 19]: Unless you get in at once I intend going to Bristol , or elsewhere , without you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 5]: `` Or elsewhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 15]: she gasped , though some of her high color fled under his cold glance .
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 3]: `` Precisely .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 10]: I do not intend to abandon Miss Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 16]: `` How dare you speak to me in this manner , you vulgar person ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 8]: For answer Medenham set the engine going .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 21]: `` I said ` At once , ' '' he replied , and looked Mrs. Devar squarely in the eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 65]: She had her fair share of that wisdom of the serpent which is indispensable to evildoers , and had learnt early in life that whereas many men say they will do that which they really will not do if put to the test , other men , rare but dominant , can be trusted to make good their words no matter what the cost .
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 15]: So she accepted the unavoidable ; quivering with indignation , she entered the car .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 25]: `` Drive me to the post-office , '' she said , with as much of acid repose as she could muster to her aid .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 9]: Medenham seemed to be suddenly afflicted with deafness .
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 58]: After negotiating a line of vehicles , the Mercury leaped past the caves of Gough and Cox as though the drip of lime-laden water within those amazing depths were reeling off centuries in a frenzy of haste instead of measuring time so slowly that no appreciable change has been noted in the tiniest stalactite during fifty years .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 18]: Mrs. Devar then grew genuinely alarmed , since even a designing woman may be a timid one .
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 23]: She bore with the pace until the car seemed to be on the verge of rushing full tilt against a jutting rock .
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 14]: She could endure the strain no longer , but stood up and screamed .
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 4]: Medenham slackened speed .
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 31]: When the curving road opened sufficiently to show a clear furlong ahead , he turned and spoke to the limp , shrieking creature clinging to the back of his seat .
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 26]: `` You are not in the slightest danger , '' he assured her , `` but if you wish it I will drop you here .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 9]: The village is barely half a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 18]: Otherwise , should you decide to remain , you must put up with a rapid speed . ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 7]: `` But why , why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 4]: she almost wailed .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 12]: `` Have you gone mad , to drive like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 12]: `` Again I pledge my word that there is no risk .
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 16]: I mean to overtake Miss Vanrenen before the light fails -- that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 11]: `` Your conduct is positively outrageous , '' she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 6]: `` Please yourself , madam .
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 8]: Do you go , or stay ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 13]: She collapsed into the comfortable upholstery with a gesture of impotent despair .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 11]: Medenham was sure she would not dare to leave him .
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 27]: What wretched project she and Marigny had concocted he knew not , but its successful outcome evidently depended on Mrs. Devar 's safe arrival in Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 28]: Moreover , it was a paramount condition that he should be delayed at Cheddar , and his chief interest lay in defeating that part of the programme .
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 15]: Without another word , he released the brakes , and the car sped onward .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 26]: Now they were plunging into a magnificent defile shadowed by sheer cliffs that on the eastern side rose to a height of five hundred feet .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 16]: Fluttering rock pigeons circled far up in the azure riband that spanned the opposing precipices .
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 37]: From many a towering pinnacle , carved by the ages into fantastic imageries of a castle , a pulpit , a lion , or a lance , came the loud , clear calling of innumerable jack-daws .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 33]: It was dark and gloomy , most terrifying to Mrs. Devar , down there on the twining road where the car boomed ever on like some relentless monster rushing from its lair .
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 16]: But the Cheddar gorge , though majestic and awe-inspiring , is not of great extent .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 39]: Soon the valley widened , the road took longer sweeps to round each frowning buttress , and at last emerged , with a quality of inanimate breathlessness , on to the bleak and desolate tableland of the Mendips .
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 39]: At this point , had Cynthia been there , Medenham would have stopped for a while , so that she might admire the far-flung panorama of the `` island valley of Avallon '' that stretched below the ravine .
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 16]: Out of the green pastures in the middle distance rose the ruined towers of Glastonbury .
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 97]: The purple and gold of Sedgemoor , relieved by the soft outlines of the Polden hills , the grim summits of Taunton Dean and the Blackdown range , the wooded Quantocks dipping to the Severn , and the giant mass of Exmoor bounding the far horizon , -- these great splashes of color , softened and blended by belts of farmland and the blue smoke of clustering hamlets , formed a picture that not even Britain 's storehouse of natural beauty can match too often to sate the eyes of those who love a charming landscape .
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 44]: He had , as it were , jealously guarded this vista all day , said not a word of it , even when Cynthia and he discussed the route , so that it might come at last in one supreme moment of revelation .
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 47]: And now that it was here , Cynthia was hidden somewhere in the gray distance , and Medenham was frowning at a flying strip of white road , with his every faculty intent on exacting the last ounce of power from the superb machine he controlled .
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 33]: The miles rolled beneath , yet there was no token of the Du Vallon that was to `` run slowly up the hill '' until overtaken by the industrious writer of postcards .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 37]: At the utmost , the French car was given some twelve or thirteen minutes ' start , which meant seven or eight miles to a high-powered automobile urged forward with the determination Medenham himself was displaying .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 29]: Marigny 's chauffeur , therefore , must have dashed through that Titanic cleft in the limestone at a speed utterly incompatible with his employer 's excuse of sightseeing .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 30]: Of course , it would be an easy matter for Marigny to enlist Miss Vanrenen 's sympathies in the effort of a first-rate engine to conquer the adverse gradient .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 35]: She would hardly realize the rate of progress , and , from where she was seated , the speed indicator would be invisible unless she leaned forward for the express purpose of reading it .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 78]: Medenham was sure that the Mercury would catch the Du Vallon long before Bristol was reached , but when the last ample fold of the bleak plateau spread itself in front , and his hunter 's eyes could discern no cloud of dust lingering in the still air where the road dipped over the horizon , he began to doubt , to question , to solve grotesque problems that were discarded ere they had well taken shape .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 12]: Oddly enough , there came no more expostulation from Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 24]: Like the majority of nervous people , she was quelled by the need of placing complete trust in one who understood his work .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 23]: While Medenham was still searching the sky-line for signs of the vanished car , she did show some interest in his quest .
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 31]: He felt , since he could not see , that she half rose and looked over his head , bent low behind the partial shelter afforded by a glass screen .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 17]: Then she settled back in the seat , and drew a rug comfortably around her knees .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 9]: For some reason , she was strangely content .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 8]: The incident supplied food for active thought .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 5]: So she felt safe !
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 17]: That which she dreaded as the result of a too strenuous pursuit could not now happen !
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 5]: Then what was it ?
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 46]: Medenham swept aside the fantasy that Mrs. Devar knew the country well enough to be able to say precisely when and where she might be sure of his failure to snatch Cynthia from that hidden evil the nature of which he could only guess at .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 49]: Her world was the artificial one of hotels , and shops , and numbered streets -- in the real world , of which the lonely wastes of the Mendips provided no meager sample , she was a profound ignoramus , a fat little automaton equipped with atrophied senses .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 18]: But she blundered badly in composing herself so cozily for the remainder of the run to Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 36]: Medenham had dwelt many months at a time in lands where just such simple indications of mood on the part of man or beast had meant to him all the difference between life and death .
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 46]: So now , if ever , he became doubly alert ; his eyes were strained , eager , peering ; his body still as the wild creatures which he knew to be skulking unseen behind many a rock and grass tuft passed on the way .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 29]: This desolate land , given over to stones interspersed with patches of wiry grass on which browsed some hardy sheep , resembled a disturbed ocean suddenly made solid .
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 14]: It was not level , but ran in long , almost regular undulations .
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 33]: In the trough between two of these rounded ridges the road bifurcated , the way to Bristol trending to the left , and a less important thoroughfare glancing off to the right .
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 25]: There was no sign-post , but a child could scarce have erred if asked to choose the track that led to a big town .
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 18]: Medenham , having consulted the map earlier in the day , swung to the left without hesitation .
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 28]: The car literally flew up the next incline , and the dark lines of trees and hedges in the distance proved that tilled land was being neared .
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 43]: Now he was absolutely sure that he had managed , somehow , to miss the Du Vallon -- unless , indeed , its redoubtable mechanism was of a caliber he had not yet come across in the highways and byways of Europe .
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 9]: With him , to decide was to act .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 13]: The Mercury slowed up so promptly that Mrs. Devar became alarmed again .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 5]: `` What is it ?
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 6]: -- a tire gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 15]: `` No , I am on the wrong road -- that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 7]: `` But there is no other .
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 10]: That turning we passed was a mere lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 20]: The car stopped where his watchful glance noted a carpet of sand left by the last shower of rain .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 11]: He sprang out and examined the marks of recent traffic .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 22]: Marigny 's vehicle carried non-skid covers with studs arranged in peculiar groups , and their imprint was plain to be seen .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 9]: But they had followed that road once only .
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 29]: It was impossible to determine off-hand whether they had come or gone , but , if they came from Bristol , then most certainly they had not returned .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 6]: Medenham took nothing for granted .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 14]: Dusk was advancing , and he must make no mistake at this stage .
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 16]: He ran the Mercury slowly ahead , not taking his gaze off the telltale signs .
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 10]: At last he found what he was looking for .
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 22]: The broad scars left by a heavy cart crossed the studs , and had crossed after the passage of the car .
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 8]: Thus he eliminated the vagaries of chance .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 28]: Marigny had _ not _ taken the road to Bristol -- he _ must _ be on the other one -- since no cart was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 5]: Medenham backed and turned .
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 9]: Mrs. Devar , of course , grew agitated .
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 7]: `` Where are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 22]: Medenham resolved to end this farce of pretense , else he would not be answerable for the manner of his speech .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 12]: `` I mean to find Miss Vanrenen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 9]: `` Pray let that suffice for the hour .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 17]: Any further explanation you may require can be given at Bristol and in her presence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 6]: Mrs. Devar began to sob .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 23]: He heard her , and of all things that he hated it was to become the cause of a woman 's tears .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 20]: But his lips closed in a thin seam , and he drove fast to the fork in the roads .
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 16]: Another halt here , and the briefest scrutiny showed that his judgment had not erred .
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 9]: The Du Vallon had passed this point twice .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 27]: If it came from Bristol in the first instance it had gone now to some unfamiliar wilderness that skirted the whole northeastern slopes of the Mendips .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 33]: He leaped back to the driving seat , and Mrs. Devar made one more despairing effort to regain control of a situation that had slipped from her grasp nearly an hour ago .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 9]: `` Please do be sensible , Fitzroy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 4]: she almost screamed .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 29]: `` Even if he _ has _ made a mistake in a turning , Count Marigny will take every care of Miss Vanrenen -- '' It was useless .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 57]: She was appealing to a man of stone , and , indeed , Medenham could not pay heed to her then in any circumstances , for the road surface quickly became very rough , and it needed all his skill to guide his highly-strung car over its inequalities without inflicting an injury that might prove disastrous .
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 36]: His only consolation was provided by the knowledge that the risk to a stout Mercury was as naught compared with the tortures endured by a French-built racer , with its long wheel-base and low chassis .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 24]: After a couple of miles of semi-miraculous advance his respect for Smith 's capability as a driver increased literally by leaps and bounds .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 9]: But the end was nearer than he thought .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 21]: On reaching the top of one of those seemingly interminable land-waves , he saw a blurred object in the hollow .
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 30]: Soon he distinguished Cynthia 's fawn-colored dust cloak , and his heart throbbed exultantly when the girl fluttered a handkerchief to show that she , too , had seen .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 13]: Mrs. Devar rose and clutched the back of the seat behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 11]: `` I apologize , Fitzroy , '' she piped tremulously .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 5]: `` You were right .
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 11]: They have lost their way and met with some accident .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 17]: How glad I am that I did not insist on your making straight for Bristol ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 7]: Her unparalleled impudence won his admiration .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 26]: Such a woman , he thought , was worthy of a better fate than that which put her in the position of a bought intriguer .
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 47]: But Cynthia was near , waving her hands gleefully , and executing a nymph-like thanksgiving dance on a strip of turf by the roadside , so Medenham 's views of Mrs. Devar 's previous actions were tempered by conditions extraordinarily favorable to her at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 18]: She seemed to be aware instinctively of the change in his sentiments wrought by sight of Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 23]: It was in quite a friendly tone that she cried : `` Count Edouard is there ; but where is his man ?
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 39]: ... Something serious must have happened , and the chauffeur has been sent to obtain help ... Oh , how lucky we hurried , and how clever of you to find out which way the car went ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 29]: CHAPTER VI A MIDSUMMER NIGHT 'S VAGARIES Cynthia , notwithstanding that spirited _ pas seul _ , was rather pale when Medenham stopped the car close beside her .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 42]: She had been on tenterhooks during the past quarter of an hour -- there were silent moments when she measured her own slim figure against the natty Count 's in half-formed resolution to take to her heels along the Cheddar Road .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 10]: At first , she had enjoyed the run greatly .
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 28]: Although Dale spoke of Smith as a mechanic , the man was a first-rate driver , and he spun the Du Vallon along at its best speed .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 40]: But the change from good macadam to none soon made itself felt , and Cynthia was more troubled than she cared to show when the French flier came to a standstill after panting and jolting alarmingly among the ruts .
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 60]: Marigny 's excited questions evoked only unintelligible grunts from Smith ; for all that , the irritating truth could not be withheld -- the petrol tank was empty ; not only had the chauffeur forgotten to fill it that morning , but , by some strange mischance , the supply usually held in reserve had been left at Bristol !
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 14]: The Frenchman was very angry with Smith , and Smith was humbly apologetic .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 29]: The pair must have acted convincingly , because each knew to a nicety how soon a gallon of petrol would vaporize in the Du Vallon 's six cylinders .
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 38]: Having taken the precaution to measure that exact quantity into the tank before leaving Cheddar , they were prepared for a breakdown at any point within a few hundred yards of the precise locality where it occurred .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 13]: Cynthia , being generous-minded , tried to make little of the mishap .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 10]: By taking that line she strove to reassure herself .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 12]: `` Fitzroy is always prepared for emergencies , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 9]: `` He will soon catch up with us .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 5]: But what a road !
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 8]: I did n't really notice it before .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 13]: Surely this can not be the only highway between Bristol and Cheddar ?
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 15]: -- and in England , too , where the roads are so perfect ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 31]: `` There are two roads , but this is the nearest one , '' explained the glib-tongued Count , seemingly much relieved by the prospect of Fitzroy 's early arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 27]: `` You do n't deserve to be pulled out of a difficulty so promptly , Smith , '' he went on , eying the chauffeur sternly .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 18]: `` There 's a village not very far ahead , sir , '' said the abashed Smith .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 6]: `` Oh , never mind !
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 10]: We must wait for Miss Vanrenen 's car . ''
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 4]: `` Wait ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 3]: inquired Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 8]: `` What else can we do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 20]: `` I take it he meant to walk to some village , and bring a stock of spirit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 5]: `` Oh , dear !
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 10]: I hope no such thing will be necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 15]: From that half hint of latent and highly disagreeable developments dated Cynthia 's uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 61]: She accepted Marigny 's suggestion that they should stroll to the top of the slight hill just descended , whence they would be able to watch their rescuer 's approach from a considerable distance -- she even remembered to tell him to smoke -- but she answered his lively sallies at random , and agreed unreservedly with his voluble self-reproach .
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 42]: The obvious disuse of the road , a mere lane providing access to sheep inclosures on the hills , caused her no small perplexity , though she saw fit not to add to her companion 's distress by commenting on it .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 72]: In any other circumstances she would have been genuinely alarmed , but her well-established acquaintanceship with the Count , together with the apparently certain fact that Fitzroy and Mrs. Devar were coming nearer each second , forbade the tremors that any similar accident must have evoked if , say , they were marooned on some remote mountain range of the continent , and no friendly car was speeding to their aid .
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 31]: The two halted on the rising ground , and one of them , at least , gazed anxiously into the purple shadows now mellowing the gray monotony of the plateau .
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 17]: The point where the Du Vallon left the main road was invisible from where they stood .
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 29]: Marigny had laid his plans with skill , so his humorous treatment of their plight was not marred by any lurking fear of the Mercury 's unwelcome appearance .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 24]: `` What a terrible collapse this would be if I were running away with you , Miss Cynthia , '' he said slyly .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 34]: `` Let us imagine a priest waiting in some ancient castle ten miles away , and an irate father , or a pair of them , starting from Cheddar in hot pursuit . ''
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 51]: `` My imagination fails me there , Monsieur Marigny , '' she replied , and the shade of emphasis on his surname showed that she was fully aware of the boundary crossed by the `` Miss Cynthia , '' an advance which surprised her more than the Frenchman counted on .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 33]: `` At present I am wholly absorbed in a vain effort to picture an automobile somewhere down there in the gathering mists ; still , it _ must _ arrive soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 8]: Then Marigny put forth a tentative claw .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 25]: `` I hate to tell you , '' he said , '' _ mais il faut marcher quand le diable est aux trousses _ .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 19]: -LSB- A -RSB- I am unwillingly forced to believe that your chauffeur has taken the other road . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 15]: -LSB- Footnote A : `` But needs must when the devil drives . '' -RSB-
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 6]: `` The other road ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 9]: wailed Cynthia in sudden and most poignant foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 13]: It was then that she first began to estimate her running powers .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 10]: `` Yes , there are two , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 29]: The second one is not so direct -- '' `` If you think that , your man had better go at once to the village he spoke of .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 11]: Is it certain that he will obtain petrol there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 5]: `` Almost certain . ''
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 12]: `` Really , Monsieur Marigny , I fail to understand you .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 7]: Why should you express a doubt ?
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 10]: He appeared to be confident enough five minutes ago .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 11]: He was ready to start until we prevented him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 15]: That the girl should yield to slight panic was precisely what Count Edouard desired .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 46]: True , Cynthia 's sparkling eyes and firm lips were eloquent of keen annoyance rather than fear , but Marigny was an adept in reading the danger signals of beauty in distress , and he saw in these symptoms the heralds of tears and fright .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 24]: His experience did not lead him far astray , but he had not allowed for racial difference between the Latin and the Anglo-Saxon .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 24]: Cynthia might weep , she might even attempt to run , but in the last resource she would face him with dauntless courage .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 27]: `` I assure you I would not have had this thing happen on any account , '' he said in a voice that vibrated with sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 15]: `` Indeed , I pray your pity in my own behalf , Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 19]: After all , it is I who suffer the agony of failure when I meant only to please .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 35]: You will reach Bristol this evening , a little late , perhaps , but quite safely , and I hope that you will laugh then at the predicament which now looks so ill-starred . ''
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 9]: His seeming sincerity appeased her to some extent .
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 13]: In rapid swing back to the commonplace , she affected to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 21]: `` It is not so serious , after all , '' she said , with more calmness than she felt .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 17]: `` Just for a moment you threw me off the rails by your lawyer-like vagueness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 14]: Drawing a little apart , she looked steadily back along the deserted road .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 14]: `` I see nothing of my car , '' she murmured at last .
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 7]: `` It will soon be dusk .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 7]: We must take no more chances .
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 9]: Please send for that benzine right away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 27]: Smith was dispatched forthwith on what he knew to be a fool 's errand , since both he and Marigny were practically sure of their ground .
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 51]: The nearest petrol was to be found at Langford , two miles along the Bristol road from the fork , and four miles in the opposite direction to that taken by Smith , who , when he returned empty-handed an hour later , must make another long journey to Langford .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 39]: The Du Vallon was now anchored immovably until eleven o'clock , and it was well that the girl could not realize the true nature of the ordeal before her , or events might have taken an awkward twist .
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 42]: The Frenchman meant no real harm by his rascally scheme , for Cynthia Vanrenen , daughter of a well-known American citizen , was not to be wooed and won in the fashion that commended itself to unscrupulous lovers in by-gone days .
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 28]: Yet his design blended subtlety and daring in a way that was worthy of ancestors who had ruffled it at Versailles with the cavaliers of old France .
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 17]: He trusted implicitly to the effect of a somewhat exciting adventure on the susceptible feminine heart .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 8]: The phantom of distrust would soon vanish .
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 64]: She would yield to the spell of a night scented with the breath of summer , languorous with soft zephyrs , a night when the spirit of romance itself would emparadise the lonely waste , and a belated moon , `` like to a silver bow new-bent in heaven , '' would lend its glamor to a sky already spangled with glowing sapphires .
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 10]: In such a night , all things were possible .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 27]: In such a night Stood Dido with a willow in her hand Upon the wild sea-banks , and waft her love To come again to Carthage .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 16]: Marigny had indeed arranged a situation worthy of his nurturing among the decadents of Paris .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 28]: He believed that in these surroundings an impressionable girl would admit him to a degree of intimacy not to be attained by many days of prosaic meetings .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 44]: At the right moment , when his well-bribed servant was gone to Langford , he would remember a bottle of wine and some sandwiches stored in the car that morning to provide the luncheon that he might not obtain at a wayside inn .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 10]: Cynthia and he would make merry over the feast .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 26]: The magnetism that had never yet failed him in affairs of the heart would surely prove potent now at this real crisis in his life .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 28]: Marriage to a rich woman could alone snatch him from the social abyss , and the prospect became doubly alluring when it took the guise of Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 70]: He would restore her to a disconsolate chaperon some time before midnight , and he was cynic enough to admit that if he had not then succeeded in winning her esteem by his chivalry , his unobtrusive tenderness , his devoted attentions -- above all , by his flow of interesting talk and well-turned epigram -- the fault would be his own , and not attributable to adverse conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 36]: It was not surprising , therefore , that he failed to choke back the curse quick risen to his lips when the throb of the Mercury 's engine came over the crest of the hill .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 17]: Never was mailed dragon more terrible to the beholder , even in the days of knight-errantry .
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 12]: In an instant his well-conceived project had gone by the board .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 40]: He saw himself discredited , suspected , a skulking plotter driven into the open , a self-confessed trickster utterly at the mercy of some haphazard question that would lay bare his pretenses and cover his counterfeit rhapsody with ridicule .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 33]: If Cynthia had heard , and hearing understood , it is possible that a great many remarkable incidents then in embryo would have passed into the mists of what might have been .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 17]: For instance , she would not have deigned to notice Count Edouard Marigny 's further existence .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 23]: The next time she met him he would fill a place in the landscape comparable to that occupied by a migratory beetle .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 24]: But her heart was leaping for joy , and her cry of thankfulness quite drowned in her ears the Frenchman 's furious oath .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 23]: Mrs. Devar , having had time to gather her wits , made a gallant attempt to retrieve her fellow-conspirator 's shattered fortunes .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 19]: `` My dearest Cynthia , '' she cried effusively , `` do say you are not hurt ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 11]: `` Not a bit , '' was the cheerful answer .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 16]: `` It is not I , but the car , that is out of commission .
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 18]: Did n't you see me do the Salom√© act when you were thrown on the screen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 3]: `` Ah !
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 6]: the car has broken down .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 28]: I do not wonder -- this fearful road -- '' `` The road seems to have strayed out of Colorado , but that is n't the trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 6]: We are short of petrol .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 9]: Please give some to Monsieur Marigny , Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 20]: Then we can hurry to Bristol , and the Count must pick up his chauffeur on the way . ''
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 26]: Without more ado , she seated herself by Mrs. Devar 's side , and Marigny realized that he had been robbed of a golden opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 37]: No persuasion would bring Cynthia back into the Du Vallon that evening ; it would need the exercise of all his subtle tact to induce her to re-enter it at any time in the near future .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 38]: He strove to appear at his ease , even essayed a few words of congratulation on the happy chance that brought the Mercury to their relief , but the imperious young lady cut short his limping phrases .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 16]: `` Oh , do n't let us waste these precious minutes , '' she protested .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 26]: `` It will be quite dark soon , and if there is much more of this wretched track -- '' Medenham broke in at that .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 25]: Mrs. Devar 's change of front had caused him some grim amusement , but the discovery of Marigny 's artifice roused his wrath again .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 40]: It was high time that Cynthia should be enlightened , partly at least , as to the true nature of the `` accident '' that had befallen her ; he had already solved the riddle of Smith 's disappearance .
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 16]: `` The road to Bristol lies behind you , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 11]: `` One of the roads , '' cried the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 11]: `` No , the only road , '' persisted Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 12]: `` We return to it some two miles in the rear .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 18]: Had you followed your present path much farther you could not possibly have reached Bristol to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 9]: `` But there is a village quite near .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 8]: My chauffeur has gone there for petrol .
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 10]: Someone would have told us of our mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 20]: `` There is no petrol to be bought at Blagdon , which is a mere hamlet on the downs .
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 34]: Anyhow , here are two gallons -- ample for your needs -- but if your man is walking to Blagdon you will be compelled to wait till he returns , Monsieur Marigny . ''
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 28]: Though Medenham did not endeavor to check the contemptuous note that crept into his voice , he certainly ought not to have uttered those two concluding words .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 27]: Had he ransacked his ample vocabulary of the French language he could scarcely have hit upon another set of syllables offering similar difficulties to the foreigner .
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 12]: It was quite evident that his accurate pronunciation startled the accomplices .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 31]: Each arrived at the same conclusion , though by different channels ; this man was no mere chauffeur , and the fact rendered his marked hostility all the more significant .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 32]: Nevertheless , for the moment , Marigny concealed his uneasiness : by a display of good humor he hoped to gloss over the palpable absurdity of his earlier statements to Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 16]: `` I seem to have bungled this business very badly , '' he said airily .
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 10]: `` Please do n't be too hard on me .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 14]: I shall make the _ amende _ when I see you in Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 7]: _ Au revoir , ch√®res dames !
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 9]: _ Tell them to keep me some dinner .
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 44]: I may not be so very far behind , since you ladies will take some time over your toilette , and I shall -- what do you call it -- scorch like mad after I have found that careless scoundrel , Smith . ''
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 17]: Cynthia had suddenly grown dumb , so Mrs. Devar tried once more to relax the tension .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 41]: `` Do be careful , Count Edouard , '' she cried ; `` this piece of road is dreadfully dangerous , and , when all is said and done , another half hour is now of no great consequence . ''
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 29]: `` If your chauffeur has really gone to Blagdon , he will not be back under an hour at least , '' broke in Medenham 's disdainful voice .
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 17]: `` Unless you wish to wreck your car you will not attempt to follow him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 35]: With that he bent over the head lamps , and their radiance fell unexpectedly on Marigny 's scowling face , since the discomfited adventurer could no longer pretend to ignore the Englishman 's menace .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 6]: Still , he was powerless .
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 35]: Though quivering with anger and balked desire , he dared not provoke a scene in Cynthia 's presence , and her continued silence already warned him that she was bewildered if not actually suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 5]: He forced a laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 10]: `` Explanations are like swamps , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 12]: `` The farther you plunge into them the deeper you sink .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 4]: So , good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 11]: To please you , Mrs. Devar , I shall crawl .
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 18]: As for Miss Vanrenen , I see that she does not care what becomes of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 7]: Cynthia weakened a little at that .
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 25]: Certainly she wondered why her model chauffeur chose to express his opinions so bluntly , while Marigny 's unwillingness to take offense was admirable .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 8]: `` Is there no better plan ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 20]: she asked quickly , for Medenham had started the engine , and his hand was on the reversing lever .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 5]: `` For what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 3]: he demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 10]: `` For extricating my friend from his difficulty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 25]: `` If he likes to come with us , he can leave his car here all night , and return for it to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 24]: `` Perhaps -- '' `` Please do not trouble yourself in the least on my account , '' broke in the Count gayly .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 17]: `` As for abandoning my car , such a stupid notion would never enter my mind .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 4]: No , no !
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 21]: I wait for Smith , but you may rely on my appearance in Bristol before you have finished dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 34]: Though it was no simple matter to back and turn the Mercury in that rough and narrow road , Medenham accomplished the maneuver with a skill that the Frenchman appreciated to the full .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 14]: For the first time he noted the number when the tail-lamp revealed it .
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 11]: `` X L 4000 , '' he commented to himself .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 9]: `` I must inquire who the owner is .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 12]: Devar or Smith will know where to apply for the information .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 10]: And I must also ascertain that fellow 's history .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 9]: Confound him , and my luck , too !
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 23]: If the Devar woman has any sense she will keep Cynthia well out of his way until the other chauffeur arrives . ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 43]: As it happened , the `` Devar woman '' was thinking the same thing at the same moment , but , being nervous , dared not attempt to utter her thoughts while the car was creeping cautiously over the ruts and stones .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 21]: At last , when the highroad was reached , the pace quickened , and she regained the faculty of speech .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 28]: `` We have had a quite eventful day , '' she said with an air of motherly solicitude , turning to the distrait girl by her side .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 8]: `` I am sure you are tired .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 26]: What between an extra amount of sightseeing and poor Count Edouard 's unfortunate mistake , we have been in the car nearly twelve hours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 14]: `` How did Fitzroy discover that we had taken the wrong road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 10]: asked Cynthia , rousing herself from a perplexed reverie .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 29]: `` Well , he drove very fast from Cheddar , much too fast , to my thinking , though the risk has been more than justified by circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 14]: Of course , it is always easy to be wise after the event .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 37]: At any rate , there being no sign of your car when we reached the top of a long hill , we -- er -- we discussed matters , and decided to explore the byroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 8]: `` Did you remain long in Cheddar ?
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 15]: If Fitzroy hit up the pace , why were you so far behind ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 11]: `` I waited a few minutes to address some postcards .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 22]: And that reminds me -- Fitzroy sent a most impertinent message by one of the servants -- '' `` Impertinent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 25]: `` My dear , there is no other word for it -- something about going off without me if I did not start instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 12]: Really , I shall be glad when Simmonds takes his place .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 9]: We must not renew our Bournemouth argument . ''
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 18]: `` And he caused a servant in the hotel to speak to you in that manner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 26]: `` Yes -- the very girl who waited on us at tea -- a pert creature , who seemed to find the task congenial . ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 9]: Mrs. Devar was building better than she knew .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 17]: Cynthia laughed , though not with the whole-souled merriment that was music in Medenham 's ears .
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 17]: `` She has been properly punished ; I forgot to tip her , '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 14]: `` Count Edouard would see to that -- '' `` He did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 11]: I noticed what he paid -- out of sheer curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 9]: Perhaps I ought to send her something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 6]: `` My dear Cynthia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 19]: But dear Cynthia was making believe to be quite amused by a notion that had just suggested itself .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 12]: She leaned forward in the darkness and touched Medenham 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 20]: `` Do you happen to know the name of the waitress who brought you some tea at Cheddar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 17]: `` None of us gave her anything , and I hate to omit these small items .
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 15]: If I had her name I could forward a postal order from Bristol . ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 13]: `` There is no need , Miss Vanrenen , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 15]: `` I handed her -- well , sufficient to clear all claims . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 5]: _ You _ did ?
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 4]: But why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 46]: The temptation to explain that he had never seen the girl before that day was strong , but he waived it , and contented himself with saying : `` I -- er -- ca n't exactly say -- force of habit , I imagine . ''
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 9]: `` Is she a friend of yours ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 6]: Cynthia subsided into the tonneau .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 8]: `` Of all the odd things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 22]: she murmured , little dreaming that her chance question had sent a thrill of sheer delight through Medenham 's every vein .
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 7]: `` What is it now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 12]: inquired Mrs. Devar vindictively , for she detested these half confidences .
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 8]: `` Oh , nothing of any importance .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 9]: Fitzroy footed the bill , it seems . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 4]: `` Very probably .
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 11]: He must have bribed the girl to be impudent . ''
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 6]: Cynthia left it at that .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 18]: She wished these people would stop their quarreling , which threatened to spoil an otherwise perfect day .
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 27]: The Mercury ran smoothly into ancient Bristol , crossed the Avon by the pontoon bridge , and whirled up the hill to the College Green Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 11]: There , on the steps , stood Captain James Devar .
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 34]: Obviously , he did not recognize them , and Medenham guessed the reason -- he expected to meet his mother only , and bestowed no second glance on a car containing two ladies .
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 9]: Indeed , his first words betrayed sheer amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 14]: Mrs. Devar cried , `` Ah , there you are , James ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 10]: and James 's eyeglass fell from its well-worn crease .
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 6]: `` Hello , mater ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 6]: `` But what 's up ?
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 9]: Why are you -- where is Marigny ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 12]: `` Miles away -- the silly man ran short of petrol .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 27]: Fortunately our car came to the rescue , or it would have been most awkward , since Miss Vanrenen was with the Count at the time .
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 9]: Cynthia , you have not met my son .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 8]: James , this is Miss Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 6]: The little man danced forward .
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 30]: Like all short and stout mortals , he was nimble on his feet , and his mother 's voluble outburst warned him of an unforeseen hitch in the arrangements .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 11]: `` Delighted , I 'm shaw , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 11]: `` But , by gad , fancy losing poo-aw Eddie !
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 7]: What have you done with him ?
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 14]: Dwiven a stake through him and buwied him at a cwoss woad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 45]: Medenham dreaded that the too-faithful Simmonds , car and all , would be found awaiting their arrival , and it was a decided relief when the only automobile in sight proved to be the state equipage of some local magnate dining at the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 15]: Cynthia , apparently , had shared his thoughts so far as they concerned Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 25]: `` I suppose your friend Simmonds will reveal his whereabouts during the evening , '' she said , while disencumbering herself of her wraps .
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 21]: Mrs. Devar had already alighted , but the girl was standing in the car and spoke over Medenham 's shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 47]: `` Of course , he may not be here , '' was the answer , not given too loudly , since Mrs. Devar had hastened to give details to the perplexed James , and there was no need to let either of them overhear his words .
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 4]: `` Oh my !
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 7]: What will happen , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 16]: `` In that event , I should feel compelled to take his place again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 19]: `` But the compulsion , as you put it , tends rather to take you to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 15]: `` I have changed my mind , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said simply .
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 3]: She tittered .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 15]: There was just a spice of coquetry in her manner as she stooped nearer .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 20]: `` You believe that Simmonds would not have found me in that wretched lane to-night , '' she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 9]: `` I am quite sure of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 12]: `` But the whole affair was a mere stupid error . ''
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 22]: `` I am only too glad that I was enabled to put it right , '' he said with due gravity .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 20]: `` Cynthia , '' came a shrill voice , `` do make haste , I am positively starving . ''
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 43]: `` Guess you 'd better lose Simmonds , '' breathed the girl , and an unaccountable fluttering of her heart induced a remarkably high color in her cheeks when she sped up the steps of the hotel and entered the brilliantly-lighted atrium .
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 61]: As for Medenham , though he had carefully mapped out the exact line of conduct to be followed in Bristol while watching the radiantly white arc of road that quivered in front of the car during the run from the Mendips , for a second or two he dared not trust his voice to ask the hall-porter certain necessary questions .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 17]: Unaided by the glamor of birth or position he had won this delightful girl 's confidence .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 32]: She believed in him now as she would never again believe in Count Edouard Marigny ; what that meant in such a moment , none can tell but a devout lover .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 32]: Naturally , that was his point of view ; it did not occur to him that Cynthia might already have regretted the impulse which led her to utter her thoughts aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 17]: Her nature was of the Martian type revealed to Swedenborg in one of his philosophic trances .
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 33]: `` The inhabitants of Mars , '' said he , `` account it wicked to think one thing and speak another -- to wish one thing while the face expresses another . ''
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 26]: Happy Martians , perhaps , but not quite happy Cynthia , still blushing hotly because of her daring suggestion as to the disposal of Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 13]: But she was deeply puzzled by the mishap to the Du Vallon .
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 46]: Unwilling to think evil of anyone , she felt , nevertheless , that Fitzroy -LRB- as she called him -RRB- would never have treated both Mrs. Devar and the Frenchman so cavalierly if he had not anticipated the very incident that happened on the Mendips .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 6]: Why did he turn back ?
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 12]: How did he really find out what had become of them ?
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 9]: What would Simmonds have done in his stead ?
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 36]: A hundred strange doubts throbbed in her brain , but they were jumbled in confusion before that more intimate and insistent question -- how would Fitzroy interpret her eagerness to retain him in her service ?
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 29]: Meanwhile , the Swedish seer 's theory of Martian speech and thought acting in unity was making itself at home on the pavement in front of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 17]: Medenham learnt from the hall-porter that a motor-car had reached Bristol from London about five o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 39]: The driver , who was alone , had asked for Miss Vanrenen , and was told that she was expected but had not yet arrived , whereupon he went off , saying that he would call after dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 41]: `` Another shuffer kem a bit later an ' axed the same thing , '' went on the man , `` but he did n't have no car , an ' he left no word about callin ' again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 4]: `` Excellent ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 3]: said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 16]: `` Now please go and tell Captain Devar that I wish to see him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 4]: `` Here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 7]: I can not leave my car .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 26]: He must be at liberty , as he is in evening dress , and the ladies will not come downstairs under half an hour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 4]: Devar soon appeared .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 39]: His mother had managed to inform him that the substituted driver was responsible for the complete collapse of Marigny 's project , and he was puffing with annoyance , though well aware that he must not display it .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 34]: `` Well , '' said he , strutting up to Medenham and blowing a cloud of cigarette smoke from his thick lips , `` well , what is it , my man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 16]: For answer , Medenham disconnected a lamp and held it close to his own face .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 7]: `` Do you recognize me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 15]: Devar , in blank astonishment , affected to screw in his eyeglass more firmly .
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 18]: `` No , '' he said , `` nor am I particularly anxious to make your acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 32]: You have behaved wather badly , I understand , but that is of no consequence now , as Simmonds has bwought his car he-aw -- '' `` Look again , Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 15]: We last met in Calcutta , where you swindled me out of fifty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 30]: Unfortunately I did not hear of your presence in South Africa until you were cashiered at Cape Town , or I might have saved the authorities some trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 8]: The man wilted under those stern eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 4]: `` Good gad !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 3]: Medenham ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 3]: he stammered .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 8]: Medenham replaced the lamp in its socket .
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 15]: `` I am glad you are not trying any pretense , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 20]: `` Otherwise I would be forced to take action , with the most lamentable consequences for you , Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 14]: Now , I will hold my hand , provided you obey me implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 21]: Send for your overcoat , go straight to the Central Station , and travel to London by the next train .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 40]: You can scribble some excuse to your mother , but , if I have any cause even to suspect that you have told her who I am , I shall not hesitate to put the police on your track .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 14]: You must vanish , and be dumb -- for three months at least .
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 34]: If you are hard up , I will give you some money -- sufficient for a fortnight 's needs -- and you can write to me for further supplies at my London address .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 27]: Even a rascal like you must be permitted to live , I suppose , so I risk breaking the law myself by screening you from justice .
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 5]: Those are my terms .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 6]: Do you accept them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 31]: The red face had grown yellow , and the steel-gray eyes that were a heritage of the Devar family glistened with terror , but the man endeavored to obtain mercy .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 20]: `` Dash it all , Medenham , '' he groaned , `` do n't be too hard on me .
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 12]: I 'm goin ' stwaight now -- ` pon me honor .
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 10]: This chap , Marigny -- '' `` You fool !
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 25]: I offer you liberty and money , yet you try brazenly to get me to fall in with your wretched designs against Miss Vanrenen !
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 15]: Which is it to be -- a police cell or the railway station ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 9]: Medenham moved as if to summon the hall-porter .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 11]: In a very frenzy of fear Devar caught his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 10]: `` For Gawd 's sake -- '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 7]: `` You go , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 12]: `` I am prepared to spare you to the utmost extent .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 22]: Tell the hall-porter to bring your overcoat and hat , and to give you a sheet of note-paper and an envelope .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 6]: Show me what you write .
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 12]: If it is satisfactory I shall start you with twenty pounds .
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 18]: You can send from London to-morrow for your belongings , as your hotel bill will be paid .
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 3]: But remember !
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 13]: One treacherous word from you and I telegraph to Scotland Yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 46]: Mrs. Devar had a bad quarter of an hour when a penciled note from her son was delivered at her room and she read : DEAR MATER -- I hardly had time to tell you that I am obliged to return to town this evening .
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 11]: Please make my apologies to Miss Vanrenen and Count Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 30]: Yours ever , J. Medenham frowned a little at the reference to Cynthia , but something of the sort was necessary if an open scandal was to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 16]: As for `` Dear Mater , '' she was so unnerved that she actually wept .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 40]: Hard and calculating though she might be , the man was her son , and the bitter experiences of twenty years warned her that he had been driven from Bristol by some ghost new risen from an evil past .
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 19]: Medenham , however , believed that he had settled one difficulty , and prepared blithely to tackle another .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 15]: He ran the car to the garage where he had arranged to meet Dale .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 7]: `` Have you seen Simmonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 5]: was his first question .
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 12]: `` Yes , my l -- , yes , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 6]: `` Where is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 17]: `` Just off for a snack , sir , before goin ' to the hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 7]: `` Bring him here at once .
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 8]: We will attend to the snack afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 7]: No mistake , now , Dale .
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 18]: He must see no one in the hotel until he and I have had a talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 4]: Simmonds was produced .
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 3]: He saluted .
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 14]: `` Glad to meet you again , my lord , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 32]: `` I hope I have n't caused any trouble by sending that telegram to Bournemouth , but Dale tells me that you do n't wish your title to be known . ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 8]: `` Forget it , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 20]: `` I have done you a good turn , Simmonds -- are you prepared to do me one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 8]: `` Just try me , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 8]: `` Put your car out of commission .
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 23]: Stick a pin through the earth contact of your magneto and jam it against a cylinder , or something of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 26]: Then go to Miss Vanrenen and tell her how sorry you are , but you must have another week at least to pull things straight .
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 15]: She will not be vexed , and I guarantee you against any possible loss .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 21]: To put the best face on affairs , you had better remain in Bristol a few days at my expense .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 19]: Of course , it is understood that I deputize for you during the remainder of the tour . ''
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 39]: Simmonds , no courtier , grinned broadly , and even Dale winked at the North Star ; Medenham had steeled himself against such manifestations of crude opinion -- his face was impassive as that of a graven image .
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 14]: `` Of course I 'll oblige you in that way , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 5]: Who would n't ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 5]: came the slow reply .
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 63]: CHAPTER VII WHEREIN CYNTHIA TAKES HER OWN LINE When the Mercury , shining from Dale 's attentions , halted noiselessly opposite the College Green Hotel on the Saturday morning , Count Edouard Marigny was standing there ; the Du Vallon was not in evidence , and its owner 's attire bespoke other aims than motoring , at any rate for the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 8]: Evidently he was well content with himself .
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 36]: A straw hat was set on the back of his head , a cigarette stuck between his lips , his hands were thrust into his trousers pockets , and his feet were spread widely apart .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 17]: Taken altogether , he had the air of a man without a care in the world .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 18]: He smiled , too , in the most friendly fashion , when Medenham 's eyes met his .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 18]: `` I hear that Simmonds is unable to carry out his contract , '' he said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 15]: `` You are mistaken , a second time , monsieur , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 14]: `` Why , then , are _ you _ here this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 7]: `` I am acting for Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 32]: If anything , my car is slightly superior to his , while I may be regarded as an equally competent driver , so the contract is kept in all essentials . ''
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 4]: Marigny still smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 46]: The Frenchman of mid-Victorian romance would have shelved this point by indulging in `` an inimitable shrug '' ; but nowadays Parisians of the Count 's type do not shrug -- with John Bull 's clothing they have adopted no small share of his stolidness .
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 9]: `` It is immaterial , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 24]: `` I have sent my man to offer him my Du Vallon , and Smith will go with him to explain its humors .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 17]: You , as a skilled motorist , understand that a car is of the feminine gender .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 31]: Like any other charming demoiselle , it demands the exercise of tact -- it yields willingly to gentle handling -- '' Medenham cut short the Count 's neatly turned phrases .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 16]: `` Simmonds has no need to avail himself of your courtesy , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 33]: `` As for the rest , give me your address in Paris , and when next I visit the French capital I shall be delighted to analyze these subtleties with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 6]: `` Ah , most admirable !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 18]: But the really vital question before us to-day is your address in London , Mr. Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 57]: Marigny dwelt on the surname as if it were a succulent oyster , and , in the undeniable surprise of the moment , Medenham was forced to believe that `` Captain '' Devar , formerly of Horton 's Horse , had dared all by telling his confederate the truth , or some part of the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 24]: The two men looked squarely at each other , and Marigny did not fail to misinterpret the dubious frown on Medenham 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 42]: He descended a step or two , and crossed the pavement leisurely , dropping his voice so that it might not reach the ears of a porter , laden with the ladies ' traveling boxes , who appeared in the doorway .
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 7]: `` Why should we quarrel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 15]: he asked , with an engaging frankness well calculated to reassure a startled evildoer .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 14]: `` In this matter I am anxious to treat you as a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 5]: _ Allons , donc !
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 15]: _ Hurry off instantly , and tell Simmonds to bring the Du Vallon here .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 9]: Leave me to explain everything to Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 24]: Surely you agree that she ought to be spared the unpleasantness of a wrangle -- or , shall we say , an exposure ?
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 26]: You see , '' he continued with a trifle more animation , and speaking in French , `` the game is not worth the candle .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 37]: In a few hours , at the least , you will be in the hands of the police , whereas , by reaching London to-night , you may be able to pacify the Earl of Fairholme .
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 6]: I can help , perhaps .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 18]: I will say all that is possible , and my testimony ought to carry some weight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 5]: Medenham was thoroughly mystified .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 40]: That the Frenchman was not yet aware of his identity was now clear enough , though , with Devar 's probable duplicity still running in his mind , he could not solve the puzzle presented by this vaunted half-knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 13]: Again the other attributed his perplexity to anything except its real cause .
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 13]: `` I am willing to befriend you , '' he urged emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 13]: `` You have acted foolishly , but not criminally , I hope .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 38]: In your anxiety to help a colleague you forgot the fine distinction which the law draws between _ meum _ and _ tuum _ -- '' `` No , '' said Medenham , turning to the porter .
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 22]: `` Put the larger box on the carrier , and strap the other on top of it -- the locks outwards .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 10]: Then you will find that they fit exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 27]: `` Do n't be a headstrong idiot , '' muttered the Count , with a certain heat of annoyance making itself felt in his patronizing tone .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 24]: `` Miss Vanrenen will come out at any minute -- '' Medenham glanced at the clock by the side of the speed indicator .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 21]: `` Miss Vanrenen is due now unless she is being purposely detained by Mrs. Devar , '' he commented dryly .
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 11]: `` But why persist in this piece of folly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 15]: growled Marigny , to whose reluctant consciousness the idea of failure suddenly presented itself .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 15]: `` You must realize by this time that I know who owns your car .
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 28]: A telegram from me will put the authorities on your track , your arrest will follow , and Miss Vanrenen will be subjected to the gravest inconvenience .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 6]: _ Sacr√© nom d'un pipe !
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 15]: _ If you will not yield to fair means I must resort to foul .
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 26]: It comes to this -- you either quit Bristol at once or I inform Miss Vanrenen of the trick you have played on her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 28]: Medenham turned and picked up from the seat the pair of stout driving-gloves which had caught Smith 's inquiring eye by reason of their quality and substance .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 11]: He drew on the right-hand glove , and buttoned it .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 10]: When he answered , he spoke with irritating slowness .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 33]: `` Would it not be better for all concerned that the lady in whose behalf you profess to be so deeply moved should be permitted to continue her tour without further disturbance ?
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 31]: You and I can meet in London , monsieur , and I shall then have much pleasure in convincing you that I am a most peaceable and law-abiding person . ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 9]: `` No , '' came the angry retort .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 5]: `` I have decided .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 9]: I withdraw my offer to overlook your offense .
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 27]: At whatever cost , Miss Vanrenen must be protected until her father learns how his wishes have been disregarded by a couple of English bandits . ''
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 8]: `` Sorry , '' said Medenham coolly .
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 15]: He alighted in the roadway , as the driving seat was near the curb .
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 32]: A glance into the vestibule of the hotel revealed Cynthia , in motor coat and veil , giving some instructions , probably with regard to letters , to a deferential hall-porter .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 19]: Walking rapidly round the front of the car , he caught Marigny 's shoulder with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 37]: `` If you dare to open your mouth in Miss Vanrenen 's presence , other than by way of some commonplace remark , I shall forthwith smash your face to a jelly , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 25]: A queer shiver ran through the Frenchman 's body , but Medenham did not commit the error of imagining that his adversary was afraid .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 8]: His grip on Marigny 's shoulder tightened .
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 32]: The two were now not twelve inches apart , and the Englishman read that involuntary tension of the muscles aright , for there is a palsy of rage as of fear .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 16]: `` I have some acquaintance with the _ savate _ , '' he said suavely .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 16]: `` Please take my word for it , and you will be spared an injury .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 12]: A moment ago you offered to treat me like a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 15]: I reciprocate now by being willing to accept your promise to hold your tongue .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 10]: Miss Vanrenen is coming ... What say you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 15]: `` I agree , '' said Marigny , though his dark eyes blazed redly .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 6]: `` Ah , thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 16]: and Medenham 's left hand busied itself once more with the fastening of the glove .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 8]: `` You understand , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 8]: he heard , in a soft snarl .
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 3]: `` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 7]: The truce ends with my departure .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 7]: Meanwhile , you are acting wisely .
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 14]: I do n't suppose I shall ever respect you so much again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 12]: `` Now , you two -- what are you discussing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 6]: cried Cynthia from the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 21]: `` I hope you are not trying to persuade my chauffeur to yield his place to you , Monsieur Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 28]: Once bitten , twice shy , you know , and I would insist on checking each mile by the map if you were at the wheel . ''
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 15]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Now , you two -- what are you discussing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 33]: _ Page 148 _ -RSB- `` Your chauffeur is immovable , mademoiselle , '' was the ready answer , though the accompanying smile was not one of the Count 's best efforts .
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 5]: `` He looks it .
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 7]: Why are you vexed , Fitzroy ?
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 9]: Ca n't you forgive your friend Simmonds ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 16]: Cynthia lifted those demure blue eyes of hers , and held Medenham 's gaze steadfast .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 13]: `` I trust you are not challenging contradiction , Miss Vanrenen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 21]: he said , with deliberate resolve not to let her slip back thus easily into the r√¥le of gracious employer .
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 12]: She did not flinch , but her eyebrows arched a little .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 10]: `` Oh , no , '' she said offhandedly .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 24]: `` Simmonds told me his misfortunes last night , and I assumed that you and he had settled matters satisfactorily between you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 38]: `` As for that , '' broke in the Count , `` I have just offered my car as a substitute , but Fitzroy prefers to take you as far as Hereford , at any cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 3]: `` Hereford !
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 18]: I understood from Simmonds that Mr. Fitzroy would see us through the remainder of the tour ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 21]: `` Monsieur Marigny is somewhat vague in our island topography : you saw that last evening , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 3]: He smiled .
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 24]: Cynthia , too , glanced from one to the other with a frank merriment that showed how fully she appreciated their mutual dislike .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 14]: As for Marigny , his white teeth gleamed now in a sarcastic grin .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 18]: `` Adversity is a strict master , '' he said , lapsing into his own language again .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 25]: `` My blunder of yesterday has shown me the need of caution , so I go no farther than Hereford in my thoughts . ''
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 25]: `` It is more to the point to tell us how far you are going in your car , '' cried the girl lightly .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 12]: `` I , too , hope to be in Hereford to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 10]: Mrs. Devar says you mean to spend Sunday there .
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 27]: If that is a fixed thing , and you can bear with me for a few hours , I shall meet you there without fail . ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 23]: `` Come , by all means , if your road lies that way ; but do n't let us make formal engagements .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 19]: I love to think that I am drifting at will through this land of gardens and apple blossom .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 32]: And , just think of it -- three cathedrals in one day -- a Minster for breakfast , lunch , and dinner , with Tintern Abbey thrown in for afternoon tea .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 38]: Such a wealth of medievalism makes my head reel ... I was in there for matins , '' and she nodded to the grave old pile rearing its massive Gothic within a few paces of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 16]: `` At high noon we shall visit Gloucester , and to-night we shall see Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 20]: All that within a short hundred miles , to say nothing of Chepstow , Monmouth , the Wye Valley !
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 4]: Ah , me !
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 15]: I shall never overtake my correspondence while there are so many glories to describe .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 20]: See , I have bought some darling little guidebooks which tell you just what to say in a letter .
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 26]: What between judicious extracts and a sheaf of picture postcards scribbled at each place I 'll try and keep my friends in good humor . ''
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 55]: She produced from a pocket three of the red-covered volumes so familiar to Americans in Britain -- and to Britons themselves , for that matter , when the belated discovery is made that it is not necessary to cross the Channel in order to enjoy a holiday -- and showed them laughingly to Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 14]: `` Now , '' she cried , `` I am armed against you .
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 13]: No longer will you be able to paralyze me with your learning .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 14]: If you say 1269 at Tintern I shall retort with 1387 at Monmouth .
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 57]: When you point out Nell Gwynne 's birthplace in Hereford , I shall take you to the Haven Inn , where David Garrick was born , and , if you are n't very , very good , I shall tell you how much the New Town Hall cost , and who laid the foundation stone . ''
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 37]: Medenham alone held the key to the girl 's lively mood , and it was a novel and quite delightful sensation to be thus admitted to the inner shrine of her emotions , as it were .
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 24]: She was chattering at random in order to smooth away the awkwardness of meeting him after that whispered indiscretion at their parting overnight .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 38]: Here , at least , Marigny was hopelessly at sea -- _ d√©sorient√© _ , as he would have put it -- because he could not possibly know that Cynthia herself had counseled the disappearance of Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 27]: Indeed , he attributed her high spirits to mere politeness -- to her wish that he should believe she had forgotten the fiasco on the Mendips .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 17]: This imagined salving of his wounded vanity served only to inflame him the more against Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 26]: He was still afire with resentment , since no Frenchman can understand the rude Saxon usage that enforces submission under a threat of physical violence .
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 35]: That a man should be ready to defend his honor -- to convince an opponent by endeavoring to kill him -- yes , he accepted without cavil those tenets of the French social code .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 18]: But the brutal British fixity of purpose displayed by this truculent chauffeur left him gasping with indignation .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 14]: He was quite sure that the man meant exactly what he had said .
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 55]: He felt that any real departure from the compact wrung from him by force would prove disastrous to his personal appearance , and he was sensible of a certain weighing underlook in the Englishman 's eyes when his seemingly harmless chatter hinted at a change of existing plans as soon as Hereford was reached .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 25]: But that was a mere feint , a preliminary flourish , such as a practiced swordsman executes in empty air before saluting his opponent .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 15]: He had not the slightest intention of testing Medenham 's pugilistic powers just then .
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 47]: The reasonable probability of having his chief features beaten to a pulp was not inviting , while the crude efficacy of the notion , in its influence on Miss Vanrenen 's affairs , was not the least stupefying element in a difficult and wholly unforeseen situation .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 32]: He realized fully that anything in the nature of a scuffle would alienate the girl 's sympathies forever , no matter how strong a case for interference he might present afterwards .
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 27]: The chauffeur would be dismissed on the spot , but with the offender would go his own prospect of winning the heiress to the Vanrenen millions .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 62]: So Count Edouard swallowed his spleen , though the requisite effort must have dissipated some of his natural shrewdness , or he could not have failed to read more correctly the tokens of embarrassment given by Cynthia 's heightened color , by her eager vivacity , by her breathless anxiety not to discuss the substitution of one driver for the other .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 22]: Medenham was about to disclaim any intention of measuring his lore against that in the guidebooks when Mrs. Devar bustled out .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 26]: `` Awfully sorry , '' she began , `` but I had to wire James -- '' Her eyes fell on Medenham and the Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 8]: Momentarily rendered speechless , she rallied bravely .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 42]: `` I thought , from what Count Edouard said -- '' `` Miss Vanrenen has lost faith in me , even in my beautiful automobile , '' broke in Marigny with a quickness that spoiled a pathetic glance meant for Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 29]: The American girl , however , was weary of the fog of innuendo and hidden purpose that seemed to be an appanage of the Frenchman and his car .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 31]: `` For goodness ' sake , '' she cried , `` let us regard it as a settled thing that Fitzroy takes Simmonds 's place until we reach London again .
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 9]: Surely we have the best of the bargain .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 17]: If the two men are satisfied why should we have anything to say against it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 46]: Cynthia was her father 's daughter , and the attribute of personal dominance that in the man 's case had proved so effective in dealing with Milwaukees now made itself felt in the minor question of `` transportation '' presented by Medenham and his motor .
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 14]: Her blue eyes hardened , and a firm note rang in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 36]: Nor did Medenham help to smooth the path for Mrs. Devar by saying quietly : `` In the meantime , Miss Vanrenen , the information stored in those little red books is growing rusty . ''
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 50]: She settled the dispute at once by asking her companion which side of the car she preferred , and the other woman was compelled to say graciously that she really had no choice in the matter , but , to avoid further delay , would take the left-hand seat .
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 34]: Cynthia followed , and Medenham , still ready to deal harshly with Marigny if necessary , adjusted their rugs , saw to the safe disposal of the camera , and closed the door .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 11]: At that instant , the hall-porter hurried down the steps .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 41]: `` Beg pardon , mum , '' he said to Mrs. Devar , thrusting an open telegram between Medenham and Cynthia , `` but there 's one word here -- '' She snatched the form angrily from his outstretched hand .
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 12]: `` The word after -- '' `` Come round this side .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 7]: You are incommoding Miss Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 4]: The man obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 25]: With the curious fatality which attends such incidents , even among well-bred people , not a word was spoken by any of the others .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 22]: To all seeming , Mrs. Devar 's cramped handwriting might have concealed some secret of gravest import to each person present .
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 9]: It was not really so thrilling when heard .
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 17]: `` That is ` Raven , ' plain enough I should think , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 6]: `` Thank you , mum .
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 12]: ` The Raven , Shrewsbury , ' '' read the hall-porter .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 6]: Medenham caught Marigny 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 10]: He was minded to laugh outright , but forebore .
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 49]: Then he sprang into his seat , and the car curled in quick semicircle and climbed the hill to the left , while the Frenchman , surprised by this rapid movement , signaled frantically to Mrs. Devar , nodding farewell , that they had taken the wrong road .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 9]: `` Not at all , '' explained Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 26]: `` I want you to see the Clifton Suspension Bridge , which is a hundred feet higher in the air than the Brooklyn Bridge . ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 13]: `` I 'm sure it is n't , '' cried Cynthia indignantly .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 19]: `` The next thing you will tell me is that the Thames is wider than the Hudson . ''
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 14]: `` So it is , at an equal distance from the sea . ''
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 8]: `` Well , trot out your bridge .
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 9]: Seeing is believing , all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 52]: But Cynthia had yet to learn the exceeding wisdom of Ezekiel when he wrote of those `` which have eyes to see , and see not , '' for never was optical delusion better contrived than the height above water level of the fairylike structure that spans the Avon below Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 8]: The reason is not far to seek .
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 23]: The mind is not prepared for the imminence of the swaying roadway that leaps from side to side of that tremendous gorge .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 43]: On either crest are pleasant gardens , pretty houses , tree-shaded paths , and the opposing precipices are so prompt in their sheer fall that the eye insensibly rests on the upper level and refuses to dwell on the river far beneath .
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 41]: So Cynthia was charmed but not convinced , and Medenham himself could scarce believe his recollection that the tops of the towers of the far larger bridge at Brooklyn would be only twenty-six feet higher than the roadway at Clifton .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 16]: Mrs. Devar , of course , showed an utter lack of interest in the debate .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 34]: Indeed , she refused emphatically to walk to the middle of the bridge , on the plea of light-headedness , and Cynthia instantly availed herself of the few minutes ' t√™te-√†-t√™te thus vouchsafed .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 36]: `` Now , '' said she , looking , not at Medenham , but at the Titanic cleft cut by a tiny river , `` now , please , tell me all about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 15]: `` Just as at Cheddar , the rocks are limestone -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 7]: `` Oh , bother the rocks !
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 8]: How did you get rid of Simmonds ?
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 7]: And why is Count Marigny mad ?
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 15]: And are you mixed up in Captain Devar 's mighty smart change of base ?
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 4]: Tell me everything .
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 4]: I hate mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 29]: If we go on at the present rate some of us will soon be wearing masks and cloaks , and stamping our feet , and saying ` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 3]: Ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 5]: or ` Sdeath ! '
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 6]: or something equally absurd . ''
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 8]: `` Simmonds is a victim of science .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 31]: If the earth wire of a magneto makes a metallic contact there is trouble in the cylinders , so Simmonds is switched off until he can locate the fault . ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 8]: `` The work of a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 11]: `` It will take him five days at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 28]: Then Cynthia did flash an amused glance at him , but he was watching a small steamer puffing against the tide , and his face was adamant .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' she cried quizzically .
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 12]: `` What 's the matter with the Count 's cylinders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 44]: `` He professed to believe that I had stolen somebody 's car , and graciously undertook to shield me if I would consent to run away at once , leaving you and Mrs. Devar to finish your tour in the Du Vallon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 6]: `` And you refused ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 7]: `` What did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 8]: `` Very little ; he agreed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 19]: `` But he is not the sort of person who turns the other cheek to the smiter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 12]: `` I did n't smite him , '' Medenham blurted out .
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 23]: Cynthia fastened on to the hesitating denial with the hawklike pounce of some barrister famous for merciless cross-examination of a hostile witness .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 7]: `` Did you offer to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 12]: `` We dealt with possible eventualities , '' he said weakly .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 28]: `` I knew it ... There was such a funny look in your eyes when I first saw you ... '' `` Funny is the right word .
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 9]: The crisis _ was _ rather humorous . ''
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 47]: `` Poor man , he only wished to be civil , perhaps -- I mean , that is , in lending his car ; and he may really have thought you -- you were not a chauffeur -- like Simmonds , or Smith , for example .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 11]: You would n't have hit him , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 7]: `` I sincerely hope not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 28]: She caught her breath and peered at him again , and there was a light in her eyes that would have infuriated Marigny had he seen it .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 24]: It was well , too , that Medenham 's head was averted , since he simply dared not meet her frankly inquisitive gaze .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 22]: `` You know that such a thing would be horrid for me -- for all of us , '' she persisted .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 14]: `` Yes , '' he said , `` I feel that very keenly .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 10]: Thank goodness , the Frenchman felt it also . ''
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 13]: Cynthia thought fit to skip to the third item in her list .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 8]: `` Now as to Captain Devar ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 7]: `` His mother is dreadfully annoyed .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 18]: She hates dull evenings , and the four of us were to play bridge to-night at Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 7]: Why was he sent away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 5]: `` Sent away ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 6]: echoed Medenham in mock amazement .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 11]: `` Oh , come , you knew him quite well .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 6]: You said so in London .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 24]: I am not exactly the silly young thing I look , Mr. Fitzroy , and Count Marigny 's coincidences are a trifle far-fetched .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 50]: Both he and Captain Devar fully understood what they were doing when they arranged to meet in Bristol , and somebody must have fired a very big gun quite close to the fat little man that he should be scared off the instant he set eyes on me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 39]: Then Medenham resolved to end a catechism that opened up illimitable vistas , for he did not want to lose Cynthia just yet , and there was no knowing what she might do if she suspected the truth .
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 41]: Although , if the situation were strictly dissected , Mrs. Devar 's chaperonage was as useful to him as the lady herself intended it to be to Marigny , there was a vital difference between the two sets of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 75]: He had been pitchforked by fate into the company of a charming girl whom he was learning to love as he had never loved woman before , whereas the members of the money-hunting gang whose scheme he had accidentally overheard at Brighton were engaged in a deliberate intrigue , outlined in Paris as soon as Mr. Vanrenen planned the motor tour for his daughter , and perfected during Cynthia 's brief stay in London .
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 17]: So he appealed for her forbearance on a plea that he imagined was sure to succeed .
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 25]: `` I do n't wish to conceal from you that Captain Devar and I have fallen out in the past , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 21]: `` But I am genuinely sorry for his mother , who certainly does not know what a rascal he is .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 12]: Do n't ask me for further details now , Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 33]: He will not cross your path in the near future , and I promise to tell you the whole story long before there is any chance of your meeting him again . ''
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 26]: For some reason , deep hidden yet delicately distinct , Cynthia extracted a good deal more from that simple speech than the mere words implied .
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 38]: The air of the downs was peculiarly fresh and strong in the center of the bridge , a fact which probably accounted for the vivid color that lit her face and added luster to her bright eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 10]: At any rate , she dropped the conversation suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 36]: `` Mrs. Devar will be growing quite impatient , '' she said , with an admirable assumption of ease , `` and I want to buy some pictures of this pretty toy bridge of yours .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 34]: What a pity the light is altogether wrong for a snapshot , and it _ is _ so stupid to use films when one knows that the sun is in the camera ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 33]: Whereat Medenham breathed freely again , while thanking the gods for the delightfully effective resources that every woman -- even a candid , outspoken Cynthia -- has at her fingers ' ends .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 79]: The simplest means of reaching the Gloucester road was to run back past the hotel , but the goddess of happy chance elected , for her own purposes , that Medenham should ask a policeman to direct him to Cabot 's Tower , and , the man having the brain of a surveyor , he was sent through by-streets that saved a few yards , perhaps , but cost him many minutes in stopping to inquire the way .
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 8]: Hence , he missed an amazing sight .
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 29]: The merest glimpse of Count Edouard Marigny 's new acquaintance would surely have pulled him up , if it did not put an end to the tour forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 7]: But that was not to be .
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 88]: Blissfully unconscious of the fact that the Frenchman was eagerly explaining to a dignified yet strangely perturbed old gentleman that the car Number X L 4000 -- containing a young American lady and her friend , and driven by a conceited puppy of a chauffeur who suffered badly from _ t√™te mont√©e _ -- had just gone up the hill to the left , Medenham at last reached the open road , and the Mercury leaped forward as if Gloucester would hardly wait till it arrived there .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 40]: The old gentleman had only that minute alighted from a station cab , and a question he addressed to the hall-porter led that civil functionary to refer him to Marigny `` as a friend of the parties concerned . ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 21]: But the newcomer drew himself up somewhat stiffly when the foreign personage spoke of Medenham as a `` puppy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 33]: `` Before our conversation proceeds any farther I think I ought to tell you that I am the Earl of Fairholme and that Viscount Medenham is my son , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 15]: Marigny looked so blank at this that the Earl 's explanation took fresh shape .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 32]: `` I mean , '' he went on , perceiving that his hearer was none the wiser , `` I mean that the chauffeur you allude to is Viscount Medenham . ''
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 36]: Marigny , though born on the banks of the Loire , was a Southern Frenchman by descent , and the hereditary tint of olive in his skin became prominent only when his emotions were aroused .
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 13]: Now the pink and white of his complexion was tinged with yellowish-green .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 14]: Never before in his life had he been quite so surprised -- never .
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 17]: `` He -- he said his name was Fitzroy , '' was all he could gasp .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 8]: `` So it is -- the dog .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 37]: Took the family name and dropped his title in order to go gallivanting about the country with this young person ... An American , I am told -- and with that detestable creature , Mrs. Devar !
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 3]: Nice thing !
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 7]: No wonder Lady Porthcawl was shocked .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 13]: May I ask , sir , who _ you _ are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 12]: Lord Fairholme was very angry , and not without good reason .
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 43]: He had traveled from London at an absurdly early hour in response to the urgent representations of Susan , Lady St. Maur , to whom her intimate friend , Millicent Porthcawl , had written a thrilling account of the goings-on at Bournemouth .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 58]: It happened that the Countess of Porthcawl 's bedroom overlooked the carriage-way in front of the Royal Bath Hotel , and , when she recovered from the stupor of recognizing Medenham in the chauffeur of the Vanrenen equipage , she gratified her spite by sending a lively and wholly distorted version of the tour to his aunt .
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 24]: The letter reached Curzon Street during the afternoon , and exercised a remarkably restorative effect on the now convalescent lover of forced strawberries .
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 42]: Lady St. Maur ordered her carriage , and was driven in a jiffy to the Fairholme mansion in Cavendish Square , where she and her brother indulged in the most lugubrious opinions as to the future of `` poor George . ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 19]: They assumed that he would fall an easy prey to the wiles of a `` designing American . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 88]: Neither of them had met many citizens of the United States , and each shared to the fullest extent the common British dislike of every person and every thing that is new and strange , so they had visions of a Countess of Fairholme who would speak in the weird tongue of Chicago , whose name would be `` Mamie , '' who would call the earl `` poppa number two , '' and prefix every utterance with `` Say , '' or `` My land ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 41]: Both brother and sister had laughed many a time at the stage version of a Briton as presented in Paris , but they forgot that the average Englishman 's conception of the average American is equally ludicrous in its blunders .
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 14]: In devising means `` to save George '' they flew into a panic .
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 44]: Lady St. Maur telegraphed a frantic appeal to Lady Porthcawl for information , but `` dear Millicent '' took thought , saw that she was already sufficiently committed , and caused her maid to reply that she had left Bournemouth for the weekend .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 11]: A telegram to the hotel manager produced more definite news .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 44]: Cynthia , providing against the receipt of any urgent message from her father , had given the College Green Hotel as her address for the night ; but this intelligence arrived too late to permit of the Earl 's departure till next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 21]: Lady Porthcawl 's hint that the `` devoted George was traveling incognito '' prevented the use of wire or post .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 30]: If the infatuated viscount were to be brought to reason there was nothing for it but that the Earl should hurry to Bristol by an early train next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 11]: He did hurry , and arrived five minutes too late .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 15]: Marigny , of course , saw that lightning had darted from a summer sky .
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 27]: If the despised chauffeur had proved such a tough opponent , what would happen now that he turned out to be a sprig of the aristocracy ?
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 17]: He guessed at once that the Earl of Fairholme appraised Cynthia Vanrenen by the Devar standard .
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 29]: He knew that five minutes in Cynthia 's company would alter this doughty old gentleman 's views so greatly that his present fury would give place to idolatry .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 38]: No matter what the cost , they two must not meet , and it was very evident that if Hereford were mentioned as the night 's rendezvous , the Earl would proceed there by the next train .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 6]: What was to be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 4]: He decided promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 30]: Lifting his hat , and offering Lord Fairholme his card , he made up his mind to lie , and lie speciously , with circumstantial detail and convincing knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 14]: `` I happened to meet the Vanrenens in Paris , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 18]: `` Business brought me here , and I was surprised to see Miss Vanrenen without her father .
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 13]: You will pardon my reference to your son , I am sure .
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 6]: His attitude is explicable now .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 12]: He resented my offer of friendly assistance to the young lady .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 11]: Perhaps he thought she might avail herself of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 3]: `` Assistance ?
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 6]: What is the matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 12]: `` She had arranged for a car to meet her here .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 35]: As it was not forthcoming , she altered her plans for a tour of Oxford , Kenilworth , and Warwick , and has gone in Viscount -- Viscount -- '' `` Medenham 's . ''
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 22]: `` Ah , yes -- I did not catch the name precisely -- in your son 's car to London . ''
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 36]: By this time Lord Fairholme had ascertained the Frenchman 's description , and he was sufficiently well acquainted with the Valley of the Loire to recollect the Ch√¢teau Marigny as a house of some importance .
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 38]: `` I beg your pardon , Monsieur le Comte , if I seemed to speak brusquely at first , '' he said , `` but we all appear to be mixed up in a comedy of errors .
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 17]: I remember now that my son telegraphed from Brighton to say that he would return to-day .
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 25]: Perhaps my journey from town was unnecessary , and he may be only engaged in some harmless escapade that is now nearing its end .
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 24]: I am very much obliged to you , and -- er -- I hope you will call when next you are in London .
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 12]: You know my name -- my place is in Cavendish Square .
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 3]: Good-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 33]: So Marigny was left a second time on the steps of the hotel , while the cab which brought the Earl of Fairholme from the railway station took him back to it .
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 17]: The Du Vallon came panting from the garage , but the Frenchman sent it away again .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 30]: Hereford was no great distance by the direct road , and he had already determined not to follow the tortuous route devised by Cynthia for the day 's run .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 9]: Moreover , he must now reconsider his schemes .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 22]: The long telegrams which he had just dispatched to Devar in London and to Peter Vanrenen in Paris might demand supplements .
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 11]: And to think of that accursed chauffeur being a viscount !
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 6]: His gorge rose at that .
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 6]: The thought almost choked him .
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 34]: It was well that the hall-porter did not understand French , or the words that were muttered by Marigny as he turned on his heel and re-entered the hotel might have shocked him .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 22]: And , indeed , they were most unsuited for the ears of a hall-porter who dwelt next door to a cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 46]: CHAPTER VIII BREAKERS AHEAD The Earl 's title-borrowing from Shakespeare was certainly justified by current events , for Dromio of Ephesus and Dromio of Syracuse , to say nothing of their masters , were no bad prototypes of the chief actors in this Bristol comedy .
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 35]: Simmonds , not knowing who might have it in mind to investigate the latest defect in his car , decided it would be wise to disappear until Viscount Medenham was well quit of Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 40]: By arrangement with Dale , therefore , he picked up the latter soon after the Mercury was turned over to Medenham 's hands ; in effect , the one chauffeur took the other on a ` bus-driver 's holiday .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 7]: Dale was free until two o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 38]: At that hour he would depart for Hereford and meet his master , with arrangements made for the night as usual ; meanwhile , the day 's programme included a pleasant little run to Bath and back .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 30]: It was a morning that tempted to the road , but both men had risen early , and a pint of bitter seemed to be an almost indispensable preliminary .
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 26]: From Bristol to Bath is no distance to speak of , so a slight dallying over the beer led to an exchange of recent news .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 24]: Dale , it will be remembered , was of sporting bent , and he told Simmonds gleefully of his successful bet at Epsom .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 17]: `` Five golden quidlets his lordship shoved into me fist at Brighton , '' he chortled .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 17]: `` Have you met Smith , who is lookin ' after the Frenchman 's Du Vallon ?
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 2]: No ?
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 33]: Well , _ he _ was there , an ' his goggles nearly cracked when he sawr the money paid -- two points over the market price , an ' all . ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 14]: `` Sometimes one spots a winner by chanst , '' observed Simmonds judicially .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 7]: `` An ' that reminds me .
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 24]: Last night a fella tole me there was a good thing at Kempton to-day ... Now , _ what _ was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 30]: Dale instantly became a lexicon of weird-sounding words , for the British turf is exceedingly democratic in its pronunciation of the classical and foreign names frequently given to racehorses .
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 22]: His stock of racing lore was eked out by reference to a local paper ; still Simmonds scratched an uncertain pate .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 6]: `` Pity , too ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 2455 len. 20]: `` This chap had it from his nevvy , who married the sister of a housemaid at Beckhampton . ''
Parsing [sent. 2456 len. 3]: Dale whistled .
Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 6]: Here was news , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 2]: Beckhampton !
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 8]: the home of `` good things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 11]: `` Is _ that _ where it comes from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: Something real hot over a mile . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 7]: _ Ca n't _ you think ?
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 9]: Let 's look again at the entries . ''
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 9]: `` Wait a bit , '' cried Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 7]: `` I 've got it now .
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 20]: Second horse from the top of the column in to-morrow 's entries in yesterday 's _ Sportsman _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 30]: Dale understood exactly what the other man meant , and , so long as _ he _ understood , the fact may suffice for the rest of the world .
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 34]: `` Tell you wot , '' he suggested eagerly , `` when you 're ready we 'll just run to the station an ' arsk the bookstall people for yesterday 's paper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2470 len. 54]: The inquiry , the search , the triumphant discovery , the telegraphing of the `` information '' and a sovereign to Tomkinson in Cavendish Square -- `` five bob each way '' for each of the two -- all these things took time , and time was very precious to Dale just then .
Parsing [sent. 2471 len. 20]: Unhappily , time is often mute as to its value , and Bath is really quite close to Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 2472 len. 56]: The choice secret of the Beckhampton stable was safely launched -- in its speculative element , at any rate -- and Dale was about to seat himself beside Simmonds , when an astonished and somewhat irate old gentleman hooked the handle of an umbrella into his collar and shouted : `` Confound you , Dale !
Parsing [sent. 2473 len. 13]: What are you doing here , and where is your master ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2474 len. 29]: Dale 's tanned face grew pale , his ears and eyes assumed the semblance of a scared rabbit 's , and the power of speech positively failed him .
Parsing [sent. 2475 len. 9]: `` Do you hear me , Dale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2476 len. 11]: cried the Earl , that instant alighted from a cab .
Parsing [sent. 2477 len. 10]: `` I am asking you where Viscount Medenham is .
Parsing [sent. 2478 len. 17]: If he has gone to town , why have _ you _ remained in Bristol ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2479 len. 60]: `` But his lordship has n't gone to London , my lord , '' stuttered Dale , finding his voice at last , and far too flustered to collect his wits , though he realized in a dazed way that it was his duty to act exactly as Viscount Medenham would wish him to act in such trying circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 2480 len. 30]: And , indeed , many very clever people might have found themselves sinking in some such unexpected quicksand and be not one whit less bemused than the miserable chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 2481 len. 63]: Morally , he had given the only possible answer that left open a way of escape , and he had formed a sufficiently shrewd estimate of the relations between his master and the remarkably good-looking young lady whom the said master was serving with exemplary diligence to fear dire consequences to himself if he became the direct cause of a broken idyl .
Parsing [sent. 2482 len. 14]: The position was even worse if he fell back on an artistic lie .
Parsing [sent. 2483 len. 44]: The Earl was a dour person where servants were concerned , and Salom√© did not demand John the Baptist 's head on a salver with greater gusto than the autocrat of Fairholme would insist on Dale 's dismissal when he discovered the facts .
Parsing [sent. 2484 len. 23]: Talk of the horned dilemma -- here was an unfortunate asked to choose which bristle of a porcupine he would sit upon .
Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 52]: The mere presence of his lordship in Bristol betokened a social atmosphere charged with electricity -- a phase of the problem that constituted the only clear item in Dale 's seething brain : it was too much for him ; in sudden desperation he determined to stick to the plain truth .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 16]: He had to elect very quickly , for the peppery-tempered Earl would not brook delay .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 9]: `` Not gone to London , you say ?
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 11]: Then where the devil _ has _ he gone to ?
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 56]: A gentleman at the hotel , a French gentleman , who said he had met these -- these persons with whom my son is gadding about the country , told me that they had left Bristol this morning for London , because a car that was expected to meet them here had broken down . ''
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 16]: Suddenly his lordship , a county magistrate noted for his sharpness , glanced at Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 18]: He marched round to the front of the car and saw that it was registered in London .
Parsing [sent. 2492 len. 8]: He waved an accusing umbrella in air .
Parsing [sent. 2493 len. 6]: `` What car is this ?
Parsing [sent. 2494 len. 9]: Is this the motor that wo n't go ?
Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 9]: It seems to have reached Bristol all right ?
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 24]: Now , my men , I must have a candid tale from each of you , or the consequences may be most disagreeable .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 48]: You , I presume , '' and he lunged _ en tierce _ at Simmonds , `` have an employer of some sort , and I shall make it my business -- '' `` This is my own car , my lord , '' said Simmonds stiffly .
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 15]: He could be stubborn as any member of the Upper House when occasion served .
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 9]: `` Your lordship need n't use any threats .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 17]: Just ask me what you like an ' I 'll answer , if I can . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 36]: Fairholme , by no means a hasty man in the ordinary affairs of life , and only upset now by the unforeseen annoyances of an unusually disquieting mission , realized that he was losing caste .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 22]: It was a novel experience to be rebuked by a chauffeur , but he had the sense to swallow his wrath .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 22]: `` Perhaps I ought to explain that I am particularly anxious to see Lord Medenham , '' he said more calmly .
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 24]: `` I left London at eight o'clock this morning , and it is most irritating to have missed him by a few minutes .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 37]: I only wish to be assured as to his whereabouts , and , of course , I have no reason to believe that any sort of responsibility for my son 's movements rests with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 13]: `` That 's all right , my lord , '' said Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 11]: `` Viscount Medenham was very kind to me last Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 33]: I had a first-rate job , and was on my way to the Savoy Hotel to take it up , when a van ran into me an ' smashed the transmission shaft .
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 34]: His lordship met me in Down Street , an ' offered to run my two ladies to Epsom an ' along the south coast for a day or two while I repaired damages .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 36]: I was to turn up here -- an ' here I am -- but it suited his arrangements better to go on with the tour , an ' that is all there is to it .
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 11]: A bit of a joke , I call it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2512 len. 31]: `` Yes , my lord , that 's hit hexactly , '' put in Dale , with a nervous eagerness that demanded the help of not less than two aspirates .
Parsing [sent. 2513 len. 8]: The Earl managed to restrain another outburst .
Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 15]: `` Nothing to cavil at so far , '' he said with forced composure .
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 15]: `` The only point that remains is -- where is Lord Medenham now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 15]: `` Somewhere between here an ' Gloucester , my lord , '' said Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 13]: `` Gloucester -- that is not on the way to London ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 12]: No reply ; neither man was willing to bell the cat .
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 10]: Finding Simmonds a tough customer , Fairholme tackled Dale .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 14]: `` Come , come , this is rather absurd , '' he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 11]: `` Fancy my son 's chauffeur jibbing at my questions !
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 16]: Once and for all , Dale , where shall I find Lord Medenham to-night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 6]: There was no escape now .
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 13]: Dale had to blurt out the fatal word : `` Hereford ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 6]: `` Are you sure ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 6]: `` Yes , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 12]: I 'm goin ' there with his lordship 's portmanteaux . ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 11]: The head of the Fitzroy clan turned to Simmonds again .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 9]: `` Will you drive me to Gloucester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2530 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 6]: `` No , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 2532 len. 12]: I 'm under contract to remain in Bristol five days . ''
Parsing [sent. 2533 len. 4]: `` Very well .
Parsing [sent. 2534 len. 12]: Stop in Bristol , and be d -- d to you .
Parsing [sent. 2535 len. 18]: Is there any reason why you should not take me to pick up my son 's belongings ?
Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 11]: Then Dale and I can go to Hereford by train .
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 9]: Viscount Medenham is devilish particular about his linen .
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 17]: If I stick to his shirts I shall meet him sometime to-day , I suppose . ''
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 29]: Simmonds sought Dale 's counsel by an underlook , but that hapless sportsman could offer no suggestion , so the other made the best of a bad business .
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 18]: `` I 'll do that , of course , my lord , '' he said with alacrity .
Parsing [sent. 2541 len. 39]: `` Just grab his lordship 's dressing-case from that porter and shove it inside , '' he went on , eying Dale fiercely , well knowing that the whole collapse arose from a cause but too easily traced .
Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 30]: `` No , no , '' broke in the Earl , whose magisterial experiences had taught him the wisdom of keeping witnesses apart , `` Dale comes with me .
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 8]: I want to sift this business thoroughly .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 6]: Put the case in front .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 11]: We can pile the other luggage on top of it .
Parsing [sent. 2546 len. 7]: Now , Dale , jump inside .
Parsing [sent. 2547 len. 11]: Your friend knows where to go , I expect . ''
Parsing [sent. 2548 len. 23]: Thus did two bizarre elements intrude themselves into the natural order of things on that fine morning in the West of England .
Parsing [sent. 2549 len. 61]: The very shortness of the road between Bristol and Bath apparently offered an insuperable obstacle to the passage of Simmonds 's car along it , and some unknown `` chap , '' whose `` nevvy '' had married the sister of a Beckhampton housemaid , became the predominating factor in a situation that affected the fortunes of several notable people .
Parsing [sent. 2550 len. 13]: For his part , Lord Fairholme gave no further thought to Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 2551 len. 33]: It did not even occur to him it might be advisable to call again at the College Green Hotel , since Medenham had slept elsewhere , and Hereford was now the goal .
Parsing [sent. 2552 len. 44]: Certainly , the Frenchman 's good fairy might have pushed her good offices to excess by permitting him to see , careering about Bristol with a pair of chauffeurs , the man whom he believed to be then on the way to London .
Parsing [sent. 2553 len. 49]: But fairies are unreliable creatures , apt to be off with a hop , skip , and a jump , and , in any case , Marigny was writing explicit instructions to Devar , though he would have been far more profitably employed in lounging outside the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2554 len. 75]: So everybody was dissatisfied , more or less , the quaking Dale more , perhaps , than any , and the person who had absolutely no shadow of care on his soul was Medenham himself , at that moment guiding the Mercury along the splendid highway that connects Bristol with Gloucester -- taking the run leisurely , too , lest Cynthia should miss one fleeting glimpse of the ever-changing beauties of the Severn estuary .
Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 28]: During one of these adagio movements by the engine , Cynthia , who had been consulting a guidebook , leaned forward with a smile on her face .
Parsing [sent. 2556 len. 7]: `` What is a lamprey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2557 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2558 len. 22]: `` A special variety of eel which has a habit of sticking to stones by its mouth , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2559 len. 32]: Then he added , after a pause : `` Henry the First was sixty-seven years of age when he died , so the dish of lampreys was perhaps blamed unjustly . ''
Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 11]: `` You have a good memory , '' she retorted .
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 12]: `` Oh , is that in your book , Miss Vanrenen ?
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 9]: Well , here is another fact about Gloucester .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 10]: Alfred the Great held a Witenagemot there in 896 .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 9]: Do you know what a Witenagemot is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 13]: `` Yes , '' she said , `` a smoking concert . ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 25]: Mrs. Devar invariably resented these bits of by-play , since she could no more extract their meaning than if they were uttered in Choctaw .
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 14]: `` Some very good people live in Gloucestershire , '' she put in .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 48]: `` There are the -- '' She began to give extracts from Burke 's `` Landed Gentry , '' whereupon the speedometer index sprang to forty-five , and a noble fifteenth century tower soon lifted its stone lacework above the trees and spires of the ancient city .
Parsing [sent. 2569 len. 122]: Cynthia wished to obtain some photographs of old inns , so , when they had admired the cathedral , and shuddered at the memory of Richard the Third -- who wrote at Gloucester the order to Brackenbury for the murder of the princes in the Tower of London -- and smiled at Cromwell 's mordant wit in saying that the place had more churches than godliness when told of the local proverb , `` As sure as God 's in Gloucester , '' Medenham brought them to Northgate Street , where the New Inn -- which is nearly always the most antiquated hostelry in an English country-town -- supplied a fine example of massive timberwork , with courtyard and external galleries .
Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 21]: The light was so perfect that he persuaded Cynthia to stand in a doorway and let him take a picture .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 49]: During the focusing interval , he suggested that the day 's route should be varied by leaving the coast road at Westbury and running through the Forest of Dean , where a secluded hotel in the midst of a real woodland would be an ideal place for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 3]: She agreed .
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 21]: Something in his tone told her that Mrs. Devar 's consent to the arrangement had better be taken for granted .
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 104]: So they sped through the blossom-laden lanes of Gloucestershire to the leafy depths of the Forest , and saw the High Beeches , and the Old Beech , and the King 's Walk , and many of the gorgeous vistas that those twin artists Spring and Summer etched on the wooded undulations of one of Britain 's most delightful landscapes ; as a fitting sequel to a run through fairyland they lunched at the Speech House Hotel , where once the skins of daring trespassers on the King 's preserves were wont to be nailed on the Court House door by the Verderers .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 8]: It was Cynthia who pointed the moral .
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 37]: `` There is always an ogre 's cave near the Enchanted Garden , '' she said , `` and those were surely ogerish days when men were flayed alive for hunting the King 's deer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 38]: It is not to be wondered at if they dawdled somewhat by the way , when that way led past Offa 's Dyke , through Chepstow , and Tintern , and Monmouth , and Symon 's Yat .
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 36]: Indeed , Cynthia 's moods alternated between wide-eyed enjoyment and sheer regret , for each romantic ruin and charming countryside not only aroused her enthusiasm but evoked a longing to remain riveted to the spot .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 24]: Yet she would not be a woman if there were not exceptions to this rule , as shall be seen in due course .
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 39]: Mrs. Devar , perchance tempted by the word `` Castle , '' quitted the car at Chepstow , and climbed to the nail-studded oak door of one of the most perfect examples of a Norman stronghold now extant .
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 51]: Once committed to the r√¥le of sightseer , she was compelled to adhere to it , and before the fourth court was reached , had she known the story , she would have sympathized with the pilgrim who did _ not _ boil the peas in his shoes of penance .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 25]: Chepstow Castle is a splendid ruin , but its steep gradients and rough pavements are not fitted for stout ladies who wear tight boots .
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 19]: To make matters worse , the feelings of Cynthia 's chaperon soon became as sore as her toes .
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 39]: The only feature of Marten 's Tower that appealed to her was its diabolical ingenuity in providing opportunities for that interfering chauffeur to assist , almost to lift , Cynthia from one mass of fallen masonry to another .
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 12]: Though she knew nothing of Henry Marten she reviled his memory .
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 47]: She heard `` Fitzroy '' telling her wayward charge that the reformer really hated Charles I. because the King called him `` an ugly rascal '' in public , and directed that he should be turned out of Hyde Park ; the words supplied a cue .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 13]: `` Pity kings are not as powerful nowadays , '' she snapped .
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 12]: `` The presumption of the lower orders is becoming intolerable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 17]: `` Unfortunately , Marten retaliated by signing the King 's death warrant , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 4]: `` Of course .
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 13]: What else could one expect from a person of his class ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 36]: `` But Sir Henry Marten was a celebrated judge , and the son of a baronet , and he married a rich widow -- these are not the prevalent democratic vices , '' persisted Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 22]: `` You must have sat up half the night reading the guidebook , '' she cried in vexation at her blunder .
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 12]: Cynthia laughed so cheerfully that Mrs. Devar thought she had scored .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 10]: Medenham left it at that , and was content .
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 26]: Both he and Cynthia knew that lack of space forbade indulgence in such minor details of history on the part of the book 's compiler .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 9]: Another little incident heated Mrs. Devar to boiling-point .
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 47]: Cynthia more than once hinted that , if tired , she might wait for them in the lowermost court , where a fine tree spread its shade over some benches , but the older woman persisted in visiting every dungeon and scrambling up every broken stair .
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 31]: The girl took several photographs , and had reached the last film in a roll , when the whim seized her to pose Medenham in front of a Norman arch .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 13]: `` You look rather like a baron , '' she said gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 21]: `` I wish I could borrow some armor and take you in character as the gentleman who built this castle .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 9]: By the way , his name was Fitz-something-or-other .
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 6]: Was he a relation ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 8]: `` Fitz Osborne , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 5]: `` Ah , yes .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 11]: Fitzroy means King 's son , does n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 9]: `` I -- er -- believe so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 13]: `` Well , I can imagine you scowling out of a vizor .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 7]: It would suit you admirably . ''
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 8]: `` But I might not scowl . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 8]: `` Oh , yes , you would .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 4]: Remember this morning .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 18]: Just force yourself to think for a moment that I am Monsieur -- '' She stopped abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 18]: `` A little more to the left , please -- and turn your face to the sun .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 7]: There , that is capital . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 13]: `` Why should Fitzroy scowl at the recollection of Count Edouard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 19]: demanded Mrs. Devar , her eyes devouring the telltale blush that suffused the girl 's face and neck .
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 19]: `` Only because the Count wished to supplant him as our chauffeur , '' came the ready answer .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 13]: `` I thought Monsieur Marigny 's offer a very courteous one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 3]: `` Undoubtedly .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 23]: But as I had to decide the matter I preferred to travel in a car that was at my own disposal . ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 7]: Mrs. Devar dared not go farther .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 7]: She relapsed into a sulky silence .
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 44]: She said not a word when Cynthia occupied the front seat for the climb through Chepstow 's High Street , and when the girl turned to call her attention to the view from the crest of the famous Wyndcliff she was nodding asleep !
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 15]: Cynthia told Medenham , and there was a touch of regret in her voice .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 30]: `` Poor dear , '' she said in an undertone , `` the Castle was too much for her , and the fresh air has made her drowsy . ''
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 30]: He glanced quickly over his shoulder , and instantly made up his mind to broach a project that he had thought out carefully since his quarrel with the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 17]: `` You mean to stay in Hereford during the whole of to-morrow , Miss Vanrenen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 16]: Somehow , I do n't see myself scampering across the map on the British Sabbath .
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 34]: Besides , I am all behindhand with my letters , and my father will be telegraphing something emphatic if I do n't go beyond ` Much love ' on a picture postcard . ''
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 17]: `` Symon 's Yat is exceptionally beautiful , and there is a capital little hotel there .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 24]: The Wye runs past the front door , the boating is superb , and there will be a brilliant moon after dinner . ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 7]: `` And the answer is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 25]: `` That we could run into Hereford before breakfast , leaving you plenty of time to attend the morning service at the cathedral . ''
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 21]: Cynthia did not look at him or she would have seen that he was rather baronial in aspect just then .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 20]: Sad to relate , they were speeding down the Wyndcliff gorge without giving it the undisturbed notice it merited .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 24]: `` I have a kind of notion that Mrs. Devar would n't catch on to the boating proposition , '' she said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 27]: `` Perhaps not , but the river takes a wide bend there , and she could see us from the hotel veranda all the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 15]: `` Guess it ca n't be fixed up , anyhow , '' she sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 12]: Twice had she lapsed into the idioms of her native land .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 36]: What , then , was the matter with Cynthia that she had forgotten her self-imposed resolution to speak only in that purer English which is quite as highly appreciated in New York as in London ?
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 18]: It was Saturday afternoon , and they overtook and passed a break-load of beanfeasters going to Tintern .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 29]: There is no mob so cruelly sarcastic as the British , and it may be that the revelers in the break envied the dusty chauffeur his pretty companion .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 21]: At any rate , they greeted the passing of the car with jeers and cat-calls , and awoke Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 43]: It is a weakness of human nature to endeavor to conceal the fact that you have been asleep when you are supposed to be awake , so she leaned forward now , and asked nonchalantly : `` Are we near Hereford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 11]: `` We have a long way to go yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 3]: She paused .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 8]: `` Are you really very tired ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 7]: she added , as an afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 5]: `` Yes , dear .
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 7]: The air is positively overpowering . ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 5]: There was another pause .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 36]: `` Ah , well , '' sighed the girl , `` we shall have a nice long rest when we stop for tea at -- at -- what is the name of the place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 6]: `` Symon 's Yat . ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 6]: Medenham 's voice was husky .
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 10]: Truth to tell , he was rather beside himself .
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 12]: He had played for a high stake and had nearly won .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 44]: Even now the issue hung on a word , a mere whiff of volition : and if he knew exactly how much depended on that swing of the balance he might have been startled into a more earnest plea , and spoiled everything .
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 17]: `` But that will throw us late in arriving at Hereford , '' said Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 6]: `` Does it really matter ?
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 9]: We shall be there all day to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 20]: `` No , it is of no consequence , though Count Edouard said he would meet us there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 11]: `` And I refused to pledge myself to any arrangement .
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 27]: In fact , I would much prefer that his Countship should scorch on to Liverpool or Manchester , or wherever he happens to be going . ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 5]: `` Oh , Cynthia !
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 15]: And he going out of his way to be so friendly and agreeable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 12]: `` Well , perhaps that was an unkind thing to say .
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 18]: What I mean is that we must feel ourselves at liberty to depart from a cut-and-dried schedule .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 19]: Half the charm of wandering through England in an automobile is in one 's freedom from timetables . ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 41]: Back dropped Mrs. Devar , and Medenham recovered sufficient self-control to point out to Cynthia her first glimpse of the gray walls that vie with Fountains Abbey and Rievaulx for pride of place as the most beautiful ruin in England .
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 13]: Certainly those old Cistercians knew how and where to build their monasteries .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 27]: They had the true sense of beauty , whether in site or design , and at Tintern they chose the loveliest nook of a lovely valley .
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 37]: Cynthia silently feasted her vision on each new panorama revealed by the winding road , and ever the gray Abbey grew more distinct , more ornate , more completely the architectural gem of an entrancing landscape .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 6]: But disillusion was at hand .
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 24]: Rounding the last bend of the descent , the Mercury purred into the midst of a collection of horsed vehicles and frayed motors .
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 18]: By some unhappy chance the whole countryside seemed to have chosen Tintern as a rendezvous that Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 44]: The patrons of a neighboring hotel overflowed into the roadway ; the brooding peace of the dead-and-gone monks had fled before this invasion ; instead of memories of mitered abbots and cowled friars there were the realities of loud-voiced grooms and porkpie-eating excursionists .
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 9]: `` Please drive on , '' whispered Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 9]: `` I must see Tintern another time . ''
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 57]: Although Medenham hoped to consume a precious hour or more in showing her the noble church , the cloisters , the chapter-house , the monks ' parlor , and the rest of the stone records of a quiet monastic life , he realized to the full how utterly incongruous were the enthusiastic trippers with their surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 19]: The car threaded their ranks gingerly , and was soon running free along the tree-shaded road to Monmouth .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 35]: Happily , that delightful old town was sufficiently familiar to him in earlier days that he was now able to supplement the general knowledge of its past gleaned already by the girl 's reading .
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 61]: He halted in front of the Welsh Gate on Monnow Bridge , and told her that although the venerable curiosity dates back to 1270 it is nevertheless the last defensive work in Britain in which serious preparations were made for civil war , as it was expected that the Chartists would march from Newport to attack Monmouth Jail in 1839 .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 10]: `` Six hundred years , '' mused Cynthia aloud .
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 16]: `` If there are sermons in stones what a history is pent in these ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 16]: `` And how greatly it would differ from the accepted versions , '' laughed Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 11]: `` Do we never know the truth , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 31]: `` Oh , yes , if we are actually mixed up in some affair of worldwide importance , but that is precisely the reason why the actors remain dumb . ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 17]: Oddly enough , this was the first of Medenham 's utterances that Mrs. Devar approved of .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 16]: `` Evidently you have moved in high society , Fitzroy , '' she chimed in .
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 9]: `` Yes , madam , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 18]: `` More than once , when in a hurry , I have run madly through Mayfair . ''
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 6]: `` Oh , nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 37]: she cried , resenting the studied civility of the `` madam '' and ruffled by the quip , `` you speak of Mayfair , yet I do n't suppose you really know where it is . ''
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 19]: `` I shall never forget where Down Street is , I assure you , '' he said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 11]: `` And pray , why Down Street in particular ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 21]: `` Because that is where I met Simmonds , last Wednesday , and arranged to take on his job . ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 16]: `` In your mind , then , it figures as broken-down-street , '' cooed Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 27]: After that the Mercury crossed the Monnow , and Mrs. Devar muttered something about the mistake one made when one encouraged servants to be too familiar .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 8]: But Cynthia was not to be repressed .
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 43]: She was bubbling over with high spirits , and amused herself by telling Medenham that Henry V. was born at Monmouth and afterwards won the battle of Agincourt -- `` scraps of history not generally known , '' she confided to him .
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 34]: From the back of the car Mrs. Devar watched them with a hawklike intentness that showed how thoroughly those `` forty winks '' snatched while in the Wyndcliff had restored her flagging energies .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 68]: Though it was absurd to suppose that Cynthia Vanrenen , daughter of a millionaire , a girl dowered with all that happy fortune had to give , would so far forget her social position as to flirt with the chauffeur of a hired car , this experienced marriage-broker did not fail to realize what a stumbling-block the dreadful person was in the path of Count Edouard Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 16]: For once in her life , `` Wiggy '' Devar forced herself to think clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 23]: She saw that `` Fitzroy '' was a man who might prove exceedingly dangerous where a girl 's susceptible heart was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 57]: He had the address and semblance of a gentleman ; he seemed to be able to talk some jargon of history and literature and art that appealed mightily to Cynthia ; worst of all , he had undoubtedly ascertained , by some means wholly beyond her ken , that she and the Frenchman were in league .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 50]: She was quite in the dark as to the cause of her son 's extraordinary behavior the previous evening , but she was beginning to suspect that this meddlesome Fitzroy had contrived , somehow or other , to banish Captain Devar as he had outwitted Marigny on the Mendips .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 22]: Talented schemer that she was , she did not believe for a moment that Simmonds had told the truth at Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 43]: She argued , with cold logic , that the man would not risk the loss of an excellent commission by bringing from London a car so hopelessly out of repair that it could not be made available under four or five days .
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 11]: But her increasing alarm centered chiefly in Cynthia 's attitude .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 62]: If , by her allusion to a `` cut-and-dried schedule , '' the girl implied a design to depart from the tour planned in London , then the Count 's wooing became a most uncertain thing , since it was manifestly out of the question that he should continue to waylay them at stopping-places chosen haphazard during each day 's run .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 42]: So Mrs. Devar noted with a malignant eye each friendly glance exchanged by the couple in front , and listened to the snatches of their talk with a malevolence that was fanned to fury by their obvious heedlessness of her presence .
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 10]: She felt that the crisis called for decisive action .
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 29]: There was only one person alive to whose judgment Cynthia Vanrenen would bow , and Mrs. Devar began seriously to consider the advisability of writing to Peter Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 27]: If any lingering doubt remained in her mind as to the soundness of this view , it was dispelled soon after they reached Symon 's Yat .
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 36]: She was sitting in the inclosed veranda of a cozy hotel perched on the right bank of the Wye when Cynthia suddenly leaped up , teacup in hand , and looked down at the river .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 26]: `` There are the duckiest little yachts I have ever seen skimming about on that stretch of water , '' she cried over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 20]: `` The mere sight of them makes me taste all the dust I have swallowed between here and London .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 26]: Do n't you think it would be real cute to remain here to-night and run into Hereford to-morrow after an early cup of tea ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 46]: Cynthia need not have taken the trouble to avert her scarlet face from Mrs. Devar 's inquisitive eyes ; indeed , Mrs. Devar herself was glad that her quick-witted and perhaps quick-tempered young friend had not surprised the wry smile that twisted her own lips .
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 13]: `` Just as you please , Cynthia , '' said she amiably .
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 51]: Then the girl resolutely crushed the absurd emotion that led her to shirk her companion 's scrutiny : she was so taken aback by this unexpected complaisance in a quarter where she was prepared for opposition that she turned and laid a grateful hand on the other woman 's arm .
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 14]: `` Now that is perfectly sweet of you , '' she said softly .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 27]: `` I would just love to see that river by moonlight , and -- and -- I fancied you were a bit weary of the road .
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 46]: It would n't matter if the country were not so wonderful , but when one has to screw one 's head round quickly or one misses a castle or a prize landscape , a hundred miles of that sort of thing becomes a strain . ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 15]: `` This seems to be quite a restful place , '' agreed Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 17]: `` Have you -- er -- told Fitzroy of the proposed alteration in our arrangements ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 8]: Cynthia grew interested in the yachts again .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 19]: `` No , '' she said , `` I 've not mentioned it to him -- yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 18]: A maid-servant entered , and Cynthia inquired if the hotel could provide three rooms for her party .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 19]: The girl , a pretty Celt of the fair-haired type , said she was sure there was accommodation .
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 58]: `` Then , '' said Cynthia , with what she felt to be a thoroughly self-possessed air , `` please ask my chauffeur if he would like another cup of tea , and tell him to house the car and have our boxes sent in , as we shall stay here till half-past eight to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 22]: Mrs. Devar 's letter to Peter Vanrenen forthwith entered the category of things that must be done at the earliest opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 24]: She wrote it before dinner , taking a full hour in the privacy of her room to compose its few carefully considered sentences .
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 44]: She posted it , too , and was confirmed in her estimate of its very real importance when she saw a muslined Cynthia saunter out and join `` Fitzroy , '' who happened to be standing on a tiny landing-stage near a boathouse .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 33]: Yet , so strangely constituted is human nature of the Devar variety , she would have given half the money she possessed if she could have recalled that letter an hour later .
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 10]: But His Majesty 's mails are inexorable as fate .
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 26]: A twopence-ha ` penny stamp had linked Symon 's Yat and Paris , and not all Mrs. Devar 's world-worn ingenuity could sunder that link .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 11]: CHAPTER IX ON THE WYE For this is what happened .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 42]: To Mrs. Devar , gazing darkly at Cynthia 's too innocent discovery of Medenham standing on the tiny quay , came the Welsh maid , saying : `` Beg pardon , mam , but iss your chauf-feur 's name Fitz-roy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 14]: `` Then he iss wan-ted on the tel-e-phone from Her-e-ford , mam . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 13]: `` There he is , below there , near the river . ''
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 37]: Mrs. Devar smiled sourly at the thought that the interruption was well-timed , since Medenham was just raising his cap with a fine assumption of surprise at finding Miss Vanrenen strolling by the water 's edge .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 20]: The civil-spoken maid was about to trip off in pursuit of him , when Mrs. Devar changed her mind .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 31]: The notion suddenly occurred to her that it would be well if she intervened in this telephonic conversation , and Fitzroy could still be summoned a minute later if desirable .
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 29]: `` Do n't trouble , '' she cried , `` I think that Miss Vanrenen wishes to go boating , so I will attend to the call myself .
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 10]: Perhaps Fitzroy 's presence may be dispensed with . ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 31]: The felt-lined telephone box was well screened off ; as first impressions might be valuable , she adjusted the receivers carefully over both ears before she shouted `` Hallo ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 8]: `` That you , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 4]: said a voice .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 3]: `` Hallo !
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 6]: -- who wants Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 10]: she asked in the gruffest tone she could adopt .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 12]: `` It 's Dale , my -- But who is talking ?
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 7]: Is that you , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 4]: `` Go on .
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 6]: Ca n't you hear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 39]: `` Not very well , my lord , but I 'm that upset ... It was n't my fault , but your lordship 's father dropped on to me at Bristol , an ' he 's here now .
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 7]: What am I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 6]: `` My lordship 's father !
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 6]: What are you talking about ?
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 5]: Who are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 22]: `` Is n't that Lord -- Oh , dash it , are n't you Miss Vanrenen 's chauffeur , Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 8]: This is the Symon 's Yat Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 23]: The party is out now , and Fitzroy as well , but I can tell him anything you wish to say . ''
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 31]: Mrs. Devar fancied that the speaker , whose words thus far had excited her liveliest curiosity , would imagine that he was in communication with the proprietors of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 5]: She was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 41]: Dale fell into the trap instantly , though , indeed , he was not to be blamed , since he had asked most earnestly that `` Mr. Fitzroy , Miss Vanrenen 's chauffeur '' should be brought to the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 38]: `` Well , mam , '' he said , `` if I ca n't get hold of -- of Fitzroy -- I must leave a message , as I do n't suppose I 'll have another chanst .
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 15]: I 'm his man , I 'm Dale ; have you got it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 6]: `` Yes -- Dale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 19]: `` Tell him the Earl of Fairholme turned up in Bristol an ' forced me to explain everything .
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 6]: I could n't help it .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 12]: The old gentleman fell from the blooming sky , he did .
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 7]: Will you remember that name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 11]: `` Oh , yes : the Earl of Fairholme . ''
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 8]: `` Well , his lordship will understand .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 10]: I mean you must tell Fitzroy what I said .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 5]: Please tell him privately .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 47]: I expect I 'll get the sack anyhow over this business , but I 'm doin ' me best in tryin ' the telephone , so you 'll confer a favor , mam , if you call Fitzroy on one side before tellin ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 22]: Though the telephone-box was stuffy when the door was closed , Mrs. Devar felt a cold chill running down her spine .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 12]: `` I do n't quite understand , '' she said thickly .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 13]: `` You 're Dale , somebody 's man ; whose man ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 5]: `` His lordship 's .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 18]: Oh , d -- n. Beg pardon , mam , but I 'm Fitzroy 's chauffeur . ''
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 21]: It was a glorious night of early summer , yet lightning struck in that little shut-off section of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 13]: `` Do you mean that you are Viscount Medenham 's chauffeur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 20]: she gasped , and her hands trembled so much that she could scarce hold the receivers to her ears .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 6]: Now you 've got it .
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 12]: But , look here , I dare n't stop another minnit .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 22]: Tell his lordship -- tell Mr. Fitzroy -- that I 'll dodge the Earl in some way an ' remain here .
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 25]: He says he has been tricked , wot between me an ' the Frenchman , but he means to go back to London to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 4]: Good-by , mam .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 9]: You wo n't forget -- strickly private ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 67]: `` Oh , no , I wo n't forget , '' said Mrs. Devar grimly ; nevertheless , she felt weak and sick , and in her anxiety to rush out into the fresh air she did forget to hang up the receivers , and the Symon 's Yat Hotel was cut off from the world of telephones until someone entered the box early next morning .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 31]: She was of a not uncommon type -- a physical coward endowed with nerves of steel , but , for once in her life , she came perilously near fainting .
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 50]: It was bad enough that a money-making project of some value should show signs of tumbling in ruins , but far worse that she , an experienced tuft-hunter , should have lived in close companionship with a viscount for four long days and snubbed him rancorously and without cease .
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 14]: There was no escaping the net she had contrived for her own entanglement .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 75]: She had actually written to Peter Vanrenen that she deemed it her duty as Cynthia 's chaperon to acquaint him with Simmonds 's defection and the filling of his place by Fitzroy , `` a most unsuitable person to act as Miss Vanrenen 's chauffeur '' -- indeed , a young man who , she was sure , `` would never have been chosen for such a responsible position '' by Mr. Vanrenen himself .
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 23]: And Fitzroy was Viscount Medenham , heir to the Fairholme estates , one of the most eligible young bachelors in the kingdom !
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 13]: Oh , blind and crass that she had not guessed the truth !
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 77]: The car , the luncheon-basket , the rare wine , the crest on the silver , the very candor of the wretch in giving his real name , his instant recognition of `` Jimmy '' Devar 's mother , the hints of a childhood passed in Sussex -- why , even the aunt he spoke of on Derby Day must be Susan St. Maur , while Millicent Porthcawl had actually met him in the Bournemouth hotel !
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 25]: -- these and many another vivid index pointed the path of knowledge to one so well versed as she in the intricacies of Debrett .
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 28]: The very attributes which she had taken for an impertinent aping of the manners of society had shouted his identity into her deaf ears time and again .
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 20]: Even an intelligent West-end housemaid would have felt some suspicion of the facts when confronted by these piled-up tokens .
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 78]: She remembered noticing his hands , the quality of his linen , his astonishingly `` good '' appearance on the only occasion that she had seen him in evening dress ; she almost groaned aloud when she recalled the manner of her son 's departure from Bristol , and some imp in her heart raked the burnt ashes of the fire that had devoured her when she heard why Captain Devar was requested to resign his commission .
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 30]: Of course , this proud young aristocrat recognized him at once , and had brushed him out of his sight as one might brush a fly off a windowpane .
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 13]: But how was she to act in face of the threatened disaster ?
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: Why had not her son warned her ?
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 26]: Did Marigny know , and was that the explanation of his sheepish demeanor when she and Cynthia were about to enter the car that morning ?
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 32]: Indeed , Marigny 's quiet acceptance of the position was quite as difficult to understand as her own failure to grasp the significance of all that happened since noon on Wednesday .
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 34]: This very day , before breakfast , he had come to her room with the cheering news that information to hand from London would certainly procure the dismissal of `` Fitzroy '' forthwith .
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 56]: The Mercury was registered in the name of the Earl of Fairholme , the obvious deduction being that his lordship 's chauffeur was careering through England in a valuable car without a shred of permission ; the merest whisper to Cynthia of this discovery , said the Frenchman , would send `` Fitzroy '' packing .
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 28]: And again , what had Cynthia meant when she referred at Chepstow to the `` Norman baron scowl '' with which `` Fitzroy '' had favored Marigny ?
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 9]: Was she , too , in the secret ?
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 4]: Unhappy Mrs. Devar !
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 15]: She glowered at the darkening Wye , and wriggled on her chair in torture .
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 12]: `` Wass it all right a-bout the tel-e-phone , mam ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 8]: said a soft voice at her ear .
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 10]: She started violently , and the maid was contrite .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 31]: `` I 'm ver-ry sor-ry , mam , '' she said , `` but I see Mr. Fitz-roy down there on the riv-er -- '' `` Where , where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 19]: cried the other , rather to gain time to collect her wits than to ascertain Medenham 's whereabouts .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 4]: The girl pointed .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 16]: `` In that lit-tle boat , all by its-self , mam , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 9]: `` Oh , it was of no importance .
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 42]: By the way , '' and Mrs. Devar produced her purse , `` you might tell the people in the office not to pay any attention to the statements of a man named Dale , if he rings up from Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 38]: He is only a chauffeur , and we shall see him in the morning ; perhaps it will be best , if he asks for Fitzroy again to-night , to tell him to await our arrival . ''
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 17]: `` Yess , mam , '' and the maid went off , the richer by half-a-crown .
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 45]: Mrs. Devar 's usual `` tip '' was a sixpence for a week 's attentions , so it would demand an abstruse arithmetical calculation to arrive at an exact estimate of the degree of mental disturbance that led to the present lack of proportion .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 52]: Left alone once more , her gaze followed a small skiff speeding upstream over the placid surface of the silvery Wye ; Medenham was rowing , and Cynthia held the tiller ropes ; but Mrs. Devar 's thoughts turned her mind 's eyes inward , and they surveyed a gray prospect .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 19]: Dale , the unseen monster who had struck this paralyzing blow , spoke of `` the Frenchman . ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 15]: Lord Fairholme had charged both Dale and `` the Frenchman '' with tricking him .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 11]: Therefore , the Earl and Marigny had met at Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 74]: If so , and there could be little doubt of it , Marigny would hardly appear in Hereford , and if she attempted to telephone to the Green Dragon Hotel , where Cynthia had engaged rooms , she would not only fail to reach Marigny but probably reveal to a wrathful Earl the very fact which Dale seemed to have withheld from him , namely , his son 's address at the moment .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 25]: She assumed that Dale knew how to communicate with his master because Medenham had telegraphed the name of the hotel at Symon 's Yat .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 5]: Therein she was right .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 26]: Medenham wanted his baggage , and , having ascertained that there was a suitable train , sent instructions that Dale was to travel by it .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 11]: This , of course , the man could not do .
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 27]: Lord Fairholme had carried off his son 's portmanteaux , and had actually hired a room in the Green Dragon next to that reserved for Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: Suddenly grown wise , Mrs. Devar decided against the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 9]: But there remained the secrecy of the post-office .
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 41]: What harm if she sent a brief message to both the Green Dragon and the Mitre Hotels -- Marigny would be sure to put up at one or the other if he were in Hereford -- and demand his advice ?
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 15]: She hurried to the drawing-room and wrote : Remaining Symon 's Yat Hotel to-night .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 9]: Suppose you are aware of to-day 's developments .
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 10]: F. is son of gentleman you met in Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 3]: Wire reply .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 2]: DEVAR .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 15]: She went to the hotel bureau , but a sympathetic landlady shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 6]: `` The post-office is closed .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 15]: No telegrams can be dispatched until eight o'clock on Monday , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 37]: `` But there is the telephone -- '' `` It is matterless , '' said Mrs. Devar , crushing the written forms in her fingers as though she had reason to believe they might sting her .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 8]: She resolved to let events drift now .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 7]: They had passed beyond her control .
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 20]: Perhaps a policy of masterly inactivity might rescue her from the tornado which had swept her off her feet .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 20]: In any case , she must fight her own battles , irrespective of the cabal entered into in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 62]: Captain James Devar was an impossible ally ; the French Count was a negligible quantity when compared with an English viscount whose ancestry threw back to the Conquest and whose estates covered half of a midland shire ; but there remained , active as ever , the self-interest of a poor widow from whose despairing grasp was slipping a golden opportunity .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 7]: `` Is it too late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 4]: she asked herself .
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 6]: `` Can anything be done ?
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 17]: Maud , my dear , you are up against it , as they say in America .
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 19]: Pull yourself together , and see if you ca n't twist your mistakes to your own advantage . ''
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 9]: Cynthia , meanwhile , was enjoying herself hugely .
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 46]: The placid reaches of the Wye offered a delightful contrast to the sun-baked roads of Monmouthshire ; and , it may be added , there was enough of Mother Eve in her composition to render the proceeding none the less attractive because it was unconventional .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 21]: Perhaps , deep hidden in her consciousness , lurked a doubt -- but that was successfully stifled for the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 12]: Indeed , her wits were trying to solve a minor puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 20]: Her woman 's eye had seen and her quick brain was marveling at certain details in Medenham 's costume .
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 47]: There are conditions , even in England , in which a flannel suit is hard to obtain , and the manner of their coming to Symon 's Yat seemed to preclude the buying of ready-made garments , a solution which would occur to an American instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 29]: Yet here was that incomprehensible chauffeur clad in the correct regalia of the Thames Rowing Club , though Cynthia , of course , did not recognize the colors .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 8]: `` How did you manage it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 7]: she asked , wide-eyed and smiling .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 25]: `` I hunted through the hotels and met a man about my own size who was just off to town , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 8]: `` But -- there are gaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 8]: `` I thought they fitted rather well .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 13]: In fact , he was slightly the stouter of the two . ''
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 6]: `` Do n't be stupid .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 7]: The gaps are in your story .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 7]: Did you borrow or buy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 4]: `` I borrowed .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 15]: Luckily , he was a decent fellow , and there was no trouble . ''
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 7]: `` Did you know him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 6]: `` By name only . ''
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 11]: `` Do Englishmen lend their clothes to promiscuous strangers ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 13]: `` More , much more ; they give them at times . ''
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 8]: She was silent for a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 49]: He had persuaded her that oars were preferable to sails on such a still night , especially as he was not acquainted with the shallows , but he had not explained that if he rowed and she steered he would be able to gaze his fill at her .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 7]: `` What colors are those ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 4]: she demanded suddenly .
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 26]: `` I ought to have told you that I happened to find a member of the club to which I belong , '' he countered .
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 25]: Then , before she could pin him down to a definite statement , he tried to carry the war into the enemy 's country .
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 45]: `` By the way , I hope I am not presuming on the fact that you have consented to take this little excursion , Miss Vanrenen , but may I ask how _ you _ contrive to appear each evening in a muslin frock ?
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 24]: Those hold-alls on the motor are strictly utilitarian , and a mere man would imagine that muslin could not escape being crushed . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 5]: `` It does n't .
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 11]: I have a maid iron it for me before dinner .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 18]: At Hereford I shall receive a fresh one from London , and send this back by post .
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 8]: But fancy you noticing such a thing !
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 6]: Have you any sisters ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 6]: `` Yes , one . ''
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 7]: `` How old is she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 4]: `` Twenty-three . ''
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 4]: `` Dear me !
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 6]: A year older than me .
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 12]: Oh , ought I to have said ` than I ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 6]: That always puzzles me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 8]: `` You have Milton on your side .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 11]: He wrote : Satan -- than whom no higher sat .
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 14]: Still , it is generally allowed that Milton wrote bad grammar there . ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 25]: Cynthia was awed momentarily -- a quotation from `` Paradise Lost '' always commands respect -- so she harked back to an easier topic .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 7]: `` Is your sister married ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 7]: `` What is her husband ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 11]: `` She married rather well , as the saying is .
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 18]: Her husband is a man named Scarland , and he is chiefly interested in pedigree cattle . ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 9]: `` Let me see , '' she mused .
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 21]: `` I seem to remember the name ; it had something to do with fat cattle , too ... Scarland ?
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 5]: Does he exhibit ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 19]: Medenham wished then that he had not been so glib with the Marquis of Scarland 's pet occupation .
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 18]: `` I have been in England so little during the past few years -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 12]: `` I hope you have n't quarreled with your sister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 5]: she put in promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 7]: `` What , quarrel with Betty ?
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 3]: I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 49]: And he laughed at the conceit , though he wondered what Cynthia would say if , on Monday , he deviated a few miles from the Hereford and Shrewsbury main road and showed her Scarland Towers and the park in which the marquis 's prize stock were fattening .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 8]: `` Oh , is she so nice ?
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 9]: And pretty , too , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 9]: `` People generally speak of her as good-looking .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 30]: It is a recognized fact , I believe , that pretty girls usually have brothers not so favored -- '' `` What , fishing now as well as rowing ?
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 11]: Did n't I say you had a Norman aspect ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 11]: `` Consisting largely of a scowl , I understand . ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 11]: `` But a man is bound to look fierce sometimes .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 21]: At least , my father does , though he is celebrated for his unchanging aspect , no matter what happens .
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 41]: Perhaps he may look like a Sphinx when he is carrying through what he calls ' a deal , ' but I remember very well seeing lightning in his eye when an Italian prince was rude to me one day .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 26]: We were at Pompeii , and this Prince Monte-something induced me to look at a horrid fresco under the pretense that it was very artistic .
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 16]: Without thinking what I was doing , I ran to father and complained about it .
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 3]: My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 47]: I wonder the lava did n't melt again before he got through with his highness , who , after all , was a bit of a virtuoso , and may have really admired nasty subjects so long as they conformed to certain standards of art . ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 27]: `` Some ideals call for correction by the toe of a strong boot -- I share Mr. Vanrenen 's views on that point most emphatically . ''
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 11]: Medenham 's character was one that transmuted words to deeds .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 15]: He drove the skiff onward with a powerful sweep that discovered an unexpected shoal .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 18]: There might have been some danger of an upset if the oars were in less skillful hands .
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 15]: As it was , they were back in deep water within a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 7]: Cynthia laughed without the least tremor .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 27]: `` You were kicking my Italian acquaintance in imagination then ; I hope you see now that you might have been mistaken , '' she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 11]: `` Even in this instance I only touched mud . ''
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 12]: `` Well , well , let us forget the Signor Principe .
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 5]: Tell me about yourself .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 7]: How did you come to enlist ?
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 19]: In my country , men of your stamp do not join the army unless some national crisis arises .
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 10]: But , perhaps , that applies to your case .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 11]: The Boers nearly beat you , did n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 26]: He took advantage of the opening thus presented , and was able to interest her in stories of the campaign without committing himself to details .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 37]: Nevertheless , a man who had served on the headquarters staff during the protracted second phase of the South African war could hardly fail to exhibit an intimate knowledge of that history which is never written .
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 33]: Though Cynthia had met many leaders of thought and action , she had never before encountered one who had taken part in a struggle of such peculiar significance as the Boer revolt .
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 49]: She was not an English girl , eager only to hear tales of derring-do in which her fellow-countrymen figure heroically , but a citizen of that wider world that refuses to look at events exclusively through British spectacles ; therein lay the germ of real peril to Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 10]: He had not only to narrate but to convince .
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 27]: He was called on to answer questions of policy and method that few if any of the women in his own circle would think of putting .
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 15]: Obviously , this appeal to his intellect weakened the self-imposed guard on his lips .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 91]: There is excellent authority for the belief that Desdemona loved Othello for the dangers he had passed , and did with greedy ear devour his discourse , yet it may well be conceded that an explanatory piquancy would have been added to the Moor 's account Of most disastrous chances , Of moving accidents by flood and field , if the lady were not a maid of Venice but hailed from some kindred city that refused to range all the virtues on the side of the Mistress of the Adriatic .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 30]: More than once it chanced that Medenham had to exercise his wits very quickly to trip his tongue when on the verge of some indiscretion that would betray him .
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 6]: Perhaps he was unduly cautious .
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 13]: Perhaps his listener 's heart had mastered her brain for the time .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 41]: Perhaps she would not have woke up in a maze from a dream that was not less a dream because she was not sleeping even if some unwary utterance caused her to ask what manner of man this could be .
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 13]: But that can never be known , since Cynthia herself never knew .
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 66]: The one sharp and clear fact that remained in her mind as a memory of a summer 's evening passed in a boat on a river flowing through fairyland , was provided by a set of circumstances far removed from tales of stormy night-riding after De Wet or the warp and weft of European politics as they fashioned the cere-cloths of the two Dutch republics .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 33]: Neither the one nor the other should be blamed if they found a boat on the Wye a most pleasant exchange for an eager automobile on roads that tempted to high speed .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 42]: At any rate , they gave no heed to the time until Cynthia happened to glance at the horizon and saw that the sun was represented by a thin seam of silver hemming the westerly fringe of a deep blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 13]: If there was a moon , it was hidden by the hills .
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 7]: `` Whatever o'clock is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 13]: she cried in a voice that held almost a sound of scare .
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 23]: Medenham looked at his watch , and had to hold it close to his eyes before he could make out the hour .
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 19]: `` Time you were back at the hotel , '' he said , swinging the boat round quickly .
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 15]: `` I am afraid I have kept you out too long , Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 38]: It is a perfect night , but you must not risk catching a chill -- '' `` I 'm not worrying about that sort of chill -- there are others : what will Mrs. Devar think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 11]: `` The worst , '' he could not help saying .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 9]: `` What time is it , really ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you be happier not to know ?
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 19]: We have the stream with us now -- '' `` Mr. Fitzroy -- what time is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 6]: `` Nearly half-past ten o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 12]: You did not leave the hotel till after half-past eight . ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 9]: `` Oh , blame me , of course .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 12]: ` The woman tempted me and I did eat . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 5]: `` No , no .
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 8]: Apples are not the only forbidden fruit .
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 7]: May I vary an unworthy defense ?
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 12]: The woman came with me and I did n't care . ''
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 6]: `` But I do care .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 3]: Please hurry .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 20]: Mrs. Devar will be real mad , and I sha n't have a word to say for myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 15]: Medenham bent to it , and the outrigger traveled downstream at a rare pace .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 36]: Cynthia steered with fair accuracy by the track they had followed against the current , but the oarsman glanced over his shoulder occasionally , and advised her as to the probable trend of the channel .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 18]: `` Keep a bit wide here , '' he said when they were approaching a sharp bend .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 15]: `` I believe we almost touched ground in midstream as we came up . ''
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 15]: She obeyed , and a wide expanse of low-lying land opened before her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 22]: `` I do n't see the lights of the hotel yet , '' she said , with a note of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 18]: `` You are not making enough allowance for the way in which this river turns and twists .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 36]: There are sections in which you box the compass during the course of a short -- '' A sharp tearing noise in the bottom of the boat amidships was followed by an inrush of water .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 17]: Medenham sprang upright , leaped overboard , and caught the port outrigger with his left hand .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 25]: He was then immersed to the waist , but he flung his right arm around Cynthia and lifted her clear of the sinking craft .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 6]: `` Sit on my shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 27]: Steady yourself with your hands on my head , '' he said , and his voice was so unemotional that the girl could almost have laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 7]: Beyond one startled `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 20]: when the plank was ripped out she had uttered no sound , and she followed his instructions now implicitly .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 29]: She was perched comfortably well above the river when she felt that he was moving , not to either bank , but down the center of the stream .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 13]: Suddenly he let go the boat , which had swung broadside on .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 33]: `` It is sinking , and the weight was pulling me over , '' he explained , still in the same quiet way , as though he were stating the merest commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 13]: Some thrill that she could not account for vibrated through her body .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 8]: She was not frightened in the least .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 31]: She had the most complete confidence in this man , whose head was braced against her left thigh , and whose arm was clasping her skirts closely round her ankles .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 11]: `` Which side do you mean to make for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 5]: `` I hardly know .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 7]: You are higher up than me .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 13]: Perhaps you can decide best as to the set of the current .
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 12]: The boat seems to have been carried to the right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 23]: -LSB- Illustration : `` Pity I 'm not a circus lady , to balance myself on your head , '' said Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 8]: _ Page 209 _ -RSB- `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 10]: I think the river shoals to the left . ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 9]: `` Suppose we try the other way first .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 8]: The hotel is on that side . ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 6]: `` Anything you like . ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 9]: He took a cautious step , then another .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 5]: The water was rising .
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 16]: Luckily the current was not very strong or he could not have stood against it .
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 8]: `` No good , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 7]: `` We must go back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 9]: `` Pity I 'm not a circus lady .
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 15]: Then I might have balanced myself gracefully on the top of your head . ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 22]: He murmured something indistinctly , but Cynthia fancied she caught the words : `` You 're a dear , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 32]: `` It is high time we were out of here , '' he answered , turning his back to the pressure of water , which was very great in that place .
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 22]: `` What will happen if there are two channels , and we have pitched on a bank in the middle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 14]: `` I must walk about a bit until I find the right track .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 10]: The Wye is not very deep at this point .
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 12]: It must shelve rapidly in one direction or the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 7]: `` But it may n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 30]: `` In that event I shall lower you into the water , ask you to hold tight to my coat collar with both hands , and let me swim .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 8]: It is only a few yards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 9]: `` But I can swim , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 13]: `` Not in a long dress ... Ah , here we are .
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 5]: I thought so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 12]: In a couple of strides the water was below his knees .
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 24]: Soon he was standing on a pebbly beach at the nose of the promontory formed by the bend where the accident had happened .
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 25]: In order to lower Cynthia to the ground without bringing her muslin flounces in contact with his dripping clothes he had to stoop somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 18]: Her hair brushed his forehead , his eyes , his lips , as he lifted her down .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 16]: His hands rested for an instant on the warm softness of her neck and shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 34]: His heart leaped in a mad riot of joy at the belief that she would have uttered no protest if he had drawn her nearer instead of setting her decorously on her feet .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 15]: He dared not look at her , but turned and gazed at the river .
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 9]: `` Thank God , that is over ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 29]: Cynthia heard something in his voice then that was absent when they were both in peril of being swept away by the silent rush of the black stream .
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 18]: `` Quite an adventure , '' she sighed , stooping to feel the hem of her frock .
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 7]: `` You are not wet ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 7]: he asked , after a pause .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 5]: `` Not a thread .
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 7]: The water barely touched my feet .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 5]: How prompt you were !
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 17]: I suppose men who fight have often to decide quickly like that ... What caused it ?
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 8]: A whole seam was torn open . ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 8]: `` It can not be a stake .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 17]: Such a thing would not be permitted to exist in this river ... A snag probably .
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 13]: Some old tree stump undermined by last month 's heavy rain . ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 6]: `` What of the boat ?
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 5]: Is it lost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 10]: It will be found easily enough in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 5]: The damage is trifling .
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 6]: How splendid you were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 5]: `` Please do n't .
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 17]: I have n't said a word to you , and I do n't mean to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 15]: `` But -- '' `` Well , say it , if you must . ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 13]: `` I am not going to compliment you in the ordinary terms .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 17]: Just this -- nature intended you to be a soldier 's bride , Miss Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 19]: `` Nature , being feminine , may promise that which she does not always mean to carry out .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 32]: Besides , I do n't know many soldiers ... It is charming here , by the river 's edge , but I must remember that you are soaked to the skin .
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 7]: Where are we , exactly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 22]: `` About four miles from the hotel , by water : perhaps a mile and three-quarters as the crow flies . ''
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 9]: `` How far as a girl walks ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 10]: `` Let us try , '' he said briskly .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 10]: `` We seem to have landed in a meadow .
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 35]: If we cross it , all my efforts to save that muslin frock will count as naught , since there is sure to be a heavy dew on the grass after this fine day .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 17]: Suppose we follow the bank a little way until we reach some sort of a path .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 7]: Will you take my hand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 13]: `` No , I need both hands to hold up my dress .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 7]: But you might grab my arm .
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 16]: I am wearing French shoes , which are not built for clambering over rocks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 4]: Cynthia was adroit .
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 11]: The use of one small word had relieved the situation .
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 28]: Medenham might hold her arm with the utmost tenderness , but so long as he was `` grabbing '' it there was nothing more to be said .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 33]: He piloted her to a narrow strip of turf that bordered the Wye , found a path that ran close to a small wood , and soon they were in a road .
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 33]: There was slight excuse for arm-holding now , but Cynthia seemed to think that her frills still needed safeguarding , so he did not withdraw the hand which clung to her elbow .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 31]: A light in a laborer 's cottage promised information ; he knocked at the door , which was not opened , but a voice cried : `` Who is it ?
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 6]: What do you want ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 19]: `` Tell me the nearest way to the Symon 's Yat Hotel , please , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 11]: `` Keep straight on till you come to the ferry .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 14]: If the boat is on this side you can pull yourself across . ''
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 8]: `` But if it is not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 6]: `` You must chance it .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 11]: The nearest bridge is a mile the other way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 5]: `` By gad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 6]: said Medenham under his breath .
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 43]: `` I would n't care a pin if Mrs. Devar was n't waiting for me , '' whispered Cynthia , whose mental attitude during this mishap on the Wye contrasted strangely with her alarm when Marigny 's motor collapsed on the Mendips .
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 12]: `` Mrs. Devar is the real problem , '' laughed Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 12]: `` We must find some means of soothing her agitation . ''
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 9]: `` Why do n't you like her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 14]: `` That is one of the things I wish to explain later . ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 34]: `` She has been horrid to you , I know , but -- '' `` I am beginning to think that I owe her a debt of gratitude I can never repay . ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 18]: `` What will happen if that wretched ferryboat is on the wrong side of the river ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 16]: Medenham took her arm again , for the road was dark where there were trees .
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 13]: `` You are not to think about it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 10]: `` I have been doing all the talking to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 10]: Now tell me something of your wanderings abroad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 11]: These two already understood each other without the spoken word .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 29]: He respected her desire to sheer off anything that might be construed as establishing a new relationship between them , and she appreciated his restraint to the full .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 31]: They discussed foreign lands and peoples until the road bent toward the river again and the ferry was reached -- at a point quite half a mile below the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 6]: And there was no boat !
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 20]: A wire rope drooped into the darkness of the opposite bank , but no voice answered Medenham 's hail .
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 21]: Cynthia said not a syllable until her companion handed her his watch with a request that she should hold it .
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 14]: `` You are not going into that river , '' she cried determinedly .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 12]: `` There is not the slightest risk , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 5]: `` But there is .
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 9]: What if you were seized with cramp ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 14]: `` I shall cling to the rope , if that will satisfy you .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 38]: I have swum the Zambesi before to-day , not from choice , I admit , and it is twenty times the width of the Wye , while it holds more crocodiles than the Wye holds salmon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 11]: `` Well -- if you promise about the rope . ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 17]: Soon he was out of sight , and her heart knew its first pang of fear .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 30]: Then she heard his cry of `` Got the boat , '' followed by the clank of a sculling oar and the creak of the guiding-wheel on the hawser .
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 12]: At last , shortly before midnight , they neared the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 13]: Lights were visible on the quay , and Medenham read their meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 13]: `` They are sending out a search party , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 8]: `` I must go and stop them .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: You run on to the hotel , Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 2]: Good-night !
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 10]: I shall give you an extra hour to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 8]: She hesitated the fraction of a second .
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 6]: Then she extended a hand .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 7]: `` Good-night , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 13]: `` After all , I have had a real lovely time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 22]: Then she was gone , and Medenham turned to thank the hotel servants and others who were going to the rescue .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 37]: `` I wonder what the guv ` nor will say when he sees Cynthia , '' he thought , with the smile on his face of the lover who deems his lady peerless among her sex .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 49]: He recalled that moment before many days had passed , and his reflections then took a new guise , for not all the knowledge and all the experience a man may gather can avail him a whit to forecast the future when Fate is spinning her complex web .
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 41]: CHAPTER X THE HIDDEN FOUNTS OF EVIL It was a flushed and somewhat breathless Cynthia who ran into the quiet country hotel at an hour when the Licensing Laws of Britain have ordained that quiet country hotels shall be closed .
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 27]: But even the laws of the Medes and Persians , which altered not , must have bulged a little at times under the pressure of circumstances .
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 26]: The daughter of an American millionaire could not be reported as `` missing '' without a buzz of commotion being aroused in that secluded valley .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 29]: As a matter of fact , no one in the house dreamed of going to bed until her disappearance was accounted for , one way or the other .
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 14]: Mrs. Devar , now really woebegone , screamed shrilly at sight of her .
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 41]: The lady 's nerves were in a parlous condition -- `` on a raw edge '' was her own phrase -- and the relief of seeing her errant charge again was so great that the shriek merged into a sob .
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 10]: `` Oh , my dear , my dear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 12]: she wept , `` what a shock you have given me !
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 7]: I thought you were gone ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 13]: `` Not so bad as that , '' was the contrite answer .
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 30]: Cynthia interpreted `` gone '' as meaning `` dead , '' and naturally read into the other woman 's anxiety her own knowledge of the disaster to the boat .
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 29]: `` We had a bit of an upset -- that is all -- and the bread always flops to the floor buttered side down , does n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 11]: So we had to struggle ashore on the wrong bank .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 30]: It could n't be helped -- that is , the accident could n't -- but I ought not to have been on the river at such a late hour .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 9]: Do forgive me , dear Mrs. Devar ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 37]: By this time the girl 's left arm was around her friend 's portly form ; in her intense eagerness to assuage Mrs. Devar 's agitation she began to stroke her hair with the disengaged hand .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 59]: A deeply sympathetic landlady , a number of servants , and most of the feminine guests in the hotel -- all the men were down on the quay -- had gathered to murmur their congratulations ; but Mrs. Devar , dismayed by Cynthia 's action , which might have brought about a catastrophe , revived with phenomenal suddenness .
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 26]: `` My dear child , '' she cried , extricating herself from the encircling arm , '' _ do _ let me look at you !
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 11]: I want to make sure that you are not injured .
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 7]: The boat upset , you say .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 10]: Why , your clothes must be wringing wet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 3]: Cynthia laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 16]: She had guessed why her chaperon wished to keep her literally at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: She spread her skirts with a quick gesture that relieved an awkward situation .
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 13]: `` Not a drop on my clothes , '' she said gleefully .
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 37]: `` The water just touched the soles of my boots , but before you could say ` Jack Robinson ' Fitzroy had whisked me out of the skiff -- and landed me on dry land . ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 10]: `` You were in shallow water , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 6]: put in the smiling proprietress .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 7]: `` Oh no , fairly deep .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 11]: Fitzroy was up to his waist in the stream . ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 7]: `` And the boat upset ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 5]: came the amazed chorus .
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 8]: `` I did n't quite mean that .
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 6]: What actually happened was this .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 40]: I discovered that the hour was rather late , and Fitzroy was rowing down stream at a great pace when some sunken thing , a tree-root he thinks , caught the side of the boat and started a plank .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 34]: I was so taken by surprise that I should have sat right there and gone to the bottom with the boat , but Fitzroy jumped overboard straight away and hiked me out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 24]: Ready-tongued Cynthia was beginning to find detailed explanation rather difficult , and her speech reverted to the picturesque idioms of her native land .
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 10]: It was the happiest ruse she could have adopted .
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 12]: Everyone laughed at the notion of being `` hiked out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 29]: None of her hearers knew quite what it meant , yet it covered the requisite ground , which was more than might have been achieved by explicit English .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 9]: `` Where did the accident take place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 4]: asked the landlady .
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 27]: Cynthia was vague on this point , but when she told how the return journey was made , the pretty Welsh waitress hit on a theory .
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 23]: `` In-deed to goot-ness , miss , '' she cried , `` you wass be-tween the Garren River an ' Huntsham Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 12]: It iss a bad place , so it iss , however .
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 15]: Me an ' my young man wass shoaled there once , we wass . ''
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 45]: Cynthia felt that her face and neck had grown positively scarlet , and she could have kissed the well-disposed landlady for entering on a voluble disquisition as to the tricks played by the Wye on those unaware of its peculiarities , especially at night .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 36]: A general conversation broke out , but Mrs. Devar , rapidly regaining her spirits after enduring long hours of the horrible obsession that Medenham had run off with her heiress , noted that telltale blush .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 30]: At present her object was to assist rather than embarrass , so with a fine air of motherly solicitude she asked : `` Where did you leave Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 21]: `` He saw preparations being made to send boats in search of us , and he went to stop them .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 7]: Oh , here he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 13]: Medenham entered , and the impulsive Mrs. Devar ran to meet him .
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 60]: Though he had been in the river again only five minutes earlier , the walk up a dust-laden path had covered his sopping boots with mud , and in the not very powerful light of the hall , where a score or more of anxious people were collected , it was difficult to notice that his clothes were wet .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 20]: But `` Wiggy '' Devar did not care now whether or not the story told by Cynthia was true .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 31]: With reaction from the nightmare that had possessed her since ten o'clock came a sharp appreciation of the extraordinarily favorable turn taken by events so far as she was concerned .
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 24]: If a French count were to be supplanted by an English viscount , what better opportunity of approving the change could present itself ?
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 31]: `` Mr. Fitzroy , '' she said in her shrill voice , `` I can never thank you sufficiently for the courage and resource you displayed in rescuing Miss Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 6]: You have acted most nobly .
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 23]: I am only saying now what Mr. Vanrenen will say when his daughter and I tell him of your magnificent behavior . ''
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 28]: He reddened and tried to smile , though wishing most heartily that these heroics , if unavoidable , had been kept for some other time and place .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 31]: He could not believe that Cynthia had exalted a not very serious incident into a `` rescue , '' yet she might be vexed if he cheapened his own services .
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 30]: In any event , it was doubtful whether she would wish her father to hear of the escapade until she told him herself at the close of the tour .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 33]: `` I am sure Miss Vanrenen felt safe while in my care , '' was all he dared to say , but Cynthia promptly understood his perplexity and came to his aid .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Devar thinks far more of our adventure than we do , '' she broke in .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 10]: `` Our chief difficulty lay in finding the road .
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 17]: The only time I felt worried was when you crossed the river to retrieve the ferryboat .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 10]: But surely I have caused enough excitement for to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 13]: You ought to take some hot lemonade and go to bed . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 21]: A man who had walked up the hill from the boathouse with Medenham laughed and slapped him on the shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 8]: `` Come along , old chap ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 23]: `` You certainly want a hot draught of some sort , and you must not hang about in those wet clothes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 20]: `` Yes , '' purred Mrs. Devar , `` do n't run the risk of catching cold , Fitzroy .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 13]: It would spoil everything if _ you _ were laid up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 7]: Her gracious manner almost deceived Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 30]: During his years of wandering he had come across unexpected good qualities in men from whom he looked for naught but evil -- was it the same with women ?
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 4]: He hoped so .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 15]: Perhaps this scheming marriage-broker had shed her worldly scales under the stress of emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 33]: `` You need have no fear that the car will not be waiting for you in the morning , Mrs. Devar , '' he said , smiling frankly into her steel-gray eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 11]: `` Did you say half-past nine , Miss Vanrenen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 12]: he asked , turning to snatch one last look at Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 7]: Good-night -- and thank you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 10]: She offered her hand to him before them all .
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 90]: The touch of her cool fingers was infinitely sweet , but when he strove to surprise some hint of her thought in those twin pools of limpid light that were wont to gaze at him so fearlessly he failed , for all the daring had fled from Cynthia , and he knew -- how Heaven and lovers alone can tell -- that her heart was beating with a fright she had not felt when he staggered under the relentless pressure of the river while holding her in his arms .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 31]: To the lookers-on the girl 's outstretched hand was a token of gratitude ; to Medenham it carried an acknowledgment of that equality which should reign between those who love .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 19]: His head swam in a sudden vertigo of delight , and he hurried away without uttering a word .
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 72]: There were some , perhaps , who wondered ; others who saw in his brusqueness nothing more than the confusion of an inferior overwhelmed by the kindly condescension of a young and charming mistress ; but the one who did fully and truly interpret the secret springs of his action went suddenly white to the lips , and her voice was curiously low and strained as she turned to Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 31]: `` Come , dear , '' she murmured , `` I am tired , it would seem ; and you , you must be quite worn out with anxiety . ''
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 39]: `` My darling child , '' gushed Mrs. Devar , `` I should have been nearly dead if I had not known that Fitzroy was with you , but he is one of those men who inspire confidence .
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 21]: I refused to admit even to myself that anything of evil consequence could happen to you while he was present .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 30]: How fortunate we were that day in town -- '' The man who had suggested that the hotel pharmacist could dispense hot drinks other than lemonade nudged an acquaintance .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 15]: `` Our chauffeur friend has a rippin ' nice job , '' he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 20]: `` Would n't mind taking his billet myself -- it ` ud be a change from everlastin ' goff .
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 2]: Hello !
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 4]: Where is he ?
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 21]: I meant to -- '' Medenham had gone , striding away up the hillside in a very frenzy of happiness .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 10]: Four days , and Cynthia as good as won !
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 31]: Was it possible , then , that the disguised prince of the fairytale could be a reality -- that such romances might still be found in this gray old world ?
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 3]: Four days !
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 40]: He could not be deeper in love with Cynthia had he known her four years , or forty , and he was certain now that he had really loved her before he had been in her company four minutes .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 64]: But these rhapsodies were cut short by his arrival at the hotel garage , with the displeasing discovery that no one named Dale had reached Symon 's Yat that evening , while the stolid fact stared him in the face that his cherished Mercury demanded several hours of hard-working attentions if it were to glisten and hum in its usual perfection next morning .
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 22]: `` Queer thing , '' he said , thinking aloud rather than addressing the stableman who had given this disconcerting news .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 18]: `` I have never before known him fail ; and I wired to Hereford early enough . ''
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 12]: `` Oh , he 's in Hereford , is he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 4]: inquired the man .
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 15]: `` He ought not to be , but he is , I fear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 15]: `` Then it 'll be him who axed for ye on the telephone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 14]: `` It ` ud be somewheres about a quarter or half past eight .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 20]: Lizzie tole me after the old leddy kem up to see if you 'd taken the car out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 8]: Medenham 's wits were alert enough now .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 11]: `` I do n't fully understand , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 12]: `` What old lady , and why did she come ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 12]: `` That 's wot bothered me , '' was the reply .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 29]: `` Everybody knew that the young leddy an ' you were on the Wye : ` deed to goodness , some of us thought you were in it .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 33]: Anyways , it was long after ten when she -- '' `` You mean Mrs. Devar , I suppose -- the older lady of the two who arrived in my car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 7]: `` Yes , that 's her .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 42]: She wanted to be sure the car was n't gone , and nothing would suit her but the key must be brought from the orfis an ' the coach-house door unlocked so 's she could see it with her own eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 46]: Well , Lizzie sez to me , ` That 's funny , it is , because she watched they two goin ' on the river , and was in the box a long time telephonin ' to a shuffer called Dale , at Hereford . '
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 28]: Thinks I , ` It 's funnier that the shuffer who 's here should be expectin ' a chap named Dale , ' but I said nothink .
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 6]: I never does to wimmen .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 21]: Lord luv yer , they 'll twist a tale twenty ways for Sundays to suit their own pupposes afterwards . ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 28]: Lightning struck from a cloudless sky a second time that night at Symon 's Yat , and in its gleam was revealed the duplicity of Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 32]: Medenham could not guess the double significance of Dale 's message and failure to appear , but he was under no delusion now as to the cause of those honeyed words .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 31]: Dale had been indiscreet , had probably blurted out his employer 's title , and Mrs. Devar knew at last who the chauffeur was whose interference had baffled her plans .
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 13]: He laughed bitterly , but did not pursue the inquiry any further .
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 9]: `` Can you clean coachwork and brass ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 9]: he asked , stooping to unlock the toolbox .
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 11]: The stableman shuffled uneasily from one foot to the other .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 23]: The hour was past midnight , and the alarm raised at the hotel had already robbed him of two hours ' sleep .
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 13]: `` Hosses is more in my line , '' he answered gruffly .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 17]: `` But if I give you half a sovereign perhaps you will not mind helping me .
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 10]: I shall attend to the engine myself . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 11]: ` Arf a suv-rin did you say , mister ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 5]: came the panting question .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 3]: Be quick !
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 9]: Off with your coat , and get busy .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 20]: A man who can groom a horse properly ought to be able to use a rubber and hose . ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 11]: By two o'clock the Mercury was shining above and below .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 17]: Thoroughly weary , yet well satisfied with the day 's record , Medenham went to bed .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 42]: He was up at seven , and meant to talk severely to Dale after breakfast ; then he found , by consulting a directory , that the small hotel where his man had arranged to stay did not possess a telephone .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 30]: It was annoying , but he had the consolation of knowing that an hour 's slow run would bring him to Hereford and reunite him with his sorely-needed baggage .
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 29]: He was giving a few finishing touches to the car 's toilette , when the Welsh waiting-maid hurried to the garage ; Miss Vanrenen wanted him at once .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 15]: She awaited him in the veranda of the hotel , which fronted the southeast .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 48]: A shower of June roses , pink and crimson and white , bespangled the sloping roof and hid the square posts that supported it , and a flood of vivid sunshine irradiated Cynthia as she leaned over the low rail of the balcony and smiled a greeting .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 31]: She presented a picture that was a triumph of unconscious art , and her beauty affected Medenham more than a deep draught of the strongest wine ever vinted by man .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 53]: Yesterday she was a charming girl , radiantly good-looking , and likely to attract attention even in circles where pretty women were plentiful as blackberries in a September thicket , but to-day , in Medenham 's eyes , she was a woodland sprite , an ethereal creature cast in no mortal mold .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 15]: So enthralled was he by the vision that he failed to note her attire .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 26]: She wore the muslin dress of the previous night , and this , in itself , might have prepared him for what was to come .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 44]: `` Good-morning , Mr. Fitzroy , '' she said , with a fine attempt at re-establishing those friendly relations which might reasonably exist between the owner of a motor-car and its hirer , `` how are you after your strenuous labors of yesterday ?
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 7]: I have heard all about you .
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 9]: Fancy remaining out of bed till two o'clock !
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 18]: Could n't that precious car of yours be cleaned this morning , and by someone else ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 7]: He found his tongue at that .
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 11]: `` Mercury obeys none but Jupiter , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 10]: Her eyes met his fairly , and she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 30]: `` That is the first conceited thing I have heard you say , '' she cried , `` and , by Jove , are n't you flying high ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 10]: `` Jupiter assumed disguises , '' he reminded her .
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 30]: `` Once , when he peered into an Olympian grove , he saw Io , and took the form of a youth so that he might talk with her .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 48]: He found her so lovable that he passed many a pleasant hour in her company wandering on the banks of the classic stream that flowed through the wood , and in those hours he was not Jupiter but a boy , a boy very much in love .
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 25]: Every man has , or ought to have , something of Jupiter , a good deal of the boy , in his make-up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 12]: He turned and looked at the Wye and its tree-shaded banks .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 17]: Then he faced Cynthia again , and his hands rested on the barrier that divided them .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 23]: For one mad instant he thought of vaulting it , and Cynthia read his thought ; she drew back in a panic .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 25]: A less infatuated wooer than Medenham might have noted that she seemed to fear interruption more than any too impulsive action on his part .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 23]: `` I sent for you to tell you that Mrs. Devar is ill , '' she said in a flurry of words .
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 16]: `` I am afraid she suffered more from the fright than I imagined last night .
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 13]: Anyhow , she has asked me to let her remain here to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 21]: You wo n't mind , I am sure , though it must be a bother not to have your luggage .
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 11]: Ca n't you run in to Hereford and get it ?
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 15]: I am quite content to rest in this pretty place and write letters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 18]: `` I do honestly believe that Mrs. Devar is more frightened than ill , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 12]: `` Oh , she is n't making a fuss about it .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 22]: Indeed , she was willing to go to Hereford this afternoon if I particularly wanted to attend service at the cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 30]: I did , as a matter of fact , but it would be real mean to insist on it after scaring the poor thing into a nervous headache . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 11]: `` The affair arranges itself admirably , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 22]: `` At most cathedrals there is an anthem , followed by a sermon by some eminent preacher , about three o'clock .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 27]: Write your letters this morning , or , better still , climb to the top of the Yat and see the glorious view from the top .
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 44]: Come back for lunch at one , and -- '' `` I 'll see what Mrs. Devar thinks of it , '' broke in Cynthia , whose cheeks were borrowing tints from the red roses and the white with astonishing fluctuations of color .
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 23]: She ran off , more like Io , the sylph , than ever , and Medenham stood there in a brown study .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 16]: `` This sort of thing ca n't go on , '' he argued with himself .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 58]: `` At any minute now I shall be taking her in my arms and kissing her , and that will not be fair to Cynthia , who is proud and queenly , and who will strive against the dictates of her own heart because it is not seemly that she should wed her father 's paid servant .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 19]: So I must tell her , to-day -- perhaps during the run home from Hereford , perhaps to-night .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 6]: But , dash it all !
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 7]: that will break up our tour .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 54]: One ought to consider the world we live in ; Cynthia will be one of its leaders , and it will never do to have people saying that Viscount Medenham became engaged to Cynthia Vanrenen while acting as the lady 's chauffeur during a thousand-mile run through the West of England and Wales .
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 11]: Now , what _ am _ I to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 12]: The answer came from a bedroom window that overlooked the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 5]: `` Mr. Fitzroy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 37]: He knew as he looked up that Cynthia dared not face him again , for her voice was too exquisitely subtle in its modulations not to betray its owner 's disappointment before she uttered another word .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 36]: `` I am very sorry , '' she said rapidly , `` but I feel I ought not to leave Mrs. Devar until she is better , so I mean to remain indoors all day .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 11]: I shall not require the car before nine o'clock to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 19]: If _ you _ like to visit Hereford , go at any time that suits your convenience . ''
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 66]: She seemed to regret the curtness of her speech , though indeed she was raging inwardly because of certain barbed shafts planted in her breast by Mrs. Devar 's faint protests , and tried to mitigate the blow she had inflicted by adding , with a valiant smile : `` For this occasion only , Jupiter must content himself with Mercury as a companion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 13]: `` If I had Jove 's power -- '' he began wrathfully .
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 26]: `` If you were Cynthia Vanrenen , you would do exactly what she is doing , '' she cried , and fled from the window .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 18]: It is not to be denied that he extracted some cold comfort from that last cryptic remark .
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 14]: Cynthia wanted to come , but Mrs. Devar had evidently burked the excursion .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 19]: Because Cynthia 's escort would be Viscount Medenham and not Arthur Simmonds , orthodox and highly respectable chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 15]: But Mrs. Devar plainly declared herself on the side of Viscount Medenham last night .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 45]: Why , then , did she stop a short journey by motor , with the laudable objective of hearing an anthem and a sermon in a cathedral , when overnight she permitted the far less defensible trip on the river with the hated Fitzroy ?
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 10]: It needed no great penetration to solve this puzzle .
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 18]: Mrs. Devar was afraid of some development that might happen if the girl visited Hereford that day .
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 41]: She counted on Medenham being chained to Symon 's Yat while Cynthia was there -- consequently she had heard something from Dale that rendered it eminently necessary that neither he nor Cynthia should be seen in Hereford on the Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 41]: Probably , too , she did not anticipate that Cynthia would don the haircloth of self-discipline and avoid him during the whole of the day , since that was what the girl meant by her allusion to Monday 's starting-time .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 30]: Perhaps , using a woman 's privilege , she might change her mind towards sunset ; meanwhile , it behooved him to visit Hereford and pry into things there .
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 8]: Nevertheless , he was a wise lover .
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 29]: Cynthia might dismiss him graciously to follow his own behests , but it might not please her if she discovered that he had taken her permission too literally .
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 73]: He entered the hotel and wrote a letter : `` My dear Miss Vanrenen -- '' no pretense of `` Madam '' or other social formula , but a plain and large `` My dear , '' with the name appended as a concession to the humbug of life , even in regard to the woman he loved -- `` I am going to Hereford , but shall return here for luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 31]: Mrs. Devar 's illness is not likely to be lasting , and the view from the Yat is , if possible , better in the afternoon than in the morning .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 23]: In addition to my obvious need of a clean collar , I believe that our presence in Hereford to-day is not desired .
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 3362 len. 10]: I shall make it my business to find out .
Parsing [sent. 3363 len. 17]: Yours ever sincerely -- '' Then he reached a high and stout stone wall of difficulty .
Parsing [sent. 3364 len. 27]: Was he to fall back on the subterfuge of `` George Augustus Fitzroy , '' which , of course , was his proper signature in law ?
Parsing [sent. 3365 len. 56]: He disliked this veil of concealment more and more each instant , but it was manifestly out of the question that he should sign himself `` Medenham , '' or `` George , '' while he had fought several pitched battles at Harrow with classmates who pined to label him `` Augustus , '' abbreviated .
Parsing [sent. 3366 len. 37]: So , greatly daring , he wrote : `` Mercury 's Guv ` nor , '' trusting to luck whether or not Cynthia 's classical lore would remind her that Mercury was the son of Jupiter .
Parsing [sent. 3367 len. 17]: He reread this effusion twice , and was satisfied with it as the herald of others .
Parsing [sent. 3368 len. 27]: `` My dear '' sounded well ; the intimacy of `` our presence '' was not overdone ; while `` yours ever sincerely '' was excellent .
Parsing [sent. 3369 len. 14]: He wondered if Cynthia would analyze it word for word in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 3370 len. 9]: Well , some day he might ask her .
Parsing [sent. 3371 len. 60]: For the present he sealed the letter with a sigh and gave it to a waiter for safe delivery ; he fancied , but could not be quite sure , that a good deal of unnecessary play with the motor 's Gabriel horn five minutes later brought a slender muslined figure to a window of the then distant hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3372 len. 30]: From Symon 's Yat to Hereford is about fifteen miles , and Medenham drew out of the narrow lane leading from the river to Whitchurch about a quarter-past nine .
Parsing [sent. 3373 len. 39]: Thenceforth a straight and good road lay clear before him , and he meant to break the law as to speed limit by traveling at the fastest rate compatible with his own safety and that of other road-users .
Parsing [sent. 3374 len. 39]: It was no disgrace to the Mercury car , therefore , when a dull report and a sudden effort of the steering-wheel to swerve to the right betokened the collapse of an inner tube on the off side .
Parsing [sent. 3375 len. 18]: From the motorist 's point of view it was difficult to understand the cause of the mishap .
Parsing [sent. 3376 len. 40]: The whole four tires were new so recently as the previous Monday , and Medenham was far too deeply absorbed in his own affairs to grasp the essential fact that Fate was still taking an intelligent interest in him .
Parsing [sent. 3377 len. 18]: Of course , he did not hurry over the work as though his life depended on it .
Parsing [sent. 3378 len. 32]: Even when the cover was replaced and the tire pumped to the proper degree of air-pressure he lit a cigarette and had a look at the magneto before restarting the engine .
Parsing [sent. 3379 len. 46]: Two small boys had appeared from space , and he amused himself by asking them to reckon how long it would take two men to mow a field of grass which one of the men could mow in three days and the other in four .
Parsing [sent. 3380 len. 27]: He promised a reward of sixpence if the correct answer were forthcoming in a minute , and raised it to a shilling during the next minute .
Parsing [sent. 3381 len. 27]: This stimulated their wits to suggest `` a day and three-quarters '' instead of the first frantic effort of `` three days and a half . ''
Parsing [sent. 3382 len. 7]: `` No , '' said he .
Parsing [sent. 3383 len. 35]: `` Think it over , ponder it with ardor , and if you have the right answer ready when I pass this way again about midday I 'll give you a shilling each . ''
Parsing [sent. 3384 len. 41]: There is no saying what sum he would have given those urchins if some magician had spoken by their mouths and bade him hasten to Hereford with all the zest of all the horses pent beneath the Mercury 's bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 3385 len. 63]: But he left the boys ciphering on a gate with a bit of lead pencil which he lent them , and pulled up at the door of the Green Dragon Hotel in Hereford just five minutes after the Sunday morning express to London had snatched a fuming and indignant Earl of Fairholme from off the platform of the Great Western railway station .
Parsing [sent. 3386 len. 5]: `` Whose car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3387 len. 4]: inquired a hall-porter .
Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 13]: `` Mine , '' said Medenham , rather surprised by the question .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 5]: `` Sorry , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 13]: I thought you might be the party Lord Fairholme was expecting . ''
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 10]: `` Did you say ` Lord Fairholme ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 17]: Medenham spoke with the slow accents of sheer astonishment , and the man hastened to explain .
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 28]: His lordship has been a-damnin ' everybody since two o'clock yesterday afternoon because a Miss Vanrenen , who had ordered rooms here , did n't turn up .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 21]: She 's on a motor tour through England , so I thought -- '' `` You have made no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 16]: But are you quite sure that the Earl of Fairholme asked for Miss Vanrenen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 25]: `` Not exactly that , sir , but he seemed to be uncommon vexed when we could give him no news of her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 8]: `` Where is his lordship now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 11]: `` Gone to London , sir , by the 10.5 .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 13]: He damned me for the last time half an hour ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 7]: `` Oh , did he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 29]: Medenham glanced at his watch , twisted himself free of the wheel , leaped to the pavement , and tapped one of the hall-porter 's gold epaulettes impressively .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 17]: `` I am forced to believe that you are speaking the truth , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 15]: `` Now , tell me all about it , there 's a good fellow .
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 38]: I am a bit rattled , because , do n't you see , Lord Fairholme is my father , and he is the last man on earth whom I would have expected to meet in Hereford to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 18]: During the less exciting intervals in his speech did you find out why he came here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 14]: `` Perhaps the manageress may be able to tell you something , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 11]: Beg pardon , but may I ask your name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 4]: `` Medenham . ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 26]: The man tickled the back of his ear in doubt , since he was aware that an Earl 's son usually has a courtesy title .
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 5]: `` Lord Medenham ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 3]: he hazarded .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 4]: `` Viscount . ''
Parsing [sent. 3414 len. 22]: `` I thought , perhaps , you might have been a gentleman named Fitzroy , my lord , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3415 len. 9]: `` Well , I am that , too .
Parsing [sent. 3416 len. 40]: If you feel that I ought to be presented to the manageress in state , kindly announce me as George Augustus Fitzroy , Viscount Medenham , of Medenham Hall , Downshire , and 91 Cavendish Square , London . ''
Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 6]: The hall-porter 's eyes twinkled .
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 30]: `` I did n't mean that , my lord , but there 's a chauffeur , name of Dale -- '' `` Ah , what of him ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 48]: _ He _ knows _ all _ about it , my lord , and he 's hiding in a hayloft down the stable yard at this minnit , because your lordship 's father threatened to give him in charge for stealing a couple of your portmanteaux . ''
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 14]: `` Tell me he thieved successfully and I shall fork out handsomely . ''
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 4]: The man grinned .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 27]: He was shrewd enough to realize that , no matter what mystery lay behind all this , the aid of the police would not be requisitioned .
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 8]: `` I believe -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 19]: Then he made off , with a cry of `` Wait just a few seconds , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 6]: I 'll bring Dale . ''
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 45]: And Dale appeared , picking bits of hay off his uniform , and striving vainly to compose his features into their customary expression of a stolid alertness that hears nothing but his master 's orders , sees nothing that does not concern his duties .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 29]: He gave one sharp glance at the car , and his face grew chauffeurish , but the look of hang-dog despair returned when he met Medenham 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 18]: `` I could n't get away to save me life , my lord , '' he grumbled .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 14]: `` It was a fair cop at Bristol , an ' no mistake .
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 20]: His lordship swooped down on me an ' Simmonds at the station , so wot could I do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 3]: Medenham laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 9]: `` I do n't blame you , Dale .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 13]: You could not have been more nonplussed than I at this moment .
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 26]: Will you kindly remember that I know nothing whatever of the Earl 's appearance either at Bristol or Hereford -- '' `` Gord 's trewth !
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 12]: Did n't they tell you I telephoned , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 36]: Dale would not have spoken in that fashion were he not quite woebegone and down-hearted ; and not without reason , for the Earl had dismissed him with contumely not once but a dozen times .
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 56]: Medenham saw that his retainer would be more muddled than ever if he realized that Mrs. Devar had intercepted the telephone message , so he slurred over that element of the affair , and Dale quickly enlightened him as to the course taken by events after the departure of the Mercury 's tourists from Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 37]: The Earl , too , had referred to Lady St. Maur 's correspondent at Bournemouth , and Medenham could fill in blanks in the story quite easily , but the allusions to Marigny were less comprehensible .
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 36]: Dale 's distress arose chiefly from the Earl 's vows of vengeance when he discovered that his son 's baggage had been spirited away during the breakfast hour that morning , but Medenham reassured him .
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 13]: `` Do n't bother your head about that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 14]: `` I 'll telegraph and write to my father a full explanation to-day .
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 22]: You have obeyed my orders , and he must blame me , not you , if they ran counter to his .
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 16]: Take charge of the car while I change my clothes and make a few inquiries .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 18]: To save any further mix-up , you had better come with me to Symon 's Yat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 28]: Within five minutes he ascertained that Count Edouard Marigny had occupied a room in the Mitre Hotel , just across the street , since the previous afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 18]: More than that , the Frenchman was traveling to London by the same train as the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 6]: Then Medenham felt really angry .
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 29]: It was inconceivable that his father should have allowed himself to be drawn into a pitiful intrigue by such doubtful agents as Marigny and the Countess of Porthcawl .
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 27]: `` I 'll write , '' he vowed , `` and in pretty stiff terms , too , but I 'm jiggered if I 'll wire .
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 11]: The old chap should have shown more confidence in me .
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 12]: Why on earth did n't he announce his visit to Bristol ?
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 17]: Jolly good job he left Hereford to-day before I arrived -- there might have been ructions .
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 3]: Good Lord !
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 9]: He evidently takes Cynthia for an adventuress ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 25]: Yet , in spite of the chance of ructions , it would have been far better had Medenham not missed his father that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 29]: He was too dutiful a son , the Earl was too fair-minded a parent , that they should not be able to meet and discuss matters without heat .
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 26]: By noon they would have reached Symon 's Yat ; before lunch was ended the older man would have been Cynthia 's most outspoken admirer .
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 47]: As it was -- well , as it was -- there used to be a belief in the Middle Ages that the Evil One 's favorite nook lay amid the deepest shadow of a cathedral , and modern fact is ofttimes curiously akin to medieval romance .
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 26]: CHAPTER XI THE PARTING OF THE WAYS When he came to think of it , Medenham decided to return at once to Symon 's Yat .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 35]: It was advisable , however , to inform the proprietor of the hotel that the Earl 's denunciation of Dale as a pilferer of luggage was based on a complete misunderstanding of the facts .
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 16]: With that object in view he entered the office ; another surprise awaited him there .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 34]: A lady bookkeeper , casting an appraising eye over his motoring garments , asked instantly : `` Are you Mr. Fitzroy , driver of a Mercury car , Number X L 4000 ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 24]: `` Yes , '' said he , prepared now to see his name and description blazoned across the west front of the cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 8]: `` You are wanted on the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 10]: Miss Vanrenen wishes you to ring her up . ''
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 18]: After a soul-chastening delay he heard Cynthia 's voice : `` That you , Mr. Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 31]: `` I 'm so glad I caught you before you hurried away again ... Er -- that is -- I suppose you traveled rather fast , you and Mercury ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 3]: He laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 4]: That was all .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 23]: He did not intend to let her assume so readily that he had missed the first thought which bubbled forth in words .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 25]: She well knew that he was not in Hereford from personal choice , but she had not meant to tell him that she knew .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 8]: `` What are you sniggering at ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 4]: she demanded imperiously .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 10]: `` Only at your divination , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 28]: `` Indeed , if a tire had not given out soon after I left Whitchurch I would now be well on my way to the Yat . ''
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 10]: Suddenly he recollected the singular outcome of the incident .
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 23]: There was some reasonable probability that it might exercise a material effect on the course of events during the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 21]: So , after a little pause , he added : `` That is one reason ; there are others . ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 9]: `` Is something detaining you , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 19]: `` Yes , a trivial matter , but I shall be at the hotel long before lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 18]: `` Mrs. Devar is much better ... She is so sorry I remained indoors this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 33]: `` Mrs. Devar is cultivating angelic qualities , '' he said , but he murmured under his breath : `` The old cat finds now that she has made a mistake . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 19]: `` I want you to pay the hotel people for the rooms I reserved but have not occupied .
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 18]: Then , perhaps , they will hand you any mail that may have been sent after me .
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 9]: And please give them my address at Chester .
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 7]: Will you do all that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 3]: `` Certainly .
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 7]: There should be no difficulty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 8]: `` Is Hereford looking very lively ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 15]: `` It strikes me as peculiarly empty , '' he said with convincing candor .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 14]: `` Shall we have time to see all the show places to-morrow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 7]: `` We shall make time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 5]: `` Well , good-bye !
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 4]: Bring my letters .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 13]: I have not heard from my father since we left Bournemouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 11]: `` Ah , there I have the better of you .
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 16]: I heard of , if not from , my revered dad since reaching Hereford . ''
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 4]: `` Unexpectedly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 6]: `` Oh , quite . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 8]: `` Nothing wrong , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 35]: `` The old gentleman 's temper seems to be a trifle out of gear ; the present attack is not serious ; he will survive it -- for many years , I trust . ''
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 12]: `` You must not be flippant where your father is concerned .
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 25]: I believe he is annoyed because you came away with me , and so failed to keep the appointment fixed for Saturday in London .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 2]: Eh ?
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 6]: What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 17]: `` I said ` Well , I am surprised , ' or words to that effect .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 23]: As my name is George I can not tell a lie , so I must admit regretfully that you have guessed right .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 29]: Indeed , Miss Vanrenen , I may go so far as to suggest , by letter , that before my father condemns me he should first meet you .
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 13]: Of course , I shall warn him that you are irresistible . ''
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 9]: `` Good-by again , '' said Cynthia severely .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 19]: `` You can tell me all about it after -- oh , some time to-day , anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 9]: The Green Dragon proved to be most undragonish .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 37]: No manner of doubt was cast on Medenham 's good faith ; he pocketed half a dozen letters for Cynthia , and one , unstamped , bearing the crest of the Mitre , for Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 25]: By the merest chance he caught sight of a note , addressed `` Viscount Medenham , '' stuck in a rack among some telegrams .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 7]: The handwriting was his father 's .
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 10]: But how secure it without arousing quite reasonable suspicion ?
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 6]: He tried the bold course .
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 15]: `` I may as well take that , too , '' he said offhandedly .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 10]: `` Is Viscount Medenham also in your party ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 4]: inquired the bookkeeper .
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 35]: Again no demur was raised , since the Earl 's repeated demands for information as to Miss Vanrenen 's whereabouts showed that some sort of link must exist between him and the missing tourists .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 28]: Medenham sat in his car outside and read : MY DEAR GEORGE -- If this reaches you , please oblige me by returning to town at once .
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 15]: Your aunt is making a devil of a fuss , and is most unpleasant .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 21]: I say no more now , since I am not sure that you will be in Hereford before we meet .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 32]: Yours ever , F. `` I can see myself being very angry with Aunt Susan , '' he growled in the first flush of resentment against the unfairness of her attitude .
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 6]: But that phase soon passed .
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 16]: His mind dwelt rather on Lady St. Maur 's bland amazement when she encountered Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 47]: He could estimate with some degree of precision her ladyship 's views regarding the eighty millions of citizens of the United States ; had she not said in his hearing that `` American society was evidently quite English -- but with the head cut off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 23]: That , and a sarcastic computation as to the difference between Ten Thousand and Four Hundred , constituted her knowledge of America .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 8]: Still , he made excuses for her .
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 12]: It was no new thing for an aristocracy to be narrow-minded .
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 53]: Horace , that fine gentleman , `` hated the vulgar crowd , '' and Nicolo Machiavelli , fifteen centuries later , denounced the nobles of Florence for their `` easy-going contempt of everything and everybody '' ; so Lady St. Maur had plenty of historical precedent for the coining of cheap epigrams .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 12]: The one person Medenham was really bitter against was Millicent Porthcawl .
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 46]: _ She _ had met Cynthia ; _ she _ herself must have frowned at the lying innuendoes written from Bournemouth ; it would give him some satisfaction to tell Cynthia that the Porthcawl _ m√©nage _ ought not to figure on her visiting list .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 3]: But there !
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 28]: Cynthia was too generous-minded even to avenge her wrongs , though well able to deal with the Millicents and Mauds and Susans if they dared be spiteful .
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 37]: Then the coming of Dale with various leather bags roused him from the reverie induced by his father 's curt missive , and he laughed at the discovery that he was fighting Cynthia 's battles already .
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 30]: The Mercury was raising a good deal of dust in the neighborhood of Whitchurch when its occupants noticed a pair of urchins perched on a gate , signaling frantically .
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 26]: It pleased Medenham to mystify Dale , who was , if possible , more taciturn than ever since those heart-searching experiences at Gloucester and Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 12]: He pulled up some fifty yards or more down the road .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 7]: `` You saw those boys ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 15]: `` Yes , my lord , but they 're only having a game . ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 6]: `` Nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 13]: Skip along and ask them if they have found out the answer .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 16]: If they say ' a day and five-sevenths , ' hand them a shilling each .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 7]: Any other reply will be wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 4]: Do n't talk .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 16]: Just run there and back , and pay only on a day and five-sevenths . ''
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 3]: Dale ran .
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 8]: Soon he was in his seat again .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 21]: `` I gev ' 'em a bob each , my lord , '' he announced , grave as an owl .
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 28]: While they were running slowly down the winding lane that led to the Yat Medenham determined to make sure of his ground with reference to Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 30]: `` I suppose you left no room for doubt as to my identity in the mind of the lady to whom you spoke over the telephone last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 7]: `` None whatever , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 8]: She wormed it out of me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 8]: `` Did you mention the Earl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 14]: `` Like an ijjit , I began by giving his lordship 's name .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 15]: It was my only chanst , I could n't get to the post-office nohow .
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 25]: Why , I was ordered to bed at eight o'clock , so 's his lordship could smoke in peace , as he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 18]: `` Then my father was determined to stop you from communicating with me , if possible ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 34]: `` If his lordship knew that I crep ' down a back stairs to the telephone I do believe he 'd have set about me with a poker , '' said Dale grimly .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 4]: `` Strange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 16]: mused Medenham , with eyes now more intent on the hotel than on the road .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 12]: `` Influences other than Aunt Susan 's must be at work .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 26]: My father would never have rushed off in a fever from town merely because of some ill-natured gossip in a letter from Lady Porthcawl . ''
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 29]: His mind flew to the Earl 's allusions to Marigny , and it occurred to him then that the latter had used his father 's name at Bristol .
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 6]: He turned to Dale again .
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 21]: `` Before this business is ended I shall probably find it necessary to kick a Frenchman , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 26]: `` Make it two of 'em , my lord , an ' let me take it out of the other one , '' growled Dale .
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 39]: `` Well , there _ is _ a bottle-holder , '' said Medenham , thinking of Devar , `` a short , fat fellow , an Englishman , but a most satisfactory subject for a drop kick . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 18]: `` Say when , my lord , an ' I 'll score a goal with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 17]: Dale seemed to be speaking feelingly , but his master paid slight heed to him then .
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 20]: A girl in muslin , wearing a rather stylish hat -- now , where did Cynthia get a hat ?
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 20]: -- had just sauntered to that end of the hotel 's veranda which gave a glimpse of the road .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 21]: `` Make yourself comfortable in one of the cottages hereabouts , '' was Medenham 's parting instruction to his man .
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 27]: `` I do n't suppose the car will be needed again to-day , but you might refill the petrol tank -- on the off chance . ''
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 7]: `` Yes -- my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 5]: Dale lifted his cap .
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 22]: The ostler who had helped in the cleaning of the car overnight was standing near the open doors of the coach-house .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 16]: He might not have heard the words , but he certainly saw the respectful action .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 18]: His eyes grew round , and his lips pursed to give vent to an imaginary whistle . ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 10]: _ I _ knew , '' he told himself .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 12]: `` He 's a toff , that 's wot he is .
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 7]: Mum 's the word , Willyum .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 9]: Say nothink , ` specially to wimmen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 14]: Bowing low before his smiling goddess , Medenham produced the packet of letters .
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 25]: It happened that the unstamped note for Mrs. Devar lay uppermost , and Cynthia guessed some part , at least , of its contents .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 6]: `` Poor Monsieur Marigny ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 11]: `` I fear he had a cheerless evening in Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 5]: This is from him .
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 29]: I know his handwriting ... While father and I were in Paris he often sent invitations for fixtures at the Velo -- once for a coach-drive to Fontainebleau .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 11]: I was rather sorry I missed _ that _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 11]: Medenham thanked her in his heart for that little pause .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 12]: No printed page could be more legible than Cynthia 's thought-processes .
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 17]: How delightful it was to feel that her unspoken words were mirrored in his own brain !
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 11]: But these lover-like beatitudes were interrupted by a slight shriek .
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 22]: She had glanced curiously at a postmark , ripped open an envelope , and was reading something that surprised her greatly .
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 10]: `` Well , of all the queer things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 7]: `` Here 's father in London .
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 29]: He started from Paris yesterday afternoon , and found he had just time to send me a line by paying a special postal fee at Paddington ... What ?
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 10]: ... Mrs. Leland going to join us at Chester !
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 7]: ... Wire if I get this !
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 10]: ... '' She reread the letter with heightened color .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 12]: Medenham 's heart sank to his boots while he watched her .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 44]: Whosoever Mrs. Leland might be -- and Cynthia 's first cry of the name sent a shock of recognition through him -- it was fully evident that the addition of another member to the party would straightway shut him out of his Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 27]: Mrs. Devar , in the r√¥le of guardian , had been disposed of satisfactorily , but `` Mrs. Leland '' was more than a doubtful quantity .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 22]: For some kindred reason , perhaps , Cynthia chose to turn and look at the sparkling Wye when next she spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 36]: `` I do n't see why Mrs. Leland 's unexpected appearance should make any real difference to our tour , '' she said in the colorless tone of one who seeks rather than imparts conviction .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 10]: `` There is plenty of room in the car .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 14]: We must take the front seat in turn , that is all . ''
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 10]: `` May I ask who Mrs. Leland is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 37]: he asked , and , if his voice was ominously cold , it may be urged in extenuation that in matters affecting Cynthia he was no greater adept at concealing his thoughts than the girl herself .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 12]: `` An old friend of ours , '' she explained hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 19]: `` In fact , her husband was my father 's partner till he died , some years ago .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 10]: She is a charming woman , quite a cosmopolitan .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 21]: She lives in Paris ` most all the time , but I fancied she was at Trouville for the summer .
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 12]: I wonder ... '' She read the letter a third time .
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 53]: Drooping lids and a screen of heavy eyelashes veiled her eyes , and when the fingers holding that disturbing note rested on the rail of the veranda again , still those radiant blue eyes remained invisible , and the eloquent eyebrows were not arched in laughing bewilderment but straightened in silent questioning .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 31]: `` Mr. Vanrenen gives no details , '' she said at last , and seldom , indeed , did `` Mr. Vanrenen '' replace `` father '' in her speech .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 24]: `` Perhaps he was writing against time , though he might have told me less about the post and more of Mrs. Leland .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 29]: Anyhow , he has a fine Italian hand in some things , and may be this is one of them ... But I must telegraph at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 15]: Medenham roused himself to set forth British idiosyncrasies on the question of Sunday labor .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 22]: He remembered the telephone , however , and Cynthia went off to try and get in touch with the Savoy Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 23]: He withdrew a little way , and began to smoke a reflective cigar , for he knew now who Mrs. Leland was .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 10]: In twenty minutes or less Cynthia came to him .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 23]: It was difficult to account for her obvious perplexity , though he could have revealed some of its secret springs readily enough .
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 29]: `` I 'm sorry I shall not be able to take that walk , Mr. Fitzroy , '' she said , frankly recognizing the tacit pact between them .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 28]: `` We have a long day before us to-morrow , and we must make Chester in good time , as Mrs. Leland is coming alone from London .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 10]: Meanwhile , I must attend to my correspondence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 3]: `` Ah .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 10]: You have spoken to Mr. Vanrenen , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 28]: He was not in the hotel , but he left a message for me , knowing that I was more likely to ` phone than wire . ''
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 22]: She was troubled , disturbed , somewhat resentful of this unforeseen change in the programme arranged for the next few days .
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 45]: Medenham could have chosen no more unhappy moment for what he had to say , but during those twenty minutes of reflection a definite line of action had been forced upon him , and he meant to follow it to the only logical end .
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 19]: `` I am glad now that I mentioned my own little difficulty at Hereford , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 27]: `` Since alterations are to be the order of the day at Chester , will you allow me to provide another driver for the Mercury there ?
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 30]: You will retain the car , of course , but my place can be taken by a trustworthy man who understands it quite as well as I do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 15]: `` You mean that you are dropping out of the tour , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 23]: She shot one indignant glance at his impassive face , for he held in rigid control the fire that was consuming him .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 13]: `` Rather a sudden resolve on your part , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 15]: What earthly difference does the presence of another lady in our party make ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 13]: `` I have been thinking matters over , '' he said doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 11]: `` Would you mind reading my father 's letter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 16]: He held out the note received at the Green Dragon , but she ignored it .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 22]: `` I take it for granted that you have the best of reasons for wishing to go , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 12]: `` Please oblige me by reading it , '' he persisted .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 42]: Perhaps , despite all his self-restraint , some hint of the wild longing in his heart to tell her once and for all that no power under that of the Almighty should tear him from her side moved her to relent .
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 10]: She took the letter , and began to read .
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 15]: `` Why , '' she cried , `` this was written at Hereford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 7]: My father waited there all night .
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 17]: He left for town only a few minutes before I entered the hotel this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 35]: She read with puzzled brows , smiled a little at `` Your aunt is making a devil of a fuss , '' and passed quite unheeded the solitary `` F. '' in the signature .
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 13]: `` I think you ought to go to-day , '' she commented .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 14]: `` Not because of any argument advanced there , '' he growled passionately .
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 13]: `` But your aunt ... she is making a -- a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 9]: One has to conciliate aunts at times . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 10]: `` My aunt is really a most estimable person .
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 19]: I promise myself some amusement when she explains the origin of the ` fuss ' to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 5]: `` To me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 15]: Have I not your permission to bring her to see you in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 8]: `` Something was said about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 17]: `` May I add that I hope to make Mr. Vanrenen 's acquaintance on Tuesday ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 10]: She looked at him in rather a startled way .
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 12]: `` Are you going to call and see my father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 8]: `` But -- why , exactly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 14]: `` In the first place , to give him news of your well-being .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 11]: Letters are good , but the living messenger is better .
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 18]: Secondly , I want to find out just why he traveled from Paris to London yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 7]: The air was electric between them .
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 24]: Each knew that the other was striving to cloak emotions that threatened at any moment to throw off the last vestige of concealment .
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 17]: `` My father is a very clever man , Mr. Fitzroy , '' she said slowly .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 32]: `` If he did not choose to tell you why he did a thing , you could no more extract the information from him than from a bit of marble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 20]: `` He has one weak point , I am sure , '' and Medenham smiled confidently into her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 11]: `` I do not know it , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 13]: `` But I know it , though I have never seen him .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 8]: He is vulnerable through his daughter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 20]: Her cheeks flamed into scarlet , and her lips trembled , but she strove valiantly to govern her voice .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 24]: `` You must be very careful in anything you say about me , '' she said with a praiseworthy attempt at light raillery .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 38]: `` I shall be careful with the care of a man who has discovered some rare jewel , and fears lest each shadow should conceal an enemy till he has reached a place of utmost security . ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 13]: She sighed , and her glance wandered away into the sun-drowned valley .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 14]: `` Such fortresses are rare and hard to find , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 6]: `` Take my own case .
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 51]: I was really enjoying this pleasant tour of ours , yet it is broken in two , as it were , by some force beyond our control , and the severance makes itself felt here , in this secluded nook , a retreat not even marked on our self-drawn map .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 26]: Where could one be more secure -- as you put it -- less open to that surge of events that drives resistlessly into new seas ?
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 19]: I am something of a fatalist , Mr. Fitzroy , though the phrase sounds strange on my lips .
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 61]: Yet I feel that after to-morrow we shall not meet again so soon or so easily as you imagine , and -- if I may venture to advise one much more experienced than myself -- the way that leads least hopefully to my speedy introduction to your aunt is that you should see my father , before I rejoin him .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 46]: You know , I am sure , that I look on you rather as a friend than a mere -- a mere -- '' `` Slave , '' he suggested , trying to wrench some spark of humor out of the iron in their souls .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 6]: `` Do n't be stupid .
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 34]: I mean that you and I have met on an equality that I would deny to Simmonds or to any of the dozen chauffeurs we have employed in various parts of the world .
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 37]: And I want to warn you of this -- knowing my father as well as I do -- I am certain he has asked Mrs. Leland 's help for the undertaking that others have failed in .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 7]: I -- ca n't say more .
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 8]: I -- '' `` Cynthia , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 14]: I have been looking for you everywhere , '' cried a detested voice .
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 11]: `` Ah , there you are , Mr. Fitzroy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 7]: and Mrs. Devar bustled forward cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 10]: `` You have been to Hereford , I hear .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 7]: How kind and thoughtful of you !
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 8]: Were there any letters for me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 8]: `` Sorry , '' broke in Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 14]: `` I was so absorbed in my own news that I forget yours .
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 5]: Here is your letter .
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 24]: It is only from Monsieur Marigny , to blow both of us up , I suppose , for leaving him desolate last night .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 11]: But what do you think of _ my _ budget ?
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 30]: My father is in London ; Mrs. Leland , a friend of ours , joins us at Chester to-morrow ; and Fitzroy deserts us at the same time . ''
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 13]: Mrs. Devar 's eyes bulged and her lower jaw fell a little .
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 30]: She could hardly have exhibited more significant tokens of alarm had each of Cynthia 's unwelcome statements been punctuated by the crash of artillery fired in the garden beneath .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 31]: During a long night and a weary morning she had labored hard at the building of a new castle in Spain , and now it was dissipated at a breath .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 19]: Her sky had fallen ; she was plunged into chaos ; her brain reeled under these successive shocks .
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 32]: `` I -- do n't understand , '' she gasped , panting as if she had run across vast stretches of that vague `` everywhere '' during her quest of Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 6]: `` None of us understands .
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 9]: That is not the essence of the contract .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 20]: Anyhow , father is in England , Mrs. Leland will be in Chester , and Fitzroy is for London .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 10]: He is the only real hustler in the crowd .
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 16]: Unless my eyes deceived me , he brought his successor in the car from Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 19]: Really , Mr. Fitzroy , do n't you think you ought to skate by the next train ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 18]: `` I prefer waiting till to-morrow evening if you will permit it , '' he said humbly .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 13]: Cynthia was lashing herself into a very fair semblance of hot anger .
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 35]: She felt that she was trammeled in a net of deception , and , like the freedom-loving American that she was , she resented the toils none the less because their strands remained invisible .
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 31]: Seeing Medenham 's crestfallen aspect at her unjust charge with reference to Dale 's presence , she bit her lip with a laugh of annoyance and turned on Mrs. Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 34]: `` It seems to me , '' she cried , `` that Count Edouard Marigny has been taking an interest in me that is certainly not warranted by any encouragement on my part .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 29]: Open your letter , Mrs. Devar , and see if he , too , is on the London trail ... Ah , well -- perhaps I am mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 25]: I was so vexed for the moment that I thought he might have telegraphed to father when we did not turn up at Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 8]: Of course , that is sheer nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 7]: He could n't have done it .
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 17]: Father was in England before Monsieur Marigny was aware of our failure to connect with Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 37]: I 'm sure I do n't know what is vexing me , but something is , or somebody , and I want to quarrel with it , or him , or her , real bad . ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 16]: Without waiting for any opening of Marigny 's note she ran off to her room .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 28]: Medenham had turned to leave the hotel when he heard a gurgling cry : `` Mr. Fitzroy -- Lord Medenham -- what does it all mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 7]: Mrs. Devar 's distress was pitiable .
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 19]: Snatches of talk overheard in Paris and elsewhere warned her that Mrs. Leland would prove an unconquerable foe .
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 45]: She was miserably conscious that her own letter , posted overnight , would rise up in judgment against her , but already she had devised the plausible excuse that the very qualities which were excellent in a viscount were most dangerous in a chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 23]: Nevertheless , the letter , ill-advised though it might be , could not account for Peter Vanrenen 's sudden visit to England .
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 37]: She might torture her wits for a year without hitting on the truth , since the summoning of the millionaire to the rescue appeared to be the last thing Count Edouard Marigny would dream of doing .
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 46]: She actually held in her hand a summary of the telegrams he had dispatched from Bristol , but her mind was too confused to work in its customary grooves , and she blurted out Medenham 's title in a frantic attempt to gain his support .
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 35]: `` It means this , '' he said coolly , resolved to clear the ground thoroughly for Mrs. Devar 's benefit ; `` your French ally is resorting to the methods of the blackmailer .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 22]: If you are wise you will cut yourself entirely adrift from him , and warn your son to follow your example .
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 50]: I shall deal with Monsieur Marigny -- have no doubt on that score -- and if you wish me to forget certain discreditable incidents that have happened since we left London you will respect my earnest request that Miss Vanrenen shall not be told anything about me by you .
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 14]: I mean to choose my own time and place for the necessary explanations .
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 24]: They concern none but Miss Vanrenen and myself , in the first instance , and her father and mine , in the second .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 31]: I have observed that you can be a shrewd woman when it serves your interests , Mrs. Devar , and now you have an opportunity of adding discretion to shrewdness .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 10]: I take it you are asking for my advice .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 8]: It is simple and to the point .
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 18]: Enjoy yourself , cease acting as a matrimonial agent , and leave the rest to me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 30]: The residents in the hotel were gathering in the veranda , as the luncheon hour was approaching , so Mrs. Devar could not press him to be more explicit .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 13]: In the privacy of her own room she read Marigny 's letter .
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 45]: Then she learnt why Cynthia 's father had hurried across the Channel , for the Frenchman had not scrupled to warn him that his presence was imperative if he would save his daughter from a rogue who had replaced the confidential Simmonds as chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 10]: Forthwith , Mrs. Devar became more dazed than ever .
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 25]: She felt that she must confide in someone , so she wrote a full account of events at Symon 's Yat to her son .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 11]: It was the worst possible thing she could have done .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 28]: Unconsciously -- for she was now anxious to help instead of hindering Medenham 's wooing -- some of the gall in her nature distilled itself into words .
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 16]: She dwelt on the river episode with all the sly rancor of the inveterate scandalmonger .
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 34]: She was really striving to depict her own confusion of ideas when stunned by the discovery of Medenham 's position , but she only succeeded in stringing together a series of ill-natured innuendoes .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 24]: Sandwiched between each paragraph of the story were the true gossip 's catchwords -- thus : `` What was I to think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 10]: `` What would people say if they knew ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 21]: `` My dear , just picture your mother 's predicament when midnight struck , and there was no news ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 17]: `` Of course , one makes allowances for an American girl , '' and the rest .
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 37]: Though this soured woman was a ready letter-writer , she was no reader , or in days to come she might have parodied Pope 's `` Epistle to Dr. Arbuthnot '' : Why did I write ?
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 10]: What sin to me unknown Dipped me in ink ?
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 9]: -- my parents ' , or my own ?
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 15]: Not content with her outpouring to Devar she dashed off a warning to Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 19]: She imagined that the Frenchman would grin at his broken fortunes , and look about for another heiress !
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 60]: And so , abandoning a meal to the fever of scribbling , she packed more mischief into an hour than any elderly marriage-broker in Europe that day , and waddled off to the letterbox with a sense of consolation , strong in the belief that the morrow would bring telegrams to guide her in the fray with Mrs. Leland .
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 31]: Medenham sent a short note to his father , saying that he would reach London about midnight next day and asking him to invite Aunt Susan to lunch on Tuesday .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 51]: Then he waited in vain for sight of Cynthia until , driven to extremes by tea-time , he got one of the maids to take her a verbal message , in which he stated that the climb to the summit of the Yat could be made in half an hour .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 5]: The reply was deadening .
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 8]: `` Miss Vanrenen says she is busy .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 25]: She does not intend to leave the hotel to-day ; and will you please have the car ready at eight o'clock to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 19]: Then Medenham smiled ferociously , for he had just ascertained that the local telegraph office opened at eight .
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 32]: `` Kindly tell Miss Vanrenen that we had better make a start some few minutes earlier , because we have a long day 's run before us , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 45]: And he hummed a verse of `` Young Lochinvar '' as he moved away , thereby provoking the maid-servant to an expression of opinion that some folk thought a lot of themselves -- but as for London shuffers and their manners -- well there !
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 38]: CHAPTER XII MASQUES , ANCIENT AND MODERN The clouds did not lift until Cynthia was standing in front of that remarkable Map of the World which reposes behind oaken doors in the south aisle of Hereford Cathedral .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 22]: During the run from Symon 's Yat , not even a glorious sun could dispel the vapors of that unfortunate Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 61]: Cynthia had smiled a `` Good-morning '' when she entered the car , but beyond one quick glance around to see if the deputy chauffeur was in attendance -- which Medenham took care he should not be -- she gave no visible sign of yesterday 's troubles , though her self-contained manner showed that they were present in her thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 25]: Mrs. Devar tried to be gracious , and only succeeded in being stilted , for the shadow of impending disaster lay black upon her .
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 24]: Medenham 's only thrill came when Cynthia asked for letters or telegrams at the Green Dragon , and was told there were none .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 17]: Evidently , Peter Vanrenen was not a man to create a mountain out of a molehill .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 22]: Mrs. Leland might be trusted to smooth away difficulties ; perhaps he meant to await her report confidently and in silence .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 35]: But that square of crinkled vellum on which Richard of Holdingham and Lafford had charted this strange old world of ours as it appeared during the thirteenth century helped to blow away the mists .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 44]: `` I never knew before that the Garden of Eden was inside the Arctic Circle , '' said the girl , gazing awe-stricken at the symbolic drawings of the eating of the forbidden fruit and the expulsion of Adam and Eve from Paradise .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 21]: `` No later than yesterday I fancied it might have been situated in the Wye Valley , '' commented Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 12]: The cast was skillful , but the fish did not rise .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 18]: Instead , Cynthia bent nearer to look at Lot 's wife , placed _ in situ _ .
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 15]: `` Too bad there is no word about America , '' she said irrelevantly .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 16]: `` Oh , even at that date the United States were on the other side .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 10]: You see , Richard was a person of intelligence .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 25]: He anticipated Galileo by making the earth round , so he would surely get ahead of Columbus in guessing at a New World . ''
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 21]: They were the only tourists in the cathedral at that early hour , so the attendant verger tolerated this flippancy .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 33]: `` In the left-hand corner , '' he recited , `` you see Augustus C√¶sar delivering orders for a survey of the world to the philosophers Nichodoxus , Theodotus , and Polictitus .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 50]: Near the center you have the Labyrinth of Crete , the Pyramids of Egypt , the House of Bondage , the Jews worshiping the Golden Calf -- '' `` Ah , what a pity we left Mrs. Devar at the post-office -- how she would have appreciated this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 3]: murmured Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 8]: Still Cynthia refused to take the fly .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 8]: `` May we visit the library ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 14]: she asked , dazzling the verger with a smile in her best manner .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 20]: `` I have heard so much about the books in chains , and the Four Gospels in Anglo-Saxon characters .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 10]: Is the volume really a thousand years old ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 59]: From the Cathedral they wandered into the beautiful grounds of the Bishop 's Palace , where a brass plate , set in a boundary wall , states in equivocal phrase that `` Nell Gwynne , Founder of Chelsea Hospital , and Mother of the first Duke of St. Albans , '' was born near the spot thus marked .
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 26]: Each remembered the irresponsible chatter of Saturday , but neither alluded to it , nor did Medenham offer to lead Cynthia to Garrick 's birthplace .
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 30]: Not forty-eight hours , but long years , as measured by the seeming trivialities that go to make or mar existence , spanned the interval between Bristol and Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 55]: They chafed against the bonds of steel that yet sundered them ; they resented the silent edict that aimed at parting them ; by a hundred little artifices each made clear to the other that the coming separation was distasteful , while an eager interest in the commonplace supplied sure index of their embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 39]: And so , almost as a duty , the West Front , the North Porch , the Close , the Green , the Wye Bridge , were duly snap-shotted and recorded in a little book that Cynthia carried .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 12]: -LSB- Illustration : Fitzroy poses as the first Earl of Chepstow .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 28]: _ Page 263 _ -RSB- Once , while she was making a note , Medenham held the camera , and happened to watch her as she wrote .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 25]: At the top of a page he saw `` Film 6 , No. 5 : Fitzroy poses as the first Earl of Chepstow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 13]: Cynthia 's left hand hid the entry just a second too late .
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 13]: `` I could n't help seeing that , '' he said innocently .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 24]: `` If you will give me a print , I shall have it framed and place it among the other family portraits . ''
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 23]: `` I really meant to present you with an album containing all the pictures which turn out well , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 12]: `` You have not changed your mind , I hope ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 12]: `` N -- no , but there will be so few .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 11]: I was rather lazy during the first two days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 15]: `` You can trust me to fill in the gaps with exceeding accuracy . ''
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 16]: `` Oh , do n't let us talk as if we would never meet again .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 9]: The world is small -- to motorists . ''
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 14]: `` I had the exact contrary in mind , '' he said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 34]: `` If we parted to-day , and did not meet for twenty years , each of us might well be doubtful as to what did or did not happen last Friday or Saturday .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 8]: But association strengthens and confirms such recollections .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 17]: I often think that memories held in common are the most solid foundation of friendship . ''
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 18]: `` You do n't believe , then , in love at first sight , '' she ventured .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 11]: `` Let me be dumb rather than so misunderstood ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 4]: Cynthia breathed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 29]: She was profoundly conscious of an escape wholly due to his forbearance , but she was terrified at finding that her thankfulness was of a very doubtful quality .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 21]: She knew now that this man loved her , and the knowledge was at once an ecstasy and a torture .
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 23]: And how wise he was , how considerate , how worthy of the treasure that her overflowing heart would heap on him !
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 6]: But it could not be .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 38]: She dared not face her father , her relatives , her host of friends , and confess with proud humility that she had found her mate in some unknown Englishman , the hired driver of a motor-car .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 25]: At any rate , in that moment of exquisite agony , Cynthia did not know what she might dare when put to the test .
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 21]: Her lips parted , her eyes glistened , and she turned aside to gaze blindly at the distant Welsh hills .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 40]: `` If we do n't hurry , '' she said with the slowness of desperation , `` we shall never complete our programme by nightfall ... And we must not forget that Mrs. Leland awaits us at Chester . ''
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 33]: `` To-night I shall realize the feelings of Charles the First when he witnessed the defeat of his troops at the battle of Rowton Moor , '' was Medenham 's savage growl .
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 23]: Hardly aware of her own words , Cynthia murmured : `` Though defeated , the poor king did not lose hope . ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 12]: `` No : the Stuarts ' only virtue was their stubbornness .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 10]: By the way , I am a Stuart . ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 21]: `` Evidently that is why you are flying from Chester , '' she contrived to say with a little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 13]: `` I pin my faith in the Restoration , '' he retorted .
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 7]: `` It is a fair parallel .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 26]: It took Charles twenty years to reach Rowton Moor , but the modern clock moves quicker , for I am there in five days . ''
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 25]: `` I am no good at dates -- '' she began , but Mrs. Devar discovered them from afar , and fluttered a telegram .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 48]: They hastened to her -- Cynthia flushed at the thought that she might be recalled to London -- which she would not regret , since a visit to the dentist to-day is better than the toothache all next week -- and Medenham steeled himself against imminent unmasking .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 11]: But Mrs. Devar 's main business in life was self .
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 12]: `` I have just heard from James , '' she cooed .
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 19]: `` He promised to run up to Shrewsbury to-day , but finds he can not spare the time .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 24]: Count Edouard told him that Mr. Vanrenen was in town , and he regrets he was unable to call before he left . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 6]: `` Before who left ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 3]: demanded Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 7]: `` Your father , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 6]: `` Left for where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 10]: Mrs. Devar screwed her eyes at the pink slip .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 7]: `` That is all it says .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 6]: Just ` left ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 13]: `` That does n't sound right , anyhow , '' laughed Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 10]: `` Oh , but this is too ridiculous ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 6]: and Cynthia 's foot stamped .
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 15]: `` I have never before known my father behave in this Jack-in-the-Box fashion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 14]: `` Mrs. Leland will clear up the whole mystery , '' volunteered Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 8]: `` But what mystery is there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 14]: purred Mrs. Devar , blinking first at one , then at the other .
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 7]: She bent over the telegram again .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 27]: `` James sent this message from the West Strand at 9.30 a.m. Perhaps he had just heard of Mr. Vanrenen 's departure , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 34]: Judging from Cynthia 's occasional references to her father 's character and associates , Medenham fancied it was much more likely that the American railway magnate had merely refused to meet Captain Devar .
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 6]: But therein he was mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 58]: At the very hour that the three were settling themselves in the Mercury before taking the road to Leominster , Mr. Vanrenen , driven by a perturbed but silent Simmonds , stopped the car on the outskirts of Whitchurch and asked an intelligent-looking boy if he had noticed the passing of an automobile numbered X L 4000 .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 13]: `` I s ` pose you mean a motor-car , sir ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 4]: said the boy .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 53]: Vanrenen , a tall man , thin , close-lipped , with high cheekbones , and long nose , a man utterly unlike his daughter save for the wide-open , all-seeing eyes , smiled at the na√Øve correction ; with that smile some enchanter 's wand mirrored Cynthia in her father 's face .
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 45]: Even Simmonds , who had seen no semblance of a smile in the features of the chilly , skeptical man by whom he was dragged out of bed at an unearthly hour in the morning at Bristol , witnessed the alchemy , and marveled .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 17]: `` Yes , sir , rather , '' continued the boy , brimming over with enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 16]: `` The gentleman went along the Hereford Road , he did , yesterday mornin ' .
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 24]: He kem back , too , wiv a shuffer , an ' he 's a-stayin ' at the Symon 's Yat Hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 26]: Peter Vanrenen frowned , and Cynthia vanished , to be replaced by the Wall Street speculator who had `` made a pyramid in Milwaukees . ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 8]: Whence , then , had Cynthia telephoned ?
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 38]: Of course , his alert mind hit on a missed mail as the genesis of the run to Hereford early on Sunday , but he asked himself why he had not been told of a changed address .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 54]: He could not guess that Cynthia would have mentioned the fact had she spoken to him , but in the flurry and surprise of hearing that he was not in the hotel she forgot to tell the attendant who took her message that she was at Symon 's Yat and not at Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 9]: `` Are you sure about the car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 14]: he said , rendered somewhat skeptical by the boy 's overfullness of knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 5]: `` Yes , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 14]: Did n't me an ' Dick Davies watch for it all chapel-time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 4]: `` But why ?
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 8]: -- for that car in particular ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 37]: `` The gentleman bust his tire , an ' we watched him mendin ' it , an ' he set us a sum , an ' promised us a bob each if we did it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 10]: `` Meanwhile he went to Hereford and back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 10]: `` I s ` pose so , sir . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 32]: Peter Vanrenen 's attention was held by that guarded answer , and , being an American , he was ever ready to absorb information , especially in matters appertaining to figures .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 7]: `` What was the sum ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 41]: To his very keen annoyance he found that he could not determine straight off how long two men take to mow a field of grass , which one of them could cut in four days and the other in three .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 22]: Indeed , he almost caught himself saying `` three days and a half , '' but stopped short of that folly .
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 17]: `` About a day and three-quarters , '' he essayed , before the silence grew irksome .
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 5]: `` Wrong , sir .
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 7]: Is it worth a bob ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 6]: and the urchin grinned delightfully .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 41]: `` A day an ' five-sevenths , ` coss one man can do one quarter in a day , and t ` other man a third , which is seven-twelfths , leavin ' five-twelfths to be done next day . ''
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 22]: Though the millionaire financier was nettled , he did not show it , but paid the shilling with apparent good grace .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 16]: `` Did _ you _ find that out -- or was it Dick Davies ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 14]: `` Both of us , sir , wiv ' a foot rule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 17]: `` And how far is the Symon 's Yat Hotel , measured by that rule ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 13]: `` Half a mile , sir , down that there lane . ''
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 13]: While traveling slowly in the narrow way , Simmonds turned his head .
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 25]: `` It does n't follow that because the boy saw Viscount Medenham yesterday his lordship is here now , sir , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 17]: `` You just do as you are told and pass no remarks , '' snapped Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 23]: If the head of the house of Vanrenen were judged merely by that somewhat unworthy retort he would not be judged fairly .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 52]: He was tired physically , worried mentally ; he had been brought from Paris at an awkward moment ; he was naturally devoted to his daughter ; he believed that Medenham was an unmitigated scamp and Simmonds his tool ; and his failure to solve Medenham 's arithmetical problem still rankled .
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 13]: These considerations , among others , may be pleaded in his behalf .
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 31]: But , if Simmonds , who had stood on Spion Kop , refused to be browbeaten by a British earl , he certainly would not grovel before an American plutocrat .
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 12]: He had endured a good deal since five o'clock that morning .
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 57]: He told his tale honestly and fully ; he even sympathized with a father 's distress , though assured in his own mind that it was wholly unwarranted ; he was genuinely sorry on hearing that Mr. Vanrenen had been searching the many hotels of Bristol for two hours before he came to the right one .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 8]: But to be treated like a serf ?
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 9]: -- no , not if Simmonds knew it !
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 7]: The car stopped with a jerk .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 5]: Out leaped the driver .
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 24]: `` Now you can walk to the hotel , '' he said , though he distinguished the hotel by an utterly inappropriate adjective .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 24]: The more sudden the crisis the more prepared was Vanrenen -- that was his noted characteristic , whether dealing with men or money .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 9]: `` What has bitten _ you _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 4]: he demanded calmly .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 22]: `` You must find somebody else to do your detective work , that is all , '' came the stolid answer .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 8]: `` Do n't be a mule . ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 7]: `` I 'm not a mule .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 12]: You 're makin ' a d -- d row about nothing .
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 41]: Viscount Medenham is a gentleman to his finger tips , and if you were one you 'd know that he would n't hurt a hair of Miss Vanrenen 's head , or any lady 's , for that matter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 26]: `` Where my daughter is concerned I am not a gentleman , or a viscount , or a person who makes d -- d rows .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 28]: I am just a father -- a plain , simple father -- who thinks more of his girl than of any other object in this wide world .
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 10]: If I have hurt your feelings I am sorry .
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 11]: If I am altogether mistaken I 'll apologize and pay .
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 5]: I 'm paying now .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 21]: This trip will probably cost me fifty thousand dollars that I would have scooped in were I in Paris to-morrow .
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 20]: Your game is to attend to the benzine buzz part of the contract and leave the rest to me .
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 8]: Shove ahead , and step lively ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 34]: To his lasting credit , Simmonds obeyed : but the row had cleared the air ; Vanrenen liked the man , and felt now that his original estimate of his worth was justified .
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 17]: At the hotel , of course , he had much more to learn than he expected .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 33]: Oddly enough , the praises showered on `` Fitzroy '' confirmed him in the opinion that Cynthia was the victim of a clever knave , be he titled aristocrat or mere adventurer .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 19]: For the first time , too , he began to suspect Mrs. Devar of complicity in the plot !
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 21]: A nice kind of chaperon she must be to let his girl go boating with a chauffeur on the Wye !
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 31]: And her Sunday 's illness was a palpable pretense -- an arranged affair , no doubt , to permit more boating and dallying in this fairyland of forest and river .
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 10]: What thanks he owed to that Frenchman , Marigny !
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 16]: Indeed , it was easy to hoodwink this hard-headed man in aught that affected Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 52]: Count Edouard displayed a good deal of tact when he called at the Savoy Hotel late the previous night , but his obvious relief at finding Vanrenen in London had induced the latter to depart for Bristol by a midnight train rather than trust wholly to Mrs. Leland 's leisured strategy .
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 13]: He did not go straight to Hereford for the best of reasons .
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 24]: He had told Cynthia of Mrs. Leland 's coming , and had heard of if not from her in response to his letter .
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 48]: If he rushed off now to intercept the motorists at Hereford he would defeat the very purpose he had in view , which was to interpose an effectual shield between the scoundrelly lordling and his prey , while avoiding any risk of hurting his daughter 's feelings .
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 9]: Moreover , he was eminently a just man .
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 24]: Hearing from Marigny that Simmonds , the original cause of all the trouble , was skulking at Bristol , to Bristol he went .
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 31]: From that starting-point , with his knowledge of Cynthia 's probable route , he could surely pick up traces of the predatory car at most towns through which it passed .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 32]: Moreover , he could choose his own time for joining the party in front , which by this time he was fully resolved on , either at Chester or farther north .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 15]: Transcending these minor features of a disturbing affair was his self-confessed fear of Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 21]: In the unfathomed deeps of a father 's love for such a daughter there is ever an element of fear .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 18]: Not for all his wealth would Vanrenen cast a shadow on the unsullied intimacy of their affection .
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 58]: Therefore , he would be wary , circumspect , ready to accept as most credible theories which he would scout in any other conditions , quick to discern the truth , slow to point out wherein an inexperienced girl had erred , but merciless to the fortune-hunter who had so jeopardized Cynthia 's happiness and his own .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 34]: Hence , his appearance at the Symon 's Yat Hotel seemed to have no more serious import than a father 's wish to delight his daughter by an unexpected participation in her holiday .
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 14]: No secret had been made as to the Mercury 's halting-place that day .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 27]: Cynthia herself had written the address in the hotel register , adding a request that letters , if any , were to be forwarded to Windermere .
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 18]: By chance , the smiling landlady 's curiosity as to `` Fitzroy '' raised a new specter .
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 29]: `` He must be a gentleman , '' she said , `` because he belongs to the Thames Rowing Club ; he also spoke and acted like one .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 8]: Why did he employ an assistant chauffeur ?
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 6]: That is most unusual . ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 27]: Vanrenen could only explain that arrangements for the tour were made during his absence in France , so he was not fully posted as to details .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 54]: `` Oh , they did not intend to remain here on Saturday , but Miss Vanrenen liked the place , and seemed to be rather taken with the hotel -- '' whereat the millionaire nodded his complete agreement -- `` so Mr. Fitzroy telegraphed for a man named Dale to come to Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 16]: There was some misunderstanding , however , and Dale only arrived yesterday in the car .
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 16]: He left by an early train this morning , after doing the garage work . ''
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 20]: Simmonds , candor itself about Medenham , had said no word of the Earl of Fairholme or of Dale .
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 61]: Marigny , of course , was silent as to the Earl , since it might have ruined his last faint hope of success had the two perplexed fathers met ; Simmonds 's recent outburst opposed an effectual bar to farther questioning ; so Vanrenen was free to deduce all sorts of possibilities from the existence of yet another villainous chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 12]: Unhappily , he availed himself of the opportunity to the full .
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 20]: The fair countryside and the good food of the March counties made little or no appeal to him thenceforth .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 58]: He pined to be in Chester , yet restrained the impulse that urged a frenzied scurry to the Banks of the Dee , for he was adamant in his resolve not to seem to have pursued Cynthia , but rather to have joined her as the outcome of a mere whim after she had met Mrs. Leland .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 15]: The Mercury arrived at Ludlow long before Vanrenen crossed the Wye Bridge at Hereford .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 54]: Medenham stopped the car at `` The Feathers , '' that famous magpie among British Inns , where Cynthia admired and photographed some excellent woodcarving , and saw an iron-studded front door which has shut out revellers and the night on each alternate round of the clock since 1609 , if not longer .
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 44]: If they hurried over luncheon they were content to dawdle in the picturesque streets , and Cynthia was reluctant to leave the fine old castle , in which Milton 's `` Masque of Comus '' was first played on Michaelmas night of 1634 .
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 76]: At first , she yielded only to the flood of memories pent in every American brain when the citizen of the New World stands in one of these treasure-houses of history and feels the passing of its dim pageants ; when they stood together in the ruined banqueting hall , Medenham gave play to his imagination , and strove to reconstruct a scene once spread before the bright eyes of a maiden long since dead .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 62]: `` You will please regard yourself , '' he said , `` as the Lady Alice Egerton , daughter of the Earl of Bridgwater , Lord President of the Marches of Wales , who , with her two brothers , was benighted in the Forest of Heywood while riding to Ludlow to witness her father 's installation in his high office .
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 29]: Milton was told of her adventures by Henry Lawes , the musician , and he wrote the ` Masque of Comus ' to delight her and her friends .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 8]: Have you read ` Comus ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 31]: `` No , '' said Cynthia , almost timidly , for she was beginning to fear this masterful man whose enthusiasm caught her to his very soul at such moments .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 7]: `` Ah , but you shall .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 13]: It ranks high among the miracles of English poetry wrought by Milton .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 53]: Many a mile from Ludlow have I called to mind one of its incomparable passages : A thousand phantasies Begin to throng into my memory -- Of calling shapes , and beckoning shadows dire , And airy tongues that syllable men 's names On sands , and shores , and desert wildernesses .
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 36]: And now you , the heroine of the masque , must try to imagine that you are lost in a wild wood represented by a carpet spread here , in the center of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 19]: Seated there on a dais , is your father the Earl , surrounded by his officers and retainers .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 50]: Near you are your brothers , Lord Brackley and Thomas Egerton , so blinded by sprites that they can not see you , though keen enough to note the bright eyes and flushed cheeks of other ladies of high degree bidden to Ludlow from neighboring shires for the merry-making .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 16]: And mark you , this is no rude gathering of unlettered squires and rough men-at-arms .
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 46]: How is it possible that an uncultured throng should listen rapturously to the noblest performance of the kind that exists in any language , wherein each speech is a majestic soliloquy , eloquent , sublime , with an uncloying word-music acclaimed by three centuries ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 46]: The sheer wonder in Cynthia 's face warned him that this brief excursion into the pages of Macaulay had better cease , so he focused his thoughts on the actual representation of the masque in which he had taken part ten years ago at Fairholme .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 54]: `` I must ask you to concede that the lords and ladies , the civic dignitaries and their wives , for whose amusement Milton spread the pinions of his genius , were far better equipped to understand his lyric flights than any similar assemblage that could be collected haphazard in some modern castle .
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 8]: They did not pretend -- they knew .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 24]: Even you , Lady Alice , could frame a neat verse in Latin and cap some pleasant jest with a line from Homer .
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 60]: When Milton dreamed aloud of bathing in the Elysian dew of the rainbow , of inhaling the scents of nard and cassia , ` which the musky wings of the Zepyhr scatter through the cedared alleys of the Hesperides , ' they followed each turn and swoop of his fancy with an active sense of its truth and beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 6]: And what a brilliant company !
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 29]: How the red flare of torch and cresset would flicker on the sheen of silk , the luster of velvet , the polished brightness of morion and spear .
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 28]: I think I can see those gallant gentlemen and fine ladies grouped round the players who told of the strange pranks played by the God of Mirth .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 50]: Perhaps that same fair Alice , who supplied the motive of the masque as well as its leading lady , may be linked with you by stronger ties than those of mere feminine grace -- '' Cynthia did not blush : she grew white , but shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 11]: `` You can not tell , '' he said . ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 44]: ` Comus ' was played in Ludlow only fourteen years after the landing of the Pilgrim Fathers in New England , and I would remind you that we stocked the new nation in the west with some of the bluest blood in Britain .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 50]: Even in this hall there were Puritans whose ascetic tastes disapproved of Milton 's imageries , of children play-acting , of the brave show made by the gentry -- '' `` My mother 's people lived in Pennsylvania for generations , '' she broke in with a strange wistfulness .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 11]: `` I knew it , '' he cried in triumph .
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 33]: `` Tell me the names of the first-nighters at the Milton Theater , Ludlow , on that autumn evening in 1634 , and warrant me to find you an authentic ancestor . ''
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 8]: Cynthia bent a puzzled brow at him .
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 20]: `` After this , I shall apply myself to ` Comus ' with added comprehension , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 45]: `` But -- you take my breath away ; have you , then , delved so deep in the mine of English history that you can people ` most every ruined pile in Britain with the men and women of the dead years ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 21]: He laughed , and colored a little , with true British confusion at having been caught in an extravagant mood .
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 12]: `` There you lay bare the mummer , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 21]: `` What clever fellows actors would be if they grasped the underlying realities of all the fine words they mouth !
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 19]: No ; I quote ` Comus ' only because on one half-forgotten occasion I played in it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 7]: The prompt question took him unaware .
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 8]: `` At Fairholme , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 7]: `` Is that another castle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 9]: `` No -- merely a Georgian residence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 17]: `` I seem to have heard of it -- somewhere -- I ca n't remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 23]: He remembered quite well -- was not Mrs. Devar , student of Burke , sitting in the car at the castle gate ?
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 12]: `` Oh , we must hurry , '' he said shamefacedly .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 39]: `` I have kept you here too long , for we have yet to trace huge forests and unharbour 'd heaths , Infamous hills and sandy perilous wilds , before we see Chester -- and Mrs. Leland . ''
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 36]: With that the bubble was pricked , and staid Ludlow became a busy market-town again , its streets blocked by the barrows of hucksters and farmers ' carts , its converging roads thronged with cattle .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 36]: At Shrewsbury Medenham was vouchsafed a gleam of frosty humor by Mrs. Devar 's anxiety lest her son might have obeyed her earlier injunctions , and kept tryst at `` The Raven '' after all .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 6]: That trivial diversion soon passed .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 50]: He hoped that Cynthia would share the front seat with him in the final run to Chester ; but she remained tucked up in the tonneau , and the dread that kept her there was bitter-sweet to him , since it betrayed her increasing lack of confidence in herself .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 40]: The rendezvous was at the Grosvenor Hotel , and Medenham had made up his mind how to act long before the red towers of Chester Cathedral glowed above the city 's haze in the fire of a magnificent sunset .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 19]: Dale was waiting on the pavement when the Mercury drew up at the galleried entrance to the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 4]: Medenham leaped down .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 15]: `` Good-by , Miss Vanrenen , '' he said , holding out his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 15]: `` I can catch an early train to town by hurrying away at once .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 10]: This is Dale , who will take my place .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 16]: He is thoroughly reliable , and an even more careful driver than I am . ''
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 10]: `` Are you really going -- like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 13]: faltered Cynthia , and her face blanched at the suddenness of it .
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 15]: I shall have the pleasure of seeing you in London when you return . ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 8]: Their hands met in a firm clasp .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 16]: Mrs. Devar , too flustered at first to gasp more than an `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 13]: of astonishment , leaned forward and shook his hand with marked cordiality .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 18]: `` You must tell Dale to take great care of us , '' she said , knowingly .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 38]: `` I think he realizes the exceeding trust I repose in him , '' he said , but the accompanying smile was meant for Cynthia , and she read into it a farewell that presaged many things .
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 6]: He disappeared without another word .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 38]: When a slim , elegantly-gowned lady had hastened to the door from the drawing-room , whence she was summoned by a page , she found two dust-covered figures in the act of alighting from a well-appointed car .
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 12]: Her next glance was at the solemn jowl of the chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 8]: `` Cynthia , my darling girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 8]: she cried , with arms thrown wide .
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 36]: There could be no doubting the heartiness of the greeting , and in that motherly embrace Cynthia felt a repose , a security , that she had been willfully skeptical of during many weary hours .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 25]: But polite usage called for an introduction , and Mrs. Leland and Mrs. Devar eyed each other warily , with the smiles of convention .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 6]: Mrs. Leland glanced at Dale .
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 7]: `` And who is this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 16]: she asked , seizing the opportunity to settle a point that was perplexing her strangely .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 21]: `` Our chauffeur , '' said Cynthia , and a glint of fun showed through the wanness of her cheeks .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 16]: `` But not -- not -- '' Even smooth-tongued Mrs. Leland was at a loss .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 11]: `` Not Fitzroy , who left us a minute ago .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 7]: This man 's name is Dale .
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 20]: One wonders , though , how you knew -- why you doubted , '' cried Cynthia in sharp discernment .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 12]: `` Pray why did Fitzroy leave you a minute ago ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 11]: was all that the other woman could find to say .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 8]: `` He had to return to London .
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 13]: But , there -- it is I who ought to ask questions .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 5]: Let us go inside .
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 30]: I want to get some of the grit out of my eyes and hair ; then I shall become an absolute mark of interrogation -- so I warn you .
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 26]: Of course , I am delighted to see you ; but queer things have happened , and I am pining to have them cleared up .
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 7]: When did you see father last ?
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 7]: Is he still in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 21]: Mrs. Leland answered , with freer speech now , but in her heart she was saddened by Medenham 's duplicity .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 22]: Six months earlier he and the Earl had dined at the villa she was occupying at San Remo for the winter .
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 20]: She then took a great liking to him on account of his shy and reticent but singularly pleasing manners .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 19]: She was prepared to laugh at the present escapade when she had discussed it with him that night .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 9]: Now he had fled , doubtless through fear .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 4]: That was bad .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 6]: That looked ugly and mean .
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 14]: Most certainly Peter Vanrenen had acted rightly in bringing her post-haste from Trouville .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 13]: She must use all her skill if mischief were to be avoided .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 14]: CHAPTER XIII WHEREIN WRATH BEGUILES GOOD JUDGMENT `` Good-mornin ' , George . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 6]: `` Good-morning , dad . ''
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 8]: `` Enjoy your run to Hereford ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 3]: `` Immensely .
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 4]: Did you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 7]: `` It was not so bad .
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 32]: Rather tiresome , you know , travelin ' alone , but on the return journey I fell in with a decent sort of Frenchman who helped to pass the time . ''
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 8]: `` Monsieur Marigny , in fact ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 10]: `` Ah , you know him , of course .
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 5]: I had forgotten . ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 6]: `` I have met him .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 13]: He is not the kind of person I care to know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 25]: The Earl selected an egg , tapped it , and asked his son what he thought of the crops -- did they want rain ?
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 37]: The two were breakfasting alone -- at the moment there was not even a man-servant in the room -- but Lord Fairholme had long ago established the golden rule that controversial topics were taboo during meals .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 10]: Medenham laughed outright at the sudden change of topic .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 39]: He remembered that Dale was sent to bed in the Green Dragon Hotel at eight o'clock , and he had not the least doubt that his father 's ukase was really a dodge to secure an undisturbed dinner .
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 15]: But he was under no delusions because of this placid meeting in the breakfast-room .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 7]: There was thunder in the air .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 8]: Tomkinson had warned him of it overnight .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 28]: `` There 's bin ructions while you were away , my lord , '' the butler had whispered , waylaying him in the hall just before midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 32]: `` Lady St. Maur has upset the Earl somethink dreadful ; '' and Medenham had growled in reply : `` Her ladyship will lunch here at one o'clock to-morrow , Tomkinson .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 21]: Have an ambulance ready at two , for she will be in little pieces before I have done with her .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 8]: The mangling will be somethink orful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 12]: `` But what has become of Dale , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 8]: went on Tomkinson in a hushed voice .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 3]: `` Dale ?
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 5]: He is all right .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 2]: Why ?
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 11]: Is _ he _ in the soup , too ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 6]: `` No , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 25]: I 've heard nothink of that , but he sent me a wire from Bristol -- '' `` A telegram -- about what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 6]: `` About a horse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 11]: `` Oh , the deuce take you and your horses .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 19]: By the way , that reminds me -- you gave me a rotten tip for the Derby . ''
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 11]: `` It was a false run race , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 29]: The favorite was swep ' off his feet at Tattenham Corner , and could n't get into his stride again till the field was opposite Langland 's Stands .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 13]: After that -- '' `` After that I 'm going to bed .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 7]: But I forgive you , Tomkinson .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 8]: You put up a ripping good lunch .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 11]: You 're a far better butler than a tipster . ''
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 19]: This brief conversation had illumined at least one dubious page in the records of the past few days .
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 34]: Medenham realized now that his aunt had emptied the vials of her wrath on Mrs. Devar , but , that lady being absent in body , the Earl had received the full dose .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 26]: It indicated somewhat the line he should follow when , breakfast ended , his father suggested that they should smoke a cigarette in the library .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 22]: Once there , and the door closed , the Earl established himself on the hearth-rug with his back to the fireplace .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 43]: It was high summer , and the lazy London heat crept in through the open windows ; but the hearth-rug constituted a throne , a seat of Solomon ; had his lordship stood anywhere else he would have felt lacking in authority .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 36]: `` Now , George , my boy , tell me all about it , '' he said , with a genially paternal air that lent itself admirably to the discussion of a youngster 's transgressions .
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 12]: Medenham had a sense of humor denied to his well-meaning sire .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 11]: He recalled the last time he had heard those words .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 45]: He and another sprig of nobility had come up to London from Winchester without leave in order to attend a famous glove contest between heavyweights , and there had been wigs on the green before an irate head-master would even deign to flog them .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 12]: That had happened twelve years ago , almost to a day .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 29]: Since then he had fought through a great war , had circled the globe , had sought the wild places of earth and its monsters in their lairs .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 13]: He knew men and matters as his father had never known them .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 27]: A Prime Minister had urged him to adopt a political career , and had virtually promised him a colonial under-secretaryship as soon as he entered parliament .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 36]: He held the D.S.O. , had been thanked by the Royal Geographical Society for a paper on Kilimanjaro , and cordially invited by the Foreign Office to send in any further notes in his possession .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 36]: Months later , he heard that Sir Somebody Something was deeply interested in his comments on the activity of a certain Great Power in the neighborhood of Britain 's chief coaling-stations in the Indian Ocean .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 42]: The absurdity of a family conclave in which he should again be treated as a small boy , and admonished to apologize and be flogged , while it brought a smile to his lips , banished any notion of angry remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 30]: `` By ` all about it ' I suppose you mean that you wish to hear what I have been doing since last Wednesday , '' he said pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 11]: `` Well , dad , I have obeyed your orders .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 13]: You asked me to find a wife worthy to reign at Fairholme .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 5]: I have succeeded . ''
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 15]: `` You do n't mean to say you have _ married _ her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 20]: shouted the Earl , in a purple upheaval of rage whose lightning-like abruptness was not its least amazing feature .
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 8]: Certainly Medenham was taken aback by it .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 18]: Indeed , he was almost alarmed , though he had no knowledge of apoplexy in the family .
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 15]: `` I have not even asked the lady yet , '' he said quietly .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 34]: `` I hope -- I think -- that the idea will not be disagreeable to her ; but a future Countess of Fairholme is not to be carried by storm in that fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 17]: We must get to know her people -- '' `` D -- n her people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 6]: broke in the older man .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 21]: `` Have you taken leave of your wits , George , to stand there and talk such infernal nonsense ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 8]: `` Steady , dad , steady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 26]: and the quiet voice grew still more calm , though the forehead wrinkled a little , and there was an ominous tightening of the lips .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 7]: `` You must take that back .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 36]: Peter Vanrenen is quite as great a man in the United States as you are in England -- may I even say , without disrespect , a man who has won a more commanding position ?
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 26]: -- and his daughter , Cynthia , is better fitted to adorn a coronet than a great many women now entitled to wear one . ''
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 17]: The Earl laughed , with an immoderate display of an amusement he was far from feeling .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 8]: `` Are these Wiggy Devar 's credentials ?
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 23]: By gad , that shabby little wretch is flying high when she tries to bag my son for her pretty prot√©g√©e ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 30]: `` Do n't you think it would be wiser , sir , if you allowed me to tell you exactly what has taken place since we met last ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 8]: `` What good purpose will that serve ?
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 35]: I have heard the whole story from Lady Porthcawl , from Dale , from that Frenchman -- and Heaven knows I have been well coached in Mrs. Devar 's antecedents by your Aunt Susan .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 86]: George , I am surprised that a man of your sound commonsense should permit yourself to be humbugged so egregiously ... Yes , yes , I am aware that an accident led you to take Simmonds 's place in the first instance , but ca n't you see that the Devar creature must have gone instantly on her bended knees -- if she ever does pray , which I doubt -- and thanked Providence for the chance that enabled her to dispose of an earldom ?
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 20]: ... At a pretty stiff price , too , I 'll be bound , if the truth were told .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 32]: Really , George , notwithstanding your very extensive travels and wide experiences , you are nothing but a kid in the hands of a managing woman of the Devar variety . ''
Parsing [sent. 4161 len. 44]: `` I am not being given in marriage by Mrs. Devar , I assure you , '' began Medenham , smiling anxiously , for the fatherly `` tell me all about it '' was not being borne out by the Earl 's petulance .
Parsing [sent. 4162 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4163 len. 11]: You can trust me to take care of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4164 len. 9]: `` But are you treating me quite fairly ?
Parsing [sent. 4165 len. 50]: Why should the distorted version of my affairs given by Lady Porthcawl , a woman whom Cynthia Vanrenen could not possibly receive in her house , and by Count Edouard Marigny , a disappointed fortune-hunter , be accepted without cavil , while my own story is not listened to ?
Parsing [sent. 4166 len. 7]: I leave Dale out of it .
Parsing [sent. 4167 len. 22]: I am sure he told you the actual truth -- '' `` By the way , where is he now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4168 len. 12]: `` Somewhere in the neighborhood of Chester , I believe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4169 len. 7]: `` Have you discharged him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4170 len. 8]: `` No -- why should I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4171 len. 7]: `` Because I wish it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4172 len. 13]: `` Why in the world are you so unreasonable , dad ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4173 len. 3]: `` Unreasonable !
Parsing [sent. 4174 len. 7]: By gad , I like that .
Parsing [sent. 4175 len. 16]: Have _ I _ been gallivanting round the country with some -- '' `` Stop !
Parsing [sent. 4176 len. 6]: You are going too far .
Parsing [sent. 4177 len. 8]: This conversation must cease here and now .
Parsing [sent. 4178 len. 30]: If you have any respect for yourself , though not for me , you must adjourn the discussion till after you have met Miss Vanrenen and her father . ''
Parsing [sent. 4179 len. 26]: For the first time in his life , the Earl of Fairholme realized his limitations ; he was actually cowed for a few fleeting seconds .
Parsing [sent. 4180 len. 69]: But the arrogant training of the county bench , the seignory of a vast estate , the unquestioning deference accorded to his views by thousands of men who tacitly admitted that what he said must be right because he was a lord -- these excellent stays of self-conceit came to his help , and he snorted indignantly : `` I absolutely refuse to meet either of them . ''
Parsing [sent. 4181 len. 21]: `` That disposes of the whole difficulty for the hour , '' said Medenham , turning to leave the room .
Parsing [sent. 4182 len. 41]: `` Wait , George ... I insist -- '' Perhaps a clearer glimpse of a new and , to him , utterly unsuspected force in his son 's character withheld the imperious command that trembled on the Earl 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 4183 len. 3]: Medenham halted .
Parsing [sent. 4184 len. 26]: The two looked at each other , and the older man fidgeted with his collar , which seemed to have grown tight for his neck .
Parsing [sent. 4185 len. 25]: `` Come , come , let us not leave a friendly argument in this unsettled state , '' he said after an awkward pause .
Parsing [sent. 4186 len. 12]: `` My only thought is for your interests , you know .
Parsing [sent. 4187 len. 18]: Your lifelong happiness is at stake , to say nothing of the future of our house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4188 len. 26]: `` I recognize those considerations so fully that I am going now in order to shirk even the semblance of a quarrel between us . ''
Parsing [sent. 4189 len. 7]: `` Why not thresh things out ?
Parsing [sent. 4190 len. 20]: Your aunt will be here in a couple of hours -- '' `` You refuse to hear a word .
Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 8]: You argue with a hammer , sir .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 42]: I shall send a note to Lady St. Maur telling her that she has done mischief in plenty without adding fuel to the fire by coming here to-day -- unless _ you _ wish to consult her , that is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 17]: The Earl , already afraid of his sister , was rapidly learning to fear his son .
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 5]: `` Dash it all !
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 18]: do n't tell me you are off on this d -- d motoring trip once more ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 4]: he cried passionately .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 8]: Medenham smiled , even in his anger .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 12]: `` See how willfully you misunderstand me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 19]: `` I came away from Miss Vanrenen solely because matters had gone far enough under rather absurd conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 17]: She knows me only as Fitzroy , the chauffeur ; it is time to drop masquerading .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 62]: Romance is delightful in its way -- perhaps there might well be more of it in this commonplace world of ours -- but none of us can afford to play the knight errant too long , so when next I meet Cynthia it will be as a man who occupies a social position that renders our marriage at least possible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 13]: Lord Fairholme threw out his hands in a gesture of sheer bewilderment .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 9]: `` And do you honestly believe that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 8]: `` I am quite sure of it .
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 43]: I may have to jump a very big fence indeed when she learns the harmless deception I have practiced on her , but I do hope most devoutly that she will look at the facts more calmly than you have done . ''
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 19]: The Earl took a turn or two on the hearth-rug , from which wisdom had temporarily taken flight .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 32]: He thought now he could see a way to avoid open rupture , and he believed , quite rightly , that his son was in no mood to accept further disillusionment .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 41]: `` At any rate , '' he grumbled , `` you are cutting a discred -- sorry , I did n't quite mean that -- you are not rushing away from town again in pursuit of the young lady ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 10]: `` When is she due back in London ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 5]: `` On Sunday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 12]: `` And you will not see her before that day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 15]: `` I believe not -- in fact , I am fairly certain of it .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 20]: Mrs. Leland joined her at Chester last night , so there should be no curtailment of the tour . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 4]: The Earl started .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 4]: `` Mrs. Leland !
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 12]: Not the Mrs. Leland of Paris , and San Remo ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 23]: By hazard , as it were , you have let me tell you why I came away -- one of the reasons .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 10]: Mrs. Leland would have recognized me at once . ''
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 13]: `` Dear me , dear me , this is a beastly muddle !
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 36]: Look here , George , promise me you wo n't do anything stupid for a day or so ... I have been so pestered by people ... I do n't know which way to turn .
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 9]: Why not stay and meet your aunt ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 13]: `` Because I might lose my temper with _ her _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 18]: `` Ah , well , she _ is _ somewhat trying when it comes to family matters .
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 18]: Still , I may tell her -- '' `` That she ought to mind her own business ?
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 4]: By all means .
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 44]: And oblige me , too , by telling her that she would confer a boon on humanity if she persuaded Lady Porthcawl to go to -- Jericho -- or Tokio -- or wherever that ass , Porthcawl , may happen to be . ''
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 11]: `` Millicent Porthcawl was at Bournemouth , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 8]: `` Yes , I spoke to her .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 11]: She had the impudence to introduce Ducrot to Cynthia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 4]: `` By gad !
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 5]: Did she , though ?
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 9]: I heard something from Scarland about that affair .
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 11]: Well , well -- there 's no accounting for tastes .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 25]: I suppose you realize , George , that I am keeping back a good deal of the tittle-tattle which reached me during your absence .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 14]: I do n't want to hurt your feelings -- '' `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 36]: The absurdity of the present position lies in the fact that I shall have all my work cut out to hold your wrath against these people within bounds when once you have met Cynthia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 34]: `` Oh , I have no doubt she is pretty , and fascinating , and all that sort of thing , '' growled the Earl , in a grudging access of good humor .
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 16]: `` Confound it , that is why we are putty in their hands , George .
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 11]: Do n't forget I 've had fifty-five years of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 2]: Gad !
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 18]: I could tell you things -- all right , let us chuck the dispute for the time .
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 8]: Shall I see you at dinner ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: `` Yes -- if you are alone . ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 7]: `` There will be no women .
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 9]: I 'll take devilish good care of that .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 26]: Scarland is in town for the show , and he is bringing Sir Ashley Stoke , but Betty is nursing a youngster through the measles .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 3]: Good Lord !
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 13]: I 'm glad your aunt did n't get hold of Betty ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 14]: Now , Lord Fairholme 's diatribes against the sex were not quite justified .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 22]: Notorious as a lady-killer in his youth , in middle age he was as garrulous a gossip as Mrs. Devar herself .
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 36]: Indeed , he had an uneasy consciousness that Lady St. Maur might turn and rend him if stress were laid only on _ her _ efforts to thwart his son 's unexpected leaning towards matrimony .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 40]: During every yard of the journey from Chester to London he had tried to extract information from Marigny , and the sharp-witted Frenchman had enjoyed himself hugely in displaying a well-feigned reluctance to yield to the Earl 's probing .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 26]: It was just as much a part of his scheme to make the threatened alliance as objectionable on the one side as on the other .
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 44]: By painting Medenham as an unprincipled adventurer he had succeeded in alarming Vanrenen ; his sly hints , derogatory of both Cynthia and her father , now fanned the flame of suspicion kindled in Lord Fairholme 's breast by his sister 's remonstrances .
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 50]: Unfortunately , his lordship had gone straight to Curzon Street and told Susan St. Maur every word that Marigny had said , and a good deal that he had not said , but had left to be inferred from a smirk , a malicious glance , an airy gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: Perhaps the two elderly guardians of the Fairholme line were not wholly to blame for their interference .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 18]: The title descended through male heirs only , and Medenham 's marriage thereby attained an added importance .
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 55]: Lord Fairholme himself had been singularly fortunate in escaping a m√©salliance -- several , in fact -- and it was the one great trouble in his otherwise smooth and self-contained life that his high-born and most admirable countess had died soon after the birth of her second child , the present Marchioness of Scarland .
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 20]: Such a man would naturally be the most jealous scrutineer of the pretensions of his son 's chosen wife .
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 14]: Qualities of heart and mind would weigh light in the scale against genealogy .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 31]: To his thinking , blue blood differed from the common red stream as the claret of some noted vintage differs from the _ vin ordinaire _ of the same year .
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 21]: Perhaps he had blundered on a well-founded theory , but he certainly lacked discrimination as to the _ cru _ .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 36]: Medenham did some shopping , lunched at a club , surprised his tailor by a prolonged visit and close inspection of tweeds and broadcloths , and successfully repressed a strong desire to write a letter .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 30]: It was some consolation to peruse for the twentieth time the four closely-written pages on which Cynthia had set out the tour 's timetable for the benefit of Simmonds .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 64]: He had not returned it , since she possessed a copy , and in his mind 's eye he followed the Mercury in its flight up the map from end to end of industrial Lancashire , through smoky Preston to trim Lancaster and quiet Kendal , and finally , after a long day , to the brooding peace and serene beauty of Windermere .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 31]: At last , rousing himself from his dreaming -- for he was now back in his club again , sipping a cup of tea -- he glanced at his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 39]: Five o'clock -- a likely hour to find Mr. Vanrenen in the hotel , if , as was most probable , Devar 's telegram to his mother was altogether mistaken in its report of the millionaire 's movements .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 24]: He meant , of course , to make himself known to Vanrenen , and go through the whole adventure from A to Z .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 33]: It should provide an interesting story , he thought -- lively as a novel in some of its chapters , and calculated to appeal strongly to the bright intelligence of an American .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 22]: On his way to the Savoy , he tried to picture to himself just what Cynthia 's father would look like .
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 26]: It was a futile endeavor , because he had never yet been able to construct a mental portrait of any man wholly unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 30]: One day in Madras he had telephoned to an official for leave to shoot an elephant in a Government reservation , and a deep voice boomed back an answer .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 44]: Apparently it belonged to a man whose stature warranted his appointment as controller of monsters , but when Medenham called in person for the permit he found that the voice came from a lean and wizened scrap of humanity about five feet high .
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 40]: He smiled at the recollection of his dumb surprise at this apparition , and was in the best of humors with himself when he arrived at the inquiry office of the Savoy Hotel and asked for Mr. Peter Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 12]: `` Left here Sunday , sir , '' was the answer .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 10]: `` He will not return for a week . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 6]: This blow dished his hopes .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 21]: He had counted strongly on gaining Vanrenen 's friendship and sympathy before Cynthia 's dainty vision met his eyes again .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 8]: `` Has he gone to Paris ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 11]: `` Ca n't say , sir , I 'm sure .
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 17]: My orders are to tell callers that Mr. Vanrenen will be in town next Tuesday . ''
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 18]: So , if present arrangements held good , Cynthia would reach London two days before her father .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 18]: Well , he must contrive somehow to get Lady St. Maur in a proper frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 13]: Mrs. Leland 's presence would be a positive blessing in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 56]: Meanwhile , there would be no harm done if he -- Lest prudence should conquer him a second time he sat down and wrote : DEAR MISS VANRENEN -- I hope the car is behaving in a manner that befits the messenger of the gods , and that Dale has justified my faith in him .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 39]: I am here in fulfillment of my promise to call on Mr. Vanrenen : unluckily , he is out of town , and the hotel people say he is not expected back till a day early next week .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 60]: If you make any change in your programme , or even if you have a minute to spare , though proving yourself a true American by rigidly adhering to schedule , please send a line to yours ever sincerely -- Once more he hesitated at the name , and contented himself by signing `` George , the Chauffeur . ''
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 54]: The problem of an address offered some difficulty , but he boldly declared for `` 91 Grosvenor Square '' in a postscript , believing , and correctly as it happened , that Cynthia shared with Sam Weller a peculiar knowledge of London that rendered one address very like unto another in her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 14]: The failure to meet Vanrenen was the first real drawback he had encountered .
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 24]: It was irritating , at the time , but he gave little heed to it after the first pang of disappointment had passed .
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 28]: Fate , which had proved so kind during six days , did not see fit to warn him that her smiles would now be replaced by frowns .
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 15]: She even lulled him into the belief that Vanrenen 's absence might prove fortunate .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 18]: `` Perhaps , '' he fancied , `` I would have rubbed him up the wrong way .
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 22]: He is devoted to his daughter , and he might look on my harmless but unavoidable guile with a prejudiced eye .
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 33]: In any event , I should be compelled to go slow in analyzing Mrs. Devar 's motives , and this pertinacious Marigny seems to have been fairly intimate with him in Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 16]: Yes , on the whole , it is just as well that I missed him .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 21]: Cynthia can put matters before him in a better light than is possible to one who is an utter stranger .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 23]: I must tell her , in my best American , that it is up to her to explain Fitzroy to pap . ''
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 11]: Before leaving the hotel he inquired for Count Edouard Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 6]: He drew a blank there .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 10]: No such name had been registered during the year .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 7]: The dinner passed without noteworthy incident .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 60]: Sir Ashley Stoke condemned the Government , the Marquis of Scarland was more than skeptical as to the prospects of grouse shooting after the deluge in April and May , Lord Fairholme growled at the pernicious effects of the Ground Game Act , and Medenham spoke of these things with his lips but in his heart thought of Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 28]: The four men were in the smoking-room , and the Earl was chaffing his son on account of his inability to play bridge , when Tomkinson entered .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 4]: He approached Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 20]: `` Dale has arrived ; he wishes to see your lordship , '' he said in a stage whisper .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 4]: `` Dale ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 23]: The young man sprang to his feet , and his troubled cry brought a smile of wonderment to his brother-in-law 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 5]: `` By Jove ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 25]: said the Marquis , `` you could n't have jumped quicker if Tomkinson had said ` the devil ' instead of ` Dale . '
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 8]: Who , then , is Dale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 9]: Medenham hurried from the room without another word .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 6]: The Earl shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 5]: `` More mischief ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 3]: he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 7]: `` Dale is George 's chauffeur .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 13]: I suppose he is mixed up in this Vanrenen muddle again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 7]: `` What muddle is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 3]: asked Scarland .
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 6]: `` Is George in it ?
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 7]: -- that would be unusual . ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 5]: Fairholme suddenly bethought himself .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 13]: `` Something to do with a motor , '' he said vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 12]: `` The Vanrenens are Americans , friends of Mrs. Leland 's .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 11]: You remember her , Arthur , do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 3]: `` Perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 11]: Is ` Vanrenen ' the Peter of that ilk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 5]: `` I think so .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 11]: Yes -- that is the name -- Peter Vanrenen . ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 10]: `` Oh , _ he 's _ all right .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 15]: If George has any dispute with him I 'll settle it in a minute .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 24]: He is as straight as they make 'em -- bought two of my prize bulls three years ago for his ranch in Montana .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 27]: By the way , someone told me the other day that he has a very pretty daughter -- ' a real peach ' the man said .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 7]: Wonder if George has seen her ?
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 10]: Begad , he might go farther and fare worse .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 19]: We effete aristocrats can do with a strain of new blood occasionally , eh , what ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 45]: ` Vanrenen ' sounds like a blend of old Dutch and New England , '' said Sir Ashley Stoke , who was sane on all subjects save one , his pet mania being the decay of England since the passing of the Victorian age .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 10]: The Earl helped himself to a whisky and soda .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 6]: His egotism was severely shaken .
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 28]: Who would have thought that a pillar of the state like Scarland would approve of this Vanrenen girl as a match for George , even in jest ?
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 12]: But he had the good sense to steer clear of explanations .
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 16]: When he found his voice it was to swear at the quality of the whisky .
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 10]: Medenham , meanwhile , had rushed into the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 18]: He expected to find Dale there , but saw no one except the suave footman on duty .
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 6]: The man opened the door .
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 16]: `` Dale is outside , in the car , my lord , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 6]: `` In the car ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 12]: That meant the bursting of a meteor in a blue sky .
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 23]: Sure enough , there stood the Mercury , dusty and panting , but seemingly gathering breath for another mighty effort if necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 5]: `` Come in ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 28]: shouted Medenham , on whom the first strong shadow of impending disaster had fallen as soon as he heard those ill-omened words `` in the car . ''
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 26]: Dale scrambled to the pavement and walked stiffly up the steps , being weary after an almost unbroken run of one hundred and eighty miles .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 17]: He nodded to the Mercury , and the footman rang for a pageboy to mount guard .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 14]: Medenham led the way into a small anteroom and switched on the light .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 7]: `` Now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 16]: `` Mr. Vanrenen kem to Chester last night in Simmond 's car , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 16]: This mornin ' he sent for me an ' sez ` who are you ? '
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 14]: ` The chauffeur , sir , ' sez I. ` Whose chauffeur ? '
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 3]: sez he .
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 18]: ` Yours for the time , ' sez I , bein ' sort of ready for him .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 11]: ` Well , you can get , ' sez he .
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 5]: ` Get what ? '
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 10]: sez I. ` Get out , ' sez he .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 29]: Of course , my lord , I knew well enough what he meant , but I wanted to have it straight , an ' I got it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 18]: Dale 's style of speech was elliptical , though he might have been surprised if told so .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 11]: For once , Medenham wished he was a loquacious man .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 7]: `` Was nothing else said ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 7]: `` No message from -- anyone ?
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 4]: No reason given ?
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 7]: What brought Simmonds to Chester ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 16]: `` Mr. Vanrenen picked him up in Bristol at 4 a.m. yesterday , my lord .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 32]: Simmonds made out that that there Frenchman , Monsieur Marinny '' -LRB- Dale prided himself on a smattering of French -RRB- , `` had pitched a fine ole tale about you .
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 25]: In fact , the bearings got so hot at Symon 's Yat that Simmonds chucked his job till Mr. Vanrenen sort of apologized . ''
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 8]: `` Can you be specific , Dale ?
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 7]: You are hard to follow . ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 15]: `` Well , my lord , I _ could _ do with a drink .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 39]: It 's a long road that stretches between here an ' Chester , an ' I left there at ten o'clock this morning , runnin ' through any Gord 's quantity of traps , an ' all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 5]: Medenham did not smile .
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 17]: He touched a bell , and found that Dale 's specific was a bottle of beer .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 22]: `` I never set eyes on Miss Cynthia , '' continued the chauffeur , his wits quickening under the soothing draught .
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 14]: `` Another lady kem out an ' looked me up an ' down .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 25]: ` Yes , that is the car , ' she said , an ' with that I remembered seein ' her at San Remo .
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 25]: Mrs. Devar seemed as if she wanted to say somethink , but she dare n't , because Mr. Vanrenen 's eye was on her .
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 24]: He made no bones about it , but told me to hike back to London the minnit Simmonds got the carrier off . ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 9]: `` I am quite clear on that point .
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 25]: What I really want to know is the reason behind Simmonds 's statement about Count Marigny 's tale-pitching , as you term it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 14]: `` Oh , of course Mr. Vanrenen did n't _ say _ anythink .
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 13]: Simmonds was what you call puttin ' two an ' two together .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 20]: From what Mr. Vanrenen arsked him it was easy enough to get at the Frenchman 's dirty tricks . ''
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 9]: `` Tell me how Simmonds put it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 11]: said Medenham , with the patience of a great anger .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 8]: Dale scratched the back of his ear .
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 20]: `` For one thing , my lord , Mr. Vanrenen wanted to know if you was reelly a viscount .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 25]: It was a long time before Simmonds could get him to believe that the accident in Down Street was n't a put up job .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 22]: Then , he was sure you stopped in Symon 's Yat just in order to throw Mr. Marinny off your track .
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 42]: Simmonds is no fool , my lord , an ' he guesses that the Frenchman brought Mr. Vanrenen hot-foot from Paris so as to -- to -- '' Dale grinned , and sought inspiration in the bottom of an empty glass .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 24]: `` Well , my lord , excuse _ me _ , '' he said , `` but you know what I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 5]: Medenham completed the sentence .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 12]: `` So as to prevent me from marrying Miss Cynthia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 13]: `` Exactly what Simmonds an ' me said , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 9]: `` He will not succeed , Dale . ''
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 7]: `` I never thought he would .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 16]: Once your lordship is set on a thing , well , that thing occurs . ''
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 4]: `` Thank you .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 3]: Good-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 14]: Medenham did not feel equal to facing the men in the smoking-room again .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 20]: He went out , walked up Oxford Street and across the park , and reached his room about midnight .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 8]: Next day he devoted himself to work .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 55]: In view of the new and strange circumstances that had arisen he believed confidently that Cynthia would reply to his letter by return of post , and there should be no chance of delay , because she meant to stay two days at Windermere , making that town the center of excursions through lakeland .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 41]: While the son was seeking forgetfulness in classifying a collection of moths and night flies caught during a week at La Turbie , the father found occupation in prosecuting diligent inquiries into the social and financial standing of Peter Vanrenen .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 35]: As a result , the Earl visited Lady St. Maur , and , as a further result , Lady St. Maur wrote a very biting and sarcastic note to `` My dear Millicent . ''
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 15]: Moreover , she decided not to press her nephew to visit her at present .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 8]: Next morning , Medenham was up betimes .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 16]: He heard the early postman 's knock , and Tomkinson in person brought the letters .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 25]: `` There 's nothink in the name of Fitzroy , my lord , '' said he , having been warned in that matter overnight .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 32]: Medenham took his packet with the best grace possible , trying to assure himself that Cynthia had written at a late hour and had missed the first London mail in consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 19]: Glancing hurriedly through the correspondence , however , his glance fell on a letter bearing the Windermere postmark .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 26]: It was addressed , in an unfamiliar hand , to `` Viscount Medenham , '' and the writing was bold , well-formed , and business-like .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 42]: Then he read : SIR -- My daughter received a note from you this morning , and she was about to answer it when I informed her that she was communicating with a person who had given her an assumed name .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 18]: I also asked her , as a favor , to permit me to reply in her stead .
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 32]: Now , I have this to say -- Miss Vanrenen does not know , and will never know from me , the true nature of the trick you played on her .
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 46]: You bear the label of a gentleman , so it is my earnest hope -- indeed , my sincere belief -- that you will respect the trust she placed in you , and not expose her to the idle chatter of clubs and scandal-spreading drawing-rooms .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 11]: During two days I have been very bitter against you .
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 62]: To-day I take a calmer view , and , provided that neither my daughter nor I ever see or hear of you again , I shall be willing to credit that you acted more in a spirit of youthful caprice than from any foul desire to injure the good repute of one who has done no harm to you or yours .
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 9]: I am , Yours truly , PETER VANRENEN .
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 10]: Medenham read and reread this harsh letter many times .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 16]: Then , out of brooding chaos , leaped one fiery question -- where was Marigny ?
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 18]: The gate which Cynthia 's father had shut and bolted in his face did not frighten him .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 43]: He had leaped a wall of brass and triple steel when he won Cynthia Vanrenen 's love in the guise of an humble chauffeur , so it was unbelievable that the barrier interposed by a father 's misguided wrath should prove unsurmountable .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 3]: But Marigny !
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 45]: He wanted to feel his fingers clutching that slender throat , to see that pink and white face empurple and grow black under their strain , and it was all-important that the scoundrel should be brought to book before the Vanrenens returned to London .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 13]: He gave a passing thought to Mrs. Leland , it was true .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 37]: If she shared with Vanrenen the silly little secret of his identity , it was beyond comprehension that she should let her friend hold the view that he -LRB- Medenham -RRB- was merely an enterprising blackguard .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 16]: Still , these considerations were light as thistle-down compared with the need of finding Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 11]: He and Dale began to hunt London for the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 22]: But they had to deal with a wary bird , who would not break covert till it suited his own convenience .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 10]: And then , the sublime cheek of the man !
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 49]: On the Friday morning , when Medenham rose with a fixed resolve to obtain the services of a private detective , he received this note : DEAR VISCOUNT MEDENHAM -- I have a notion , as our mutual acquaintance Mr. Vanrenen would say -LRB- Do you know him ?
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 20]: Now that I consider the matter , I think not -RRB- , that you are anxious to meet me .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 10]: We have things to discuss , have we not ?
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 11]: Well , then I await you at the above address .
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 7]: Yours to command , EDOUARD MARIGNY .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 37]: CHAPTER XIV -- AND GOOD JUDGMENT YIELDS TO FOLLY At any other moment the tone of confidence underlying the effrontery of this letter would certainly have revealed its presence to a brain more than ordinarily acute .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 24]: But in the storm and stress of his rage against gods and men , Medenham did not wait to ponder subtleties of expression .
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 33]: No matter what the hidden reason that inspired Marigny 's pen , it was enough for Medenham to know that at last that arch-plotter and very perfect rascal was within his reach .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 34]: He breakfasted in a fury of haste , crammed on a hat , and rushed away , meaning to drive in a cab to the hotel in Northumberland Avenue from which Marigny wrote .
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 33]: Such was his agitated state that he was not even surprised when he found the Mercury waiting outside , with Dale , taciturn as ever , scrutinizing the day 's sporting news .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 14]: In sober fact , the man was almost as perturbed as his master .
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 61]: For an hour in the morning , and again during certain periods of suspense in the afternoon , he forgot his troubles in the effort either to `` spot winners '' or to persuade himself that the horses he had selected for particular races had not run , since their names failed to appear among the `` first three . ''
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 10]: But these spasms of anticipation and disillusionment soon passed .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 43]: During the remainder of the long hours of daylight Dale was ever on the _ qui vive _ for a wild rush of two or three hundred miles in pursuit of the woman whose charms had so effectually subjugated the young Viscount .
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 56]: Even the hunt for Marigny did not weaken Dale 's belief , and Medenham was never in Cavendish Square or at his club at any practicable hour that the Mercury was not at hand , with petrol tanks full , luggage carriers attached , and a full stock of spares and reserve spirit on board .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 19]: At any rate , on this occasion Medenham merely gave him Marigny 's address , and jumped inside .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 4]: Dale was disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 14]: He expected the order to be `` Carlisle , '' at the least .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 15]: Soon his lordship was being conducted by an hotel servant to a private sitting-room .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 21]: The Frenchman , who was seated at a table , writing , when he entered , rose and bowed politely .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 58]: `` I thought it highly probable that I should have the honor of seeing you this morning , Viscount Medenham , '' he said , and there was a touch of restraint , of formal courtesy , in his voice that the other , even in his anger against the man , did not fail to notice .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 26]: Oddly enough , it savored of brutality to attack him without preface , and Marigny seemed to be unconscious of his visitor 's unconcealed animosity .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 14]: `` I am glad you are here , '' he went on glibly .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 17]: `` Recent events call for a full discussion between you and me , do you agree ?
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 31]: But before we come to close quarters , as you say in England , I wish to know whether the argument is to be conducted on lines that befit gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 17]: On the last occasion when we differed , you used the methods of the costermonger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 20]: `` They served their purpose , '' said Medenham , annoyed at finding the Frenchman 's coolness rather disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 22]: Suddenly , he decided on a new plan of action , and resolved to let the man say what he chose .
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 36]: Dearly as he would have liked to wreak physical vengeance on him , he felt that such a proceeding offered the least satisfactory way out of a situation fraught with no small risk of publicity .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 27]: Marigny must have had some all-powerful motive in sending for him ; better learn that before his bitter and contemptuous words sealed an adversary 's lips .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 8]: `` Wo n't you sit down ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 5]: came the urbane request .
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 56]: `` I prefer standing , if you do n't mind , '' said Medenham curtly ; then he added , after a little pause : `` It may clear the atmosphere somewhat if I tell you that I threatened you at Bristol merely because a certain issue had to be determined within a few seconds .
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 7]: That consideration does not apply now .
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 15]: You are at liberty to say what you like without fear of consequences . ''
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 6]: The Frenchman elevated his eyebrows .
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 4]: `` Fear ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 10]: `` Oh , do n't bandy words with me .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 6]: You know what I mean .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 25]: I suppose a man must possess courage of a sort even to become a blackmailer , which is what you threaten to develop into .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 21]: At any rate , I promise to keep my hands off you , if that is what you want . ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 10]: `` Not exactly , '' was the quiet answer .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 30]: `` One may draw distinctions , even in that regard , but I do wish for an opportunity to discuss our quarrel without an appeal to brute force . ''
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 29]: `` In other words , '' said Medenham sternly , `` you want to be free to say something which under ordinary conditions would earn you a thrashing .
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 6]: Well -- say it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 26]: Marigny nodded , pulled a chair round so that he was straddled across it , facing Medenham , with his arms resting on the back .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 32]: He lit a cigarette , and seemed to draw inspiration from the first dense cloud of smoke , for his eyes dwelt on it rather than sought the Englishman 's frown .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 32]: `` In a dispute of this kind , '' he said , `` it is well to begin at the beginning , otherwise one 's motives are apt to be misunderstood .
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 17]: Even you , I suppose , will admit that I was first in the field . ''
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 5]: There was no answer .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 39]: To his credit , Medenham thought , Marigny showed a curious unwillingness to mention Cynthia 's name , but , no matter what he had in mind , Medenham certainly did not intend to render his task easier .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 34]: `` You see , '' went on Count Edouard , after a thoughtful puff or two , `` I am quite as well-born a man in my country as you are in yours .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 26]: I have not ascertained the date when the Fairholme Earldom was created , but there has been a Comte Marigny on the Loire since 1434 .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 20]: Of course , you understand that I do not mention this trivial fact in any ridiculous spirit of boasting .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 14]: I only put it forward as constituting a claim to a certain equality .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 4]: That is all .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 27]: Unfortunately , recent events in my family have robbed me of those necessary appurtenances to rank and position which a happier fate has preserved to you .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 24]: I am poor , you are rich ; I must marry a wife with money , you can afford to marry for love .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 19]: Why then , Viscount Medenham , should you step in and rob me of a rich wife ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 44]: In spite of his loathing of the means adopted by this self-proclaimed rival to snatch an advantage , Medenham did not hesitate to reply : `` My answer to that is , of course , that I have done nothing of the sort .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 19]: I simply intervened between a crew of adventurers and their possible , though most improbable , victim . ''
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 17]: `` Unfortunately , our points of view are irreconcilable , '' went on the Frenchman airily .
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 19]: `` I might claim that the term adventurer , as applied to me , is a harsh one .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 22]: You may inquire where and how you choose in Paris , and you will find no discredit attached to my name .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 12]: But that phase of the difficulty is now of no consequence .
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 8]: Let us keep to the main issue .
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 20]: Some three months ago I made the acquaintance of a lady fitted in every respect to fill my ideal .
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 19]: I was on good terms with her father , and by no means distasteful to the lady herself .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 35]: Given a fair opportunity , I thought I might win her , and I was puzzling my wits to know how best to attain that most desirable end when Fate apparently opened a way .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 25]: But you have no doubt observed in life that while one can seldom misinterpret Fate 's frowns , her smiles can be damnably misleading .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 47]: Sometimes they are little else than malicious leers ; it was so now , and I quickly found that I had erred badly in thinking that I had been vouchsafed a golden opportunity -- '' `` Ca n't you spare me some of this theorizing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 8]: broke in Medenham with a cold impatience .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 19]: `` You happened to send for me at a moment when I was exceedingly anxious to meet you .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 24]: The fact that I am here in response to your request stops me from carrying out the special purpose I had in view .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 9]: That can wait , though not very long .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 27]: At any rate , you might save yourself some hair-splitting and me some exercise of self-restraint by telling me what it is that you want . ''
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 27]: `` A thousand regrets if I am boring you , '' said Marigny , leaning back in the chair and laying the cigarette on the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 18]: `` Yet bear with me a little while , I pray you ; these explanations are necessary .
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 25]: A sane man acts with motive , and it is only reasonable that you should understand my motive before you hear my project . ''
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 11]: `` Ah , then , there is a project ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 21]: You have stepped in between me and the realization of my dearest wish , of my main object in life .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 13]: You are , I take it , a soldier and a gentleman .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 21]: There is a way by which men of honor settle these disputes -- I invite you to follow it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 18]: The fantastic proposal was made with an air of dignity that robbed it of any inherent ludicrousness .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 20]: Greatly as he despised this man , Medenham could not wholly conceal the wonder that leaped to his eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 12]: `` Are you suggesting that we should fight a duel ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 20]: he asked , smiling with incredulity , yet constrained to believe that Marigny was really speaking in cold blood .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 7]: `` Yes -- oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 7]: A duel -- no make-believe ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 12]: A curious change came into Marigny 's voice at that instant .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 31]: He seemed to bark each staccato phrase ; a vindictive fire gleamed in his black eyes , and the olive tint showed beneath the pink and white of his skin .
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 6]: Medenham laughed , almost good-humoredly .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 12]: `` The notion is worthy of you , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 15]: `` I might have expected it , but I fancied you were more sensible .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 17]: Surely you know enough of my world to realize that such a thing is impossible . ''
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 12]: `` It must be made possible , '' said Marigny gravely .
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 9]: `` It can not -- I refuse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 24]: `` I am partly prepared for some such answer , but I shall be just to you in my thoughts , Viscount Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 8]: I know you are a brave man .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 19]: It is not cowardice , but your insular convention that restrains you from facing me on the field .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 6]: Nevertheless , I insist . ''
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 7]: Medenham threw out an impatient hand .
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 32]: `` You are talking arrant nonsense , for what purpose I can hardly conceive , '' he said , frowning with vexation at the tragi-comedy into which he had been drawn .
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 15]: `` Frenchmen , it is true , regard these things from a different standpoint .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 14]: That which seems rational to you is little else than buffoonery to me .
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 16]: If that is your object in seeking an interview , it has now been accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 11]: I absolutely decline to entertain the proposition for a moment .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 19]: You have certainly succeeded in lending an air of drivel to a controversy that I regard as serious .
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 18]: I came here filled with very bitter thoughts toward you , but your burlesque has disarmed me .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 38]: It is only fair , however , that I should warn you not to cross my path again , since one 's sense of humor may become strained , and that will be bad for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 28]: His attitude seemed to betoken an immediate departure , but Marigny looked at him so fixedly that he waited to hear what the other had to say .
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 13]: He was quite determined now to keep Cynthia out of the discussion .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 32]: Even Vanrenen 's letter need not be mentioned until he had seen the millionaire in person and disabused his mind of the inept inventions with which the Frenchman had perplexed him .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 27]: `` I do n't take your refusal as final , '' said Count Edouard , speaking very slowly , and choosing each sentence with evident care .
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 31]: `` I was at pains to explain my position , and there now devolves upon me the disagreeable duty of telling you what will happen if you do not fight .
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 31]: You English may not care to defend your honor in the manner that appeals to a more sensitive nation like the French , but you are vulnerable in your womenfolk .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 35]: I now tell you quite frankly , that if you do not abandon your pretensions to Miss Cynthia Vanrenen , I shall make it my special business in life to ruin her socially . ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 8]: Medenham listened more in amazement than indignation .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 13]: At first , the true significance of the threat left him unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 22]: In his ears it was a mere repetition of the bogey raised by Vanrenen , and that was the wildest nonsense .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 17]: `` I really do not think you are responsible for your words , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 10]: Marigny swept aside the protest with an emphatic gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 20]: `` Oh , yes , I am , '' he said , his voice low , sibilant , menacing .
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 16]: `` I have laid my plans , and shall pursue them with a complete detachment .
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 17]: Others may suffer -- so shall I. I have practically reached the limit of my resources .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 10]: In a month or less I shall be penniless .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 40]: What money I could scrape together I devoted to the furtherance of this marriage-project , and I am well aware that when you meet Mr. Vanrenen , my poor little cobweb of intrigue will be blown into thin air .
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 28]: You are quite a desirable _ parti _ , Viscount Medenham -- every condition points to your speedy and happy union to the lady of your choice .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 48]: It is , however , a most unfortunate and lamentable fact that she also happens to be the lady of _ my _ choice , and I shall revenge myself on you , through her , in the way best calculated to pierce your thick British hide .
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 26]: The future Countess of Fairholme should be superior to C√¶sar 's wife in being not only above suspicion , but altogether removed from its taint .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 15]: I am afraid that it will be my task to tarnish her escutcheon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 41]: `` You miserable rascal , '' cried Medenham , stung beyond endurance by this extraordinary declaration of a vile purpose , `` why should you imagine that I shall allow you to sit there and pour forth your venom unscathed ?
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 14]: Stand up , you beast , or must I kick you up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 3]: `` Ha !
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 12]: You are ready to fight me now , my worthy Viscount !
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 7]: But not in your costermonger fashion .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 10]: You can not , because I have your promise .
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 19]: You see I have taken your measure with some accuracy , and hard words will not move me .
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 9]: I mean you to understand the issue clearly .
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 59]: Either you meet me under conditions that will insure a clear field for the survivor , or I devote myself to spreading in every quarter most likely to prove damaging to Miss Vanrenen the full , though , perhaps , untrue , but none the less fascinating story of her boating excursion on the Wye at midnight . ''
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 25]: He did then spring to his feet , for Medenham was advancing on him with obvious intent to stifle the monstrous accusation by force .
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 3]: `` No !
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 2]: No !
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 11]: you will achieve nothing by violence , '' he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 47]: `` You are not so much my physical superior that I can not defend myself until assistance arrives , and I will ask you to consider what manner of gloss will be placed upon your actions if I drag you before a magistrate for an assault .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 11]: Why , man , you are absolutely at my mercy .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 8]: You yourself would be my best witness .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 6]: Ah , _ touch√© _ !
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 7]: You felt the point that time .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 4]: _ Que diable !
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 31]: _ I gave you credit for a quicker wit , but it is gratifying to learn that you are beginning at last to see that I am in deadly earnest .
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 24]: When I strike there is nothing half-hearted behind my blow ; I swear to you that I shall neither relent nor draw back .
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 14]: If ruin overwhelm me , Cynthia Vanrenen shall be involved in my downfall .
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 20]: Picture to yourself the smiles , the whispers , the half-spoken scandal that will cling to her through life .
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 21]: Who will believe her when she says that she was ignorant of your rank when she started out from London ?
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 23]: The incomparable Cynthia and the naughty Viscount , touring their thousand miles through England with Mrs. Devar as a shield of innocence !
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 4]: ... Mrs. Devar !
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 24]: ... Ca n't you hear the long and loud guffaw that would convulse society as soon as _ her _ name cropped up ?
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 13]: Ah , you are writhing under the lash now , I fancy !
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 18]: It is dawning on you that a peril greater than the sword or bullet may be near .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 52]: Dozens of people in Paris and London know , or guess , at any rate , that I was Cynthia Vanrenen 's suitor , but as many hundreds as there were dozens shall be told that I cast her off because of the taint placed on her by your silly masquerading .
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 20]: You have no escape -- you have no answer -- your marriage will only serve to confirm my words .
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 4]: Do you hear ?
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 20]: I shall say ... But you know what I shall say ... Now , will you fight me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 38]: A spasm of hate and furious joy struggled for mastery in Marigny 's face , but he showed an iron resolution that almost equaled the coolness of the man whose scornful gaze might well have abashed him .
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 17]: `` I thought so , '' he said -- `` under terms , of course ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 6]: `` Terms , you beast !
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 20]: The only terms I ask are that you shall stand before me with a sword in your hand . ''
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 4]: `` A sword !
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 6]: -- is that quite fair ?
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 9]: You Englishmen are not proficient with the sword .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 5]: Why not pistols ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 22]: `` I think you are right , '' said Medenham , turning away as if the sight of him was loathsome .
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 19]: `` You deserve the death of a dog ; it would dishonor bright steel to touch you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 24]: `` We shall see , '' said Marigny , who having achieved his purpose , was now apparently unconcerned as to its outcome .
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 14]: `` But it would be folly to fight without arriving at an understanding .
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 29]: I shall try to kill you , and I am sure you will admit that I have striven to force you into an active reciprocity in that respect .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 51]: But one might only be wounded -- that is the lottery of it -- so I stipulate that if fortune should favor me , and you still live , you shall agree to leave me in undisturbed possession of the field for at least six months after our encounter . ''
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 8]: Medenham still refused to look at him .
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 14]: `` I agree to no terms or conditions whatsoever , '' he answered .
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 25]: `` I am meeting you solely because of the foul lie you have dared to utter against the reputation of the woman I love .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 27]: If you breathe a word of it in any other ear I shall tear your tongue out by the roots , duel or no duel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 14]: `` Ah , but that is a pity , '' jeered the Frenchman .
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 43]: `` Do n't you see that unless you accept my offer I shall be compelled to fall back on the sword , since it is absolutely an essential element of my probable success that you should be cleared out of my way ?
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 27]: I have no chance against you in the matrimonial market , but I think the odds are in my favor when cold steel is the arbitrator .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 13]: Now , could anyone be more frank than I in this matter ?
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 8]: I mean either to win or lose .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 7]: There must be no middle course .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 21]: Unless you are willing to stand aside , if beaten , I can win only by stepping over your corpse .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 5]: Why not avoid extremes ?
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 6]: They may be unnecessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 56]: `` You have already convinced me that your ethics are drawn from the police court , but I see now , that you depend for your wit on the cheaper variety of melodrama , '' said Medenham , with a quiet derision that at last brought a flush of passion to the Frenchman 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 11]: `` I fail to see the need of more words .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 12]: You have asked for deeds , and you shall have them .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 14]: When and where do you propose that this encounter shall take place ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 17]: `` To-morrow morning -- about four o'clock -- on the sands between Calais and Wissant . ''
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 17]: In spite of all that had gone before , Medenham was unprepared for this categorical answer .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 21]: Were he in full possession of his faculties he must have seen the trap into which he was being decoyed .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 25]: Unhappily , Vanrenen 's letter had helped to complete the lure , and he was no longer amenable to the dictates of cold reason .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 10]: `` That is hardly possible , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 18]: `` I do not propose to bring myself under the law as a murderer , Monsieur Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 23]: I am ready to take the consequences of a fair fight , but to secure that , certain preliminaries are indispensable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 22]: `` I was sure you would meet me , '' said Marigny , smiling nonchalantly as he lighted the cigarette again .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 15]: `` I have arranged everything , even the attendance of witnesses and a doctor .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 39]: We cross over to Calais by the night boat from Dover , pick up the others at the H√¥tel de la Plage , at which they will arrive to-night , and drive straight to the _ terrain _ .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 8]: There is no prospect of outside interference .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 18]: This is not the sort of duel which either of the combatants is anxious to advertise broadcast .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 28]: My friends will be discretion itself , and I need hardly express my conviction that you will not make known in England the purpose of our journey .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 21]: Of course , it is open to you to bring one of your own friends , if you think fit .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 23]: But my notion is , that these affairs should be settled discreetly in the presence of the smallest possible number of onlookers .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 21]: I shall , of course , satisfy you as to the standing of the gentlemen I have summoned from Paris .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 16]: On the table there are their telegrams accepting my invitation to meet us at Calais .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 14]: When you came in I was busy putting my wretched affairs in order .
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 14]: At least I have given you proof of my belief in your courage .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 36]: I even go so far as to say that I regret most profoundly the necessity which has driven me to use threats against a charming lady in order to wring a challenge out of you .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 38]: Of course , between ourselves , I know perfectly well that there is not a word of truth in the statements I have pledged myself to make , but that defect in nowise detracts from their efficiency .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 21]: Indeed , it commends them the more to the real purveyor of scandal -- '' The door slammed behind Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 33]: A dreadful doubt assailed him that if he did not hurry away from that taunting voice he might be tempted to forget himself -- and what torture that would mean to Cynthia !
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 19]: He was indeed a prey to complex emotions that rendered him utterly incapable of forming a well-balanced judgment .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 44]: Nothing more illogical , more ill-advised , more thoroughly unsuited to achieve its object than the proposed duel could well be mooted , yet the sheer malignity of Marigny 's ruffianly device to attain his ends had impelled him to that final madness .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 11]: Notions of right and wrong were topsy-turvy in his brain .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 19]: He was carried along on a current of passion that overturned every barrier imposed by sense and prudence .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 54]: It seemed quite reasonable to one who had often risked life and limb for his country , who , from mere love of sport , had faced many an infuriated tiger and skulking lion , that he should be justified by the eternal law in striving to rid the world of this ultra-beast .
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: He had not scrupled to kill a poisonous snake -- why should he flinch from killing a man whose chief equipment was the poison-laden fang of slander ?
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 17]: Happily , he could use a sword in a fashion that might surprise Marigny most wofully .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 46]: If he did not succeed in killing the wretch , he would surely disable him , and the thought sent such a thrill of fierce pleasure through his veins that he resolutely closed his eyes to the lamentable results that must follow his own death .
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 16]: Cynthia , at least , would not suffer ; that was all he cared for .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 18]: No matter what happened , he did not imagine for one moment that she would marry Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 9]: But that eventuality hardly troubled him at all .
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 16]: The Frenchman had chosen the sword , and he must abide by its stern arbitrament .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 4]: `` Home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 20]: he said to Dale , finding his retainer 's eye bent inquiringly on him when he reached the street .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 11]: The word had a curiously detached sound in his ears .
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 4]: `` Home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 36]: It savored of rank lunacy to think that within a few short hours he would be standing on foreign soil , striving desperately with naked steel to defend his own life and destroy another 's .
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 17]: CHAPTER XV THE OUTCOME The fine weather which had endured so long gave way that night .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 22]: Storm-clouds swept up from the Atlantic , and England was drenched in rain when Medenham quitted Charing Cross at 9 p.m. .
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 47]: At the eleventh hour he determined to take Dale with him , but that belated display of wisdom arose more from the need he felt of human companionship than from any sense of the absurdity of going alone to fight a duel in a foreign land .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 53]: He had given no thought during the fleeting hours to the necessity of communicating with his relatives in case he fell a victim to Marigny 's rancor , so he devoted himself now to writing a brief account to the Marquis of Scarland of the causes that led up to the duel .
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 69]: He concluded with an entreaty that his brother-in-law should use all means within his power to close down any inquiry that might result , and pointed out that in this connection Dale would prove a valuable ally , since his testimony would make clear the fact that the contest had taken place in France , where duels are looked on with a more lenient eye than in England .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 36]: It was difficult to write legibly in the fast-moving , ill-lighted train , so he completed the letter on board the steamer , but did not hand it to Dale until after Calais was reached .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 22]: While the steamer was drawing up to her berth , he saw Count Edouard Marigny among the few passengers on deck .
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 36]: He had turned his back on the Frenchman at Charing Cross , but the imperturbable Count , noticing Dale in the half-light of dawn , believed that Medenham had brought a fellow-countryman as a witness .
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 16]: He strolled up , and said affably : `` Is this gentleman your friend ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 18]: `` Yes , '' said Medenham , `` though not quite in the sense that you mean .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 15]: He will accompany me to the hotel , and await my return there . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 15]: The Frenchman was evidently mystified ; he smiled , but passed no other comment .
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 22]: Dale , who heard what was said , now wondered more than ever what lay behind this sudden journey to France .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 45]: He had already recognized Marigny as the owner of the Du Vallon , for he had seen him leaving the Metropole Hotel at Brighton not many days ago , and had the best of reasons for regarding him as Viscount Medenham 's implacable enemy .
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 46]: Why , then , were these two crossing the Channel in company , going together to some hotel , and leaving him , Dale , to kick his heels in the small hours of the morning till it pleased them to pick him up again ?
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 36]: In justice to the loyal-hearted chauffeur , plunged quite unknowingly into the crisis of his life , it must be said that the notion of a duel did not even occur to his puzzled brain .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 9]: Nor was he given much time for speculation .
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 9]: A carriage awaited the trio at the quay .
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 30]: They carried no luggage to entail a delay at the Customs , and they drove off at a rapid pace through silent streets in a drenched downpour of rain .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 24]: When they reached the H√¥tel de la Plage , neither Medenham nor the Frenchman alighted , but the former handed Dale a letter .
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 21]: `` I may be detained in France somewhat longer than I anticipated , '' he said in a matter-of-fact tone .
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 25]: `` If that is so , and you have to return to England without me , hand this letter to the Marquis of Scarland .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 27]: Take great care of it , and keep it in your possession until you are positively assured that I am unable to go with you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 18]: These enigmatical instructions bothered their hearer far more than any of the strange proceedings of the night .
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 21]: `` How shall I know , my lord , whether I am to go back with you or not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 16]: `` Oh , of course I shall make that quite clear , '' laughed Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 18]: `` At present , all you have to do is to wait here a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 18]: His careless demeanor dispelled the first dim shadow of doubt that had arisen in Dale 's mind .
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 48]: The man was no stranger on the Continent , having traveled with his employer over the length and breadth of France and Northern Italy ; but the manner of this visit to the H√¥tel de la Plage at Calais was so perplexing that he essayed another question .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 11]: `` When may I expect you , my lord ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 7]: Medenham affected to consult his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 16]: `` Within an hour , '' he said ; `` perhaps a few minutes more .
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 13]: At any rate , you can arrange to catch the afternoon boat .
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 7]: Meanwhile , make yourself comfortable . ''
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 20]: By this time , three men , whom he had never seen before , came out from the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 15]: Apparently , they were fully prepared for the coming of the visitors from England .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 12]: They greeted Count Marigny cordially , and were introduced to Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 51]: Without more ado , two of them entered the vehicle ; the third , hoisting an umbrella , climbed to the side of the driver , to whom no orders were given , and the cab rattled rapidly away over the paving-stones , leaving Dale to gaze disconsolately after it .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 11]: Then the vague suspicions in his mind awoke into activity .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 20]: For one thing , he had heard one of the strangers alluded to as `` Monsieur le Docteur . ''
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 22]: For another , the newcomers carried a curious-looking parcel , or case , of an elongated shape that suggested unusual contents .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 9]: Some trick of memory came to his aid .
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 36]: In an hotel at Lyons he had watched a valet packing just such an object with the remainder of his employer 's luggage , and was told , on inquiry , that it contained foils .
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 4]: But why foils ?
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 8]: ... at four o'clock in the morning ?
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 21]: ... in a country where men might still requite an outrage by an appeal to the law of the jungle ?
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 17]: Hastily drawing from his breast pocket the letter intrusted to him , he examined the superscription .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 46]: It was addressed simply to the Marquis of Scarland , and must surely be a document of immense significance , or the young Viscount would not have brought him all the way from London to act as messenger rather than intrust it to the post .
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 18]: Each instant Dale 's ideas became clearer ; each instant his heart throbbed with a deeper anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 27]: At last , when the four-wheeler disappeared from sight round an angle of the rain-soaked boulevard , he yielded to impulse and ran into the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 29]: French people are early risers , but the visitors to Calais that morning were astir at an hour when most of the hotel staff were still sound asleep .
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 50]: A night porter , however , was awaiting him at the entrance , and Dale forthwith engaged in a valiant struggle with the French language in the effort to ascertain , first , whether the man possessed a bicycle , and , secondly , whether he would lend it .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 48]: The Frenchman , of course , broke into a voluble statement out of all proportion to the demand , but the production of a British sovereign seemed to interpret matters satisfactorily , because a bicycle was promptly produced from a shed in the rear of the building .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 24]: Dale handed the man the sovereign , jumped on the machine , and rode off rapidly in the direction taken by the cab .
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 49]: He had no difficulty in turning the corner round which it had vanished , but a little farther on he erred in thinking that it had gone straight ahead , since the driver had really turned to the right again in order to keep clear of the fortifications .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 31]: Dale traveled at such a pace that the first long stretch of straight road opening up before his eyes convinced him of his blunder when no cab was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 23]: He raced back , dismounted at the crossing , examined the road for wheel-marks , and soon was in the saddle again .
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 35]: He was destined to be thus bothered three times in all , but , taught wisdom by his initial mistake , he never passed a crossroad without searching for the recent tracks of wheels .
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 30]: The rain helped him wherever the roadway was macadamized , but the paved _ routes militaires _ with which Calais abounds offered difficulties that caused many minutes of delay .
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 32]: At last , he found himself in the open country , scorching along a sandy road that traversed the low dunes lying between the town of Calais and Cape Gris Nez .
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 53]: It was not easy to see far ahead owing to the rain and mist , and he had covered a mile or more beyond the last of the scattered villas and cottages which form the eastern suburb of the port , when he saw the elusive cab drawn up by the roadside .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 36]: The horse was steaming as though it had been driven at a great pace , and the driver stood near , smoking a cigarette , and protecting himself from the persistent downpour by an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 22]: Dale soon reached the man , and said breathlessly , in his slow French : `` Where are the gentlemen ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 16]: The cabman , who had evidently been paid to hold his tongue , merely shrugged .
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 25]: Dale , breathing hard , laid a heavy hand on his shoulder , whereupon the other answered : `` I do n't know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 33]: This , of course , was a lie , and the fact that it was a lie alarmed Dale quite as much as any of the sinister incidents which had already befallen .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 16]: For one thing , there was no house into which five men could have gone .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 33]: On each side of the road were bleak sandhills ; to the right was the sea , gray and lowering beneath a leaden-hued sky that seemed to weep above a dead earth .
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 18]: Here , undoubtedly , was the cab , since Dale could swear to both horse and man .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 8]: Where , then , were its occupants ?
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 71]: Having to depend upon his wits , he gave no further heed to the Frenchman , but , fancying that he saw vestiges of recent footmarks on the right , or seaward , side of the road , and dragging the bicycle with him , he climbed to the top of the nearest dune , as he believed that a view of the sands could be obtained from that point .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 4]: He was right .
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 50]: The sea was at a greater distance than he imagined would be the case , but a wide strip of firm sand , its wet patches glistening dully in the half-light , extended to the water 's edge almost from the base of the hillock on which he stood .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 40]: At first , his anxious eyes strained through the haze in vain , until some circling seagulls caught his attention , and then he discerned some vague forms silhouetted against a brighter belt of the sea to the northeast .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 20]: Three of the figures were black and motionless , but two gave an eerie suggestion of whiteness and movement .
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 18]: Abandoning the bicycle , and hardly realizing why he should be so perturbed , Dale ran forward .
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 51]: Twice he stumbled and fell amidst the stringy heath grass , but he was up again in a frenzy of haste , and soon was near enough to the group of men to see that Medenham and Marigny , bare-headed and in their shirt sleeves , were fighting with swords .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 48]: Dale 's eyes were now half-blinded with perspiration , for he had ridden fast through the mud from Calais , and this final run through yielding sand and clinging sedge was exhausting to one who seldom walked as many furlongs as he had covered miles that morning .
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 18]: But even in his panic of distress he fancied that his master was pressing the Frenchman severely .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 13]: It was no child 's play , this battle with cold steel .
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 33]: The slender , venomous-looking blades whirled and stabbed with a fearsome vehemence , and the sharp rasp of each riposte and parry rang out with a horrible suggestiveness in the moist air .
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 21]: And then , as he lumbered heavily on , Dale thought he saw something that turned him sick with terror .
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 17]: Almost halting , he swept a hasty hand across his eyes -- then he was sure .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 31]: Medenham , with arm extended in a feint in tierce , was bearing so heavily on his opponent 's rapier that his right foot slipped , and he stumbled badly .
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 14]: At once Marigny struck with the deadly quickness and certainty of a cobra .
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 13]: His weapon pierced Medenham 's breast high up on the right side .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 24]: The stroke was so true and furious that the Englishman , already unbalanced , was driven on to his back on the sand .
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 21]: Marigny wrenched the blade free , and stooped with obvious intent to plunge it again through his opponent 's body .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 12]: A warning shout from each of the three spectators withheld him .
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 13]: He scowled vindictively , but dared not make that second mortal thrust .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 37]: These French gentlemen whom he had summoned from Paris were bound by a rigid code of honor that would infallibly have caused him to be branded as a murderer had he completed matters to his satisfaction .
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 23]: Nevertheless , he bent and peered closely into Medenham 's face , gray now as the sand on which he was lying .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 13]: `` I think it will serve , '' he muttered to himself .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 19]: `` May the devil take him , but I thought he would get the better of me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 25]: He turned away with an affectation of coolness which he was far from feeling , while the doctor knelt to examine Medenham 's injury .
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 29]: He saw someone running towards him , but believed it must be one of the witnesses , and his eyes fell to the stained blade in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 10]: `` I rather forgot myself -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 27]: But the excuse was stopped short by a blow on the angle of the jaw that stretched him by Medenham 's side and apparently as lifeless .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 34]: Assuredly , Dale was not versed in the punctilio of the duel , but he knew how and where to hit with a fist that was hard as one of his own spanners .
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 29]: He put weight and passion into that punch , and scarcely understood how effective it was until he found himself struggling in the grasp of two excited Frenchmen .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 48]: He cursed both them and Marigny fluently , and vowed the most horrible vengeance on all three , but soon calmed himself sufficiently to see that Count Edouard could not stir , and his perturbed wits then sought to learn the extent of his master 's injury .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 6]: Still he swore at Marigny .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 5]: `` Damn you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 26]: he cried hoarsely , `` you would have stabbed him as he was lying there if these pals of yours had n't stopped you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 25]: At last , recovering some degree of self-possession , he assisted the astounded and rather frightened Frenchmen to carry Medenham to the waiting carriage .
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 40]: One , who spoke English , asked him to help in rendering a like service to Marigny , but he refused with an oath , and the others dared not press him , he looked so fierce and threatening .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 6]: `` Is he dead ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 6]: he asked the doctor brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 25]: There could be no mistaking the meaning of the words , for his red-shot eyes glared fixedly at the limp body of his master .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 50]: The other shook his head , but pointed in the direction of Calais , as though to suggest that the sooner the injured man was taken to some place where his wound could be properly attended to , the better would be the faint chance of life that remained .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 28]: By this time the seconds were approaching , and Marigny had seemingly recovered to a slight extent from the knockout blow which he had received so unexpectedly .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 16]: The doctor , who was the only self-collected person present , pointed to the bicycle .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 8]: `` Hotel , '' he said emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 7]: `` Go hotel -- quick ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 27]: Dale was minded not to desert his master , but the anxiety in the doctor 's face warned him that the request ought to be obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 29]: If the spark of vitality still flickering in Medenham 's body was to be preserved not a moment should be lost in preparing a room for his reception .
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 11]: Gulping down his anguish , Dale mounted and made off .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 19]: At a distant bend in the road he turned his head and looked back along that dismal heath .
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 20]: All five were packed in the cab , and the coachman was urging the unwilling horse into a trot .
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 10]: * * * * * And what of Cynthia ?
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 29]: The break in the weather was the one thing needed to put an abrupt end to all pretense of enjoyment so far as the Windermere tourists were concerned .
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 11]: Strained relations existed from the moment Vanrenen arrived at Chester .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 51]: For the first time in her life , Cynthia thought that her father was not acting with the open-eyed justice which she expected from him , and for the first time in his life Peter Vanrenen harbored an uneasy suspicion that his daughter had not been quite candid with him .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 34]: It was impossible , of course , in the close intimacy of long hours spent together in a touring car , that there should not be many references to Fitzroy and the Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 56]: They were inevitable as the milestones , and Vanrenen , who was just as prone as other men to look at facts through his own spectacles , failed to understand how an intelligent girl like his daughter could remain in constant association with Viscount Medenham for five days , and yet not discover his identity .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 49]: More than once , indeed , notwithstanding the caution exercised by the others -- engaged now in a tacit conspiracy to dispel memories of a foolish entanglement from the girl 's mind -- the identification of Fitzroy with the young Viscount trembled on the very lip of discovery .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 46]: Thus , on Friday , when they had motored to Grasmere , and had gathered before lunch in the lounge of the delightfully old-fashioned Rothay Hotel , Vanrenen happened to pick up an illustrated paper , containing a page of pictures of the Scarland short-horns .
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 22]: Now , being a busy man , he gave little heed to the terminological convolutions of names among the British aristocracy .
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 54]: He had not the slightest notion that the Marquis of Scarland 's wife was Medenham 's sister , and , with the quick interest of the stock-breeder , he pointed out to Mrs. Leland an animal that resembled one of his own pedigree bulls , at present waxing fat on the Montana ranch .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 15]: For the moment Mrs. Leland herself had forgotten the relationship between the two men .
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 16]: `` I met the Marquis last year at San Remo , '' she said heedlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 12]: `` Anyone more unlike a British peer you could not imagine .
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 20]: If I remember rightly , he is a blunt , farmer-like person , but his wife is very charming .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 9]: By the way , who was she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 10]: Such a question could not pass Mrs. Devar unanswered .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 10]: `` Lady Betty Fitzroy , '' she chirped instantly .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 44]: Cynthia , who was looking through the window at the square-towered little church , throned midst the somber yews which shelter the graves of Wordsworth and his kin , caught the odd conjunction of names -- `` Betty '' and `` Fitzroy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 12]: `` Who is that you are speaking of , father ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 22]: she asked , though with a listless air that Medenham had never seen during any minute of those five happy days .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 36]: `` The Marquis of Scarland -- the man from whom I bought some cattle a few years ago , '' he said , trusting to the directness of the reply to carry it through unchallenged .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 9]: Cynthia 's brows puckered in a reflective frown .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 9]: `` That is odd , '' she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 6]: `` What is odd ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 18]: asked her father , while Mrs. Leland bent over the periodical to hide a smile of embarrassment .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 17]: `` Oh , just a curious way of running in grooves people have in this country .
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 11]: They call towns after men and men after towns . ''
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 34]: She was about to add that Fitzroy had told her of a sister Betty who was married to a man named Scarland , a breeder of pedigree stock , but checked the impulse .
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 44]: For some reason known best to her father , he did not seem to wish any mention to be made of the vanished chauffeur , but she did not gauge the true extent of his readiness to drop the subject on that occasion .
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 22]: Mrs. Leland looked up , caught his eye with a smile , and asked how many miles it was to Thirlmere .
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 16]: Cynthia 's thoughts brooded again on poets and lonely graves , and the danger passed .
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 12]: Mrs. Devar , in these days , had recovered her complacency .
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 29]: The letter she wrote from Symon 's Yat had reached Vanrenen from Paris , and its hearty disapproval of Fitzroy helped to re-establish his good opinion of her .
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 12]: She heard constantly , too , from Marigny and her son .
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 17]: Both agreed that the comet-like flight of Medenham across their horizon was rapidly losing its significance .
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 8]: Still , she was not quite happy .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 79]: Mrs. Leland 's advent had thrust her into the background , for the American widow was rich , good-looking , and cultured , and the flow of small talk between the newcomer and Cynthia left her as hopelessly out of range as used to be the case when that domineering Medenham would lean back in the car and say things beyond her comprehension , or murmur them to Cynthia if she happened to be sitting by his side .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 27]: Luncheon had ended , but the clouds which had been gathering over the lake country during the morning suddenly poured a deluge over a thirsty land .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 28]: Thirlmere and Ullswater and the rest of the glories of Westmoreland that lay beyond the pass of Dunmail Raise were swallowed up in a fog of rain .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 25]: Simmonds , questioned by the millionaire , admitted that a weather-beaten native had prophesied `` a week of it , '' more or less .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 41]: Four Britons might have sat down and played Bridge stolidly , but three of this quartette were Americans , and within two hours of the change in the elements , they were seated in the London-bound train at Windermere Station .
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 16]: Not one of them was really displeased because of this rapid alteration in their plans .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 80]: Cynthia was ill at ease ; Mrs. Leland wished to rejoin her guests at Trouville ; Vanrenen , who was anxious to complete certain business negotiations in Paris , believed that a complete change of scene and new interests in life would speedily bring Cynthia back to her own cheery self ; while Mrs. Devar , though the abandonment of the tour meant reversion to a cheap boarding-house , was not sorry that it had come to an end .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 47]: In London , she would be more in her element , and , at any rate , she was beginning to feel cramped through sitting three in a row in Simmonds 's car , after the luxurious comfort of two in the tonneau of the Mercury .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 37]: So it came to pass that on Friday evening , while Medenham was driving from Cavendish Square to Charing Cross , Cynthia was crossing London on a converging line from St. Pancras to the Savoy Hotel .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 25]: Strange , indeed , was the play of Fate 's shuttle that it should have so nearly reunited the unseen threads of their destinies !
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 12]: Again , a trifling circumstance conspired to detain Vanrenen in London .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 56]: One of his business associates in Paris , rendered impatient by the failure of the great man to return as quickly as he had promised , arrived in England by the afternoon service from the Gare du Nord , and was actually standing in the foyer of the hotel when Vanrenen entered with the others .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 34]: As a result of this meeting , the journey to Paris arranged for Saturday was postponed till Sunday , and on this trivial base was destined to be built a very remarkable edifice .
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 24]: It chanced that Mrs. Leland , too , decided to have a day in London , and she and Cynthia went out early .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 29]: They returned to lunch at the hotel , and the girl , pleading lack of appetite , slipped out alone to buy a copy of Milton 's poems .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 11]: From the book-seller 's she wandered into the Embankment Gardens .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 34]: She was a dutiful daughter , and had resolved to obey without question her father 's stern command not to enter again into communication with a man of whom he so strongly disapproved .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 26]: But she was not content , for all that , and the dripping trees and rain-sodden flowers seemed now to accord with her distraught mood .
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 35]: The fine , though not bright , interval that had tempted her forth soon gave way to another shower , and she ran for shelter into the Charing Cross Station of the Metropolitan Railway .
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 27]: She stood in one of the doorways looking out disconsolately over the river , when a taxicab drove up and deposited its occupant at the station .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 11]: Then some unbidden impulse led her to hail the driver .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 11]: `` Take me to Cavendish Square , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 7]: `` What number , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4862 len. 4]: `` No number .
Parsing [sent. 4863 len. 14]: Just drive slowly round the square and return to the Savoy Hotel . ''
Parsing [sent. 4864 len. 10]: He eyed her curiously , but made no comment .
Parsing [sent. 4865 len. 29]: Soon she was speeding up Regent Street , bent on gratifying the truly curious whim of seeing what manner of residence it was that Fitzroy occupied in London .
Parsing [sent. 4866 len. 25]: Fate had failed in her weaving during the previous evening , but on the present occasion she combined warp and weft without any error .
Parsing [sent. 4867 len. 77]: The cab was crawling past the Fairholme mansion , and Cynthia 's astonished eyes were regarding its style and general air of magnificence with some degree of heart-sinking -- for it did then seem to be true that Mrs. Devar 's original estimate of Fitzroy was correct -- when a man sprang out of another taxi in front of the door , and glanced at her while in the very act of running up the steps .
Parsing [sent. 4868 len. 4]: Recognition was mutual .
Parsing [sent. 4869 len. 28]: Dale muttered under his breath a wholly unjustifiable assumption as to his future state , halted dubiously , and then signaled to Cynthia 's driver to stop .
Parsing [sent. 4870 len. 17]: He strode towards her across the road , and thrust his head through the open window .
Parsing [sent. 4871 len. 21]: `` Of course , miss , '' he said roughly , `` you do n't know what has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4872 len. 16]: `` No , '' she said , too greatly surprised to resent his strange manner .
Parsing [sent. 4873 len. 22]: `` Well , '' he growled , `` somebody 's been nearly killed on your account , that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4874 len. 13]: `` Somebody , '' she repeated , and her lips went white .
Parsing [sent. 4875 len. 13]: `` Yes , you ought to guess well enough who it is .
Parsing [sent. 4876 len. 25]: He and that rotten Frenchman fought a duel this morning on the sands near Calais , and Marinny as good as murdered him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4877 len. 36]: Dale 's heart was sore against her as the cause of his master 's plight , but even in his own distress he was quick to see the shrinking terror in the girl 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 4878 len. 9]: `` Are you speaking of Mr. Fitzroy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4879 len. 3]: she demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4880 len. 7]: `` Are you telling the truth ?
Parsing [sent. 4881 len. 16]: Oh , for Heaven 's sake , man , tell me what you mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 4882 len. 15]: `` I mean what I say , miss , '' said he more softly .
Parsing [sent. 4883 len. 16]: `` I have left him almost at death 's door in an hotel at Calais .
Parsing [sent. 4884 len. 48]: That damned Frenchman ... I beg your pardon , miss , but I ca n't contain myself when I think of him -- ran a sword through him this morning , and would have killed him outright if he had n't been stopped by some other gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 4885 len. 40]: And now , there he is , a-lying in the hotel , with a doctor and a nurse trying to coax the life back into him , while I had to scurry back here to tell his people . ''
Parsing [sent. 4886 len. 12]: Some women might have shrieked and fainted -- not so Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 4887 len. 15]: At that instant there was one thing to be done , and one only .
Parsing [sent. 4888 len. 18]: She saw the open road , and took it without faltering or thought as to the future .
Parsing [sent. 4889 len. 10]: `` When is the next train to Calais ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4890 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 4891 len. 9]: `` At nine o'clock to-night , miss . ''
Parsing [sent. 4892 len. 6]: `` Oh , God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4893 len. 6]: she wailed under her breath .
Parsing [sent. 4894 len. 8]: Dale 's voice grew even more sympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 4895 len. 12]: `` Was you a-thinking of going to him , miss ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4896 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 4897 len. 12]: `` Would that I could fly there , '' she moaned .
Parsing [sent. 4898 len. 19]: He scratched the back of his ear , for it was by such means that Dale sought inspiration .
Parsing [sent. 4899 len. 6]: `` Dash it all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4900 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4901 len. 12]: `` I wish I had seen you half an hour earlier .
Parsing [sent. 4902 len. 14]: There is a train that leaves Charing Cross at twenty minutes past two .
Parsing [sent. 4903 len. 19]: It goes by way of Folkestone and Boulogne , and from Boulogne one can get easy to Calais .
Parsing [sent. 4904 len. 16]: Anyhow , what 's the use of talkin ' -- it is too late . ''
Parsing [sent. 4905 len. 6]: Cynthia glanced at her watch .
Parsing [sent. 4906 len. 8]: It was just twenty-five minutes to three .
Parsing [sent. 4907 len. 7]: `` How far is Folkestone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4908 len. 11]: was the immediate demand generated by her practical American brain .
Parsing [sent. 4909 len. 17]: `` Seventy-two miles , '' said the chauffeur , who knew his roads out of London .
Parsing [sent. 4910 len. 10]: `` And what time does the boat leave ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4911 len. 11]: A light irradiated his face , and he swore volubly .
Parsing [sent. 4912 len. 7]: `` We can do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4913 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4914 len. 10]: `` By the Lord , we can do it !
Parsing [sent. 4915 len. 5]: Are you game ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4916 len. 2]: Game ?
Parsing [sent. 4917 len. 11]: The light that leaped to her eyes was sufficient answer .
Parsing [sent. 4918 len. 33]: He tore open the door of the cab , roaring to the driver : `` Round that corner to the right -- quick -- then into the mews at the back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4919 len. 22]: Within two minutes the Mercury was attracting the attention of the police as it whirled through the traffic towards Westminster Bridge .
Parsing [sent. 4920 len. 11]: Dale 's face was set like a block of granite .
Parsing [sent. 4921 len. 48]: He had risked a good deal in leaving his master at the point of death at Calais ; he was now risking more , far more , in rushing back to Calais again without having discharged the duty which had dragged him from that master 's bedside .
Parsing [sent. 4922 len. 31]: But he thought he had secured the best physician London could bring to the sufferer 's aid , and the belief sustained him in an action that was almost heroic .
Parsing [sent. 4923 len. 57]: He was a simple-minded fellow , with a marked taste for speed in both animals and machinery , but he had hit on one well-defined trait in human nature when he decided that if a man is dying for the sake of a woman the presence of that woman may cure when all else will fail .
Parsing [sent. 4924 len. 21]: CHAPTER XVI THE END OF ONE TOUR : THE BEGINNING OF ANOTHER Cynthia found him lying in a darkened room .
Parsing [sent. 4925 len. 44]: The nurse had just raised some of the blinds ; a dismal day was drawing to its close , and more light was needed ere she could distinguish marked bottles , and doses , and the rest of the appurtenances of dangerous illness .
Parsing [sent. 4926 len. 25]: An English nurse would have forbidden the presence of a stranger ; this French one acted with more discretion if less of strict science .
Parsing [sent. 4927 len. 9]: `` Madam is his sister , perhaps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4928 len. 3]: she whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4929 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 4930 len. 7]: `` A relative , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4931 len. 10]: `` No ; a woman who loves him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4932 len. 12]: That heartbroken admission told the whole tale to the quick-witted Frenchwoman .
Parsing [sent. 4933 len. 57]: There had been a duel ; one man was seriously injured ; the other , she had heard , was also receiving medical attention in another hotel -- the _ t√©moins _ , wistful to avoid the interrogation of the law , had so arranged -- and here was the woman who had caused the quarrel .
Parsing [sent. 4934 len. 9]: Well , such was the will of Providence !
Parsing [sent. 4935 len. 45]: These things had been since man and woman were expelled from Paradise -- for the nurse , though a devout Catholic , suspected that Genesis had suppressed certain details of the first fratricide -- and would continue , she supposed , until the Millennium .
Parsing [sent. 4936 len. 4]: She nodded cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4937 len. 34]: `` There is every reason to hope , but he must not be disturbed -- not excited , that is , '' she added , seeing the wan agony in Cynthia 's face .
Parsing [sent. 4938 len. 10]: The girl tiptoed to the side of the bed .
Parsing [sent. 4939 len. 12]: Medenham 's eyes were closed , but he was muttering something .
Parsing [sent. 4940 len. 19]: She bent and kissed his forehead , and a strange smile broke through the tense lines of pain .
Parsing [sent. 4941 len. 14]: Even in his semi-conscious state he felt the touch of those exquisite lips .
Parsing [sent. 4942 len. 6]: `` My Lady Alice ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4943 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4944 len. 6]: She choked back a sob .
Parsing [sent. 4945 len. 20]: He was dreaming of `` Comus '' -- standing with her in the ruined banqueting hall of Ludlow Castle .
Parsing [sent. 4946 len. 11]: `` Yes , your Lady Alice , '' she breathed .
Parsing [sent. 4947 len. 6]: A slight quiver shook him .
Parsing [sent. 4948 len. 11]: `` Do n't tell Cynthia , '' he said brokenly .
Parsing [sent. 4949 len. 29]: `` She must never know ... Ah , if I had n't slipped , I would have quieted his viperish tongue ... But Cynthia must not know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4950 len. 13]: `` Oh , my dear , my dear , Cynthia does know !
Parsing [sent. 4951 len. 7]: It is you who know not .
Parsing [sent. 4952 len. 7]: Kind Heaven , let him live !
Parsing [sent. 4953 len. 12]: Grant that I may tell him all that I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4954 len. 23]: She could not help it ; the words welled forth of their own accord ; but the nurse touched her arm gently .
Parsing [sent. 4955 len. 14]: `` It is a little fever , '' she whispered with ready sympathy .
Parsing [sent. 4956 len. 6]: `` Soon it will pass .
Parsing [sent. 4957 len. 22]: He will sleep , and , when he awakes , it is perhaps permissible that you should speak to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4958 len. 11]: * * * * * Well , it was permissible .
Parsing [sent. 4959 len. 11]: The age of miracles had not passed for those two .
Parsing [sent. 4960 len. 62]: Even the experienced doctor marveled at the strength of a man who at four o'clock in the morning could have a sword driven through the tissues in perilous proximity to the right lung , and yet , at nine o'clock on that same night , was able to announce an unalterable resolution to get up and dress for breakfast next day .
Parsing [sent. 4961 len. 15]: That , of course , was a pleasing fiction intended for Cynthia 's benefit .
Parsing [sent. 4962 len. 6]: It served its purpose admirably .
Parsing [sent. 4963 len. 21]: The kindly nurse displayed an unexpected firmness in leading her to her own room , there to eat and sleep .
Parsing [sent. 4964 len. 8]: For Cynthia had an ordeal to face .
Parsing [sent. 4965 len. 64]: Many things had been said in the car during that mad rush to Folkestone , and on board the steamer which ferried Dale and herself to Boulogne she had wrung from the taciturn chauffeur a full , true , and particular account of Medenham , his family , and his doings throughout as much of his life as Dale either knew or guessed .
Parsing [sent. 4966 len. 17]: By the time they reached Boulogne she had made up her mind with a characteristic decision .
Parsing [sent. 4967 len. 38]: One long telegram to her father , another to Lord Fairholme , caused heart-burning and dismay not alone in certain apartments of the Savoy Hotel , but in the aristocratic aloofness of Cavendish Square and Curzon Street .
Parsing [sent. 4968 len. 51]: As a result , two elderly men , a younger one , in the person of the Marquis of Scarland , and two tearful women -- Lady St. Maur and Mrs. Leland -- met at Charing Cross about one o'clock in the morning to travel by special train and steamer .
Parsing [sent. 4969 len. 23]: Another woman telegraphed from Shropshire saying that baby was better , and that she would follow by the first steamer on Sunday .
Parsing [sent. 4970 len. 7]: Mrs. Devar did not await developments .
Parsing [sent. 4971 len. 11]: She fled , dinnerless , to some burrow in Bayswater .
Parsing [sent. 4972 len. 49]: These alarums and excursions were accompanied by the ringing of telephones and the flight of carriages back and forth through muddy London , and Cynthia was called on to deal with a whole sheaf of telegrams which demanded replies either to Dover or to Scarland Towers in Shropshire .
Parsing [sent. 4973 len. 41]: With a man like Vanrenen at one end , however , and a woman like his daughter at the other , it might be fairly assumed that even the most complex skein of circumstances might be resolved from its tangle .
Parsing [sent. 4974 len. 29]: As a matter of curious coincidence , the vessel which carried Marigny to England passed in mid-Channel its sister ship conveying the grief-stricken party of relatives to France .
Parsing [sent. 4975 len. 50]: It happened , too , that the clouds from the Atlantic elected to hover over Britain rather than France , and when Cynthia stood on the quay to meet the incoming steamer , a burst of sunshine from the east gave promise of a fine if somewhat blustery day .
Parsing [sent. 4976 len. 21]: Five pairs of eyes sought her face anxiously while the vessel was warping to the quay opposite the Gare Maritime .
Parsing [sent. 4977 len. 12]: They looked there for tidings , and they were not disappointed .
Parsing [sent. 4978 len. 17]: `` That 's all right , '' said Vanrenen with an unwonted huskiness in his voice .
Parsing [sent. 4979 len. 13]: `` Cynthia would n't smile if she had n't good news . ''
Parsing [sent. 4980 len. 7]: `` Thank God for that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4981 len. 25]: muttered the Earl , bending his head to examine a landing ticket , the clear type of which he was utterly unable to read .
Parsing [sent. 4982 len. 19]: `` I never thought for a minute that any Frenchman could kill George , '' cried Scarland cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 4983 len. 32]: But the two women said nothing , could see nothing , and the white-faced but smiling Cynthia standing near the shoreward end of the gangway had vanished in a sudden mist .
Parsing [sent. 4984 len. 39]: Of course , Marigny was right when he foresaw that Vanrenen could not meet either Medenham or any of his relatives for five minutes without his `` poor little cobweb of intrigue '' being dissipated once and forever .
Parsing [sent. 4985 len. 89]: With the marvelous insight that every woman possesses when dealing with the affairs of the man she loves , Cynthia combined the eloquence of an orator with the practiced skill of a clever lawyer in revealing each turn and twist of the toils which had enveloped her since that day in Paris when her father happened to suggest in Marigny 's hearing that she might utilize his hired car for a tour in England , while he concluded the business that was detaining him in the French Capital .
Parsing [sent. 4986 len. 39]: Nothing escaped her ; she unraveled every knot ; Medenham 's few broken words , supplemented by the letter to his brother-in-law which he told her to obtain from Dale , threw light on all the dark places .
Parsing [sent. 4987 len. 6]: But the gloom had fled .
Parsing [sent. 4988 len. 23]: It was a keenly interested , almost light-hearted , little party that walked through the sunshine to the H√¥tel de la Plage .
Parsing [sent. 4989 len. 52]: * * * * * Dale , abashed , sheepish , yet oddly confident that all was for the best in a queer world , met the Earl of Fairholme later in the day ; his lordship , who had been pining for someone to pitch into , addressed him sternly .
Parsing [sent. 4990 len. 15]: `` This is a nice game you 've been playing , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4991 len. 29]: `` I always thought you were a man of steady habits , a little given to horse-racing perhaps , but otherwise a decent member of the community . ''
Parsing [sent. 4992 len. 19]: `` So I was before I met Viscount Medenham , my lord , '' was the daring answer .
Parsing [sent. 4993 len. 24]: For Dale was no fool , and he had long since seen how certain apparently hostile forces had adapted themselves to new conditions .
Parsing [sent. 4994 len. 14]: `` Before you left him , you mean , '' growled the Earl .
Parsing [sent. 4995 len. 14]: `` What sort of sense was there in letting him fight a duel ?
Parsing [sent. 4996 len. 12]: -- it could have been stopped in fifty different ways . ''
Parsing [sent. 4997 len. 33]: `` Yes , my lord , but I never suspicioned a word of it till he went off in the cab with them -- '' The Earl held up a warning finger .
Parsing [sent. 4998 len. 23]: `` Hush , '' he said , `` this is France , remember , and _ you _ are the foreigner here .
Parsing [sent. 4999 len. 8]: Where is my son 's car ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5000 len. 11]: `` In the garage at Folkestone , my lord . ''
Parsing [sent. 5001 len. 17]: `` Well , you had better cross by an early boat to-morrow and bring it here .
Parsing [sent. 5002 len. 9]: You understand all the preliminaries , I suppose ?
Parsing [sent. 5003 len. 20]: Find out from the Customs people what deposit is necessary , and come to me for the money . ''
Parsing [sent. 5004 len. 31]: So it happened that when Medenham was able to take his first drive in the open air , the Mercury awaited him and Cynthia at the door of the hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5005 len. 15]: It positively sparkled in the sunlight ; never was car more spick and span .
Parsing [sent. 5006 len. 25]: The brasswork scintillated , each cylinder was rhythmical , and a microscope would not have revealed one speck of dust on body or upholstery .
Parsing [sent. 5007 len. 98]: * * * * * On a day in July -- for everybody agreed that not even a marriage should be allowed to interfere with the Scottish festival of St. Grouse -- that same shining Mercury with the tonneau decorously cased in glass for the hour , drew up at the edge of a red carpet laid down from curb to stately porch of St. George 's , Hanover Square , and Dale turned a grinning face to the doorway when Viscount Medenham led his bride down the steps through a shower of rice and good wishes .
Parsing [sent. 5008 len. 67]: Wedding breakfasts and receptions are all `` much of a muchness , '' as the Mad Hatter said to another Alice , and it was not until the Mercury was speeding north by west to Scarland Towers , `` lent to the happy pair for the honeymoon '' while Betty took the children to recuperate at the seaside , that Cynthia felt she was really married .
Parsing [sent. 5009 len. 22]: `` I have a bit of news for you , '' said her husband , taking a letter from his pocket .
Parsing [sent. 5010 len. 11]: `` I received a letter by this morning 's post .
Parsing [sent. 5011 len. 34]: A heap of others remain unopened till you and I have time to go through them ; but this one caught my attention , and I read it while I was dressing . ''
Parsing [sent. 5012 len. 29]: He had an excellent excuse for putting his arm round her waist while he held the open sheet so that both might peruse it at the same time .
Parsing [sent. 5013 len. 20]: It ran : MY DEAR VISCOUNT -- Of course I meant to kill you , but fate decided otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 5014 len. 47]: Indeed , with my usual candor , which by this time you may have learned to admire , I may add that only the special kind of dog 's luck which attaches itself to members of my family , saved me from being killed by you .
Parsing [sent. 5015 len. 7]: But that is ancient history now .
Parsing [sent. 5016 len. 13]: I am glad to hear that your wound was not really serious .
Parsing [sent. 5017 len. 19]: There was no sense in merely crippling you -- my only chance lay in procuring your untimely demise .
Parsing [sent. 5018 len. 41]: Having failed , however , I want to tell you , with the utmost sincerity , that I never had the slightest intention of carrying out my abominable threat in regard to the fair lady who is now Viscountess Medenham .
Parsing [sent. 5019 len. 24]: Were you other than a heavy-witted and thick-skinned Briton , you would have known that I was goading you into issuing a challenge .
Parsing [sent. 5020 len. 27]: This piece of information is my wedding present ; it is all I can give , because , metaphorically speaking , I have n't a sou !
Parsing [sent. 5021 len. 22]: I am , as you see , domiciled in Brussels , where my car is attached by an unsympathetic hotel proprietor .
Parsing [sent. 5022 len. 40]: Still , I am devoid of rancor , and mean to keep a sharp eye for a well-favored and well-dowered wife ; such a one , in fact , as you managed to snap up under my very nose .
Parsing [sent. 5023 len. 15]: With a thousand compliments , I am , Yours very sincerely , EDOUARD MARIGNY .
Parsing [sent. 5024 len. 18]: P.S. -- Devar went `` steerage '' to the United States when he heard of our affair .
Parsing [sent. 5025 len. 13]: He thought it was all up with you , and with him .
Parsing [sent. 5026 len. 5]: `` The wretch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5027 len. 3]: murmured Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 5028 len. 15]: `` Can he really believe even yet that I would have married him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5029 len. 20]: `` I do n't care tuppence what he believes , '' said Medenham , giving her a reassuring hug .
Parsing [sent. 5030 len. 20]: `` Indeed , I have a mind to write and ask him how much he owes in that hotel .
Parsing [sent. 5031 len. 30]: Do n't you see , my dear , that if it had n't been for Marigny there was a chance that I might have left you at Bristol . ''
Parsing [sent. 5032 len. 4]: `` Never ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5033 len. 3]: cooed Cynthia .
Parsing [sent. 5034 len. 25]: `` Well , now I have got you , I am beginning to imagine all sorts of terrible possibilities which might have parted us .
Parsing [sent. 5035 len. 17]: I remember thinking , when my foot slipped ... '' `` Oh , do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5036 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 5037 len. 10]: `` I ca n't bear to hear of that .
Parsing [sent. 5038 len. 29]: Sometimes , in Calais , I awoke screaming , and then I knew I had seen it in my dreams ... There , you have disarranged my hat !
Parsing [sent. 5039 len. 25]: ... But I do n't think much of _ your _ budget , anyhow ; mine is a great deal more to the point .
Parsing [sent. 5040 len. 17]: My father told me this morning that he is sure he will feel very lonely now .
Parsing [sent. 5041 len. 47]: He never meant , he said , to put anyone in my dear mother 's place , but he will miss me so greatly -- that , perhaps , Mrs. Leland -- '' `` By Jove , '' cried Medenham , `` that will be splendid !
Parsing [sent. 5042 len. 5]: I like Mrs. Leland .
Parsing [sent. 5043 len. 30]: At one time , do you know , I rather fancied she might become my step-mother , now it seems I shall have to greet her as a mother-in-law .
Parsing [sent. 5044 len. 13]: She was bound to come into the family one way or another .
Parsing [sent. 5045 len. 7]: When is it to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5046 len. 4]: Cynthia laughed delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 5047 len. 12]: `` Father looked _ so _ confused when I asked him .
Parsing [sent. 5048 len. 35]: Say , would n't it be a joke if Simmonds brought them to Scarland Towers one day , and they were announced by some solemn footman as ` Mr. and Mrs. Vanrenen ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 5049 len. 13]: `` Cynthia , you _ know _ , '' he teased her .
Parsing [sent. 5050 len. 17]: `` I do n't know , but I am a good guesser , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 5051 len. 4]: And she was .
Parsing [sent. 5052 len. 2]: THE END
