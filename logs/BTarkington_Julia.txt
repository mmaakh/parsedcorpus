Parsing [sent. 1 len. 18]: GENTLE JULIA BY BOOTH TARKINGTON AUTHOR OF PENROD , PENROD AND SAM , THE TURMOIL , ETC. .
Parsing [sent. 2 len. 100]: ILLUSTRATED BY C. ALLAN GILBERT and WORTH BREHM GROSSET & DUNLAP PUBLISHERS NEW YORK GENTLE JULIA `` Rising to the point of order , this one said that since the morgue was not yet established as the central monument and inspiration of our settlement , and true philosophy was as well expounded in the convivial manner as in the miserable , he claimed for himself , not the license , but the right , to sing a ballad , if he chose , upon even so solemn a matter as the misuse of the town pump by witches . ''
Parsing [sent. 3 len. 56]: GENTLE JULIA CHAPTER ONE Superciliousness is not safe after all , because a person who forms the habit of wearing it may some day find his lower lip grown permanently projected beyond the upper , so that he ca n't get it back , and must go through life looking like the King of Spain .
Parsing [sent. 4 len. 59]: This was once foretold as a probable culmination of Florence Atwater 's still plastic profile , if Florence did n't change her way of thinking ; and upon Florence 's remarking dreamily that the King of Spain was an awf ` ly han ` some man , her mother retorted : `` But not for a girl ! ''
Parsing [sent. 5 len. 31]: She meant , of course , that a girl who looked too much like the King of Spain would not be handsome , but her daughter decided to misunderstand her .
Parsing [sent. 6 len. 11]: `` Why , mamma , he 's my Very Ideal !
Parsing [sent. 7 len. 7]: I 'd marry him to-morrow ! ''
Parsing [sent. 8 len. 20]: Mrs. Atwater paused in her darning , and let the stocking collapse flaccidly into the work-basket in her lap .
Parsing [sent. 9 len. 10]: `` Not at barely thirteen , would you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 10 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 11 len. 27]: `` It seems to me you 're just a shade too young to be marrying a man who 's already got a wife and several children .
Parsing [sent. 12 len. 16]: Where did you pick up that ` I 'd - marry-him-to-morrow , ' Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 13 len. 9]: `` Oh , I hear that everywhere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 14 len. 6]: returned the damsel , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 15 len. 7]: `` Everybody says things like that .
Parsing [sent. 16 len. 7]: I heard Aunt Julia say it .
Parsing [sent. 17 len. 8]: I heard Kitty Silver say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 18 len. 8]: `` About the King of Spain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 19 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater inquired .
Parsing [sent. 20 len. 23]: `` I do n't know who they were saying it about , '' said Florence , `` but they were saying it .
Parsing [sent. 21 len. 26]: I do n't mean they were saying it together ; I heard one say it one time and the other say it some other time .
Parsing [sent. 22 len. 12]: I think Kitty Silver was saying it about some coloured man .
Parsing [sent. 23 len. 22]: She proba ` ly would n't want to marry any white man ; at least I do n't expect she would .
Parsing [sent. 24 len. 33]: She 's _ been _ married to a couple of coloured men , anyhow ; and she was married twice to one of 'em , and the other one died in between .
Parsing [sent. 25 len. 9]: Anyhow , that 's what she told me .
Parsing [sent. 26 len. 53]: She weighed over two hunderd pounds the first time she was married , and she weighed over two hunderd-and-seventy the last time she was married to the first one over again , but she says she do n't know how much she weighed when she was married to the one in between .
Parsing [sent. 27 len. 16]: She says she never got weighed all the time she was married to that one .
Parsing [sent. 28 len. 11]: Did Kitty Silver ever tell you that , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 29 len. 6]: `` Yes , often ! ''
Parsing [sent. 30 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater replied .
Parsing [sent. 31 len. 20]: `` I do n't think it 's very entertaining ; and it 's not what we were talking about .
Parsing [sent. 32 len. 16]: I was trying to tell you -- '' `` I know , '' Florence interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 33 len. 39]: `` You said I 'd get my face so 's my underlip would n't go back where it ought to , if I did n't quit turning up my nose at people I think are beneath contemp ' .
Parsing [sent. 34 len. 29]: I guess the best thing would be to just feel that way without letting on by my face , and then there would n't be any danger . ''
Parsing [sent. 35 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Mrs. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 36 len. 8]: `` That 's not what I meant .
Parsing [sent. 37 len. 60]: You must n't let your feelings get _ their _ nose turned up , or their underlip out , either , because feelings can grow warped just as well as -- '' But her remarks had already caused her daughter to follow a trail of thought divergent from the main road along which the mother feebly struggled to progress .
Parsing [sent. 38 len. 48]: `` Mamma , '' said Florence , `` do you b ` lieve it 's true if a person swallows an apple-seed or a lemon-seed or a watermelon-seed , f ' r instance , do you think they 'd have a tree grow up inside of 'em ?
Parsing [sent. 39 len. 9]: Henry Rooter said it would , yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 40 len. 7]: Mrs. Atwater looked a little anxious .
Parsing [sent. 41 len. 10]: `` Did you swallow some sort of seed ? ''
Parsing [sent. 42 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 43 len. 37]: `` It was only some grape-seeds , mamma ; and you need n't think I got to take anything for it , because I 've swallowed a million , I guess , in my time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 44 len. 6]: `` In your time ? ''
Parsing [sent. 45 len. 7]: her mother repeated , seemingly mystified .
Parsing [sent. 46 len. 15]: `` Yes , and so have you and papa , '' Florence went on .
Parsing [sent. 47 len. 10]: `` I 've seen you when you ate grapes .
Parsing [sent. 48 len. 94]: Henry said maybe not , about grapes , because I told him all what I 've just been telling you , mamma , how I must have swallowed a million , in my time , and he said grape-seeds were n't big enough to get a good holt , but he said if I was to swallow an apple-seed a tree would start up , and in a year or two , maybe , it would grow up so ' t I could n't get my mouth shut on account the branches . ''
Parsing [sent. 49 len. 4]: `` Nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 50 len. 26]: `` Henry said another boy told _ him _ , but he said you could ask anybody and they 'd tell you it was true .
Parsing [sent. 51 len. 35]: Henry said this boy that told him 's uncle died of it when he was eleven years old , and this boy knew a grown woman that was pretty sick from it right now .
Parsing [sent. 52 len. 32]: I expect Henry was n't telling such a falsehood about it , mamma , but proba ` ly this boy did , because I did n't believe it for a minute !
Parsing [sent. 53 len. 29]: Henry Rooter says he never told a lie _ yet _ , in his whole life , mamma , and he was n't going to begin now . ''
Parsing [sent. 54 len. 20]: She paused for a moment , then added : `` I do n't believe a word he says ! ''
Parsing [sent. 55 len. 9]: She continued to meditate disapprovingly upon Henry Rooter .
Parsing [sent. 56 len. 5]: `` Old thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 57 len. 16]: she murmured gloomily , for she had indeed known moments of apprehension concerning the grape-seeds .
Parsing [sent. 58 len. 12]: `` Nothing but an old thing -- what he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 59 len. 4]: she repeated inaudibly .
Parsing [sent. 60 len. 32]: `` Florence , '' said Mrs. Atwater , `` do n't you want to slip over to grandpa 's and ask Aunt Julia if she has a very large darning needle ?
Parsing [sent. 61 len. 16]: And do n't forget not to look supercilious when you meet people on the way .
Parsing [sent. 62 len. 20]: Even your grandfather has been noticing it , and he was the one that spoke of it to me .
Parsing [sent. 63 len. 5]: Do n't forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 64 len. 5]: `` Yes 'm . ''
Parsing [sent. 65 len. 48]: Florence went out of the house somewhat moodily , but afternoon sunshine enlivened her ; and , opening the picket gate , she stepped forth with a fair renewal of her chosen manner toward the public , though just at that moment no public was in sight .
Parsing [sent. 66 len. 29]: Miss Atwater 's underlip resumed the position for which her mother had predicted that regal Spanish fixity , and her eyebrows and nose were all three perceptibly elevated .
Parsing [sent. 67 len. 50]: At the same time , her eyelids were half lowered , while the corners of her mouth somewhat deepened , as by a veiled mirth , so that this well-dressed child strolled down the shady sidewalk wearing an expression not merely of high-bred contempt but also of mysterious derision .
Parsing [sent. 68 len. 33]: It was an expression that should have put any pedestrian in his place , and it seems a pity that the long street before her appeared to be empty of human life .
Parsing [sent. 69 len. 62]: No one even so much as glanced from a window of any of the comfortable houses , set back at the end of their `` front walks '' and basking amid pleasant lawns ; for , naturally , this was the `` best residence street '' in the town , since all the Atwaters and other relatives of Florence dwelt there .
Parsing [sent. 70 len. 33]: Happily , an old gentleman turned a corner before she had gone a hundred yards , and , as he turned in her direction , it became certain that they would meet .
Parsing [sent. 71 len. 54]: He was a stranger -- that is to say , he was unknown to Florence -- and he was well dressed ; while his appearance of age -LRB- proba ` ly at least forty or sixty or something -RRB- indicated that he might have sense enough to be interested in other interesting persons .
Parsing [sent. 72 len. 39]: An extraordinary change took place upon the surface of Florence Atwater : all superciliousness and derision of the world vanished ; her eyes opened wide , and into them came a look at once far-away and intently fixed .
Parsing [sent. 73 len. 33]: Also , a frown of concentration appeared upon her brow , and her lips moved silently , but with rapidity , as if she repeated to herself something of almost tragic import .
Parsing [sent. 74 len. 64]: Florence had recently read a newspaper account of the earlier struggles of a now successful actress : As a girl , this determined genius went about the streets repeating the lines of various roles to herself -- constantly rehearsing , in fact , upon the public thoroughfares , so carried away was she by her intended profession and so set upon becoming famous .
Parsing [sent. 75 len. 50]: This was what Florence was doing now , except that she rehearsed no rôle in particular , and the words formed by her lips were neither sequential nor consequential , being , in fact , the following : `` Oh , the darkness ... never , never , never !
Parsing [sent. 76 len. 13]: ... you could n't ... he would n't ... Ah , mother !
Parsing [sent. 77 len. 15]: ... Where the river swings so slowly ... Ah , _ no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 78 len. 80]: Nevertheless , she was doing all she could for the elderly stranger , and as they came closer , encountered , and passed on , she had the definite impression that he did indeed take her to be a struggling young actress who would some day be famous -- and then he might see her on a night of triumph and recognize her as the girl he had passed on the street , that day , so long ago !
Parsing [sent. 79 len. 53]: But by this time , the episode was concluded ; the footsteps of him for whom she was performing had become inaudible behind her , and she began to forget him ; which was as well , since he went out of her life then , and the two never met again .
Parsing [sent. 80 len. 13]: The struggling young actress disappeared , and the previous superiority was resumed .
Parsing [sent. 81 len. 31]: It became elaborately emphasized as a boy of her own age emerged from the `` side yard '' of a house at the next corner and came into her view .
Parsing [sent. 82 len. 51]: The boy caught sight of Florence in plenty of time to observe this emphasis , which was all too obviously produced by her sensations at sight of himself ; and , after staring at her for a moment , he allowed his own expression to become one of painful fatigue .
Parsing [sent. 83 len. 34]: Then he slowly swung about , as if to return into that side-yard obscurity whence he had come ; making clear by this pantomime that he reciprocally found the sight of her insufferable .
Parsing [sent. 84 len. 48]: In truth , he did ; for he was not only her neighbour but her first-cousin as well , and a short month older , though taller than she -- tall beyond his years , taller than need be , in fact , and still in knickerbockers .
Parsing [sent. 85 len. 32]: However , his parents may not have been mistaken in the matter , for it was plain that he looked as well in knickerbockers as he could have looked in anything .
Parsing [sent. 86 len. 95]: He had no visible beauty , though it was possible to hope for him that by the time he reached manhood he would be more tightly put together than he seemed at present ; and indeed he himself appeared to have some consciousness of insecurity in the fastenings of his members , for it was his habit -LRB- observable even now as he turned to avoid Miss Atwater -RRB- to haul at himself , to sag and hitch about inside his clothes , and to corkscrew his neck against the swathing of his collar .
Parsing [sent. 87 len. 65]: And yet there were times , as the most affectionate of his aunts had remarked , when , for a moment or so , he appeared to be almost knowing ; and , seeing him walking before her , she had almost taken him for a young man ; and sometimes he said something in a settled kind of way that was almost adult .
Parsing [sent. 88 len. 49]: This fondest aunt went on to add , however , that of course , the next minute after one of these fleeting spells , he was sure to be overtaken by his more accustomed moods , when his eye would again fix itself with fundamental aimlessness upon nothing .
Parsing [sent. 89 len. 45]: In brief , he was at the age when he spent most of his time changing his mind about things , or , rather , when his mind spent most of its time changing him about things ; and this was what happened now .
Parsing [sent. 90 len. 50]: After turning his back on the hateful sight well known to him as his cousin Florence at her freshest , he turned again , came forth from his place of residence , and joining her upon the pavement , walked beside her , accompanying her without greeting or inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 91 len. 25]: His expression of fatigue , indicating her insufferableness , had not abated ; neither had her air of being a duchess looking at bugs .
Parsing [sent. 92 len. 10]: `` You _ are _ a pretty one ! ''
Parsing [sent. 93 len. 16]: he said ; but his intention was perceived to be far indeed from his words .
Parsing [sent. 94 len. 13]: `` Oh , _ am _ I , Mister Herbert Atwater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 95 len. 3]: Florence responded .
Parsing [sent. 96 len. 16]: `` I 'm _ awf ` ly _ glad _ you _ think so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 97 len. 14]: `` I mean about what Henry Rooter said , '' her cousin explained .
Parsing [sent. 98 len. 35]: `` Henry Rooter told me he made you believe you were goin ' to have a grapevine climbin ' up from inside of you because you ate some grapes with the seeds in 'em .
Parsing [sent. 99 len. 28]: He says you thought you 'd haf to get a carpenter to build a little arbour so you could swallow it for the grapevine to grow on .
Parsing [sent. 100 len. 11]: He says -- '' Florence had become an angry pink .
Parsing [sent. 101 len. 25]: `` That little Henry Rooter is the worst falsehooder in this town ; and I never believed a word he said in his life !
Parsing [sent. 102 len. 33]: Anyway , what affairs is it of yours , I 'd like you to please be so kind and obliging for to tell me , Mister Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Exquire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 103 len. 5]: `` What affairs ? ''
Parsing [sent. 104 len. 6]: Herbert echoed in plaintive satire .
Parsing [sent. 105 len. 8]: `` What affairs is it of mine ?
Parsing [sent. 106 len. 6]: That 's just the trouble !
Parsing [sent. 107 len. 15]: It 's _ got _ to be my affairs because you 're my first-cousin .
Parsing [sent. 108 len. 21]: My goodness _ I _ did n't have anything to do with you being my cousin , did I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 109 len. 10]: `` Well , _ I _ did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 110 len. 12]: `` That 's neither here nor there , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 111 len. 21]: `` What _ I _ want to know is , how long you goin ' to keep this up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 112 len. 6]: `` Keep what up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 113 len. 50]: `` I mean , how do you think I like havin ' somebody like Henry Rooter comin ' round me tellin ' what they made a cousin of mine believe , and more than thirteen years old , goin ' on fourteen ever since about a month ago ! ''
Parsing [sent. 114 len. 14]: Florence shouted : `` Oh , for goodness ' _ sakes _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 115 len. 12]: then moderated the volume but not the intensity of her tone .
Parsing [sent. 116 len. 8]: `` Kindly reply to _ this _ .
Parsing [sent. 117 len. 14]: Whoever asked you to come and take a walk with me to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 118 len. 5]: Herbert protested to heaven .
Parsing [sent. 119 len. 22]: `` Why , I would n't take a walk with you if every policeman in this town tried to make me !
Parsing [sent. 120 len. 59]: I would n't take a walk with you if they brought a million horses and -- '' `` I would n't take a walk with _ you _ , '' Florence interrupted , `` if they brought a million million horses and cows and camels and -- '' `` No , you would n't , '' Herbert said .
Parsing [sent. 121 len. 11]: `` Not if _ I _ could help it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 122 len. 11]: But by this time Florence had regained her derisive superciliousness .
Parsing [sent. 123 len. 28]: `` There 's a few things you _ could _ help , '' she said ; and the incautious Herbert challenged her with the inquiry she desired .
Parsing [sent. 124 len. 7]: `` What could I help ? ''
Parsing [sent. 125 len. 63]: `` I should think you could help bumpin ' into me every second when I 'm takin ' a walk on my own affairs , and walk along on your own side of the sidewalk , anyway , and not be so awkward a person has to keep trippin ' over you about every time I try to take a step ! ''
Parsing [sent. 126 len. 11]: Herbert withdrew temporarily to his own side of the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 127 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 128 len. 5]: he demanded hotly . ''
Parsing [sent. 129 len. 9]: _ Who _ says I 'm awkward ? ''
Parsing [sent. 130 len. 19]: `` All the fam ` ly , '' Miss Atwater returned , with a light but infuriating laugh .
Parsing [sent. 131 len. 45]: `` You bump into 'em sideways and keep gettin ' half in front of 'em whenever they try to take a step , and then when it looks as if they 'd pretty near fall over you -- '' `` You look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 132 len. 38]: `` And besides all that , '' Florence went on , undisturbed , `` why , you generally keep kind of snorting , or somep ` n , and then making all those noises in your neck .
Parsing [sent. 133 len. 41]: You were doin ' it at grandpa 's last Sunday dinner because every time there was n't anybody talking , why , everybody could hear you plain as everything , and you ought to 've seen grandpa look at you !
Parsing [sent. 134 len. 20]: He looked as if you 'd set him crazy if you did n't quit that chuttering and cluckling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 135 len. 9]: Herbert 's expression partook of a furious astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 136 len. 9]: `` I do n't any such thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 137 len. 4]: he burst out .
Parsing [sent. 138 len. 21]: `` I guess I would n't talk much about last Sunday dinner , if I was _ you _ neither .
Parsing [sent. 139 len. 21]: Who got caught eatin ' off the ice cream freezer spoon out on the back porch , if you please ?
Parsing [sent. 140 len. 18]: Yes , and I guess you better study a little grammar , while you 're about it .
Parsing [sent. 141 len. 19]: There 's no such words in the English language as ` cluckling ' and ` chuttering . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 142 len. 17]: `` I do n't care what language they 're in , '' the stubborn Florence insisted .
Parsing [sent. 143 len. 16]: `` It 's what you do , just the same : cluckling and chuttering ! ''
Parsing [sent. 144 len. 7]: Herbert 's manners went to pieces .
Parsing [sent. 145 len. 7]: `` Oh , dry up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 146 len. 3]: he bellowed .
Parsing [sent. 147 len. 11]: `` That 's a _ nice _ way to talk !
Parsing [sent. 148 len. 17]: So gentlemanly -- '' `` Well , you try be a lady , then ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 149 len. 5]: ` Try ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 150 len. 3]: Florence echoed .
Parsing [sent. 151 len. 23]: `` Well , after that , I 'll just politely thank you to dry up , yourself , Mister Herbert Atwater ! ''
Parsing [sent. 152 len. 6]: At this Herbert became moody .
Parsing [sent. 153 len. 6]: `` Oh , pfuff ! ''
Parsing [sent. 154 len. 11]: he said ; and for some moments walked in silence .
Parsing [sent. 155 len. 13]: Then he asked : `` Where you goin ' , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 156 len. 33]: The damsel paused at a gate opening upon a broad lawn evenly divided by a brick walk that led to the white-painted wooden veranda of an ample and honest old brick house .
Parsing [sent. 157 len. 15]: `` Righ ' there to grandpa 's , since you haf to know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 158 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 159 len. 30]: `` And thank you for your delightful comp ` ny which I never asked for , if you care to hear the truth for once in your life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 160 len. 3]: Herbert meditated .
Parsing [sent. 161 len. 20]: `` Well , I got nothin ' else to do , as I know of , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 162 len. 21]: `` Let 's go around to the back door so 's to see if Kitty Silver 's got anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 163 len. 17]: Then , not amiably , but at least inconsequently , they passed inside the gate together .
Parsing [sent. 164 len. 27]: Their brows were fairly unclouded ; no special marks of conflict remained ; for they had met and conversed in a manner customary rather than unusual .
Parsing [sent. 165 len. 28]: They followed a branch of the brick walk and passed round the south side of the house , where a small orchard of apple-trees showed generous promise .
Parsing [sent. 166 len. 44]: Hundreds of gay little round apples among the leaves glanced the high lights to and fro on their polished green cheeks as a breeze hopped through the yard , while the shade beneath trembled with coquettishly moving disks of sunshine like golden plates .
Parsing [sent. 167 len. 51]: A pattern of orange light and blue shadow was laid like a fanciful plaid over the lattice and the wide , slightly sagging steps of the elderly `` back porch '' ; and here , taking her ease upon these steps , sat a middle-aged coloured woman of continental proportions .
Parsing [sent. 168 len. 29]: Beyond all contest , she was the largest coloured woman in that town , though her height was not unusual , and she had a rather small face .
Parsing [sent. 169 len. 28]: That is to say , as Florence had once explained to her , her face was small but the other parts of her head were terribly wide .
Parsing [sent. 170 len. 33]: Beside her was a circular brown basket , of a type suggesting arts-and-crafts ; it was made with a cover , and there was a bow of brown silk upon the handle .
Parsing [sent. 171 len. 12]: `` What you been up to to-day , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 172 len. 4]: Herbert asked genially .
Parsing [sent. 173 len. 6]: `` Any thing special ? ''
Parsing [sent. 174 len. 21]: For this was the sequel to his `` so 's we can see if Kitty Silver 's got anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 175 len. 6]: But Mrs. Silver discouraged him .
Parsing [sent. 176 len. 11]: `` No , I ai n't , '' she replied .
Parsing [sent. 177 len. 15]: `` I ai n't , an ' I ai n't goin ' to . ''
Parsing [sent. 178 len. 16]: `` I thought you pretty near always made cookies on Tuesday , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 179 len. 16]: `` Well , I ai n't _ this _ Tuesday , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 180 len. 13]: `` I ai n't , and I ai n't goin ' to .
Parsing [sent. 181 len. 12]: You might dess well g ` on home ri ' now .
Parsing [sent. 182 len. 14]: I ai n't , an ' I ai n't goin ' to . ''
Parsing [sent. 183 len. 33]: Docility was no element of Mrs. Silver 's present mood , and Herbert 's hopeful eyes became blank , as his gaze wandered from her head to the brown basket beside her .
Parsing [sent. 184 len. 22]: The basket did not interest him ; the ribbon gave it a quality almost at once excluding it from his consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 185 len. 20]: On the contrary , the ribbon had drawn Florence 's attention , and she stared at the basket eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 186 len. 10]: `` What you got there , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 187 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 188 len. 7]: `` What I got where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 189 len. 6]: `` In that basket . ''
Parsing [sent. 190 len. 37]: `` Nemmine what I got 'n ` at basket , '' said Mrs. Silver crossly , but added inconsistently : `` I dess _ wish _ somebody ast me what I got 'n ` at basket !
Parsing [sent. 191 len. 12]: _ I _ ai n't no cat-washwoman fer _ no_body ! ''
Parsing [sent. 192 len. 4]: `` Cats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 193 len. 3]: Florence cried .
Parsing [sent. 194 len. 11]: `` Are there cats in that basket , Kitty Silver ?
Parsing [sent. 195 len. 7]: Let 's look at 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 196 len. 29]: The lid of the basket , lifted by the eager , slim hand of Miss Atwater , rose to disclose two cats of an age slightly beyond kittenhood .
Parsing [sent. 197 len. 32]: They were of a breed unfamiliar to Florence , and she did not obey the impulse that usually makes a girl seize upon any young cat at sight and caress it .
Parsing [sent. 198 len. 32]: Instead , she looked at them with some perplexity , and after a moment inquired : `` Are they really cats , Kitty Silver , do you b ` lieve ? ''
Parsing [sent. 199 len. 16]: `` Cats what she done tole _ me _ , '' the coloured woman replied .
Parsing [sent. 200 len. 58]: `` You betta shet lid down , you don ' wan ' 'em run away , 'cause they ai n't yoosta livin ' 'n ` at basket yit ; an ' no matter whut kine o ' cats they is or they is n't , _ one _ thing true : they _ wile _ cats ! ''
Parsing [sent. 201 len. 10]: `` But what makes their hair so long ? ''
Parsing [sent. 202 len. 3]: Florence asked .
Parsing [sent. 203 len. 15]: `` I never saw cats with hair a couple inches long like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 204 len. 9]: `` Miss Julia say they Berjum cats . ''
Parsing [sent. 205 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 206 len. 13]: `` I ai n't tellin ' no mo 'n she tole me .
Parsing [sent. 207 len. 9]: You ' aunt say they Berjum cats . ''
Parsing [sent. 208 len. 7]: `` Persian , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 209 len. 5]: `` That 's nothing .
Parsing [sent. 210 len. 7]: I 've seen plenty Persian cats .
Parsing [sent. 211 len. 16]: My goodness , I should think you 'd seen a Persian cat at yow age .
Parsing [sent. 212 len. 7]: Thirteen goin ' on fourteen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 213 len. 20]: `` Well , I _ have _ seen Persian cats plenty times , I guess , '' Florence said .
Parsing [sent. 214 len. 16]: `` I thought Persian cats were white , and these are kind of gray . ''
Parsing [sent. 215 len. 12]: At this Kitty Silver permitted herself to utter an embittered laugh .
Parsing [sent. 216 len. 5]: `` You wrong ! ''
Parsing [sent. 217 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 218 len. 11]: `` These cats , they white ; yes 'm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 219 len. 8]: `` Why , they are n't either !
Parsing [sent. 220 len. 15]: They 're gray as -- '' `` No 'm , '' said Mrs. Silver .
Parsing [sent. 221 len. 22]: `` They plum spang white , else you ' Aunt Julia gone out her mind ; me or her , one .
Parsing [sent. 222 len. 12]: I say : ` Miss Julia , them gray cats . '
Parsing [sent. 223 len. 7]: ` White , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 224 len. 12]: ` Them two cats is white cats , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 225 len. 10]: ` Them cats been crated , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 226 len. 25]: ` They been livin ' in a crate on a dirty express train fer th ` ee fo ' days , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 227 len. 15]: ` Them cats gone got all smoke ' up thataway , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 228 len. 64]: ` No 'm , Miss Julia , ' I say , ` No 'm , Miss Julia , they ai n't _ no _ train , ' I say , ` they ai n't _ no _ train kin take an ' smoke two white cats up like these cats so 's they hair is gray clean plum up to they hide . '
Parsing [sent. 229 len. 12]: You betta put the lid down , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 230 len. 28]: Florence complied , just in time to prevent one of the young cats from leaping out of the basket , but she did not fasten the cover .
Parsing [sent. 231 len. 32]: Instead , she knelt , and , allowing a space of half an inch to intervene between the basket and the rim of the cover , peered within at the occupants .
Parsing [sent. 232 len. 16]: `` I believe the one to this side 's a he , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 233 len. 20]: `` It 's got greenisher eyes than the other one ; that 's the way you can always tell .
Parsing [sent. 234 len. 18]: I b ` lieve this one 's a he and the other one 's a she . ''
Parsing [sent. 235 len. 14]: `` I ai n't stedyin ' about no he an ' she ! ''
Parsing [sent. 236 len. 8]: `` What did Aunt Julia say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 237 len. 3]: Florence asked .
Parsing [sent. 238 len. 10]: `` Whut you ' Aunt Julia say when ? ''
Parsing [sent. 239 len. 15]: `` When you told her these were gray cats and not white cats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 240 len. 15]: `` She tole me take an ' clean 'em , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 241 len. 30]: `` She say , she say she want 'em clean ' up spick an ' spang befo ' Mista Sammerses git here to call an ' see 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 242 len. 13]: And she added morosely : `` I ai n't no cat-washwoman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 243 len. 9]: `` She wants you to bathe 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 244 len. 11]: Florence inquired , but Kitty Silver did not reply immediately .
Parsing [sent. 245 len. 39]: She breathed audibly , with a strange effect upon vasty outward portions of her , and then gave an incomparably dulcet imitation of her own voice , as she interpreted her use of it during the recent interview .
Parsing [sent. 246 len. 26]: ` Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say -- ` Miss Julia , ma'am , my bizniss cookin ' vittles , ' I say .
Parsing [sent. 247 len. 67]: ` Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I tole her , ` Miss Julia , ma'am , I cook fer you ' pa , an ' cook fer you ' fam ` ly year in , year out , an ' I hope an ' pursue , whiles some might make complaint , I take whatever I find , an ' I leave whatever I find .
Parsing [sent. 248 len. 29]: No 'm , Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say -- ` no 'm , Miss Julia , ma'am , I ai n't no cat-washwoman ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 249 len. 9]: `` What did Aunt Julia say then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 250 len. 23]: `` She say , she say : ` Di 'n I tell you take them cats downstairs an ' clean 'em ? '
Parsing [sent. 251 len. 3]: she say .
Parsing [sent. 252 len. 9]: I ai n't _ no_body 's cat-washwoman ! ''
Parsing [sent. 253 len. 8]: Florence was becoming more and more interested .
Parsing [sent. 254 len. 15]: `` I should think that would be kind of fun , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 255 len. 6]: `` To be a cat-washwoman .
Parsing [sent. 256 len. 17]: _ I _ would n't mind that at all : I 'd kind of like it .
Parsing [sent. 257 len. 24]: I expect if you was a cat-washwoman , Kitty Silver , you 'd be pretty near the only one was in the world .
Parsing [sent. 258 len. 13]: I wonder if they do have 'em any place , cat-washwomen . ''
Parsing [sent. 259 len. 53]: `` I don ' know if they got 'em some place , '' said Kitty Silver , `` an ' I do n't know if they ai n't got 'em no place ; but I bet if they do got 'em any place , it 's some place else from here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 260 len. 4]: Florence looked thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 261 len. 17]: `` Who was it you said is going to call this evening and see 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 262 len. 5]: `` Mista Sammerses . ''
Parsing [sent. 263 len. 10]: `` She means Newland Sanders , '' Herbert explained .
Parsing [sent. 264 len. 32]: `` Aunt Julia says all her callers that ever came to this house in their lives , Kitty Silver never got the name right of a single one of 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 265 len. 15]: `` Newland Sanders is the one with the little moustache , '' Florence said .
Parsing [sent. 266 len. 16]: `` Is that the one you mean by ` Sammerses , ' Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 267 len. 19]: `` Mista Sammerses who you ' Aunt Julia tole _ me _ , '' Mrs. Silver responded stubbornly .
Parsing [sent. 268 len. 33]: `` He ai n't got no moustache whut you kin look at -- dess some blackish whut don ' reach out mo 'n halfway todes the bofe ends of his mouf . ''
Parsing [sent. 269 len. 23]: `` Well , '' said Florence , `` was Mr. Sanders the one gave her these Persian cats , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 270 len. 5]: `` I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 271 len. 13]: Mrs. Silver breathed audibly again , and her expression was strongly resentful .
Parsing [sent. 272 len. 109]: `` When she go fer a walk ` long with any them callers she stop an ' make a big fuss over any li'l ole dog or cat an ' I do n't know whut all , an ' after they done buy her all the candy from all the candy sto 's in the livin ' worl ' , an ' all the flowers from all the greenhouses they is , it 's a wonder some of 'em ai n't sen ' her a mule fer a present , 'cause seem like to me they done sen ' her mos ' every kine of animal they is !
Parsing [sent. 273 len. 97]: Firs ' come Airydale dog you ' grampaw tuck an ' give away to the milkman ; 'n' en come two mo ' pups ; I do n't know whut they is , 'cause they bofe had dess sense enough to run away after you ' grampaw try learn 'em how much he ai n't like no pups ; an ' nex ' come them two canaries hangin ' in the dinin ' - room now , an ' nex ' -- di 'n' I holler so 's they could a-hear me all way down town ?
Parsing [sent. 274 len. 36]: Di 'n' I walk in my kitchen one mawnin ' right slam in the face of ole warty allagatuh three foot long a-lookin ' at me over the aidge o ' my kitchen sink ? ''
Parsing [sent. 275 len. 13]: `` It was Mr. Clairdyce gave her that , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 276 len. 35]: `` He 'd been to Florida ; but she did n't care for it very much , and she did n't make any fuss at all when grandpa got the florist to take it .
Parsing [sent. 277 len. 5]: Grandpa hates animals . ''
Parsing [sent. 278 len. 18]: `` He don ' hate 'em no wuss 'n whut I do , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 279 len. 35]: `` An ' he ai n't got to ketch 'em lookin ' at him outen of his kitchen sink -- an ' he ai n't fixin ' to be no cat-washwoman neither ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 280 len. 8]: _ Are _ you fixing to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 281 len. 4]: Florence asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 282 len. 12]: `` You do n't need to do it , Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 283 len. 11]: I 'd be willing to , and so 'd Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 284 len. 7]: Would n't you , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 285 len. 8]: Herbert deliberated within himself , then brightened .
Parsing [sent. 286 len. 11]: `` I 'd just as soon , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 287 len. 19]: `` I 'd kind of like to see how a cat acts when it 's getting bathed . ''
Parsing [sent. 288 len. 25]: `` I think it would be spesh ` ly inter ` sting to wash Persian cats , '' Florence added , with increasing enthusiasm .
Parsing [sent. 289 len. 11]: `` I never washed a cat in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 290 len. 9]: `` Neither have I , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 291 len. 10]: `` I always thought they did it themselves . ''
Parsing [sent. 292 len. 4]: Kitty Silver sniffed .
Parsing [sent. 293 len. 12]: `` Ai n't I says so to you ' Aunt Julia ?
Parsing [sent. 294 len. 12]: She done tole me , ` No , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 295 len. 27]: She say , she say Berjum cats ai n't wash they self ; they got to take an ' git somebody else to wash 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 296 len. 34]: `` If we 're goin ' to bathe 'em , '' said Florence , `` we ought to know their names , so 's we can tell 'em to hold still and everything .
Parsing [sent. 297 len. 14]: You ca n't do much with an animal unless you know their name .
Parsing [sent. 298 len. 14]: Did Aunt Julia tell you these cats ' names , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 299 len. 10]: `` She say they name Feef an ' Meemuh .
Parsing [sent. 300 len. 3]: Yes 'm !
Parsing [sent. 301 len. 5]: Feef an ' Meemuh !
Parsing [sent. 302 len. 15]: Whut kine o ' name is Feef an ' Meemuh fer cat name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 303 len. 9]: `` Oh , those are lovely names ! ''
Parsing [sent. 304 len. 20]: Florence assured her , and , turning to Herbert , explained : `` She means Fifi and Mimi . ''
Parsing [sent. 305 len. 11]: `` Feef an ' Meemuh , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 306 len. 20]: `` Them name don ' suit me , an ' them long-hair cats don ' suit me neither . ''
Parsing [sent. 307 len. 16]: Here she lifted the cover of the basket a little , and gazed nervously within .
Parsing [sent. 308 len. 6]: `` Look at there ! ''
Parsing [sent. 309 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 310 len. 11]: `` Look at the way they lookin ' at me !
Parsing [sent. 311 len. 17]: Do n't you look at _ me _ thataway , you Feef an ' Meemuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 312 len. 9]: She clapped the lid down and fastened it .
Parsing [sent. 313 len. 15]: `` Fixin ' to jump out an ' grab me , was you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 314 len. 27]: `` I guess , maybe , '' said Florence , `` maybe I better go ask Aunt Julia if I and Herbert ca n't wash 'em .
Parsing [sent. 315 len. 12]: I guess I better go _ ask _ her anyhow . ''
Parsing [sent. 316 len. 17]: And she ran up the steps and skipped into the house by way of the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 317 len. 14]: A moment later she appeared in the open doorway of a room upstairs .
Parsing [sent. 318 len. 35]: CHAPTER TWO It was a pretty room , lightly scented with the pink geraniums and blue lobelia and coral fuchsias that poised , urgent with colour , in the window-boxes at the open windows .
Parsing [sent. 319 len. 61]: Sunshine paused delicately just inside , where forms of pale-blue birds and lavender flowers curled up and down the cretonne curtains ; and a tempered , respectful light fell upon a cushioned _ chaise longue _ ; for there fluffily reclined , in garments of tender fabric and gentle colours , the prettiest twenty-year-old girl in that creditably supplied town .
Parsing [sent. 320 len. 29]: It must be said that no stranger would have taken Florence at first glance to be her niece , though everybody admitted that Florence 's hair was pretty .
Parsing [sent. 321 len. 22]: -LRB- `` I 'll say _ that _ for her , '' was the family way of putting it . -RRB- .
Parsing [sent. 322 len. 56]: Florence did not care for her hair herself ; it was dark and thick and long , like her Aunt Julia 's ; but Florence -- even in the realistic presence of a mirror -- preferred to think of herself as an ashen blonde , and also as about a foot taller than she was .
Parsing [sent. 323 len. 34]: Persistence kept this picture habitually in her mind , which , of course , helps to explain her feeling that she was justified in wearing that manner of superciliousness deplored by her mother .
Parsing [sent. 324 len. 42]: More middle-aged gentlemen than are suspected believe that they look like the waspen youths in the magazine advertisements of clothes ; and this impression of theirs accounts -LRB- as with Florence -RRB- for much that is seemingly inexplicable in their behaviour .
Parsing [sent. 325 len. 53]: Florence 's Aunt Julia was reading an exquisitely made little book , which bore her initials stamped in gold upon the cover ; and it had evidently reached her by a recent delivery of the mail , for wrappings bearing cancelled stamps lay upon the floor beside the _ chaise longue _ .
Parsing [sent. 326 len. 48]: It was a special sort of book , since its interior was not printed , but all laboriously written with pen and ink -- poems , in truth , containing more references to a lady named Julia than have appeared in any other poems since Herrick 's .
Parsing [sent. 327 len. 54]: So warmly interested in the reading as to be rather pink , though not always with entire approval , this Julia nevertheless , at the sound of footsteps , closed the book and placed it beneath one of the cushions assisting the _ chaise longue _ to make her position a comfortable one .
Parsing [sent. 328 len. 6]: Her greeting was not enthusiastic .
Parsing [sent. 329 len. 9]: `` What do you want , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 330 len. 29]: `` I was going to ask you if Herbert and me -- I mean : Was it Noble Dill gave you Fifi and Mimi , Aunt Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 331 len. 4]: `` Noble Dill ?
Parsing [sent. 332 len. 3]: No . ''
Parsing [sent. 333 len. 10]: `` I wish it was , '' Florence said .
Parsing [sent. 334 len. 15]: `` I 'd like these cats better if they were from Noble Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 335 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 336 len. 3]: Julia inquired .
Parsing [sent. 337 len. 12]: `` Why are you so partial to Mr. Noble Dill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 338 len. 23]: `` I think he 's _ so _ much the most inter ` sting looking of all that come to see you .
Parsing [sent. 339 len. 19]: Are you _ sure _ it was n't Noble Dill gave you these cats , Aunt Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 340 len. 15]: A look of weariness became plainly visible upon Miss Julia Atwater 's charming face .
Parsing [sent. 341 len. 17]: `` I do wish you 'd hurry and grow up , Florence , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 342 len. 6]: `` I do , too !
Parsing [sent. 343 len. 7]: What for , Aunt Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 344 len. 15]: `` So there 'd be somebody else in the family of an eligible age .
Parsing [sent. 345 len. 90]: I really think it 's an outrageous position to be in , '' Julia continued , with languid vehemence -- `` to be the only girl between thirteen and forty-one in a large connection of near relatives , including children , who all seem to think they have n't anything to think of but Who comes to see her , and Who came to see her yesterday , and Who was here the day before , and Who 's coming to-morrow , and Who 's she going to marry !
Parsing [sent. 346 len. 19]: You really ought to grow up and help me out , because I 'm getting tired of it .
Parsing [sent. 347 len. 2]: No .
Parsing [sent. 348 len. 27]: It was n't Noble Dill but Mr. Newland Sanders that sent me Fifi and Mimi -- and I want you to keep away from 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 349 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 350 len. 3]: asked Florence .
Parsing [sent. 351 len. 31]: `` Because they 're very rare cats , and you are n't ordinarily a very careful sort of person , Florence , if you do n't mind my saying so .
Parsing [sent. 352 len. 34]: Besides , if I let you go near them , the next thing Herbert would be over here mussing around , and he ca n't go near _ anything _ without ruining it !
Parsing [sent. 353 len. 13]: It 's just in him ; he ca n't help it . ''
Parsing [sent. 354 len. 26]: Florence looked thoughtful for a brief moment ; then she asked : `` Did Newland Sanders send 'em with the names already to them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 355 len. 15]: `` No , '' said Julia , emphasizing the patience of her tone somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 356 len. 9]: `` I named them after they got here .
Parsing [sent. 357 len. 8]: Mr. Sanders has n't seen them yet .
Parsing [sent. 358 len. 7]: He had them shipped to me .
Parsing [sent. 359 len. 6]: He 's coming this evening .
Parsing [sent. 360 len. 7]: Anything more to-day , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 361 len. 11]: `` Well , I was thinking , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 362 len. 13]: `` What do you think grandpa 'll think about these cats ? ''
Parsing [sent. 363 len. 26]: `` I do n't believe there 'll be any more outrages , '' Julia returned , and her dark eyes showed a moment 's animation .
Parsing [sent. 364 len. 28]: `` I told him at breakfast that the Reign of Terror was ended , and he and everybody else had to keep away from Fifi and Mimi .
Parsing [sent. 365 len. 8]: Is that about all , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 366 len. 11]: `` You let Kitty Silver go near 'em , though .
Parsing [sent. 367 len. 10]: She says she 's fixing to wash 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 368 len. 4]: Julia smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 369 len. 6]: `` I thought she would !
Parsing [sent. 370 len. 34]: I had to go so far as to tell her that as long as I 'm housekeeper in my father 's house she 'd do what I say or find some other place .
Parsing [sent. 371 len. 18]: She behaved outrageously and pretended to believe the natural colour of Fifi and Mimi is gray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 372 len. 30]: `` I expect , '' said Florence , after pondering seriously for a little while -- `` I expect it would take quite some time to dry them . ''
Parsing [sent. 373 len. 4]: `` No doubt .
Parsing [sent. 374 len. 9]: But I 'd rather you did n't assist .
Parsing [sent. 375 len. 14]: I 'd rather you were n't even around looking on , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 376 len. 11]: A shade fell upon her niece 's face at this .
Parsing [sent. 377 len. 28]: `` Why , Aunt Julia , I could n't do any harm to Fifi and Mimi just _ lookin ' _ at 'em , could I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 378 len. 3]: Julia laughed .
Parsing [sent. 379 len. 40]: `` That 's the trouble ; you never do ` just look ' at anything you 're interested in , and , if you do n't mind my saying so , you 've got rather a record , dear !
Parsing [sent. 380 len. 31]: Now , do n't you care : you can find lots of other pleasant things to do at home -- or over at Herbert 's , or Aunt Fanny 's .
Parsing [sent. 381 len. 20]: You run along now and -- '' `` Well -- '' Florence said , moving as if to depart .
Parsing [sent. 382 len. 24]: `` You might as well go out by the front door , child , '' Julia suggested , with a little watchful urgency .
Parsing [sent. 383 len. 29]: `` You come over some day when Fifi and Mimi have got used to the place , and you can look at them all you want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 384 len. 33]: `` Well , I just -- '' But as Florence seemed disposed still to linger , her aunt 's manner became more severe , and she half rose from her reclining position .
Parsing [sent. 385 len. 8]: `` No , I really mean it !
Parsing [sent. 386 len. 32]: Fifi and Mimi are royal-bred Persian cats with a wonderful pedigree , and I do n't know how much trouble and expense it cost Mr. Sanders to get them for me .
Parsing [sent. 387 len. 44]: They 're entirely different from ordinary cats ; they 're very fine and queer , and if anything happens to them , after all the trouble papa 's made over other presents I 've had , I 'll go straight to a sanitarium !
Parsing [sent. 388 len. 27]: No , Florence , you keep away from the kitchen to-day , and I 'd like to hear the front door as you go out . ''
Parsing [sent. 389 len. 31]: `` Well , '' said Florence ; `` I do wish if these cats are as fine as all that , it was Noble Dill that gave 'em to you .
Parsing [sent. 390 len. 21]: I 'd like these cats lots better if _ he _ gave 'em to you , would n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 391 len. 8]: `` No , I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 392 len. 11]: `` Well -- '' Florence said again , and departed .
Parsing [sent. 393 len. 68]: Twenty is an unsuspicious age , except when it fears that its dignity or grace may be threatened from without ; and it might have been a `` bad sign '' in revelation of Julia Atwater 's character if she had failed to accept the muffled metallic clash of the front door 's closing as a token that her niece had taken a complete departure for home .
Parsing [sent. 394 len. 37]: A supplemental confirmation came a moment later , fainter but no less conclusive : the distant slamming of the front gate ; and it made a clear picture of an obedient Florence on her homeward way .
Parsing [sent. 395 len. 67]: Peace came upon Julia : she read in her book , while at times she dropped a languid , graceful arm , and , with the pretty hand at the slimmer end of it , groped in a dark shelter beneath her couch to make a selection , merely by her well-experienced sense of touch , from a frilled white box that lay in concealment there .
Parsing [sent. 396 len. 64]: Then , bringing forth a crystalline violet become scented sugar , or a bit of fruit translucent in hardened sirup , she would delicately set it on the way to that attractive dissolution hoped for it by the wistful donor -- and all without removing her shadowy eyes from the little volume and its patient struggle for dignified rhymes with `` Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 397 len. 11]: Florence was no longer in her beautiful relative 's thoughts .
Parsing [sent. 398 len. 20]: Florence was idly in the thoughts , however , of Mrs. Balche , the next-door neighbour to the south .
Parsing [sent. 399 len. 44]: Happening to glance from a bay-window , she negligently marked how the child walked to the front gate , opened it , paused for a moment 's meditation , then hurled the gate to a vigorous closure , herself remaining within its protection .
Parsing [sent. 400 len. 4]: `` Odd ! ''
Parsing [sent. 401 len. 4]: Mrs. Balche murmured .
Parsing [sent. 402 len. 54]: Having thus eloquently closed the gate , Florence slowly turned and moved toward the rear of the house , quickening her steps as she went , until at a run she disappeared from the scope of Mrs. Balche 's gaze , cut off by the intervening foliage of Mr. Atwater 's small orchard .
Parsing [sent. 403 len. 33]: Mrs. Balche felt no great interest ; nevertheless , she paused at the sound of a boy 's voice , half husky , half shrill , in an early stage of change .
Parsing [sent. 404 len. 9]: `` What she say , Flor ` nce ?
Parsing [sent. 405 len. 6]: D'she say we could ? ''
Parsing [sent. 406 len. 12]: But there came a warning '' _ Hush up _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 407 len. 28]: from Florence , and then , in a lowered tone , the boy 's voice said : `` Look here ; these are mighty funny-actin ' cats .
Parsing [sent. 408 len. 25]: I think they 're kind of crazy or somep ` n. Kitty Silver 's fixed a washtub full o ' suds for us . ''
Parsing [sent. 409 len. 18]: Mrs. Balche was reminded of her own cat , and went to give it a little cream .
Parsing [sent. 410 len. 47]: Mrs. Balche was a retired widow , without children , and too timid to like dogs ; but after a suitable interval , following the loss of her husband , she accepted from a friend the gift of a white kitten , and named it Violet .
Parsing [sent. 411 len. 39]: It may be said that Mrs. Balche , having few interests in life , and being of a sequestering nature , lived for Violet , and that so much devotion was not good for the latter 's health .
Parsing [sent. 412 len. 110]: In his youth , after having shown sufficient spirit to lose an eye during a sporting absence of three nights and days , Violet was not again permitted enough freedom of action to repeat this disloyalty ; though , now , in his advanced middle-age , he had been fed to such a state that he seldom cared to move , other than by a slow , sneering wavement of the tail when friendly words were addressed to him ; and consequently , as he seemed beyond all capacity or desire to run away , or to run at all , Mrs. Balche allowed him complete liberty of action .
Parsing [sent. 413 len. 26]: She found him asleep upon her `` back porch , '' and placed beside him a saucer of cream , the second since his luncheon .
Parsing [sent. 414 len. 48]: Then she watched him affectionately as he opened his eye , turned toward the saucer his noble Henry-the-Eighth head with its great furred jowls , and began the process of rising for more food , which was all that ever seemed even feebly to rouse his mind .
Parsing [sent. 415 len. 16]: When he had risen , there was little space between him anywhere and the floor .
Parsing [sent. 416 len. 16]: Violet took his cream without enthusiasm , pausing at times and turning his head away .
Parsing [sent. 417 len. 28]: In fact , he persisted only out of an incorrigible sensuality , and finally withdrew a pace or two , leaving creamy traces still upon the saucer .
Parsing [sent. 418 len. 29]: With a multitude of fond words his kind mistress drew his attention to these , whereupon , making a visible effort , he returned and disposed of them .
Parsing [sent. 419 len. 18]: `` Dat 's de ` itty darlin ' , '' she said , stooping to stroke him .
Parsing [sent. 420 len. 8]: `` Eat um all up nice clean .
Parsing [sent. 421 len. 7]: Dood for ole sweet sin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 422 len. 45]: She continued to stroke him , and Violet half closed his eye , but not with love or serenity , for he simultaneously gestured with his tail , meaning to say : `` Oh , do take your hands off o ' me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 423 len. 17]: Then he opened the eye and paid a little attention to sounds from the neighbouring yard .
Parsing [sent. 424 len. 41]: A high fence , shrubberies , and foliage concealed that yard from the view of Violet , but the sounds were eloquent to him , since they were those made by members of his own general species when threatening atrocities .
Parsing [sent. 425 len. 28]: The accent may have been foreign , but Violet caught perfectly the sense of what was being said , and instinctively he muttered reciprocal curses within himself .
Parsing [sent. 426 len. 8]: `` What a matta , honey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 427 len. 5]: his companion inquired sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 428 len. 12]: `` Ess , bad people f ` ighten poor Violet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 429 len. 75]: From beyond the fence came the murmurings of a boy and a girl in hushed but urgent conversation ; and with these sounds there mingled watery agitations , splashings and the like , as well as those low vocalizings that Violet had recognized ; but suddenly there were muffled explosions , like fireworks choked in feather beds ; and the human voices grew uncontrollably somewhat louder , so that their import was distinguishable . ''
Parsing [sent. 430 len. 3]: _ Ow !
Parsing [sent. 431 len. 10]: _ '' `` Hush up , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 432 len. 12]: You want to bring the whole town to -- _ ow !
Parsing [sent. 433 len. 8]: _ '' `` Hush up yourself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 434 len. 8]: `` Oh , _ goodness _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 435 len. 4]: `` Look out !
Parsing [sent. 436 len. 25]: Do n't let her -- '' `` Well , look what she 's _ doin ' _ to me , ca n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 437 len. 13]: `` For Heavenses ' sakes , catch holt and -- _ Ow !
Parsing [sent. 438 len. 27]: _ '' Then came a husky voice , inevitably that of a horrified coloured person hastening from a distance : `` Oh , my soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 439 len. 23]: There was a scurrying , and the girl was heard in furious yet hoarsely guarded vehemence : `` Bring the clo'es prop !
Parsing [sent. 440 len. 5]: Bring the clo'es prop !
Parsing [sent. 441 len. 12]: We can poke that one down from the garage , anyway .
Parsing [sent. 442 len. 12]: _ Oh , my goodness , look at ` er go !
Parsing [sent. 443 len. 8]: _ '' Mrs. Balche shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 444 len. 5]: `` Naughty children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 445 len. 25]: she said , as she picked up the saucer and went to the kitchen door , which she held open for Violet to enter .
Parsing [sent. 446 len. 8]: `` Want to come with mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 447 len. 18]: But Violet had lost even the faint interest in life he had shown a few moments earlier .
Parsing [sent. 448 len. 10]: He settled himself to another stupor in the sun .
Parsing [sent. 449 len. 11]: `` Well , well , '' Mrs. Balche said indulgently .
Parsing [sent. 450 len. 10]: `` Afterwhile shall have some more nice keem . ''
Parsing [sent. 451 len. 60]: * * * * * Sunset was beginning to be hinted , two hours later , when , in another quarter of the town , a little girl of seven or eight , at play on the domestic side of an alley gate , became aware of an older girl regarding her fixedly over the top of the gate .
Parsing [sent. 452 len. 20]: The little girl felt embarrassed and paused in her gayeties , enfolding in her arms her pet and playmate .
Parsing [sent. 453 len. 15]: `` Howdy ' do , '' said the stranger , in a serious tone .
Parsing [sent. 454 len. 10]: `` What 'll you take for that cat ? ''
Parsing [sent. 455 len. 20]: The little girl made no reply , and the stranger , opening the gate , came into the yard .
Parsing [sent. 456 len. 18]: She looked weary , rather bedraggled , yet hurried : her air was predominantly one of anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 457 len. 15]: `` I 'll give you a quarter for that cat , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 458 len. 44]: `` I want an all-white cat , but this one 's only got that one gray spot over its eye , and I do n't believe there 's an all-white cat left in town , leastways that anybody 's willing to part with .
Parsing [sent. 459 len. 9]: I 'll give you twenty-five cents for it .
Parsing [sent. 460 len. 22]: I have n't got it with me , but I 'll promise to give it to you day after to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 461 len. 24]: The little girl still made no reply , but continued to stare , her eyes widening , and the caller spoke with desperation .
Parsing [sent. 462 len. 19]: `` See here , '' she said , `` I _ got _ to have a whitish cat !
Parsing [sent. 463 len. 28]: That 'n is n't worth more 'n a quarter , but I 'll give you thirty-five cents for her , money down , day after to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 464 len. 18]: At this , the frightened child set the cat upon the ground and fled into the house .
Parsing [sent. 465 len. 25]: Florence Atwater was left alone ; that is to say , she was the only human being in the yard , or in sight .
Parsing [sent. 466 len. 12]: Nevertheless , a human voice spoke , not far behind her .
Parsing [sent. 467 len. 19]: It came through a knot-hole in the fence , and it was a voice almost of passion . ''
Parsing [sent. 468 len. 5]: _ You grab it !
Parsing [sent. 469 len. 16]: _ '' Florence stood in silence , motionless ; there was a solemnity about her .
Parsing [sent. 470 len. 4]: The voice exhorted .
Parsing [sent. 471 len. 5]: `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 472 len. 3]: it said .
Parsing [sent. 473 len. 16]: `` She did n't say she _ would n't _ sell it , did she ?
Parsing [sent. 474 len. 16]: You can bring her the money like you said you would , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 475 len. 17]: I got _ mine _ , did n't I , almost without any trouble at all !
Parsing [sent. 476 len. 3]: My Heavens !
Parsing [sent. 477 len. 8]: Ai n't Kitty Silver pretty near crazy ?
Parsing [sent. 478 len. 11]: Just think of the position we 've put her into !
Parsing [sent. 479 len. 11]: I tell you , you _ got _ to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 480 len. 5]: But now Florence moved .
Parsing [sent. 481 len. 13]: She moved slowly at first : then with more decision and rapidity .
Parsing [sent. 482 len. 55]: * * * * * That evening 's dusk had deepened into blue night when the two cousins , each with a scant , uneasy dinner eaten , met by appointment in the alley behind their mutual grandfather 's place of residence , and , having climbed the back fence , approached the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 483 len. 25]: Suddenly Florence lifted her right hand , and took between thumb and forefinger a lock of hair upon the back of Herbert 's head .
Parsing [sent. 484 len. 9]: `` Well , for Heavenses ' sakes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 485 len. 7]: he burst out , justifiably protesting .
Parsing [sent. 486 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 487 len. 4]: Florence warned him .
Parsing [sent. 488 len. 11]: `` Kitty Silver 's talkin ' to somebody in there .
Parsing [sent. 489 len. 6]: It might be Aunt Julia !
Parsing [sent. 490 len. 6]: C 'm ` ere ! ''
Parsing [sent. 491 len. 14]: She led him to a position beneath an open window of the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 492 len. 30]: Here they sat upon the ground , with their backs against the stone foundation of the house , and listened to voices and the clink of dishes being washed .
Parsing [sent. 493 len. 18]: `` She 's got another ole coloured darky woman in there with her , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 494 len. 19]: `` It 's a woman belongs to her church and comes to see her ` most every evening .
Parsing [sent. 495 len. 9]: Listen ; she 's telling her about it .
Parsing [sent. 496 len. 25]: I bet we could get the real truth of it maybe better this way than if we went in and asked her right out .
Parsing [sent. 497 len. 19]: Anyway , it is n't eavesdropping if you listen when people are talkin ' about you , yourself .
Parsing [sent. 498 len. 26]: It 's only wrong when it is n't any of your own bus -- '' `` For Heavenses ' sakes hush _ up _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 499 len. 4]: her cousin remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 500 len. 5]: `` Listen ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 501 len. 32]: ` No 'm , Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say '' -- thus came the voice of Mrs. Silver -- '' ` no 'm , Miss Julia , ma'am .
Parsing [sent. 502 len. 19]: Them the same two cats you han ' me , Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say .
Parsing [sent. 503 len. 37]: ` Leas ` wise , ' I say , ` them the two same cats whut was in nat closed-up brown basket when I open it up an ' take an ' fix to wash 'em .
Parsing [sent. 504 len. 71]: Somebody might ` a ' took an ' change 'em ` fo ' they got to _ me _ , ' I say , ` Miss Julia , ma'am , but all the change happen to 'em sence they been in charge of _ me _ , that 's the gray whut come off 'em whiles I washin ' 'em an ' dryin ' 'em in corn meal and flannel .
Parsing [sent. 505 len. 49]: I dunno how much _ washin ' _ 'em change 'em , Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say , '' cause how much they change or ai n't change , that 's fer you to say and me not to jedge , ' I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 506 len. 8]: `` Lan ' o ' misery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 507 len. 7]: cried the visitor , chuckling delightedly .
Parsing [sent. 508 len. 14]: `` I wonder how you done kep ' you face , Miss Kitty .
Parsing [sent. 509 len. 6]: What Miss Julia say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 510 len. 15]: A loud , irresponsible outburst of mirth on the part of Mrs. Silver followed .
Parsing [sent. 511 len. 12]: When she could again control herself , she replied more definitely .
Parsing [sent. 512 len. 22]: `` Miss Julia say , she say she ai n't never hear no sech outragelous sto ' y in her life !
Parsing [sent. 513 len. 6]: She _ tuck _ on !
Parsing [sent. 514 len. 2]: Hallelujah !
Parsing [sent. 515 len. 92]: An ' all time , Miz Johnson , I give you my word , I stannin ' there holdin ' nat basket , carryin ' on up hill an ' down dale how them the same two Berjum cats Mista Sammerses sen ' her : an ' trouble enough dess ten ` in ' to that basket , lem me say to you , Miz Johnson , as anybody kin tell you whutever tried to take care o ' two cats whut ai n't yoosta each other in the same basket .

Parsing [sent. 517 len. 2]: Kitty ?
Parsing [sent. 518 len. 4]: Kitty ? ' '
Parsing [sent. 519 len. 3]: _ Yes !
Parsing [sent. 520 len. 16]: _ ' Miss Julia say , she say , ` Fine sto ` y ! '
Parsing [sent. 521 len. 3]: she say .
Parsing [sent. 522 len. 41]: ` Them two cats you claim my Berjum cats , they got short hair , an ' they ai n't the same age an ' they ai n't even nowheres near the same _ size _ , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 523 len. 35]: ` One of 'em 's as fat as _ bofe _ them Berjum cats , ' she say : ` an ' it 's on ' y got one eye , ' she say .
Parsing [sent. 524 len. 55]: ` Well , Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say -- ' _ one _ thing ; they come out white , all ` cept dess around that there skinnier one 's eye , ' I say : ` dess the same you tell me they goin ' to , ' I say .
Parsing [sent. 525 len. 12]: ` You right about _ that _ much , ma'am ! '
Parsing [sent. 526 len. 4]: I say . ''
Parsing [sent. 527 len. 6]: `` Oh , me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 528 len. 9]: Mrs. Johnson moaned , worn with applausive laughter .
Parsing [sent. 529 len. 8]: `` What she respon ' then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 530 len. 88]: `` I set that basket down , '' said Kitty Silver , `` an ' I start fer the do ' , whiles she unfasten the lid fer to take one mo ' look at 'em , I reckon : but open window mighty close by , an ' nat skinny white cat make one jump , an ' after li'l while I lookin ' out thishere window an ' see that ole fat Miz Blatch 's tom , waddlin ' crost the yod todes home . ''
Parsing [sent. 531 len. 8]: `` What she doin ' now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 532 len. 4]: Mrs. Johnson inquired .
Parsing [sent. 533 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 534 len. 3]: Miss Julia ?
Parsing [sent. 535 len. 17]: She settin ' out on the front po ` che talkin ' to Mista Sammerses . ''
Parsing [sent. 536 len. 4]: `` My name !
Parsing [sent. 537 len. 17]: How she goin ' fix it with _ him _ , after all thishere dishcumaraddle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 538 len. 3]: `` Who ?
Parsing [sent. 539 len. 3]: Miss Julia ?
Parsing [sent. 540 len. 6]: Leave her alone , honey !
Parsing [sent. 541 len. 41]: She take an ' begin talk so fas ' an ' talk so sweet , no young man ai n't goin ' to ricklect he ever give her no cats , not till he 's gone an ' halfway home !
Parsing [sent. 542 len. 31]: But I ai n't tole you the en ' of it , Miz Johnson , an ' the en ' of it 's the bes ' part whut happen . ''
Parsing [sent. 543 len. 9]: `` What 's that , Miss Kitty ? ''
Parsing [sent. 544 len. 4]: `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 545 len. 4]: said Mrs. Silver .
Parsing [sent. 546 len. 24]: `` Mista Atwater gone in yonder , after I come out , an ' ast whut all them goin 's - on about .
Parsing [sent. 547 len. 32]: Well suh , an ' di 'n' he come walkin ' out in my kitchen an ' slip me two bright spang new silbuh dolluhs right in my han ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 548 len. 5]: `` My name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 549 len. 4]: `` Yessuh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 550 len. 5]: said Mrs. Silver triumphantly .
Parsing [sent. 551 len. 13]: And in the darkness outside the window Florence drew a deep breath .
Parsing [sent. 552 len. 27]: `` I 'd of felt just awful about this , '' she said , `` if Noble Dill had given Aunt Julia those Persian cats . ''
Parsing [sent. 553 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 554 len. 12]: Herbert inquired , puzzled by her way of looking at things .
Parsing [sent. 555 len. 21]: `` I do n't see why it would make it any worse _ who _ gave 'em to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 556 len. 10]: `` Well , it would , '' Florence said .
Parsing [sent. 557 len. 11]: `` But anyway , I think we did rather wrong .
Parsing [sent. 558 len. 13]: Did you notice what Kitty Silver said about what grandpa did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 559 len. 4]: `` Well ? ''
Parsing [sent. 560 len. 18]: `` I think we ought to tell him our share of it , '' Florence returned thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 561 len. 36]: `` I do n't want to go to bed to-night with all this on my mind , and I 'm going to find grandpa right now and confess every bit of it to him . ''
Parsing [sent. 562 len. 8]: Herbert hopefully decided to go with her .
Parsing [sent. 563 len. 40]: CHAPTER THREE Julia , like Herbert , had been a little puzzled by Florence 's expression of a partiality for the young man , Noble Dill ; it was not customary for anybody to confess a weakness for him .
Parsing [sent. 564 len. 29]: However , the aunt dismissed the subject from her mind , as other matters pressed sharply upon her attention ; she had more worries than most people guessed .
Parsing [sent. 565 len. 47]: The responsibilities of a lady who is almost officially the prettiest person in a town persistently claiming sixty-five thousand inhabitants are often heavier than the world suspects , and there were moments when Julia found the position so trying that she would have preferred to resign .
Parsing [sent. 566 len. 34]: She was a warm-hearted , appreciative girl , naturally unable to close her eyes to sterling merit wherever it appeared : and it was not without warrant that she complained of her relatives .
Parsing [sent. 567 len. 23]: The whole family , including the children , she said , regaled themselves with her private affairs as a substitute for theatre-going .
Parsing [sent. 568 len. 44]: But one day , a week after the irretrievable disappearance of Fifi and Mimi , she went so far as to admit a note of unconscious confession into her protest that she was getting pretty tired of being mistaken for a three-ring circus !
Parsing [sent. 569 len. 20]: Such was her despairing expression , and the confession lies in her use of the word `` three . ''
Parsing [sent. 570 len. 48]: The misleading moderation of `` three '' was pointed out to her by her niece , whose mind at once violently seized upon the word and divested it of context -- a process both feminine and instinctive , for this child was already beginning to be feminine .
Parsing [sent. 571 len. 4]: `` Three ! ''
Parsing [sent. 572 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 573 len. 11]: `` Why , Aunt Julia , you must be crazy !
Parsing [sent. 574 len. 62]: There 's Newland Sanders and Noble Dill and that old widower , Ridgley , that grandpa hates so , and Mister Clairdyce and George Plum and the two new ones from out of town that Aunt Fanny Patterson said you had at church Sunday morning -- Herbert said he did n't like one of 'em 's looks much , Aunt Julia .
Parsing [sent. 575 len. 46]: And there 's Parker Kent Usher and that funny-lookin ' one with the little piece of whiskers under his underlip that Noble Dill got so mad at when they were calling , and Uncle Joe laughed about , and I do n't know who all !
Parsing [sent. 576 len. 15]: Anyhow , there 's an awful lot more than three , Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 577 len. 11]: Julia looked down with little favour upon the talkative caller .
Parsing [sent. 578 len. 26]: Florence was seated upon the shady steps of the veranda , and Julia , dressed for a walk , occupied a wicker chair above her .
Parsing [sent. 579 len. 14]: `` Julia , dressed for a walk '' -- how scant the words !
Parsing [sent. 580 len. 60]: It was a summer walk that Julia had dressed for : and she was all too dashingly a picture of coolness on a hot day : a brunette in murmurous white , though her little hat was a film of blackest blue , and thus also in belt and parasol she had almost matched the colour of her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 581 len. 65]: Probably no human-made fabric could have come nearer to matching them , though she had once met a great traveller -- at least he went far enough in his search for comparisons -- who told her that the Czarina of Russia had owned a deep sapphire of precisely the colour , but the Czarina 's was the only sapphire yet discovered that had it .
Parsing [sent. 582 len. 14]: One of Newland Sanders 's longest Poems-to-Julia was entitled `` Black Sapphires . ''
Parsing [sent. 583 len. 10]: Julia 's harmonies in black sapphire were uncalled for .
Parsing [sent. 584 len. 50]: If she really had been as kind as she was too often capable of looking , she would have fastened patches over both eyes -- one patch would have been useless -- and she would have worn flat shoes and patronized a dressmaker with genius enough to misrepresent her .
Parsing [sent. 585 len. 27]: But Julia was not great enough for such generosities : she should have been locked up till she passed sixty ; her sufferings deserve no pity .
Parsing [sent. 586 len. 40]: And yet an attack of the mumps during the winter had brought Julia more sympathy than the epidemic of typhoid fever in the Old Ladies ' Infirmary brought all of the nine old ladies who were under treatment there .
Parsing [sent. 587 len. 34]: Julia was confined to her room for almost a month , during which a florist 's wagon seemed permanent before the house : and a confectioner 's frequently stood beside the florist 's .
Parsing [sent. 588 len. 56]: Young Florence , an immune who had known the mumps in infancy , became an almost constant attendant upon the patient , with the result that the niece contracted an illness briefer than the aunt 's , but more than equalling it in poignancy , caused by the poor child 's economic struggle against waste .
Parsing [sent. 589 len. 30]: Florence 's convalescence took place in her own home without any inquiries whatever from the outer world , but Julia 's was spent in great part at the telephone .
Parsing [sent. 590 len. 38]: Even a poem was repeated to her by the instrument : How the world blooms anew To think that you Can speak again , Can hear The words of men And the dear Own voice of you .
Parsing [sent. 591 len. 5]: This was Newland Sanders .
Parsing [sent. 592 len. 21]: He was just out of college , a reviewer , a poet , and once , momentarily , an atheist .
Parsing [sent. 593 len. 40]: It was Newland who was present and said such a remarkable thing when Julia had the accident to her thumb-nail in closing the double doors between the living-room and the library , where her peculiar old father sat reading .
Parsing [sent. 594 len. 40]: `` To see you suffer , '' Newland said passionately as she nursed her injury : -- `` to see you in pain , that is the one thing in the universe which I feel beyond all my capacities .
Parsing [sent. 595 len. 22]: Do you know , when you are made to suffer pain , then I feel that there is no God ! ''
Parsing [sent. 596 len. 32]: This strong declaration struck Herbert as one of the most impressive things he had ever heard , though he could not account for its being said to any aunt of his .
Parsing [sent. 597 len. 28]: Herbert had just dropped in without the formality of ringing the bell , and had paused in the hall , outside the open door of the living-room .
Parsing [sent. 598 len. 28]: He considered the matter , after Newland had spoken , and concluded to return to his own place of residence without disturbing anybody at his grandfather 's .
Parsing [sent. 599 len. 59]: At home he found his mother and father entertaining one of his uncles , one of his aunts , two of his great-uncles , one of his great-aunts , and one of his grown-up cousins , at cards : and he proved to be warranted in believing that they would all like to know what he had heard .
Parsing [sent. 600 len. 46]: Newland 's statement became quite celebrated throughout the family : and Julia , who had perceived almost a sacred something in his original fervour , changed her mind after hearing the words musingly repeated , over and over , by her fat old Uncle Joe .
Parsing [sent. 601 len. 24]: Florence thought proper to remind her of this to-day , after Julia 's protest containing the too moderately confessional word `` three . ''
Parsing [sent. 602 len. 44]: `` If you do n't want to be such a circus , '' the niece continued , reasoning perfectly , `` I do n't see what you always keep leadin ' all of 'em on all the time just the same for . ''
Parsing [sent. 603 len. 11]: `` Who 've you heard saying that , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 604 len. 4]: her aunt demanded .
Parsing [sent. 605 len. 10]: `` Aunt Fanny Patterson , '' Florence replied absently .
Parsing [sent. 606 len. 67]: `` F ' r instance , Aunt Julia , I do n't see what you want to go walking with Newland Sanders for , when you said yourself you wished he was dead , or somep ` n , after there got to be so muck talk in the family and everywhere about his sayin ' all that about the Bible when you hurt your thumb .
Parsing [sent. 607 len. 9]: All the family -- '' Julia sighed profoundly .
Parsing [sent. 608 len. 20]: `` I wish ` all the family ' would try to think about themselves for just a little while !
Parsing [sent. 609 len. 14]: There 's entirely too little self-centredness among my relatives to suit me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 610 len. 33]: `` Why , it 's only because you 're related to me that _ I _ pay the very _ slightest _ attention to what goes on here , '' Florence protested .
Parsing [sent. 611 len. 13]: `` It 's my own grandfather 's house , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 612 len. 37]: Well , if you did n't live here , and if you was n't my own grandfather 's daughter , Aunt Julia , I would n't ever pay the _ very _ slightest attention to you !
Parsing [sent. 613 len. 27]: Anyway , I do n't _ much _ criticize all these people that keep calling on you -- anyway not half as much as Herbert does .
Parsing [sent. 614 len. 17]: Herbert thinks he always hass to act so critical , now his voice is changing . ''
Parsing [sent. 615 len. 18]: `` At your age , '' said Julia , `` my mind was on my schoolbooks . ''
Parsing [sent. 616 len. 7]: `` Why , Aunt Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 617 len. 6]: Florence exclaimed in frank surprise .
Parsing [sent. 618 len. 9]: `` Grandpa says just the opposite from that .
Parsing [sent. 619 len. 30]: I 've heard him say , time and time and time again , you always _ were _ this way , ever since you were four years old . ''
Parsing [sent. 620 len. 5]: `` What way ? ''
Parsing [sent. 621 len. 4]: asked her aunt .
Parsing [sent. 622 len. 9]: `` Like you are now , Aunt Julia .
Parsing [sent. 623 len. 28]: Grandpa says by the time you were fourteen it got so bad he had to get a new front gate , the way they leaned on it .
Parsing [sent. 624 len. 46]: He says he hoped when you grew up he 'd get a little peace in his own house , but he says it 's worse , and never for one minute the livelong day can he -- '' `` I know , '' Julia interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 625 len. 12]: `` He talks like a Christian Martyr and behaves like Nero .
Parsing [sent. 626 len. 16]: I might warn you to keep away from him , by the way , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 627 len. 25]: He says that either you or Herbert was over here yesterday and used his spectacles to cut a magazine with , and broke them .
Parsing [sent. 628 len. 19]: I would n't be around here much if I were you until he 's got over it . ''
Parsing [sent. 629 len. 14]: `` It must have been Herbert broke 'em , '' said Florence promptly .
Parsing [sent. 630 len. 7]: `` Papa thinks it was you .
Parsing [sent. 631 len. 8]: Kitty Silver told him it was . ''
Parsing [sent. 632 len. 6]: `` Mean ole reptile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 633 len. 36]: said Florence , alluding to Mrs. Silver ; then she added serenely , `` Well , grandpa do n't get home till five o'clock , and it 's only about a quarter of two now .
Parsing [sent. 634 len. 13]: Aunt Julia , what are you waitin ' around here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 635 len. 11]: `` I told you ; I 'm going walking . ''
Parsing [sent. 636 len. 8]: `` I mean : Who with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 637 len. 8]: Miss Atwater permitted herself a light moan .
Parsing [sent. 638 len. 11]: `` With Mr. Sanders and Mr. Ridgely , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 639 len. 8]: Florence 's eyes grew large and eager .
Parsing [sent. 640 len. 20]: `` Why , Aunt Julia , I thought those two did n't speak to each other any more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 641 len. 13]: `` They do n't , '' Julia assented in a lifeless voice .
Parsing [sent. 642 len. 30]: `` It just happened that Mr. Sanders and Mr. Ridgley and Mr. Dill , all three , asked me to take a walk this afternoon at two o'clock . ''
Parsing [sent. 643 len. 9]: `` But Noble Dill is n't going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 644 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Julia .
Parsing [sent. 645 len. 19]: `` I was fortunate enough to remember that I 'd already promised someone else when he asked me .
Parsing [sent. 646 len. 14]: That 's what I did n't remember when Mr. Ridgely asked me . ''
Parsing [sent. 647 len. 14]: `` I 'd have gone with Noble Dill , '' Florence said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 648 len. 8]: `` Noble Dill is my Very Ideal !
Parsing [sent. 649 len. 7]: I 'd marry him to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 650 len. 35]: `` It seems to me , '' her aunt remarked , `` I heard your mother telling somebody the other day that you had said the same thing about the King of Spain . ''
Parsing [sent. 651 len. 3]: Florence laughed .
Parsing [sent. 652 len. 15]: `` Oh , that was only a passing fancy , '' she said lightly .
Parsing [sent. 653 len. 13]: `` Aunt Julia , what 's Newland Sanders supposed to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 654 len. 14]: `` I think he has n't entered any business or profession yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 655 len. 12]: `` I bet he could n't , '' her niece declared .
Parsing [sent. 656 len. 10]: `` What 's that old Ridgely supposed to be ?
Parsing [sent. 657 len. 5]: Just a widower ? ''
Parsing [sent. 658 len. 5]: `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 659 len. 24]: `` And that George Plum 's supposed to do something or other around Uncle Joe 's ole bank , is n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 660 len. 4]: Florence continued . ''
Parsing [sent. 661 len. 5]: ` Supposed ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 662 len. 3]: Julia protested .
Parsing [sent. 663 len. 11]: `` What is all this ` supposed to be ' ?
Parsing [sent. 664 len. 8]: Where did you catch that horrible habit ?
Parsing [sent. 665 len. 29]: You know the whole family worries over your superciliousness , Florence ; but until now I 've always thought it was just the way your face felt easiest .
Parsing [sent. 666 len. 25]: If it 's going to break out in your talk , too , it 's time you began to cure yourself of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 667 len. 10]: `` Oh , it does n't hurt anything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 668 len. 26]: Florence made careless response , and , as she saw the thin figure of young Mr. Sanders approaching in the distance , `` Look ! ''
Parsing [sent. 669 len. 5]: she cried , pointing .
Parsing [sent. 670 len. 15]: `` Why , he does n't even _ compare _ to Noble Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 671 len. 8]: `` Do n't point at people ! ''
Parsing [sent. 672 len. 12]: `` Well , he 's nothing much to point at ! ''
Parsing [sent. 673 len. 5]: She lowered her finger .
Parsing [sent. 674 len. 19]: `` It 's no depredation to me , Aunt Julia , to give up pointing at Newland Sanders .
Parsing [sent. 675 len. 22]: Atch ` ly , I would n't give Noble Dill 's little finger for a hunderd and fifty Newland Sanderses ! ''
Parsing [sent. 676 len. 37]: Julia smiled faintly as she watched Mr. Sanders , who seemed not yet to be aware of her , because he thought it would be better to reach the gate and lift his hat just there .
Parsing [sent. 677 len. 19]: `` What _ has _ brought on all this tenderness in favour of Mr. Dill , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 678 len. 13]: Her niece 's eyes , concentrated in thought , then became dreamy .
Parsing [sent. 679 len. 14]: `` I like him because he 's so uncouth , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 680 len. 16]: `` I think he 's the uncouthest of any person I ever saw . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 681 len. 5]: ` Uncouth ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 682 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 683 len. 16]: `` Herbert said I was uncouth , and I looked it up in the ditchanary .
Parsing [sent. 684 len. 25]: It said , ` Rare , exquisite , elegant , unknown , obs , unfamiliar , strange , ' and a whole lot else .
Parsing [sent. 685 len. 14]: I never did know a word that means so much , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 686 len. 11]: What 's ` obs ' mean , Aunt Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 687 len. 4]: `` Hush ! ''
Parsing [sent. 688 len. 46]: said Julia , rising , for Mr. Sanders had made a little startled movement as he reached the gate and caught sight of her ; and now , straw hat in hand , he was coming up the brick walk that led to the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 689 len. 23]: His eyes were fixed upon Julia with an intensity that seemed to affect his breathing ; there was a hushedness about him .
Parsing [sent. 690 len. 40]: And Florence , in fascination , watched Julia 's expression and posture take on those little changes that always seemed demanded of her by the approach of a young or youngish man , or a nicely dressed old one .
Parsing [sent. 691 len. 12]: By almost imperceptible processes the commonplace moment became dramatic at once .
Parsing [sent. 692 len. 4]: `` You ! ''
Parsing [sent. 693 len. 7]: said Newland in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 694 len. 34]: And Julia , with an implication as flattering as the gesture was graceful , did not wait till he was within reach , but suddenly extended her welcoming hand at arm 's length .
Parsing [sent. 695 len. 12]: He sprang forward convulsively and grasped it , as if forever .
Parsing [sent. 696 len. 8]: `` You see my little niece ? ''
Parsing [sent. 697 len. 3]: Julia said .
Parsing [sent. 698 len. 8]: `` I think you know her . ''
Parsing [sent. 699 len. 5]: `` Know her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 700 len. 21]: Mr. Sanders repeated ; then roused his faculties and gave Florence a few fingers dangling coldly after their recent emotion .
Parsing [sent. 701 len. 3]: `` Florence .
Parsing [sent. 702 len. 7]: Oh , yes , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 703 len. 29]: Florence had not risen , but remained seated upon the steps , her look and air committed to that mood of which so much complaint had been made .
Parsing [sent. 704 len. 10]: `` How do you do , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 705 len. 7]: `` There 's Mr. Ridgely . ''
Parsing [sent. 706 len. 4]: `` Where ? ''
Parsing [sent. 707 len. 4]: Newland asked loudly .
Parsing [sent. 708 len. 12]: `` Comin ' in at the gate , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 709 len. 13]: `` He 's goin ' walkin ' with you , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 710 len. 15]: In this crisis , Mr. Sanders 's feeling was obviously one of startled anguish .
Parsing [sent. 711 len. 5]: He turned to Julia .
Parsing [sent. 712 len. 8]: `` Why , this is terrible ! ''
Parsing [sent. 713 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 714 len. 10]: `` You told me -- '' `` Sh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 715 len. 20]: she warned him ; and whispered hastily , all in a breath : '' _ Could n't - be-helped-explain-next-time-I-see-you .
Parsing [sent. 716 len. 13]: _ '' Then she advanced a gracious step to meet the newcomer .
Parsing [sent. 717 len. 42]: But the superciliousness of Florence visibly increased with this advent : Mr. Ridgely was easily old enough to be her grandfather , yet she seemed to wish it evident that she would not have cared for him even in that capacity .
Parsing [sent. 718 len. 22]: He was , in truth , one of those widowers who feel younger than ever , and behave as they feel .
Parsing [sent. 719 len. 64]: Since his loss he had shown the greatest willingness to forego whatever advantages age and experience had given him over the descendants of his old friends and colleagues , and his cheerfulness as well as his susceptibility to all that was charming had begun to make him so famous in the town that some of his contemporaries seemed to know scarce another topic .
Parsing [sent. 720 len. 17]: And Julia had a kinder heart , as her father bitterly complained , than most girls .
Parsing [sent. 721 len. 43]: The widower came , holding out to her a votive cluster of violets , a pink rose among them , their stems wrapped in purple ; and upon the lapel of his jovial flannel coat were other violets about a pink rosebud .
Parsing [sent. 722 len. 7]: `` How pretty of you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 723 len. 36]: said Julia , taking the offering ; and as she pinned it at her waist , she added rather nervously , `` I believe you know Mr. Sanders ; he is going with us . ''
Parsing [sent. 724 len. 42]: She was warranted in believing the gentlemen to be acquainted , because no longer ago than the previous week they both had stated , in her presence and simultaneously , that any further communication between them would be omitted for life .
Parsing [sent. 725 len. 45]: Julia realized , of course , that Mr. Ridgely must find the present meeting as trying as Newland did , and , to help him bear it , she contrived to make him hear the hurried whisper : '' _ Could n't - be-helped-explain-some-day .
Parsing [sent. 726 len. 16]: _ '' Then with a laugh not altogether assured , she took up her parasol .
Parsing [sent. 727 len. 7]: `` Shall we be starting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 728 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 729 len. 32]: `` Here 's Noble Dill , '' said Florence , `` I guess he 's goin ' to try to go walkin ' with you , too , Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 730 len. 21]: Julia turned , for in fact the gate at that moment clicked behind the nervously advancing form of Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 731 len. 43]: He came with , a bravado that was merely pitiable and he tried to snap his Orduma cigarette away with thumb and forefinger in a careless fashion , only to see it publicly disappear through an open cellar window of the house .
Parsing [sent. 732 len. 15]: `` I hope there 's no excelsior down there , '' said Newland Sanders .
Parsing [sent. 733 len. 15]: `` A good many houses have burned to the ground just that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 734 len. 17]: `` It fell on the cement floor , '' Florence reported , peering into the window .
Parsing [sent. 735 len. 9]: `` It 'll go out pretty soon . ''
Parsing [sent. 736 len. 25]: `` Then I suppose we might as well do the same thing , '' said Newland , addressing Julia first and Mr. Dill second .
Parsing [sent. 737 len. 13]: `` Miss Atwater and I are just starting for a walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 738 len. 8]: Mr. Ridgely also addressed the new arrival .
Parsing [sent. 739 len. 13]: `` Miss Atwater and I are just starting for a walk . ''
Parsing [sent. 740 len. 23]: `` You see , Noble , '' said the kind-hearted Julia , `` I did tell you I had another engagement . ''
Parsing [sent. 741 len. 58]: `` I came by here , '' Mr. Dill began in a tone commingling timidity , love , and a fatal stubbornness ; `` I came by here -- I mean I just happened to be passing -- and I thought if it was a walking - _ party _ , well , why not go along ?
Parsing [sent. 742 len. 9]: That 's the way it struck me . ''
Parsing [sent. 743 len. 40]: He paused , coughing for courage and trying to look easily genial , but not succeeding ; then he added , `` Well , as I say , that 's the way it struck me -- as it were .
Parsing [sent. 744 len. 10]: I suppose we might as well be starting . ''
Parsing [sent. 745 len. 31]: `` Yes , we might , '' Newland Sanders said quickly ; and he placed himself at Julia 's left , seizing upon her parasol and opening it with determination .
Parsing [sent. 746 len. 12]: Mr. Ridgely had kept himself closely at the lady 's right .
Parsing [sent. 747 len. 15]: `` You were mistaken , my boy , '' he said , falsely benevolent .
Parsing [sent. 748 len. 15]: `` It is n't a party -- though there 's Miss Florence , Noble .
Parsing [sent. 749 len. 10]: Nobody 's asked her to go walking to-day ! ''
Parsing [sent. 750 len. 8]: Now , Florence took this satire literally .
Parsing [sent. 751 len. 13]: She jumped up and said brightly : `` I just as soon !
Parsing [sent. 752 len. 9]: Let 's _ do _ have a walking-party .
Parsing [sent. 753 len. 22]: I just as soon walk with Mr. Dill as anybody , and we can all keep together , kind of . ''
Parsing [sent. 754 len. 27]: With that , she stepped confidently to the side of her selected escort , who appeared to be at a loss how to avert her kindness .
Parsing [sent. 755 len. 66]: There was a moment of hesitation , during which a malevolent pleasure slightly disfigured the countenances of the two gentlemen with Julia ; but when Florence pointed to a house across the street and remarked , `` There 's Great-Uncle Milford and Aunt C'nelia ; they been lookin ' out of their second guestroom window about half an hour , '' Julia uttered an exclamation .
Parsing [sent. 756 len. 4]: `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 757 len. 11]: she said , and moved with decision toward the gate .
Parsing [sent. 758 len. 6]: `` Let 's go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 759 len. 57]: Thus the little procession started , Mr. Sanders and the sprightly widower at Beauty 's side , with Florence and Mr. Dill so close behind that , before they had gone a block , Newland found it necessary to warn this rear rank that the heels of his new shoes were not part of the pavement .
Parsing [sent. 760 len. 17]: After that the rear rank , a little abashed , consented to fall back some paces .
Parsing [sent. 761 len. 21]: Julia 's heightened colour , meanwhile , was little abated by some slight episodes attending the progress of the walking-party .
Parsing [sent. 762 len. 46]: Her Aunt Fanny Patterson , rocking upon a veranda , rose and evidently called to someone within the house , whereupon she was joined by her invalid sister , Aunt Harriet , with a trained nurse and two elderly domestics , a solemnly whispering audience .
Parsing [sent. 763 len. 29]: And in the front yard of `` the Henry Atwater house , '' at the next corner , Herbert underwent a genuine bedazzlement , but he affected more .
Parsing [sent. 764 len. 38]: His violent gaze dwelt upon Florence , and he permitted his legs slowly to crumple under him , until , just as the party came nearest him , he lay prostrate upon his back in a swoon .
Parsing [sent. 765 len. 19]: Afterward he rose and for a time followed in a burlesque manner ; then decided to return home .
Parsing [sent. 766 len. 5]: `` Old heathen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 767 len. 14]: said Florence , glancing back over her shoulder as he disappeared from view .
Parsing [sent. 768 len. 17]: Mr. Dill was startled from a reverie inspired by the back of Julia 's head . ''
Parsing [sent. 769 len. 5]: ` Heathen ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 770 len. 7]: he said , in plaintive inquiry .
Parsing [sent. 771 len. 10]: `` I meant Herbert , '' Florence informed him .
Parsing [sent. 772 len. 5]: `` Cousin Herbert Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 773 len. 10]: He was following us , walking Dutch . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 774 len. 7]: ` Cousin Herbert Atwater ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 775 len. 5]: said Noble dreamily . ''
Parsing [sent. 776 len. 5]: ` Dutch ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 777 len. 11]: `` He wo n't any more , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 778 len. 15]: `` He always hass to show off , now his voice is changing . ''
Parsing [sent. 779 len. 32]: She spoke , and she also walked , with dignity -- a rather dashing kind of dignity , which was what Herbert 's eccentricity of gait intended to point out injuriously .
Parsing [sent. 780 len. 65]: In fact , never before had Florence been so impressed with herself ; never before , indeed , had she been a member of a grown-up non-family party ; never before had she gone walking with an actual adult young man for her escort ; and she felt that she owed it to her position to appear in as brilliant an aspect as possible .
Parsing [sent. 781 len. 54]: She managed to give herself a rhythmical , switching motion , causing her kneelength skirt to swing from side to side -- a pomp that brought her a great deal of satisfaction as she now and then caught the effect by twisting her neck enough to see down behind , over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 782 len. 14]: But her poise was temporarily threatened when the walking-party passed her own house .
Parsing [sent. 783 len. 41]: Her mother happened to be sitting near an open window upstairs , and , after gazing forth with warm interest at Julia and her two outwalkers , Mrs. Atwater 's astonished eyes fell upon Florence taking care of the overflow .
Parsing [sent. 784 len. 4]: Florence bowed graciously .
Parsing [sent. 785 len. 4]: `` Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 786 len. 34]: her mother called down from the window : whereupon both Florence and her Aunt Julia were instantly apprehensive , for Mrs. George Atwater 's lack of tact was a legend in the family .
Parsing [sent. 787 len. 3]: `` Florence !
Parsing [sent. 788 len. 8]: Where on earth are you going ? ''
Parsing [sent. 789 len. 5]: `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 790 len. 6]: Florence thought best to respond .
Parsing [sent. 791 len. 5]: `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 792 len. 24]: `` You 'd better come _ in _ , '' Mrs. Atwater called , her voice necessarily louder as the party moved onward .
Parsing [sent. 793 len. 5]: `` Never mind ! ''
Parsing [sent. 794 len. 4]: Florence called back .
Parsing [sent. 795 len. 8]: Mrs. Atwater leaned out of the window .
Parsing [sent. 796 len. 6]: `` Where are you going ?
Parsing [sent. 797 len. 9]: Come back and get your _ hat _ .
Parsing [sent. 798 len. 9]: You 'll get a _ sunstroke _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 799 len. 30]: Florence was able to conceal her indignation , and merely waved a hand in airy dismissal as they passed from Mrs. Atwater 's sight , leaving her still shouting .
Parsing [sent. 800 len. 9]: The daughter smiled negligently and shrugged her shoulders .
Parsing [sent. 801 len. 8]: `` She 'll get over it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 802 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 803 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 804 len. 4]: `` My mother .
Parsing [sent. 805 len. 14]: She was the one makin ' all that noise , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 806 len. 13]: `` Sometimes I do what she says : sometimes I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 807 len. 11]: It 's all accordings to the way I feel . ''
Parsing [sent. 808 len. 53]: She looked up in her companion 's face , and her expression became politely fond as she thought how uncouth he was , for in Florence 's eye Noble Dill was truly rare , exquisite , and unfamiliar ; and she believed that he was obs , too , whatever that meant .
Parsing [sent. 809 len. 35]: She often thought about him , and no longer ago than yesterday she had told Kitty Silver that she could n't see `` how Aunt Julia could _ look _ at anybody else ! ''
Parsing [sent. 810 len. 20]: Florence 's selection of Noble Dill for the bright favourite of her dreams was one of her own mysteries .
Parsing [sent. 811 len. 32]: Noble was not beautiful , neither did he present to the ordinary eye of man anything especially rare , exquisite , unfamiliar , or even so distinguished as to be obsolete .
Parsing [sent. 812 len. 41]: He was about twenty-two , but not one of those book-read sportsmen of that age , confident in clothes and manner , easy travellers and debonair ; that is to say , Noble was not of the worldly type twenty-two .
Parsing [sent. 813 len. 54]: True , he had graduated from the High-school before entering his father 's Real Estate and Insurance office , but his geographical experiences -LRB- in particular -RRB- had been limited to three or four railway excursions , at special rates , to such points of interest as Mammoth Cave and Petoskey , Michigan .
Parsing [sent. 814 len. 49]: His other experiences were not more sparkling , and except for the emotions within him , he was in all the qualities of his mind as well as in his bodily contours and the apparel sheltering the latter , the most commonplace person in Florence 's visible world .
Parsing [sent. 815 len. 49]: The inner areas of the first and second fingers of his left hand bore cigarette stains , seemingly indelible : the first and second fingers of his right hand were strongly ornamented in a like manner ; tokens proving him ambidextrous to but a limited extent , however .
Parsing [sent. 816 len. 23]: Moreover , his garments and garnitures were not comparable to those of either Newland Sanders or that dapper antique , Mr. Ridgely .
Parsing [sent. 817 len. 71]: Noble 's straw hat might have brightened under the treatment of lemon juice or other restorative ; his scarf was folded to hide a spot that worked steadily toward a complete visibility , and some recent efforts upon his trousers with a tepid iron , in his bedchamber at home , counteracted but feebly that tendency of cloth to sculpture itself in hummocks upon repeated pressure of the human knee .
Parsing [sent. 818 len. 25]: All in all , nothing except the expression of Noble 's face and the somewhat ill-chosen pansy in his buttonhole hinted of the remarkable .
Parsing [sent. 819 len. 22]: Yet even here was a thing for which he was not responsible himself ; it was altogether the work of Julia .
Parsing [sent. 820 len. 48]: What her work was , in the case of Noble Dill , may be expressed in a word -- a word used not only by the whole Atwater family connection , in completely expressing Noble 's condition , but by Noble 's own family connection as well .
Parsing [sent. 821 len. 8]: This complete word was `` awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 822 len. 51]: Florence was the one exception on the Atwater side : she was far , far from thinking or speaking of Noble Dill in that way , although , until she looked up `` uncouth '' in Webster 's Collegiate Dictionary , she had not found suitable means to describe him .
Parsing [sent. 823 len. 21]: And now , as she walked at his side , she found her sensations to be nothing short of thrilling .
Parsing [sent. 824 len. 33]: For it must be borne in mind that this was her first and wholly unexpected outburst into society ; the experience was that of an obscure aerolite suddenly become a noble meteor .
Parsing [sent. 825 len. 23]: She longed to say or do something magnificent -- something strange and exhilarating , in keeping with her new station in life .
Parsing [sent. 826 len. 26]: It was this longing , and by no means a confirmed unveracity , that prompted her to amplify her comments upon her own filial independence .
Parsing [sent. 827 len. 21]: `` Oh , I guess I pretty near never do anything I do n't want to , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 828 len. 11]: `` I kind of run the house to suit myself .
Parsing [sent. 829 len. 26]: I guess if the truth had to be told , I just about run the whole Atwater family , when it comes to that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 830 len. 21]: The statement was so noticeable that it succeeded in turning Noble 's attention from the back of Julia 's head .
Parsing [sent. 831 len. 5]: `` You do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 832 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 833 len. 12]: `` Well , that seems queer , '' he added absently .
Parsing [sent. 834 len. 9]: `` Oh , I do n't know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 835 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 836 len. 72]: In her increasing exaltation things appeared actually to be as she wished them to be ; an atmosphere both queenly and adventurous seemed to invest her , and any remnants of human caution in her were assuaged by the circumstance that her Aunt Julia 's attention was subject to the strong demands necessarily imposed upon anybody taking a walk between two gentlemen who do not `` speak '' to each other .
Parsing [sent. 837 len. 12]: `` Oh , I do n't know , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 838 len. 14]: `` The family 's used to it by this time , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 839 len. 14]: The way I do things , they haf to be , I guess .
Parsing [sent. 840 len. 37]: When they do n't like it I do n't say much for a while , then I just -- '' She paused , waiting for her imagination to supply a sequel to the drama just sketched .
Parsing [sent. 841 len. 22]: `` Well , I guess they kind of find out they better step around pretty lively , '' she concluded darkly .
Parsing [sent. 842 len. 12]: `` They do n't bother around _ too _ much ! ''
Parsing [sent. 843 len. 18]: `` I suppose not , '' said Noble , his vacancy and credulity continuing to dovetail perfectly .
Parsing [sent. 844 len. 6]: `` You bet not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 845 len. 12]: the exuberant Florence thought proper to suggest as a preferable expression .
Parsing [sent. 846 len. 15]: And then she had an inspiration to enliven his dreamy interest in her conversation .
Parsing [sent. 847 len. 17]: `` Grandpa , he 's the one I kind of run most of all of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 848 len. 17]: He 's about fifty or sixty , and so he has n't got too much sense .
Parsing [sent. 849 len. 18]: What I mean , he has n't got too much sense _ left _ , you know .
Parsing [sent. 850 len. 14]: So I haf to sort of take holt every now and then . ''
Parsing [sent. 851 len. 17]: She lowered her voice a little , some faint whisper of discretion reaching her inward ear .
Parsing [sent. 852 len. 11]: `` Aunt Julia ca n't do a thing with him .
Parsing [sent. 853 len. 24]: I guess that 's maybe the reason she kind of depen 's on me so much ; or anyway somep 'n like that .
Parsing [sent. 854 len. 26]: You know , f ' r instance , I had to help talk grandpa into lettin ' her send to New York for her things .
Parsing [sent. 855 len. 11]: Aunt Julia gets all her things in New York . ''
Parsing [sent. 856 len. 10]: Undeniably , Mr. Dill 's interest flickered up . ''
Parsing [sent. 857 len. 5]: _ Things _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 858 len. 4]: he repeated inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 859 len. 5]: `` Her things ? ''
Parsing [sent. 860 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 861 len. 8]: Everything she wears , you know . ''
Parsing [sent. 862 len. 6]: `` Oh , yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 863 len. 23]: `` What I was goin ' to tell you , '' Florence continued , `` you know grandpa just about hates everybody .
Parsing [sent. 864 len. 140]: Anyhow , he 'd like to have some peace and quiet once in a while in his own house , he says , instead of all this moil and turmoil , and because the doctor said all the matter with her was she eats too much candy , and they keep sendin ' more all the time -- and there 's somep 'n the trouble with grandpa : it makes him sick to smell violets : he had it ever since he was a little boy , and he ca n't help it ; and he hates animals , and they keep sendin ' her Airedales and Persian kittens , and then there was that alligator came from Florida and upset Kitty Silver terribly -- and so , you see , grandpa just hates the whole everlasting business . ''
Parsing [sent. 865 len. 17]: Mr. Dill nodded and spoke with conviction : `` He 's absolutely right ; absolutely ! ''
Parsing [sent. 866 len. 37]: `` Well , some ways he is , '' said Florence ; and she added confidentially : `` The trouble is , he seems to think you 're about as bad as any of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 867 len. 5]: `` What ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 868 len. 5]: _ Well _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 869 len. 32]: Florence exclaimed , with upward gestures both of eye and of hand , to signify what she left untold of Mr. Atwater 's orations upon his favourite subject : Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 870 len. 6]: `` It 's torrable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 871 len. 3]: she added .
Parsing [sent. 872 len. 17]: Noble breathed heavily , but a thought struggled in him and a brightening appeared upon him .
Parsing [sent. 873 len. 8]: `` You mean -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 874 len. 12]: `` Do you mean it 's terrible for your Aunt Julia ?
Parsing [sent. 875 len. 13]: Do you mean his injustice about me makes her feel terribly ? ''
Parsing [sent. 876 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 877 len. 13]: `` No : I mean the way he goes on about everybody .
Parsing [sent. 878 len. 10]: But Aunt Julia 's kind of used to it .
Parsing [sent. 879 len. 17]: And anyhow you need n't worry about him ` long as I 'm on your side .
Parsing [sent. 880 len. 14]: He wo n't do anything much to you if I say not to .
Parsing [sent. 881 len. 6]: Hardly anything at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 882 len. 31]: And then , with almost a tenderness , as she marked the visibly insufficient reassurance of her companion , she said handsomely : `` He wo n't say a word .
Parsing [sent. 883 len. 8]: I 'll tell him not to . ''
Parsing [sent. 884 len. 49]: Noble was dazed ; no novelty , for he had been dazed almost continually during the past seven months , since a night when dancing with Julia , whom he had known all his life , he `` noticed for the first time what she looked like . ''
Parsing [sent. 885 len. 9]: -LRB- This was his mother 's description . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 886 len. 34]: Somewhere , he vaguely recalled , he had read of the extraordinary influence possessed by certain angelic kinds of children ; he knew , too , what favourite grandchildren can do with grandfathers .
Parsing [sent. 887 len. 21]: The effect upon him was altogether base ; he immediately sought by flattery to increase and retain Florence 's kindness .
Parsing [sent. 888 len. 22]: `` I always _ thought _ you seemed to know more than most girls of your age , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 889 len. 8]: It was a great afternoon for Florence .
Parsing [sent. 890 len. 53]: From time to time she glanced over her shoulder at the switching skirt , and increased its radius of action , though this probably required more exercise , compared to the extent of ground covered , than any lady member of a walking-party had ever before taken , merely as a pedestrian .
Parsing [sent. 891 len. 45]: Meanwhile , she chattered on , but found time to listen to the pleasant things said to her by her companion ; and though most of these were , in truth , rather vague , she was won to him more than he knew .
Parsing [sent. 892 len. 18]: Henceforth she was to be his champion indeed , sometimes with greater energy than he would need .
Parsing [sent. 893 len. 27]: ... The two were left alone together by Julia 's gate when the walk -LRB- as short as Julia dared to make it -RRB- was over .
Parsing [sent. 894 len. 16]: `` Well , '' Florence said , `` I 've had quite a nice time .
Parsing [sent. 895 len. 13]: I hope you enjoyed yourself nicely , too , Mr. Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 896 len. 14]: Then her eye rose to the overhanging branch of a shade-tree near them .
Parsing [sent. 897 len. 11]: `` Would you like to see me chin myself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 898 len. 8]: she asked , stepping beneath the branch .
Parsing [sent. 899 len. 10]: `` I bet I could skin-the-cat on that limb !
Parsing [sent. 900 len. 10]: Would you like to see me do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 901 len. 8]: `` I would _ so _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 902 len. 4]: the flatterer enthused .
Parsing [sent. 903 len. 18]: She became thoughtful , remembering that she was now a lady who took walks with grown gentlemen .
Parsing [sent. 904 len. 13]: `` I can , but I wo n't , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 905 len. 11]: `` I used to do lots of things like that .
Parsing [sent. 906 len. 9]: I used to whenever I felt like it .
Parsing [sent. 907 len. 11]: I could chin myself four times and Herbert only three .
Parsing [sent. 908 len. 19]: I was lots better than Herbert when I used to do all kinds of things like that . ''
Parsing [sent. 909 len. 5]: `` Were you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 910 len. 12]: She laughed as in a musing retrospect of times gone by .
Parsing [sent. 911 len. 22]: `` I guess I used to be a pretty queer kind of a girl in those days , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 912 len. 24]: `` Well -- I s ` pose we ought to say good-bye for the present , so to speak , Mr. Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 913 len. 7]: `` I 'm afraid so . ''
Parsing [sent. 914 len. 17]: `` Well -- '' She stood looking at him expectantly , but he said nothing more .
Parsing [sent. 915 len. 25]: `` Well , good-bye for the present , Mr. Dill , '' she said again , and , turning , walked away with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 916 len. 13]: But a moment later she forgot all about her skirt and scampered .
Parsing [sent. 917 len. 38]: CHAPTER FOUR Mrs. Dill , Noble 's mother , talked of organizing a Young Men 's Mothers ' Club against Julia , nevertheless she acknowledged that in one solitary way Noble was being improved by the experience .
Parsing [sent. 918 len. 50]: His two previous attacks of love -LRB- one at twelve , and the other at eighteen -RRB- had been incomparably lighter , and the changes in him , noted at home , merely a slight general irritability and a lack of domestic punctuality due to too much punctuality elsewhere .
Parsing [sent. 919 len. 43]: But , when his Julia Atwater trouble came , the very first symptom he manifested was a strange new effort to become beautiful ; his mother even discovered that he sometimes worked with pumice stone upon the cigarette stains on his fingers .
Parsing [sent. 920 len. 69]: The most curious thing about his condition was that for a long time he took it for granted that his family did not know what was the matter with him ; and this shows as nothing else could the meekness and tact of the Dills ; for , excluding bad cooks and the dangerously insane , the persons most disturbing to the serenity of households are young lovers .
Parsing [sent. 921 len. 22]: But the world has had to accommodate itself to them because young lovers can not possibly accommodate themselves to the world .
Parsing [sent. 922 len. 26]: For the young lover there is no general life of the species ; for him the universe is a delicate blush under a single bonnet .
Parsing [sent. 923 len. 26]: He has but an irritated perception of every vital thing in nature except the vital thing under this bonnet ; all else is trivial intrusion .
Parsing [sent. 924 len. 25]: But whatever does concern the centrifugal bonnet , whatever concerns it in the remotest -- ah , _ then _ he springs to life !
Parsing [sent. 925 len. 68]: So Noble Dill sat through a Sunday dinner at home , seemingly drugged to a torpor , while the family talk went on about him ; but when his father , in the course of some remarks upon politics , happened to mention the name of the county-treasurer , Charles J. Patterson , Noble 's startled attention to the conversation was so conspicuous as to be disconcerting .
Parsing [sent. 926 len. 61]: Mrs. Dill signalled with her head that comment should be omitted , and Mr. Dill became , for the moment , one factor in a fairly clear example of telepathic communication , for it is impossible to believe that his wife 's almost imperceptible gesture was what caused him to remember that Charles J. Patterson was Julia Atwater 's uncle .
Parsing [sent. 927 len. 52]: That name , Charles J. Patterson , coming thus upon Noble 's ear , was like an unexpected shrine on the wayside where plods the fanatic pilgrim ; and yet Mr. Patterson was the most casual of Julia 's uncles-by-marriage : he neither had nor desired any effect upon her destiny .
Parsing [sent. 928 len. 37]: To Noble he seemed a being ineffably privileged and fateful , and something of the same quality invested the wooden gateposts in front of Julia 's house ; invested everything that had to do with her .
Parsing [sent. 929 len. 49]: What he felt about her father , that august old danger , himself , was not only the uncalled-for affection inevitable toward Julia 's next of kin , but also a kind of horror due to the irresponsible and awful power possessed by a sacred girl 's parent .
Parsing [sent. 930 len. 57]: Florence 's offer of protection had not entirely reassured the young lover , and , in sum , Noble loved Mr. Atwater , but often , in his reveries , when he had rescued him from drowning or being burned to death , he preferred to picture the peculiar old man 's injuries as ultimately fatal .
Parsing [sent. 931 len. 32]: For the other Atwaters his feeling held less of apprehension , more of tenderness ; and whenever he saw one of them he became deferential and a little short of breath .
Parsing [sent. 932 len. 38]: Thus , on a sunny afternoon , having been home to lunch after his morning labour downtown , he paused in passing young Herbert 's place of residence and timidly began a conversation with this glamoured nephew .
Parsing [sent. 933 len. 68]: It happened that during the course of the morning Herbert had chosen a life career for himself ; he had decided to become a scientific specialist , an entomologist ; and he was now on his knees studying the manners and customs of the bug inhabitants of the lawn before the house , employing for his purpose a large magnifying lens , or `` reading glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 934 len. 35]: -LRB- His discovery of this implement in the attic , coincidentally with his reading a recent `` Sunday Supplement '' article on bugs , had led to his sudden choice of a vocation . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 935 len. 17]: `` Did somebody -- ah , have any of the family lost anything , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 936 len. 12]: Noble asked in a gentle voice , speaking across the fence .
Parsing [sent. 937 len. 17]: Herbert did not look up , nor did he relax the scientific frown upon his brow .
Parsing [sent. 938 len. 7]: `` No , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 939 len. 44]: `` They always _ are _ losin ' things , espesh ` ly Aunt Julia , when she comes over here , or anywheres else ; but I would n't waste _ my _ time lookin ' for any old earrings or such .
Parsing [sent. 940 len. 13]: I got more important things to do on my hands . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 941 len. 13]: _ Has _ your Aunt Julia lost an earring , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 942 len. 3]: `` Her ?
Parsing [sent. 943 len. 25]: Well , she nearly always _ has _ lost somep 'n or other , but that is n't bother 'n' _ me _ any .
Parsing [sent. 944 len. 11]: I got better things to do with my time . ''
Parsing [sent. 945 len. 11]: Herbert spoke without interrupting his occupation or relaxing his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 946 len. 74]: `` Nacher ' l history is a _ little _ more important to the inhabitants of our universe than a lot o ' worthless jew ` lry , I guess , '' he continued ; and his pride in discovering that he could say things like this was so great that his frown gave way temporarily to a look of pleased surprise , then came back again to express an importance much increased .
Parsing [sent. 947 len. 14]: He rose , approached the fence , and condescended to lean upon it .
Parsing [sent. 948 len. 33]: `` I do n't guess there 's one person in a thousand , '' he said , `` that knows what they _ ought _ to know about our inseck friends . ''
Parsing [sent. 949 len. 9]: `` No , '' Mr. Dill agreed readily .
Parsing [sent. 950 len. 7]: `` I guess that 's so .
Parsing [sent. 951 len. 10]: I guess you 're right about that , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 952 len. 12]: When did your Aunt Julia lose the earring , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 953 len. 9]: `` I d' know , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 954 len. 16]: `` Now , you take my own father and mother : What do they know ?
Parsing [sent. 955 len. 5]: Well , mighty little .
Parsing [sent. 956 len. 37]: They may have had to learn a little teeny bit about insecks when they were in school , but whatever little it was they went and forgot it proba ` ly long before they were married .
Parsing [sent. 957 len. 7]: Well , that 's no way .
Parsing [sent. 958 len. 30]: F ' r instance , you take a pinchin ' bug : What do you suppose my father and mother know about its position in the inseck world ? ''
Parsing [sent. 959 len. 8]: `` Well -- '' said Noble uneasily .
Parsing [sent. 960 len. 75]: `` Well -- '' He coughed , and hastened to add : `` But as I was saying , if she lost her earring somewhere in your yard , or -- '' The scientific boy evidently did not follow this line of thought , for he interrupted : `` Why , they would n't know a thing about it , and a pinchin ' bug is n't one of the highest insecks at all .
Parsing [sent. 961 len. 11]: Ants are way up compared to most pinchin ' bugs .
Parsing [sent. 962 len. 6]: Ants are way up anyway .
Parsing [sent. 963 len. 11]: Now , you take an ant -- '' He paused .
Parsing [sent. 964 len. 16]: `` Well , everybody ought to know a lot more 'n they do about ants .
Parsing [sent. 965 len. 30]: It takes time , and you got to study 'em the right way , and of course there 's lots of people would n't know how to do it .
Parsing [sent. 966 len. 14]: I 'm goin ' to get a book I been readin ' about .
Parsing [sent. 967 len. 9]: It 's called ` The Ant . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 968 len. 35]: For a moment Noble was confused ; he followed his young friend 's discourse but hazily , and Herbert pronounced the word `` ant '' precisely as he pronounced the word `` aunt . ''
Parsing [sent. 969 len. 47]: The result was that Noble began to say something rather dreamy concerning the book just mentioned , but , realizing that he was being misunderstood , he changed his murmur into a cough , and inquired : `` When was she over here , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 970 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 971 len. 6]: `` Your Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 972 len. 8]: `` Yesterday evening , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 973 len. 24]: `` Now , f ' r instance , you take a common lightning-bug -- '' `` Did she lose it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 974 len. 5]: `` Lose what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 975 len. 5]: `` Her earring . ''
Parsing [sent. 976 len. 9]: `` I d' know , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 977 len. 53]: `` You take the common lightning-bug or , as it 's called in some countries , the firefly -- '' He continued , quoting and misquoting the entomological authority of the recent `` Sunday Supplement '' ; but his friend on the other side of the fence was inattentive to the lecture .
Parsing [sent. 978 len. 53]: Noble 's mind was occupied with a wonder ; he had realized , though dimly , that here was he , trying to make starry Julia the subject of a conversation with a person who had the dear privilege of being closely related to her -- and preferred to talk about bugs .
Parsing [sent. 979 len. 35]: Herbert talked at considerable length about lightning-bugs , but as his voice happened rather precociously to be already in a state of adolescent change , the sound was not soothing ; yet Noble lingered .
Parsing [sent. 980 len. 36]: Nephews were queer , but this one was Julia 's , and he finally mentioned her again , as incidental to lightning-bugs ; whereupon the mere hearer of sounds became instantly a listener to words .
Parsing [sent. 981 len. 26]: `` Well , and then I says , '' Herbert continued ; -- `` I says : ` It 's phosphorus , Aunt Julia . '
Parsing [sent. 982 len. 31]: I guess there 's hardly anybody in the world does n't know more than Aunt Julia , except about dresses and parasols and every other useless thing under the sun .
Parsing [sent. 983 len. 6]: She says : ` My !
Parsing [sent. 984 len. 8]: I always thought it was sulphur ! '
Parsing [sent. 985 len. 12]: Said nobody ever _ told _ her it was n't sulphur !
Parsing [sent. 986 len. 24]: I asked her : I said : ` You mean to sit there and tell me you do n't know the difference ? '
Parsing [sent. 987 len. 19]: And she says : ' I do n't care one way or the other , ' she says .
Parsing [sent. 988 len. 50]: She said she just as soon a lightning-bug made his light with sulphur as with phosphorus ; it did n't make any difference to her , she says , and they could go ahead and make their light any way they wanted , _ she _ would n't interfere !
Parsing [sent. 989 len. 57]: I had a whole hatful of 'em , and she told me not to take 'em into their house , because grandpa hates insecks as much as he does animals and violets , and she said they never owned a microscope or a magnifying-glass in their lives , and would n't let me hunt for one .
Parsing [sent. 990 len. 26]: All in the world she knows is how to sit on the front porch and say : ` Oh you do n't mean _ that !
Parsing [sent. 991 len. 13]: _ ' to somebody like Newland Sanders or that ole widower ! ''
Parsing [sent. 992 len. 4]: `` When ? ''
Parsing [sent. 993 len. 4]: Noble asked impulsively .
Parsing [sent. 994 len. 8]: `` When did she say that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 995 len. 11]: `` Oh , I d' know , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 996 len. 20]: `` I expect she proba ` ly says it to somebody or other about every evening there is . ''
Parsing [sent. 997 len. 5]: `` She does ? ''
Parsing [sent. 998 len. 11]: `` Florence says so , '' Herbert informed him carelessly .
Parsing [sent. 999 len. 22]: `` Florence goes over to grandpa 's after dark and sits on the ground up against the porch and listens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1000 len. 8]: Noble first looked startled then uneasily reminiscent .
Parsing [sent. 1001 len. 17]: `` I do n't believe Florence ought to do that , '' he said gravely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1002 len. 9]: _ I _ would n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1003 len. 4]: Herbert was emphatic .
Parsing [sent. 1004 len. 7]: `` That 's right , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 1005 len. 8]: I 'm glad you would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 1006 len. 11]: `` No , sir , '' the manly boy declared .
Parsing [sent. 1007 len. 50]: `` You would n't never catch _ me _ takin ' my death o ' cold sittin ' on the damp grass in the night air just to listen to a lot o ' tooty-tooty about ` I 've named a star for you , ' and all such .
Parsing [sent. 1008 len. 14]: You would n't catch me -- '' Noble partly concealed a sudden anguish .
Parsing [sent. 1009 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1010 len. 3]: he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1011 len. 11]: `` Who did she say _ that _ to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1012 len. 5]: `` She did n't .
Parsing [sent. 1013 len. 10]: They say it to her , and she says ?
Parsing [sent. 1014 len. 10]: ` Oh , you do n't mean that ! '
Parsing [sent. 1015 len. 14]: and of course then they haf to go on and say some more .
Parsing [sent. 1016 len. 8]: Florence says -- '' He checked himself .
Parsing [sent. 1017 len. 6]: `` Oh , I forgot !
Parsing [sent. 1018 len. 13]: I promised Florence I would n't tell anything about all this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1019 len. 11]: `` It 's safe , '' Noble assured him quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1020 len. 17]: `` I 'm quite a friend of Florence 's and it 's absolutely safe with me .
Parsing [sent. 1021 len. 11]: I wo n't speak of it to anybody , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 1022 len. 14]: Who was it told her he 'd named a star for her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1023 len. 10]: `` It was the way some ole poem began .
Parsing [sent. 1024 len. 5]: Newland Sanders wrote it .
Parsing [sent. 1025 len. 43]: Florence found it under Aunt Julia 's sofa-cushions and read it all through , but _ I _ would n't wade through all that tooty-tooty for a million dollars , and I told her to put it back before Aunt Julia noticed .
Parsing [sent. 1026 len. 48]: Well , about every day he writes her a fresh one , and then in the evening he stays later than the rest , and reads 'em to her -- and you ought to hear grandpa when _ he _ gets to talkin ' about it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1027 len. 10]: `` He 's perfectly right , '' said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1028 len. 3]: `` Perfectly !
Parsing [sent. 1029 len. 13]: What does he say when he talks about it , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1030 len. 52]: `` Oh , he says all this and that ; and then he kind of mutters around , and you ca n't tell just what all the words are exactly , so ' t he can deny it if any o ' the family accuses him of swearing or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1031 len. 23]: And Herbert added casually : `` He was kind of goin ' on like that about you , night before last . ''
Parsing [sent. 1032 len. 6]: `` About _ me _ !
Parsing [sent. 1033 len. 12]: Why , what could he say about _ me _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1034 len. 9]: `` Oh , all this and that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1035 len. 10]: `` But what did he find to say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1036 len. 72]: `` Well , he heard her tellin ' you how you ought n't to smoke so many cigarettes and all about how it was killin ' you , and you sayin ' you guessed it would n't matter if you _ did _ die , and Aunt Julia sayin ' ` Oh , you do n't mean that , ' and all this and such and so on , you know .
Parsing [sent. 1037 len. 35]: He can hear anything on the porch pretty good from the lib ` ary ; and Florence told me about that , besides , because she was sittin ' in the grass and all .
Parsing [sent. 1038 len. 13]: She told Great-Uncle Joe and Aunt Hattie about it , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1039 len. 5]: `` My heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1040 len. 30]: Noble gasped , as for the first time he realized to what trumpeting publicity that seemingly hushed and moonlit bower , sacred to Julia , had been given over .
Parsing [sent. 1041 len. 11]: He gulped , flushed , repeated `` My heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1042 len. 33]: and then was able to add , with a feeble suggestion of lightness : `` I suppose your grandfather understood it was just a sort of joke , did n't he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1043 len. 35]: `` No , '' said Herbert , and continued in a friendly way , for he was flattered by Noble 's interest in his remarks , and began to feel a liking for him .
Parsing [sent. 1044 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1045 len. 27]: He said Aunt Julia only talked like that because she could n't think of anything else to say , and it was wearin ' him out .
Parsing [sent. 1046 len. 55]: He said all the good it did was to make you smoke more to make her think how reckless you were ; but the worst part of it was , he 'd be the only one to suffer , because it blows all through the house and he 's got to sit in it .
Parsing [sent. 1047 len. 57]: He said he just could stand the smell of _ some _ cigarettes , but if you burned any more o ' yours on his porch he was goin ' to ask your father to raise your salary for collectin ' real-estate rents , so ' t you 'd feel able to buy some real tobacco .
Parsing [sent. 1048 len. 46]: He -- '' But the flushed listener felt that he had heard as much as he was called upon to bear ; and he interrupted , in a voice almost out of control , to say that he must be `` getting on downtown . ''
Parsing [sent. 1049 len. 32]: His young friend , diverted from bugs , showed the greatest willingness to continue the narrative indefinitely , evidently being in possession of copious material ; but Noble turned to depart .
Parsing [sent. 1050 len. 5]: An afterthought detained him .
Parsing [sent. 1051 len. 10]: `` Where was it she lost her earring ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1052 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1053 len. 6]: `` Your Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 1054 len. 18]: `` Why , _ I _ did n't say she lost any earring , '' Herbert returned .
Parsing [sent. 1055 len. 20]: `` I said she always _ was _ losin ' 'em : I did n't say she did . ''
Parsing [sent. 1056 len. 33]: `` Then you did n't mean -- '' `` No , '' said Herbert , '' _ I _ have n't heard of her losin ' anything at all , lately . ''
Parsing [sent. 1057 len. 26]: Here he added : `` Well , grandpa kept goin ' on about you , and he told her -- Well , so long ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1058 len. 19]: And gazed after the departing Mr. Dill in some surprise at the abruptness of the latter 's leave-taking .
Parsing [sent. 1059 len. 27]: Then , wondering how the back of Noble 's neck could have got itself so fiery sunburnt , Herbert returned to his researches in the grass .
Parsing [sent. 1060 len. 36]: * * * * * The peaceful street , shady and fragrant with summer , was so quiet that the footfalls of the striding Noble were like an interruption of coughing in a silent church .
Parsing [sent. 1061 len. 29]: As he seethed adown the warm sidewalk the soles of his shoes smote the pavement , for mentally he was walking not upon cement but upon Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 1062 len. 42]: Unconsciously his pace presently became slower for a more concentrated brooding upon this slanderous old man who took advantage of his position to poison his daughter 's mind against the only one of her suitors who cared in the highest way .
Parsing [sent. 1063 len. 67]: And upon this there came an infinitesimal consolation in the midst of anguish , for he thought of what Herbert had told him about Mr. Newland Sanders 's poems to Julia , and he had a strong conviction that one time or another Mr. Atwater must have spoken even more disparagingly of these poems and their author than he had of Orduma cigarettes and their smoker .
Parsing [sent. 1064 len. 9]: Perhaps the old man was not altogether vile .
Parsing [sent. 1065 len. 5]: This charitable moment passed .
Parsing [sent. 1066 len. 69]: He recalled the little moonlit drama on the embowered veranda , when Julia , in her voice of plucked harp strings , told him that he smoked too much , and he had said it did n't matter ; nobody would care much if he died -- and Julia said gently that his mother would , and other people , too ; he must n't talk so recklessly .
Parsing [sent. 1067 len. 29]: Out of this the old eavesdropper had viciously represented him to be a poser , not really reckless at all ; had insulted his cigarettes and his salary .
Parsing [sent. 1068 len. 7]: Well , Noble would show him !
Parsing [sent. 1069 len. 31]: He had doubts about being able to show Mr. Atwater anything important connected with the cigarettes or the salary , but he _ could _ prove how reckless he was .
Parsing [sent. 1070 len. 80]: With that , a vision formed before him : he saw Julia and her father standing spellbound at a crossing while a smiling youth stood directly between the rails in the middle of the street and let a charging trolley-car destroy him -- not instantly , for he would live long enough to whisper , as the stricken pair bent over him : `` Now , Julia , which do you believe : your father , or me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1071 len. 26]: And then with a slight , dying sneer : `` Well , Mr. Atwater , is _ this _ reckless enough to suit you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1072 len. 53]: * * * * * Town squirrels flitted along their high paths in the shade-tree branches above the embittered young lover , and he noticed them not at all , which was but little less than he noticed the elderly human couple who observed him from a side-yard as he passed by .
Parsing [sent. 1073 len. 15]: Mr. and Mrs. Burgess had been happily married for fifty-three years and four months .
Parsing [sent. 1074 len. 45]: Mr. Burgess lay in a hammock between two maple trees , and was soothingly swung by means of a string connecting the hammock and the rocking-chair in which sat Mrs Burgess , acting as a mild motor for both the chair and the hammock .
Parsing [sent. 1075 len. 23]: `` That 's Noble Dill walking along the sidewalk , '' Mrs. Burgess said , interpreting for her husband 's failing eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1076 len. 20]: `` I bowed to him , but he hardly seemed to see us and just barely lifted his hat .
Parsing [sent. 1077 len. 23]: He need n't be cross with _ us _ because some other young man 's probably taking Julia Atwater out driving ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1078 len. 7]: `` Yes , he need ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1079 len. 4]: Mr. Burgess declared .
Parsing [sent. 1080 len. 13]: `` A boy in his condition needs to be cross with everything .
Parsing [sent. 1081 len. 11]: Sometimes they get so cross they go and drink liquor .
Parsing [sent. 1082 len. 6]: Do n't you remember ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1083 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1084 len. 6]: `` I remember once ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1085 len. 7]: she assented , and laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 1086 len. 17]: `` Why , it 's a terrible time of life , '' her husband went on .
Parsing [sent. 1087 len. 30]: `` Poets and suchlike always take on about young love as if it were a charming and romantic experience , but really it 's just a series of mortifications .
Parsing [sent. 1088 len. 43]: The young lover is always wanting to do something dashing and romantic and Sir Walter Raleigh-like , but in ordinary times about the wildest thing he can do , if he can afford it , is to learn to run a Ford .
Parsing [sent. 1089 len. 46]: And he ca n't stand a word of criticism ; he ca n't stand being made the least little bit of fun of ; and yet all the while his state of mind lays him particularly open to all the things he ca n't stand .
Parsing [sent. 1090 len. 13]: He ca n't stand anything , and he has to stand everything .
Parsing [sent. 1091 len. 15]: Why , it 's a _ horrible _ time of life , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1092 len. 11]: `` Yes , it is , '' she assented placidly .
Parsing [sent. 1093 len. 37]: `` I 'm glad we do n't have to go through it again , Freddie ; though you 're only eighty-two , and with a girl like Julia Atwater around nobody ought to be sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 1094 len. 50]: CHAPTER FIVE Although Noble had saluted the old couple so crossly , thus unconsciously making them , as he made the sidewalk , proxy for Mr. Atwater , so to speak , yet the sight of them penetrated his outer layers of preoccupation and had an effect upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1095 len. 22]: In the midst of his suffering his imagination paused for a shudder : What miserable old gray shadows those two were !
Parsing [sent. 1096 len. 11]: Thank Heaven he and Julia could never be like that !
Parsing [sent. 1097 len. 58]: And in the haze that rose before his mind 's eye he saw himself leading Julia through years of adventure in far parts of the world : there were glimpses of himself fighting grotesque figures on the edge of Himalayan precipices at dawn , while Julia knelt by the tent on the glacier and prayed for him .
Parsing [sent. 1098 len. 71]: He saw head-waiters bowing him and Julia to tables in `` strange , foreign cafés , '' and when they were seated , and he had ordered dishes that amazed her , he would say in a low voice : `` Do n't look now , but do you see that heavy-shouldered man with the insignia , sitting with that adventuress and those eight officers who are really his guards ?
Parsing [sent. 1099 len. 18]: Do n't be alarmed , Julia , but I am here to _ get _ that man !
Parsing [sent. 1100 len. 11]: Perhaps you remember what your father once said of me ?
Parsing [sent. 1101 len. 30]: Now , when what I have to do here is done , perhaps you may wish to write home and mention a few things to that old man ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1102 len. 52]: And then a boy 's changing voice seemed to sound again close by : `` He said he just could stand the smell of _ some _ cigarettes , but if you burned any more o ' yours on his porch -- '' And Noble came back miserably to town again .
Parsing [sent. 1103 len. 18]: From an upper window of a new stucco house two maidens of nineteen peered down at him .
Parsing [sent. 1104 len. 78]: The shade of a striped awning protected the window from the strong sun and the maidens from the sight of man -- the latter protection being especially fortunate , since they were preparing to take a conversational afternoon nap , were robed with little substance , and their heads appeared to be antlered ; for they caught sight of Noble just as they were preparing to put silk-and-lace things they called `` caps '' on their heads .
Parsing [sent. 1105 len. 6]: `` Who 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1106 len. 5]: the visiting one asked .
Parsing [sent. 1107 len. 16]: `` It 's Noble Dill ; he 's kind of one of the crowd . ''
Parsing [sent. 1108 len. 6]: `` Is he nice ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1109 len. 6]: `` Oh , sort of .
Parsing [sent. 1110 len. 6]: Kind of shambles around . ''
Parsing [sent. 1111 len. 17]: `` Looks like last year 's straw hat to me , '' the visiting one giggled .
Parsing [sent. 1112 len. 21]: `` Oh , he tries to dress -- lately , that is -- but he never did know how . ''
Parsing [sent. 1113 len. 7]: `` Looks mad about something . ''
Parsing [sent. 1114 len. 3]: `` Yes .
Parsing [sent. 1115 len. 18]: He 's one of the ones in love with that Julia Atwater I told you about . ''
Parsing [sent. 1116 len. 10]: `` Has he got any chance with her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1117 len. 4]: `` Noble Dill ?
Parsing [sent. 1118 len. 3]: Mercy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1119 len. 11]: `` Is he much in love with her ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1120 len. 4]: ` Much ' ?
Parsing [sent. 1121 len. 3]: _ Murder !
Parsing [sent. 1122 len. 12]: _ '' The visiting one turned from the window and yawned .
Parsing [sent. 1123 len. 18]: `` Come on : let 's lie down and talk about some of the nice ones ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1124 len. 14]: The second house beyond this was -- it was the house of Julia !
Parsing [sent. 1125 len. 18]: And what a glamour of summer light lay upon it because it was the house of Julia !
Parsing [sent. 1126 len. 31]: The texture of the sunshine came under a spell here ; glowing flakes of amber were afloat ; a powder of opals and rubies fell silently adrizzle through the trees .
Parsing [sent. 1127 len. 26]: The very air changed , beating faintly with a fairy music , for breathing it was breathing sorcery : elfin symphonies went tinkling through it .
Parsing [sent. 1128 len. 26]: The grass in the next yard to Julia 's was just grass , but every blade of grass in her yard was cut of jewels .
Parsing [sent. 1129 len. 53]: Julia 's house was also the house of that person who through some ungovernable horseplay of destiny happened to be her father : and this gave the enchanted spot a background of lurking cyclone -- no one could tell at what instant there might rise above the roseate pleasance a funnel-shaped cloud .
Parsing [sent. 1130 len. 42]: With young Herbert 's injurious narrative fresh in his mind , Noble quickened his steps ; but as he reached the farther fence post , marking the southward limit of Mr. Atwater 's property , he halted short , startled beautifully .
Parsing [sent. 1131 len. 31]: Through the open front door , just passed , a voice had called his name ; a voice of such arresting sweetness that his breath stopped , like his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1132 len. 6]: `` Oh , Noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1133 len. 4]: it called again .
Parsing [sent. 1134 len. 40]: He turned back , and any one who might have seen his face then would have known what was the matter with him , and must have been only the more sure of it because his mouth was open .
Parsing [sent. 1135 len. 21]: The next instant the adequate reason for his disorder came lightly through the open door and down to the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1136 len. 8]: Julia was kind , much too kind !
Parsing [sent. 1137 len. 85]: She had heard that her Aunt Harriet and her Uncle Joe were frequently describing Mr. Atwater 's most recent explosion to other members of the extensive Atwater family league ; and though she had not discovered how Aunt Harriet and Uncle Joe had obtained their material , yet , in Julia 's way of wording her thoughts , an account of the episode was `` all over town , '' and she was almost certain that by this time Noble Dill had heard it .
Parsing [sent. 1138 len. 20]: And so , lest he should suffer , the too-gentle creature seized the first opportunity to cheer him up .
Parsing [sent. 1139 len. 27]: That was the most harmful thing about Julia ; when anybody liked her -- even Noble Dill -- she could n't bear to have him worried .
Parsing [sent. 1140 len. 27]: She was the sympathetic princess who would n't have her puppy 's tail chopped off all at once , but only a little at a time .
Parsing [sent. 1141 len. 46]: `` I just happened to see you going by , '' she said , and then , with an astounding perfection of seriousness , she added the question : `` Did you _ mind _ my calling to you and stopping you , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1142 len. 34]: He leaned , drooping , upon the gatepost , seeming to yearn toward it ; his expression was such that this gatepost need not have been surprised if Noble had knelt to it .
Parsing [sent. 1143 len. 10]: `` Why , no , '' he said hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1144 len. 17]: `` No , I do n't have to be back at the office any particular time .
Parsing [sent. 1145 len. 3]: No . ''
Parsing [sent. 1146 len. 12]: `` I just wanted to ask you -- '' She hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1147 len. 30]: `` Well , it really does n't amount to anything -- it 's nothing so important I could n't have spoken to you about it some other time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1148 len. 29]: `` Well , '' said Noble , and then on the spur of the moment he continued darkly : `` There might not be any other time . ''
Parsing [sent. 1149 len. 9]: `` How do you mean , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1150 len. 4]: He smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 1151 len. 9]: `` I 'm thinking of going away . ''
Parsing [sent. 1152 len. 17]: This was true ; nevertheless , it was the first time he had thought of it .
Parsing [sent. 1153 len. 11]: `` Going away , '' he repeated in a murmur .
Parsing [sent. 1154 len. 7]: `` From this old town . ''
Parsing [sent. 1155 len. 11]: A shadowy , sweet reproach came upon Julia 's eyes .
Parsing [sent. 1156 len. 10]: `` You mean -- for good , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1157 len. 24]: she asked in a low voice , although no one knew better than she what trouble such performances often cost her , later .
Parsing [sent. 1158 len. 23]: `` Noble , you do n't mean -- '' He made a vocal sound conveying recklessness , something resembling a reckless laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1159 len. 8]: `` I might go -- any day !
Parsing [sent. 1160 len. 9]: Just as it happens to strike me . ''
Parsing [sent. 1161 len. 8]: `` But where to , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1162 len. 12]: `` I do n't -- Well , maybe to China . ''
Parsing [sent. 1163 len. 4]: `` China ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1164 len. 5]: she cried in amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1165 len. 7]: `` Why , Noble Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1166 len. 13]: `` There 's lots of openings in China , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1167 len. 16]: `` A white man can get a commission in the Chinese army any day . ''
Parsing [sent. 1168 len. 27]: `` And so , '' she said , `` you mean you 'd rather be an officer in the Chinese army than stay -- here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1169 len. 24]: With that , she bit her lip and averted her face for an instant , then turned to him again , quite calm .
Parsing [sent. 1170 len. 20]: Julia could not help doing these things ; she was born that way , and no punishment changed her .
Parsing [sent. 1171 len. 27]: `` Julia -- '' the dazzled Noble began , but he stopped with this beginning , his voice seeming to have exhausted itself upon the name .
Parsing [sent. 1172 len. 10]: `` When do you think you 'll start ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1173 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 1174 len. 4]: His voice returned .
Parsing [sent. 1175 len. 40]: `` I do n't know _ just _ when , '' he said ; and he began to feel a little too much committed to this sudden plan of departure , and to wonder how it had come about .
Parsing [sent. 1176 len. 13]: `` I -- I have n't set any day -- exactly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1177 len. 14]: `` Have you talked it over with your mother yet , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1178 len. 24]: `` Not yet -- exactly , '' he said , and was conscious of a distaste for China as something unpleasant and imminent .
Parsing [sent. 1179 len. 19]: `` I thought I 'd wait till -- till it was certain I _ would _ go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1180 len. 9]: `` When will that be , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1181 len. 33]: And in spite of herself , Julia spoke in the tone of one who controls herself to ask in calmness : `` Is my name on the list for the guillotine ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1182 len. 23]: `` Well , '' he said , `` it 'll be as soon as I 've made up my mind to go .
Parsing [sent. 1183 len. 19]: I probably wo n't go before then ; not till I 've made up my mind to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1184 len. 14]: `` But you might do that any day , might n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1185 len. 16]: Noble began to feel relieved ; he seemed to have hit upon a way out .
Parsing [sent. 1186 len. 15]: `` Yes ; and then I 'd be gone , '' he said firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1187 len. 15]: `` But probably I would n't go at all unless I decided to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1188 len. 32]: This seemed to save him from China , and he added recklessly : `` I guess I would n't be missed much around this old town if I did go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1189 len. 11]: `` Yes , you would , '' Julia said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1190 len. 13]: `` Your family 'd miss you -- and so would everybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 1191 len. 14]: `` Julia , _ you _ would n't -- '' She laughed lightly .
Parsing [sent. 1192 len. 12]: `` Of course I should , and so would papa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1193 len. 10]: Noble released the gatepost and appeared to slant backward .
Parsing [sent. 1194 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1195 len. 22]: `` Papa was talking about you this very morning at breakfast , '' she said ; and she spoke the truth .
Parsing [sent. 1196 len. 13]: `` He said he _ dreamed _ about you last night . ''
Parsing [sent. 1197 len. 5]: `` He did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1198 len. 4]: Julia nodded sunnily .
Parsing [sent. 1199 len. 14]: `` He dreamed that you and he were the very greatest friends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1200 len. 30]: This also was true , so far as it went ; she only omitted to state that Mr. Atwater had gone on to classify his dream as a nightmare .
Parsing [sent. 1201 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1202 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1203 len. 29]: `` Why , of course he 'd miss you -- he 'd miss you as much as he 'd miss any friend of mine that comes here . ''
Parsing [sent. 1204 len. 25]: Noble felt a sudden rush of tenderness toward Mr. Atwater ; it is always possible to misjudge a man for a few hasty words .
Parsing [sent. 1205 len. 18]: And Julia went on quickly : `` I never saw anybody like you , Noble Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1206 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1207 len. 40]: `` I do n't suppose there 's anybody in the United States except you that would be capable of doing things like going off to be an officer in the Chinese army -- all just any minute like this .
Parsing [sent. 1208 len. 15]: I 've always declared you were about the most reckless man I know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1209 len. 5]: Noble shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 1210 len. 8]: `` No , '' he said judicially .
Parsing [sent. 1211 len. 18]: `` I 'm not reckless ; it 's just that I do n't care what happens . ''
Parsing [sent. 1212 len. 4]: Julia became grave .
Parsing [sent. 1213 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1214 len. 9]: `` To me , '' he said hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 1215 len. 12]: `` I mean I do n't care what happens to myself .
Parsing [sent. 1216 len. 14]: I mean that 's more the way I am than just reckless . ''
Parsing [sent. 1217 len. 28]: She was content to let his analysis stand , though she shook her head , as if knowing herself to be wiser than he about his recklessness .
Parsing [sent. 1218 len. 32]: A cheerfulness came upon them ; and the Chinese question seemed to have been settled by these indirect processes ; -- in fact , neither of them ever mentioned it again .
Parsing [sent. 1219 len. 29]: `` I must n't keep you , '' she said , `` especially when you ought to be getting on downtown to business , but -- Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1220 len. 11]: She gave the little cry of a forgetful person reminded .
Parsing [sent. 1221 len. 13]: `` I almost forgot what I ran out to ask you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1222 len. 8]: `` What was it , Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1223 len. 9]: Noble spoke huskily , in a low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1224 len. 13]: `` What is it you want me to do , Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1225 len. 13]: She gave a little fluttering laugh , half timid , half confiding .
Parsing [sent. 1226 len. 12]: `` You know how funny papa is about tobacco smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1227 len. 12]: -LRB- But she hurried on without waiting for an answer . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 1228 len. 6]: `` Well , he is .
Parsing [sent. 1229 len. 24]: He 's the funniest old thing ; he does n't like _ any _ kind very much except his own special cheroot things .
Parsing [sent. 1230 len. 30]: He growls about every other kind , but the cigars Mr. _ Ridgely _ smokes when he comes here , papa really _ does _ make a fuss over !
Parsing [sent. 1231 len. 60]: And , you see , I do n't like to say ` No ' when Mr. Ridgely asks if he can smoke , because it always makes men so uncomfortable if they ca n't when they 're sitting on a veranda , so I wondered if I could just tactfully get him to buy something different from his cigars ?
Parsing [sent. 1232 len. 19]: -- and I thought the best thing would be to suggest those cigarettes you always have , Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1233 len. 44]: They 're the ones papa makes the _ least _ fuss about and seems to stand the best -- next to his own , he seems to like them the most , I mean -- but I 'd forgotten the name of them .
Parsing [sent. 1234 len. 11]: That 's what I ran out to ask you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1235 len. 7]: `` Orduma , '' said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1236 len. 6]: `` Orduma Egyptian Cigarettes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1237 len. 15]: `` Would you mind giving me one -- just to show Mr. Ridgely ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1238 len. 7]: Noble gave her an Orduma cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1239 len. 7]: `` Oh , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1240 len. 4]: she said gratefully .
Parsing [sent. 1241 len. 28]: `` I must n't keep you another minute , because I know your father would n't know _ what _ to do at the office without you !
Parsing [sent. 1242 len. 8]: Thank you so much for this ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1243 len. 19]: She turned and walked quickly halfway up the path , then paused , looking back over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1244 len. 15]: `` I 'll only show it to him , Noble , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1245 len. 10]: `` I wo n't give it to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1246 len. 58]: She bit her lip as if she had said more than she should have ; shook her head as in self-chiding ; then laughed , and in a flash touched the tiny white cylinder to her lips , waved it to him ; -- then ran to the veranda and up the steps and into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1247 len. 14]: She felt satisfied that she had set matters right , this kind Julia !
Parsing [sent. 1248 len. 32]: CHAPTER SIX Before she thus set matters right with Noble he had been unhappy and his condition had been bad ; now he was happy , but his condition was worse .
Parsing [sent. 1249 len. 18]: In truth , he was much , much too happy ; nothing rational remained in his mind .
Parsing [sent. 1250 len. 24]: No elfin orchestra seemed to buzz in his ears as he went down the street , but a loud , triumphing brass band .
Parsing [sent. 1251 len. 40]: His unathletic chest was inflated ; he heaved up with joy ; and a little child , playing on the next corner , turned and followed him for some distance , trying to imitate his proud , singular walk .
Parsing [sent. 1252 len. 39]: Restored to too much pride , Noble became also much too humane ; he thought of Mr. Atwater 's dream , and felt almost a motherly need to cherish and protect him , to be indeed his friend .
Parsing [sent. 1253 len. 22]: There was a warm spot in Noble 's chest , produced in part by a yearning toward that splendid old man .
Parsing [sent. 1254 len. 51]: Noble had a good home , sixty-six dollars in the bank and a dollar and forty cents in his pockets ; he would have given all for a chance to show Mr. Atwater how well he understood him now , at last , and how deeply he appreciated his favour .
Parsing [sent. 1255 len. 23]: Students of alcoholic intoxication have observed that in their cups commonplace people , and not geniuses , do the most unusual things .
Parsing [sent. 1256 len. 6]: So with all other intoxications .
Parsing [sent. 1257 len. 24]: Noble Dill was indeed no genius , and some friend should have kept an eye upon him to-day ; he was not himself .
Parsing [sent. 1258 len. 22]: All afternoon in a mood of tropic sunrise he collected rents , or with glad vagueness consented instantly to their postponement .
Parsing [sent. 1259 len. 46]: `` I 've come about the rent again , '' he said beamingly to one delinquent tenant of his father 's best client ; and turned and walked away , humming a waltz-song , while the man was still coughing as a preliminary to argument .
Parsing [sent. 1260 len. 107]: Late in the afternoon , as the entranced collector sat musing alone near a window in his father 's office , his exalted mood was not affected by the falling of a preternatural darkness over the town , nor was he roused to action by any perception of the fact that the other clerks and the members of the firm had gone home an hour ago ; that the clock showed him his own duty to lock up the office and not keep his mother `` waiting dinner '' ; and that he would be caught in a most outrageous thunderstorm if he did n't hurry .
Parsing [sent. 1261 len. 30]: No ; he sat , smiling fondly , by the open window , and at times made a fragmentary gesture as of some heroic or benevolent impulse in rehearsal .
Parsing [sent. 1262 len. 18]: Meanwhile , paunchy with wind and wetness , unmannerly clouds came smoking out of the blackened west .
Parsing [sent. 1263 len. 6]: Rumbling , they drew on .
Parsing [sent. 1264 len. 42]: Then from cloud to cloud dizzy amazements of white fire staggered , crackled and boomed on to the assault ; the doors of the winds were opened ; the tanks of deluge were unbottomed ; and the storm took the town .
Parsing [sent. 1265 len. 16]: So , presently , Noble noticed that it was raining and decided to go home .
Parsing [sent. 1266 len. 56]: With an idea that he was fulfilling his customary duties , he locked the doors of the two inner rooms , dropped the keys gently into a wastebasket , and passing by an umbrella which stood in a corner , went out to the corridor , and thence stepped into the street of whooping rain .
Parsing [sent. 1267 len. 40]: Here he became so practical as to turn up his collar ; and , substantially aided by the wind at his back , he was not long in leaving the purlieus of commerce behind him for Julia 's Street .
Parsing [sent. 1268 len. 80]: Other people lived on this street -- he did , himself , for that matter ; and , in fact , it was the longest street in the town ; moreover , it had an official name with which the word `` Julia '' was entirely unconnected ; but for Noble Dill -LRB- and probably for Newland Sanders and for some others in age from nineteen to sixty -RRB- it was `` Julia 's Street '' and no other .
Parsing [sent. 1269 len. 12]: It was a tumultuous street as Noble splashed along the sidewalk .
Parsing [sent. 1270 len. 38]: Incredibly elastic , the shade-trees were practising calisthenics , though now and then one outdid itself and lost a branch ; thunder and lightning romped like loosed scandal ; rain hissed upon the pavement and capered ankle-high .
Parsing [sent. 1271 len. 43]: It was a storm that asked to be left to itself for a time , after giving fair warning that the request would be made ; and Noble and the only other pedestrian in sight had themselves to blame for getting caught .
Parsing [sent. 1272 len. 25]: This other pedestrian was some forty or fifty yards in advance of Noble and moved in the same direction at about the same gait .
Parsing [sent. 1273 len. 39]: He wore an old overcoat , running with water ; the brim of his straw hat sagged about his head , so that he appeared to be wearing a bucket ; he was a sodden and pathetic figure .
Parsing [sent. 1274 len. 36]: Noble himself was as sodden ; his hands were wet in his very pockets ; his elbows seemed to spout ; yet he spared a generous pity for the desolate figure struggling on before him .
Parsing [sent. 1275 len. 14]: All at once Noble 's heart did something queer within his wet bosom .
Parsing [sent. 1276 len. 11]: He recognized that figure , and he was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1277 len. 36]: Except the One figure , and those of his own father and mother and three sisters , this was the shape that Noble would most infallibly recognize anywhere in the world and under any conditions .
Parsing [sent. 1278 len. 24]: In spite of the dusk and the riot of the storm , Noble knew that none other than Mr. Atwater splashed before him .
Parsing [sent. 1279 len. 27]: He dismissed a project for seizing upon a fallen branch and running forward to walk beside Mr. Atwater and hold the branch over his venerated head .
Parsing [sent. 1280 len. 25]: All the branches were too wet ; and Noble feared that Mr. Atwater might think the picture odd and decline to be thus protected .
Parsing [sent. 1281 len. 44]: Yet he felt that something ought to be done to shelter Julia 's father and perhaps save him from pneumonia ; surely there was some simple , helpful , dashing thing that ordinary people could n't think of , but that Noble could .
Parsing [sent. 1282 len. 11]: He would do it and not stay to be thanked .
Parsing [sent. 1283 len. 35]: And then , to-morrow evening , not sooner , he would go to Julia and smile and say ; `` Your father did n't get too wet , I hope , after all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1284 len. 26]: And Julia : `` Oh , Noble , he 's talked of you all day long as his ` new Sir Walter Raleigh ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1285 len. 29]: Suddenly will-o ' - the-wisp opportunity flickered before him , and in his high mood he paused not at all to consider it , but insanely chased it .
Parsing [sent. 1286 len. 29]: He had just reached a crossing , and down the cross street , walking away from Noble , was the dim figure of a man carrying an umbrella .
Parsing [sent. 1287 len. 23]: It was just perceptible that he was a fat man , struggling with seeming feebleness in the wind and making poor progress .
Parsing [sent. 1288 len. 23]: Mr. Atwater , moving up Julia 's Street , was out of sight from the cross street where struggled the fat man .
Parsing [sent. 1289 len. 52]: Noble ran swiftly down the cross street , jerked the umbrella from the fat man 's grasp ; ran back , with hoarse sounds dying out behind him in the riotous dusk ; turned the corner , sped after Mr. Atwater , overtook him , and thrust the umbrella upon him .
Parsing [sent. 1290 len. 33]: Then , not pausing the shortest instant for thanks or even recognition , the impulsive boy sped onward , proud and joyous in the storm , leaving his beneficiary far behind him .
Parsing [sent. 1291 len. 13]: In his young enthusiasm he had indeed done something for Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 1292 len. 41]: In fact , Noble 's kindness had done as much for Mr. Atwater as Julia 's gentleness had done for Noble , but how much both Julia and Noble had done was not revealed in full until the next evening .
Parsing [sent. 1293 len. 38]: That was a warm and moonshiny night of air unusually dry , and yet Florence sneezed frequently as she sat upon the `` side porch '' at the house of her Great-Aunt Carrie and her Great-Uncle Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 1294 len. 72]: Florence had a cold in the head , though how it got to her head was a process involved in the mysterious ways of colds , since Florence 's was easily to be connected with Herbert 's remark that he would n't ever be caught takin ' his death o ' cold sittin ' on the damp grass in the night air just to listen to a lot o ' tooty-tooty .
Parsing [sent. 1295 len. 38]: It appeared from Florence 's narrative to those interested listeners , Aunt Carrie and Uncle Joseph , that she had been sitting on the grass in the night air when both air and grass were extraordinarily damp .
Parsing [sent. 1296 len. 33]: In brief , she had been at her post soon after the storm cleared on the preceding evening , but she had heard no tooty-tooty ; her overhearings were of sterner stuff .
Parsing [sent. 1297 len. 12]: `` Well , what did Julia say _ then _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1298 len. 5]: Aunt Carrie asked eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 1299 len. 31]: `` She said she 'd go up and lock herself in her room and stuff cushions over her ears if grandpa did n't quit makin ' such a fuss . ''
Parsing [sent. 1300 len. 8]: `` And what did he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1301 len. 12]: `` He made more rumpus than ever , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 1302 len. 46]: `` He went on and on , and told the whole thing over and over again ; he seemed like he could n't tell it enough , and every time he told it his voice got higher and higher till it was kind of squealy .
Parsing [sent. 1303 len. 30]: He said he 'd had his raincoat on and he did n't want an umberella anyhow , and had n't ever carried one a single time in fourteen years !
Parsing [sent. 1304 len. 24]: And he took on about Noble Dill and all this and that about how you _ bet _ he knew who it was !
Parsing [sent. 1305 len. 44]: He said he could tell Noble Dill in the dark any time by his cigarette smell , and , anyway , it was n't too dark so 's he could n't see his skimpy little shoulders , and anyway he saw his face .
Parsing [sent. 1306 len. 155]: And he said Noble did n't _ hand _ him the umberella ; he stuck it all down over him like he was somep 'n on fire he wanted to put out ; and before he could get out of it and throw it away this ole fat man that it belonged to and was chasin ' Noble , he ran up to grandpa from behind and took hold of him , or somep ` n , and they slipped , and got to fussin ' against each other ; and then after a while they got up and grandpa saw it was somebody he knew and told him for Heaven 's sake why did n't he take his ole umberella and go on home ; and so he did , because it was raining , and I guess he proba ` ly had to give up ; he could n't out-talk grandpa . ''
Parsing [sent. 1307 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Uncle Joe .
Parsing [sent. 1308 len. 9]: `` He could n't , whoever he was .
Parsing [sent. 1309 len. 8]: But what happened about Noble Dill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1310 len. 24]: Florence paused to accumulate and explode a sneeze , then responded pleasantly : `` He said he was goin ' to kill him .
Parsing [sent. 1311 len. 16]: He said he often and often wanted to , and now he _ was _ .
Parsing [sent. 1312 len. 15]: That 's the reason I guess Aunt Julia wrote that note this morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 1313 len. 5]: `` What note ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1314 len. 4]: Aunt Carrie inquired .
Parsing [sent. 1315 len. 10]: `` You have n't told us of that . ''
Parsing [sent. 1316 len. 49]: `` I was over there before noon , '' said Florence , `` and Aunt Julia gave me a quarter and said she 'd write a note for me to take to Noble Dill 's house when he came home for lunch , and give it to him .
Parsing [sent. 1317 len. 28]: She kind of slipped it to me , because grandpa came in there , pokin ' around , while she was just finishin ' writin ' it .
Parsing [sent. 1318 len. 41]: She did n't put any envelope on it even , and she never said a single thing to _ me _ about its bein ' private or my not readin ' it if I wanted to , or anything . ''
Parsing [sent. 1319 len. 12]: `` Of course you did n't , '' said Aunt Carrie .
Parsing [sent. 1320 len. 11]: `` You did n't , did you , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1321 len. 18]: `` Why , she did n't _ say _ not to , '' Florence protested , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1322 len. 10]: `` It was n't even in an envelope . ''
Parsing [sent. 1323 len. 5]: Mr. Joseph Atwater coughed .
Parsing [sent. 1324 len. 27]: `` I hardly think we ought to ask what the note said , even if Florence was -- well , indiscreet enough to read it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1325 len. 8]: `` No , '' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 1326 len. 7]: `` I hardly think so either .
Parsing [sent. 1327 len. 11]: It did n't say anything important anyhow , probably . ''
Parsing [sent. 1328 len. 14]: `` It began , ` Dear Noble , ' '' said Florence promptly .
Parsing [sent. 1329 len. 12]: `` Dear Noble ' ; that 's the way it began .
Parsing [sent. 1330 len. 85]: It said how grandpa was just all upset to think he 'd accepted an umberella from him when Noble did n't have another one for himself like that , and grandpa was so embarrassed to think he 'd let Noble do so much for him , and everything , he just did n't know _ what _ to do , and proba ` ly it would be tactful if he would n't come to the house till grandpa got over being embarrassed and everything .
Parsing [sent. 1331 len. 12]: She said not to come till she let him know . ''
Parsing [sent. 1332 len. 11]: `` Did you notice Noble when he read it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1333 len. 4]: asked Aunt Carrie .
Parsing [sent. 1334 len. 3]: `` Yessir !
Parsing [sent. 1335 len. 15]: And would you believe it ; he just looked _ too _ happy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1336 len. 11]: Florence made answer , not wholly comprehending with what truth .
Parsing [sent. 1337 len. 47]: `` I 'll bet , '' said Uncle Joseph ; -- `` I 'll bet a thousand dollars that if Julia told Noble Dill he was six feet tall , Noble would go and order his next suit of clothes to fit a six-foot man . ''
Parsing [sent. 1338 len. 19]: And his wife complemented this with a generalization , simple , yet of a significance too little recognized .
Parsing [sent. 1339 len. 9]: `` They do n't see a thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1340 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1341 len. 24]: `` The young men that buzz around a girl 's house do n't see a _ thing _ of what goes on there !
Parsing [sent. 1342 len. 6]: Inside , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1343 len. 24]: Yet at that very moment a young man was seeing something inside a girl 's house a little way down that same street .
Parsing [sent. 1344 len. 14]: That same street was Julia 's Street and the house was Julia 's .
Parsing [sent. 1345 len. 31]: Inside the house , in the library , sat Mr. Atwater , trying to read a work by Thomas Carlyle , while a rhythmic murmur came annoyingly from the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1346 len. 43]: The young man , watching him attentively , saw him lift his head and sniff the air with suspicion , but the watcher took this pantomime to be an expression of distaste for certain versifyings , and sharing that distaste , approved .
Parsing [sent. 1347 len. 16]: Mr. Atwater sniffed again , threw down his book and strode out to the veranda .
Parsing [sent. 1348 len. 24]: There sat dark-haired Julia in a silver dress , and near by , Newland Sanders read a long young poem from the manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 1349 len. 8]: `` Who is smoking out here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1350 len. 8]: Mr. Atwater inquired in a dead voice .
Parsing [sent. 1351 len. 12]: `` Nobody , sir , '' said Newland with eagerness . ''
Parsing [sent. 1352 len. 7]: _ I _ do n't smoke .
Parsing [sent. 1353 len. 13]: I have never touched tobacco in any form in my life . ''
Parsing [sent. 1354 len. 15]: Mr. Atwater sniffed once more , found purity ; and returned to the library .
Parsing [sent. 1355 len. 11]: But here the air seemed faintly impregnated with Orduma cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 1356 len. 4]: `` Curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1357 len. 22]: he said as he composed himself once more to read -- and presently the odour seemed to wear away and vanish .
Parsing [sent. 1358 len. 20]: Mr. Atwater was relieved ; the last thing he could have wished was to be haunted by Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 1359 len. 7]: Yet for that while he was .
Parsing [sent. 1360 len. 42]: Too honourable to follow such an example as Florence 's , Noble , of course , would not spy or eavesdrop near the veranda where Julia sat , but he thought there could be no harm in watching Mr. Atwater read .
Parsing [sent. 1361 len. 15]: Looking at Mr. Atwater was at least the next thing to looking at Julia .
Parsing [sent. 1362 len. 28]: And so , out in the night , Noble was seated upon the top of the side fence , looking through the library window at Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 1363 len. 15]: After a while Noble lit another Orduma cigarette and puffed strongly to start it .
Parsing [sent. 1364 len. 39]: The smoke was almost invisible in the moonlight , but the night breeze , stirring gently , wafted it toward the house , where the open window made an inward draft and carried it heartily about the library .
Parsing [sent. 1365 len. 13]: Noble was surprised to see Mr. Atwater rise suddenly to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 1366 len. 18]: He smote his brow , put out the light , and stamped upstairs to his own room .
Parsing [sent. 1367 len. 18]: His purpose to retire was understood when the watcher saw a light in the bedroom window overhead .
Parsing [sent. 1368 len. 61]: Noble thought of the good , peculiar old man now disrobing there , and he smiled to himself at a whimsical thought : What form would Mr. Atwater 's embarrassment take , what would be his feeling , and what would he do , if he knew that Noble was there now , beneath his window and thinking of him ?
Parsing [sent. 1369 len. 29]: In the moonlight Noble sat upon the fence , and smoked Orduma cigarettes , and looked up with affection at the bright window of Mr. Atwater 's bedchamber .
Parsing [sent. 1370 len. 9]: Abruptly the light in that window went out .
Parsing [sent. 1371 len. 10]: `` Saying his prayers now , '' said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1372 len. 23]: `` I wonder if -- '' But , not to be vain , he laughed at himself and left the thought unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 1373 len. 51]: CHAPTER SEVEN A week later , on a hot July afternoon , Miss Florence Atwater , recovered from her cold , stood in the shady back yard of her place of residence and yawned more extensively than any one would have believed possible , judging by her face in repose .
Parsing [sent. 1374 len. 92]: Three of her friends , congenial in age and sex , were out of town for the summer ; two had been ascertained , by telephonic inquiries , to be taking commanded siestas ; and neither the other one nor Florence had yet forgotten that yesterday , although they were too religious to commit themselves to a refusal to meet as sisters in the Great Beyond , they had taken the expurgated oath that by Everything they would never speak to each other again so long as they both should live .
Parsing [sent. 1375 len. 9]: Florence was at the end of her resources .
Parsing [sent. 1376 len. 82]: She had sought distraction in experimental cookery ; but , having scorched a finger , and having been told by the cook that a person 's own kitchen was n't worth the price at eleven dollars a week if it had to git all smelled up with broiled rubber when the femometer stood at ninety-sevvum degrees in the shade , the experimenter abusedly turned her back on the morose woman and went out to the back yard for a little peace .
Parsing [sent. 1377 len. 34]: After an interval of torpor , she decided to go and see what Herbert was doing -- a move not short of desperation , on account of Herbert 's new manner toward her .
Parsing [sent. 1378 len. 30]: For a week Herbert had steadily pursued his scientific career , and he seemed to feel that in it he had attained a distinction beyond the reach of Florence .
Parsing [sent. 1379 len. 65]: What made it ridiculous for her to hope was , of course , the fact that she was a girl , and Herbert had explained this to her in a cold , unpleasant way ; for it is true that what is called `` feminism '' must be acquired by men , and is not a condition , or taste , natural to them .
Parsing [sent. 1380 len. 8]: At thirteen it has not been acquired .
Parsing [sent. 1381 len. 6]: She found him at home .
Parsing [sent. 1382 len. 68]: He was importantly engaged in a room in the cellar , where were loosely stored all manner of incapacitated household devices ; two broken clothes-wringers , a crippled and rusted sewing-machine , an ice-cream freezer in like condition , a cracked and discarded marble mantelpiece , chipped porcelain and chinaware of all sorts , rusted stove lids and flatirons , half a dozen dead mops and brooms .
Parsing [sent. 1383 len. 17]: This was the laboratory , and here , in congenial solitude , Herbert conducted his investigations .
Parsing [sent. 1384 len. 25]: That is to say , until Florence arrived he was undisturbed by human intrusion , but he was not alone -- far from it !
Parsing [sent. 1385 len. 14]: There was , in fact , almost too much life in the place .
Parsing [sent. 1386 len. 43]: Where the light fell clearest from the cobwebby windows at the ground level overhead , he had placed a long deal table , once a helpmate in the kitchen , but now a colourless antique on three legs and two starch boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1387 len. 43]: Upon the table were seven or eight glass jars , formerly used for preserves and pickles , and a dozen jelly glasses -LRB- with only streaks and bits of jelly in them now -RRB- and five or six small round pasteboard pill-boxes .
Parsing [sent. 1388 len. 26]: The jars were covered , some with their own patent tops , others with shingles or bits of board , and one with a brick .
Parsing [sent. 1389 len. 95]: The jelly glasses stood inverted , and were inhabited ; so were the preserve jars and pickle jars ; and so were the pill-boxes , which evidently contained star boarders , for they were pierced with `` breathing holes , '' and one of them , standing upon its side like a little wheel , now and then moved in a faint , ghostly manner as if about to start rolling on its own account -- whereupon Herbert glanced up and addressed it sternly , though somewhat inconsistently : `` You shut up ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1390 len. 59]: In the display of so much experimental paraphernalia , there may have been a hint that Herbert 's was a scientific nature craving rather quantity than quality ; his collection certainly possessed the virtue of multitudinousness , if that be a virtue ; and the birds in the neighbourhood must have been undergoing a great deal of disappointment .
Parsing [sent. 1391 len. 22]: In brief , as many bugs as Herbert now owned have seldom been seen in the custody of any private individual .
Parsing [sent. 1392 len. 64]: And nearly all of them were alive , energetic and swearing , though several of the preserve jars had been imperfectly drained of their heavy syrups , and in one of them a great many spiders seemed to be having , of the whole collection , the poorest time ; being pretty well mired down and yet still subject to disagreements among themselves .
Parsing [sent. 1393 len. 27]: The habits of this group , under such unusual surroundings , formed the subject of Herbert 's special study at the moment of Florence 's arrival .
Parsing [sent. 1394 len. 37]: He was seated at the table and frowning with science as he observed the unfortunates through that magnifying-glass , his discovery of which was responsible for their present condition and his own choice of a career .
Parsing [sent. 1395 len. 43]: Florence paused in the doorway , but he gave no sign of recognition , unless his intensified preoccupation was a sign , and Florence , perceiving what line of conduct he meant to adopt , instinctively selected a reciprocal one for herself .
Parsing [sent. 1396 len. 10]: `` Herbert Atwater , you ought to be punished !
Parsing [sent. 1397 len. 12]: I 'm goin ' to tell your father and mother . ''
Parsing [sent. 1398 len. 45]: `` You g ` way , '' Herbert returned , unmoved ; and , without condescending to give her a glance , he set down the magnifying-glass , and with a pencil wrote something profoundly entomological in a soiled memorandum book upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 1399 len. 8]: `` Run away , Flor ` nce .
Parsing [sent. 1400 len. 7]: Run away somewheres and play . ''
Parsing [sent. 1401 len. 4]: Florence approached . ''
Parsing [sent. 1402 len. 5]: ` Play ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1403 len. 4]: she echoed tartly .
Parsing [sent. 1404 len. 31]: `` I should think _ you _ would n't talk much about ` playin ' , ' the way you 're teasing those poor , poor little bugs ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1405 len. 5]: ` Teasing ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1406 len. 7]: Herbert exclaimed : `` That shows !
Parsing [sent. 1407 len. 4]: That shows ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1408 len. 5]: `` Shows what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1409 len. 7]: `` How much you know ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1410 len. 6]: He became despondent about her .
Parsing [sent. 1411 len. 35]: `` See here , Florence ; it does look to me as though at your age a person ought to know anyway enough not to disturb me when I 'm expairamenting , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 1412 len. 21]: I should think -- '' But she did not prove so meek as to await the conclusion of his remonstrance .
Parsing [sent. 1413 len. 13]: `` I never saw anything as wicked in my whole born days !
Parsing [sent. 1414 len. 33]: What did any of those poor , poor little bugs ever do to _ you _ , I 'd like to know , you got to go and confine 'em like this !
Parsing [sent. 1415 len. 9]: And look how dirty your hands are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1416 len. 58]: This final charge , wandering so far from her previous specifications of his guilt , was purely automatic and conventional ; Florence often interjected it during the course of any cousinly discussion , whatever the subject in dispute , and she had not even glanced at Herbert 's hands to assure herself that the accusation was warranted .
Parsing [sent. 1417 len. 27]: But , as usual , the facts supported her ; and they also supported Herbert in his immediate mechanical retort : `` So 're yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1418 len. 5]: `` Not either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1419 len. 38]: But here Florence , after instinctively placing her hands behind her , brought forth the right one to point , and simultaneously uttered a loud cry : `` Oh , _ look _ at your hands ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1420 len. 14]: For now she did look at Herbert 's hands , and was amazed .
Parsing [sent. 1421 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1422 len. 7]: `` They 're all lumpy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1423 len. 25]: she cried , and , as her gaze rose to his cheek , her finger followed her eyes and pointed to strange appearances there .
Parsing [sent. 1424 len. 9]: `` Look at your _ face _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1425 len. 8]: `` Well , what of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1426 len. 11]: he demanded , his tone not entirely free from braggadocio .
Parsing [sent. 1427 len. 69]: `` A girl ca n't make expairaments the way I do , because if one of these good ole bumblebees or hornets of mine was to give 'em a little sting , once in a while , while they was catchin ' 'em and puttin ' 'em in a jar , all they 'd know how to do 'd be to holler and run home to their mamma .
Parsing [sent. 1428 len. 17]: Nobody with any gumption minds a few little stings after you put mud on 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 1429 len. 24]: `` I guess it serves you right , '' Florence said , `` for persecutin ' these poor , poor little bugs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1430 len. 4]: Herbert became plaintive .
Parsing [sent. 1431 len. 20]: `` Look here , Florence ; I do wish you 'd go on back home where you belong . ''
Parsing [sent. 1432 len. 39]: But Florence did not reply ; instead she picked up the magnifying-glass , and , gazing through it at a pickle jar of mixed beetles , caterpillars , angleworms , and potato bugs , permitted herself to shudder .
Parsing [sent. 1433 len. 5]: `` Vile things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1434 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1435 len. 8]: `` They are not , either ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1436 len. 4]: Herbert retorted hotly .
Parsing [sent. 1437 len. 28]: `` They 're about the finest insecks that you or anybody else ever saw , and you ought to be ashamed -- '' `` I ought ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1438 len. 4]: his cousin cried .
Parsing [sent. 1439 len. 19]: `` Well , I should think you 're the one ought to be ashamed , if anybody ought !
Parsing [sent. 1440 len. 32]: Down here in the cellar playin ' with all these vile bugs that ought to be given their liberty , or thrown down the sewer , or somep ` n ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1441 len. 12]: Again , as she peered through the lens , she shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 1442 len. 20]: `` Vile -- '' `` Florence , '' he said sternly , `` you lay down that magnifying-glass . ''
Parsing [sent. 1443 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1444 len. 11]: `` Because you do n't know how to handle it .
Parsing [sent. 1445 len. 25]: A magnifying-glass has got to be handled in just the right way , and you could n't learn if you tried a thousand years .
Parsing [sent. 1446 len. 18]: That 's a mighty fine magnifying-glass , and I do n't intend to have it ruined . ''
Parsing [sent. 1447 len. 17]: `` Why , just lookin ' through it ca n't spoil it , can it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1448 len. 5]: she inquired , surprised .
Parsing [sent. 1449 len. 11]: `` You lay it down , '' said Herbert darkly .
Parsing [sent. 1450 len. 20]: `` Lookin ' through it the wrong way is n't going to do it any _ good _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 1451 len. 38]: `` Why , how could just _ lookin ' _ through it -- '' `` Lookin ' through it the wrong way is n't goin ' to _ help _ it any , I tell you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1452 len. 3]: he insisted .
Parsing [sent. 1453 len. 35]: `` You 're old enough to know that , and I 'm not goin ' to have my magnifying-glass spoiled and all my insecks wasted just because of a mere whin of yours ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1454 len. 5]: `` A what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1455 len. 9]: `` A mere whin , I said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1456 len. 7]: `` What 's a whin ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1457 len. 10]: `` Never you mind , '' said Herbert ominously .
Parsing [sent. 1458 len. 19]: `` You 'll proba ` ly find out some day when you are n't expectin ' to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1459 len. 20]: Undeniably , Florence was somewhat impressed : she replaced the magnifying-glass upon the table and picked up the notebook .
Parsing [sent. 1460 len. 13]: `` You lay that down , too , '' said Herbert instantly .
Parsing [sent. 1461 len. 61]: `` Oh , maybe it 's somep 'n you 're _ ` shamed _ to -- '' `` Go on and read it , then , '' he said , suddenly changing his mind , for he was confident that she would find matter here that might cause her to appreciate at least a little of her own inferiority . ''
Parsing [sent. 1462 len. 9]: ` Nots ' , '' Florence began . ''
Parsing [sent. 1463 len. 9]: ` Nots ' -- '' `` Notes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1464 len. 6]: he corrected her fiercely . ''
Parsing [sent. 1465 len. 9]: ` Notes ' , '' she read . ''
Parsing [sent. 1466 len. 7]: ` Notes on our inseck friends .
Parsing [sent. 1467 len. 9]: The spidder -- ' '' '' _ Spider !
Parsing [sent. 1468 len. 25]: _ '' '' ` The spider spends his time mostly in cobwebs which he digilently spins between posts and catches flies to eat them .
Parsing [sent. 1469 len. 12]: They are different coloured and sizes and have legs in pairs .
Parsing [sent. 1470 len. 20]: Spiders also spin their webs in corners or in weeds or on a fence and sometimes in the grass .
Parsing [sent. 1471 len. 48]: They are more able to get about quicker than catapillars or fishing worms , but can not fly such as pinching bugs , lightning bugs , and birds because having no wings , nor jump as far as the grass hoper -- ' '' `` Grasshopper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1472 len. 3]: Herbert shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1473 len. 16]: `` I 'm readin ' it the way it 's spelled , '' Florence explained .
Parsing [sent. 1474 len. 11]: `` Anyway , it do n't make much sense . ''
Parsing [sent. 1475 len. 12]: Herbert was at least enough of an author to be furious .
Parsing [sent. 1476 len. 6]: `` Lay it down ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1477 len. 4]: he said bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1478 len. 11]: `` And go on back home to your dolls . ''
Parsing [sent. 1479 len. 23]: `` Dolls certainly would be _ cleaner _ than vile bugs , '' Florence retorted , tossing the book upon the table .
Parsing [sent. 1480 len. 40]: `` But in regards to that , I have n't had any , '' she went on , airily -- `` not for years and years and years and -- '' He interrupted her , his voice again plaintive .
Parsing [sent. 1481 len. 35]: `` See here , Florence , how do you expect me to get my _ work _ done , with you everlastin ` ly talkin ' and goin ' on around here like this ?
Parsing [sent. 1482 len. 16]: Ca n't you see I 've got somep 'n pretty important on my hands ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1483 len. 4]: Florence became thoughtful .
Parsing [sent. 1484 len. 19]: `` I never did see as many bugs before , all together this way , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1485 len. 13]: `` What you goin ' to do with 'em , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1486 len. 9]: `` I 'm makin ' my expairaments . ''
Parsing [sent. 1487 len. 5]: But her thoughtfulness increased .
Parsing [sent. 1488 len. 42]: `` It seems to me , '' she said slowly : -- `` Herbert , it seems to me there must be some awful inter ` sting thing we could do with so many bugs all together like this . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1489 len. 5]: ` We ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1490 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 1491 len. 14]: `` My goodness , whose insecks do you think these insecks are ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1492 len. 28]: `` I just know there 's somep ` n , '' she went on , following her own line of thought , and indifferent to his outburst .
Parsing [sent. 1493 len. 25]: `` There 's somep 'n we could do with 'em that we 'd never forget , if we could only think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1494 len. 9]: In spite of himself , Herbert was interested .
Parsing [sent. 1495 len. 6]: `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1496 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 1497 len. 13]: `` What could we do with 'em we 'd never forget ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1498 len. 14]: In her eyes there was a far-away light as of a seeress groping .
Parsing [sent. 1499 len. 69]: `` I do n't just know exackly , but I know there 's _ somep ` n _ -- if we could only think of it -- if we could just -- '' And her voice became inaudible , as in dreamy concentration she seated herself upon the discarded ice-cream freezer , and rested her elbows upon her knees and her chin upon the palms of her hands .
Parsing [sent. 1500 len. 9]: In silence then , she thought and thought .
Parsing [sent. 1501 len. 42]: Herbert also was silent , for he , too , was trying to think , not knowing that already he had proved himself to be wax in her hands , and that he was destined further to show himself thus malleable .
Parsing [sent. 1502 len. 34]: Like many and many another of his sex , he never for an instant suspected that he spent the greater part of his time carrying out ideas implanted within him by a lady-friend .
Parsing [sent. 1503 len. 26]: Florence was ever the imaginative one of those two , a maiden of unexpected fancies and inexplicable conceptions , a mind of quicksilver and mist .
Parsing [sent. 1504 len. 50]: There was within her the seedling of a creative artist , and as she sat there , on the ice-cream freezer in Herbert 's cellar , with the slowly growing roseate glow of deep preoccupation upon her , she looked strangely sweet and good , and even almost pretty .
Parsing [sent. 1505 len. 60]: CHAPTER EIGHT `` Do you s ` pose , '' she said , at last , in a musing voice : `` Herbert , do you s ` pose maybe there 's some poor family 's children somewheres that have n't got any playthings or anything and we could take all these -- '' But here Herbert proved unsympathetic .
Parsing [sent. 1506 len. 22]: `` I 'm not goin ' to give my insecks to any poor people 's children , '' he said emphatically .
Parsing [sent. 1507 len. 11]: `` I do n't care how poor they are ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1508 len. 19]: `` Well , I thought maybe just as a surprise -- '' `` I wo n't do it .
Parsing [sent. 1509 len. 35]: I had mighty hard work to catch this c ` lection , and I 'm not goin ' to give it away to anybody , I do n't care how surprised they 'd be !
Parsing [sent. 1510 len. 37]: Anyway , I 'd never get any thanks for it ; they would n't know how to handle 'em , and they 'd get all stung up : and what 'd be the use , anyhow ?
Parsing [sent. 1511 len. 24]: I do n't see how _ that 's _ goin ' to be somep 'n so interesting we 'd never forget it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1512 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1513 len. 7]: `` I guess it would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1514 len. 15]: I just thought it would be kind of a bellnevolent thing to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 1515 len. 35]: This word disturbed Herbert , but he did not feel altogether secure in his own impression that `` benovvalent '' was the proper rendition of what she meant , and so refrained from criticism .
Parsing [sent. 1516 len. 5]: Their musing was resumed .
Parsing [sent. 1517 len. 18]: `` There 's one thing I do wish , '' Florence said suddenly , after a time .
Parsing [sent. 1518 len. 23]: `` I wish we could find some way to use the c ` lection that would be useful for Noble Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 1519 len. 13]: Now , at this , her cousin 's face showed simple amazement .
Parsing [sent. 1520 len. 10]: `` What on earth you talkin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1521 len. 9]: `` Noble Dill , '' she said dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 1522 len. 15]: `` He 's the only one I like that comes to see Aunt Julia .
Parsing [sent. 1523 len. 9]: Anyway , I like him the most . ''
Parsing [sent. 1524 len. 9]: `` I bet Aunt Julia do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1525 len. 21]: `` I do n't care : he 's the one _ I _ wish she 'd get married to . ''
Parsing [sent. 1526 len. 4]: Herbert was astounded .
Parsing [sent. 1527 len. 4]: `` Noble Dill ?
Parsing [sent. 1528 len. 18]: Why , I heard mamma and Aunt Hattie and Uncle Joe talkin ' about him yesterday . ''
Parsing [sent. 1529 len. 7]: `` What 'd they say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1530 len. 15]: `` Most of the time , '' said Herbert , `` they just laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1531 len. 22]: They said Noble Dill was the very last person in this town Aunt Julia 'd ever dream o ' marryin ' .
Parsing [sent. 1532 len. 30]: They said he was n't anything : they said he was n't handsome and he was n't distingrished-looking -- '' `` I think he is , '' Florence interposed .
Parsing [sent. 1533 len. 11]: `` I think he 's _ very _ distingrished-looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1534 len. 17]: `` Well , they said he was n't , and they know more 'n you do .
Parsing [sent. 1535 len. 23]: Why , Noble Dill is n't hardly any taller 'n I am myself , and he has n't got any muscle partickyourly .
Parsing [sent. 1536 len. 9]: Aunt Julia would n't look at him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1537 len. 6]: `` She does , too !
Parsing [sent. 1538 len. 34]: My goodness , how could he sit on the porch , right in front of her , for two or three hours at a time , without her lookin ' at him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1539 len. 12]: `` I do n't care , '' Herbert insisted stubbornly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1540 len. 9]: _ They _ said Aunt Julia would n't .
Parsing [sent. 1541 len. 44]: They said she was the worst flirt had ever been in the whole family and Noble Dill had the worst case they ever saw , but she would n't ever look at him , and if she did she 'd be crazy . ''
Parsing [sent. 1542 len. 44]: `` Well , anyway , '' said Florence , `` I think he 's the nicest of all that goes to see her , and I wish we could use this c ` lection some way that would be nice for him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1543 len. 5]: Herbert renewed his protest .
Parsing [sent. 1544 len. 47]: `` How many times I got to tell you I had a hard enough time catchin ' this c ` lection , day in and day out , from before daylight till after dark , and then fixin ' 'em all up like this and everything !
Parsing [sent. 1545 len. 25]: I do n't prapose to waste 'em just to suit Noble Dill , and I 'm not goin ' to give 'em away either .
Parsing [sent. 1546 len. 31]: If anybody wanted to buy 'em and offered a good fair price , money down , why , I -- '' '' _ That 's _ it , Herbert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1547 len. 7]: his lady-cousin exclaimed with sudden excitement .
Parsing [sent. 1548 len. 7]: `` Let 's sell 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1549 len. 8]: She jumped up , her eyes bright .
Parsing [sent. 1550 len. 12]: `` I bet we could get maybe five dollars for 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1551 len. 72]: We can pour the ones that are in the jars that have n't got tops and the ones in the jelly glasses and pill-boxes -- we can pour all those into the jars that have got tops , and put the tops on again , and that 'd just about fill those jars -- and then we could put 'em in a basket and take 'em out and sell 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1552 len. 8]: `` Where could we sell 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1553 len. 6]: Herbert inquired , not convinced .
Parsing [sent. 1554 len. 7]: `` At the fish store ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1555 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 1556 len. 17]: `` Everybody uses bugs and worms for bait when they go fishing , do n't they ?
Parsing [sent. 1557 len. 22]: I bet the fish man 'll buy all the worms we got , even if he would n't buy anything else .
Parsing [sent. 1558 len. 11]: I bet he 'll buy all the others , too !
Parsing [sent. 1559 len. 20]: I bet he never saw as much good bait as this all at one time in his whole life !
Parsing [sent. 1560 len. 13]: I bet he 'll give us five dollars -- maybe more ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1561 len. 20]: Herbert was dazzled ; the thought of this market was a revelation -- nothing could have been more plausible .
Parsing [sent. 1562 len. 29]: Considered as bait , the c ` lection at once seemed to acquire a practical and financial value which it lacked , purely as a c ` lection .
Parsing [sent. 1563 len. 18]: And with that the amateur and scientist disappeared , giving way to the person of affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 1564 len. 10]: ` Give _ us _ five dollars ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1565 len. 39]: he said , in this capacity , and for deeper effect he used a rhetorical expression : `` Who do you think is the owner of all this fish bait , may I ask you , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1566 len. 11]: `` Yes , you _ may _ , pray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1567 len. 9]: was his cousin 's instant and supercilious retort .
Parsing [sent. 1568 len. 26]: `` Pray where would you ever of got any five dollars from any fish man , if it had n't been for me , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 1569 len. 41]: Pray , did n't I first sajest our doing somep 'n with the bugs we 'd never forget , and if the fish man gives us five dollars for 'em wo n't we remember it all our lives , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 1570 len. 16]: And , pray , what part did you think up of all this , pray ?
Parsing [sent. 1571 len. 54]: Not one single thing , and if you do n't divide even with me , I 'll run ahead and tell the fish man the whole c ` lection has been in bottles that had old medicine and poison in 'em -- and then where 'll _ you _ be , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1572 len. 31]: It is to be doubted that Florence possessed the cold-blooded capacities with which this impromptu in diplomacy seemed to invest her : probably she would never have gone so far .
Parsing [sent. 1573 len. 17]: But the words sufficed ; and Herbert was so perfectly intimidated that he was even unresentful .
Parsing [sent. 1574 len. 28]: `` Well , you can have your ole two dollars and a half , whether you got a right to it or not , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1575 len. 10]: `` But you got to carry the basket . ''
Parsing [sent. 1576 len. 7]: `` No , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 1577 len. 11]: `` This has got to be done right , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 1578 len. 15]: We 're partners now and everything 's got to be divided just exackly even .
Parsing [sent. 1579 len. 17]: I 'll carry the basket half the way and you carry it the other half . ''
Parsing [sent. 1580 len. 9]: `` Well -- '' he grumbled , consenting .
Parsing [sent. 1581 len. 13]: `` That 's the only right way , '' she said sunnily .
Parsing [sent. 1582 len. 24]: `` You carry it till we get to the fish man 's , and I 'll carry it all the way back . ''
Parsing [sent. 1583 len. 9]: But even Herbert could perceive the inequality here .
Parsing [sent. 1584 len. 11]: `` It 'll be empty then , '' he protested .
Parsing [sent. 1585 len. 14]: `` Fair 's fair and wrong 's wrong , '' she returned firmly .
Parsing [sent. 1586 len. 22]: `` I spoke first to carry it on the way home , and the one that speaks first gets it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1587 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1588 len. 19]: `` Herbert , we got to get all these bugs fixed up and ready , '' she urged .
Parsing [sent. 1589 len. 19]: `` We do n't want to waste the whole afternoon just talkin ' about it , do we ?
Parsing [sent. 1590 len. 60]: Besides , Herbert , on the way home you 'll have two dollars and a half in your pocket , or anyway as much as you have left , if you buy some soda and candy and things , and you 'll feel so fine then you wo n't mind whether you 're carrying the basket or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 1591 len. 42]: The picture she now suggested to Herbert 's mind was of himself carrying the basket both to the fish man and from the fish man : and he found himself anxious to protest , yet helpless in a maze of perplexity .
Parsing [sent. 1592 len. 10]: `` But wait a minute , '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 1593 len. 19]: `` You said -- '' `` Let 's do n't waste another minute , '' she interrupted briskly .
Parsing [sent. 1594 len. 20]: `` I should n't wonder it was after four o'clock by this time , and we both need money .
Parsing [sent. 1595 len. 5]: Hurry , Herbert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1596 len. 15]: `` But did n't you say -- '' He paused to rub his head .
Parsing [sent. 1597 len. 21]: `` You said I 'd feel so good I would n't mind if I -- if -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 1598 len. 8]: I said , ` Hurry ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1599 len. 34]: `` Well -- '' And though he felt that a subtle injustice lurked somewhere , he was unable to think the matter out clearly into its composing elements , and gave up trying .
Parsing [sent. 1600 len. 40]: Nevertheless , as he obeyed her , and began to `` hurry , '' there remained with him an impression that by some foggy and underhand process he had been committed to acquiescence in an unfair division of labour .
Parsing [sent. 1601 len. 7]: In this he was not mistaken .
Parsing [sent. 1602 len. 35]: An hour later he and Florence were on their way home from the fish man 's place of business , and Herbert , having carried the basket thither , was now carrying it thence .
Parsing [sent. 1603 len. 53]: Moreover , his burden was precisely as heavy on this homeward leg of the course as it had been on that terminating at the fish store , for , covered by a discreet newspaper , the preserve and pickle jars still remained within the basket , their crowding and indignant contents intact .
Parsing [sent. 1604 len. 22]: The fish man had explained in terms derisive , but plain , the difference between a fish man and a fisherman .
Parsing [sent. 1605 len. 35]: He had maintained his definitions of the two economic functions in spite of persistent arguments on the part of the bait-dealers , and in the face of reductions that finally removed ninety per cent .
Parsing [sent. 1606 len. 5]: of their asking price .
Parsing [sent. 1607 len. 31]: He would n't give fifty cents , or ten cents , or one cent , he said : and he could n't furnish the address of anybody else that would .
Parsing [sent. 1608 len. 76]: His fish came by express , he declared , again and again : and the only people he knew that did any fishing were mainly coloured , and dug their own bait ; and though these might possibly be willing to accept the angle worms as a gift , they would probably incline to resent a generosity including so many spiders , not to speak of the dangerous winged members of the c ` lection .
Parsing [sent. 1609 len. 38]: On account of these latter , he jocosely professed himself to be anxious lest the tops of some of the jars might work loose -- and altogether he was the most disheartening man they had ever met .
Parsing [sent. 1610 len. 59]: Anticlimax was never the stimulant of amiability , and , after an altercation on the pavement just outside of the store , during which the derisive fish man continually called to them to go on and take that there basket out of the neighbourhood , the cousins moved morbidly away , and walked for a time in silence .
Parsing [sent. 1611 len. 3]: They brooded .
Parsing [sent. 1612 len. 42]: Herbert was even more embittered with Florence than he was with the fish man , and Florence found life full of unexpectedness ; it had been so clear to her that the fish man would say : `` Why , certainly .
Parsing [sent. 1613 len. 15]: Here 's five dollars ; two dollars and a half for each of you .
Parsing [sent. 1614 len. 10]: Would you care to have the jars back ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1615 len. 46]: The facts , so contrary , seemed to wear the aspect of deliberate malice , and she felt ill-used , especially as she had several physical grievances , due to her assistance in pouring part of the c ` lection into the jars with tops .
Parsing [sent. 1616 len. 26]: In spite of every precaution three or four of the liveliest items had made their escape , during this pouring , and had behaved resentfully .
Parsing [sent. 1617 len. 40]: Florence bore one result on the back of her left hand , two others on the thumb and second finger of her right hand , and another , naturally the most conspicuous , on the point of her chin .
Parsing [sent. 1618 len. 52]: These had all been painful , in spite of mud poultices , but , excited by the anticipation of a kindly smiling fish man , and occupied with plans for getting Herbert to spend part of his two dollars and a half for mutual refreshment , she had borne up cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 1619 len. 26]: Now , comprehending that she had suffered in vain , she suffered anew , and hated bugs , all fish men , and the world .
Parsing [sent. 1620 len. 12]: It was Herbert who broke the silence and renewed the altercation .
Parsing [sent. 1621 len. 16]: `` How far you expeck me to go on luggin ' this ole basket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1622 len. 4]: he demanded bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 1623 len. 7]: `` All the way home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1624 len. 13]: `` I do n't care how far , '' she informed him .
Parsing [sent. 1625 len. 11]: `` You can throw it away if you want to .
Parsing [sent. 1626 len. 12]: It 's certainly no propaty of mine , thank you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1627 len. 15]: `` Look here , did n't you promise you 'd carry it home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1628 len. 9]: `` I said I _ spoke _ to .
Parsing [sent. 1629 len. 12]: I did n't say I _ would _ carry it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1630 len. 18]: `` Well , I 'd like to know the dif -- '' But Florence cut him off .
Parsing [sent. 1631 len. 22]: `` I 'll tell you the difference , since you 're so anxious to know the truth , Mister Herbert Atwater !
Parsing [sent. 1632 len. 72]: The difference is just this : you had no biznuss to meddle with those vile ole bugs in the first place , and get me all stung up so ' t I should n't wonder I 'd haf to have the doctor , time I get home , and if I do I 'm goin ' to tell mamma all about it and make her send the bill to your father .
Parsing [sent. 1633 len. 11]: I want you to know I _ hurt _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1634 len. 5]: `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1635 len. 4]: Herbert burst out .
Parsing [sent. 1636 len. 13]: `` Do n't you s ` pose _ I _ hurt any ?
Parsing [sent. 1637 len. 19]: I guess you do n't hurt any worse than -- '' She stopped him : `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1638 len. 54]: From down the street there came a brazen clamouring for the right of way ; it grew imperiously louder , and there were clatterings and whizzings of metallic bodies at speed , while little blurs and glistenings in the distance grew swiftly larger , taking shape as a fire engine and a hose-cart .
Parsing [sent. 1639 len. 34]: Then , round the near-by corner , came perilously steering the long `` hook-and-ladder wagon '' ; it made the turn and went by , with its firemen imperturbable on the running boards .
Parsing [sent. 1640 len. 4]: `` Fire ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1641 len. 4]: Florence cried joyfully .
Parsing [sent. 1642 len. 6]: `` Let 's go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1643 len. 25]: And , pausing no instant , she made off up the street , shouting at the top of her voice : '' _ Fire !
Parsing [sent. 1644 len. 2]: Fire !
Parsing [sent. 1645 len. 2]: Fire !
Parsing [sent. 1646 len. 2]: Fire !
Parsing [sent. 1647 len. 5]: _ '' Herbert followed .
Parsing [sent. 1648 len. 54]: He was not so swift a runner as she , though this he never submitted to a test admitted to be fair and conclusive ; and he found her demonstration of superiority particularly offensive now , as she called back over her shoulder : `` Why do n't you keep up with me ?
Parsing [sent. 1649 len. 7]: Ca n't you keep up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1650 len. 9]: `` I 'd _ show _ you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1651 len. 3]: he panted .
Parsing [sent. 1652 len. 23]: `` If I did n't haf to lug this ole basket , I 'd leave you a mile behind mighty quick . ''
Parsing [sent. 1653 len. 13]: `` Well , why 'n' t you drop it , then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1654 len. 29]: `` You s ` pose I 'm goin ' to throw my c ` lection away after all the trouble I been _ through _ with it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1655 len. 10]: She slackened her gait , dropping back beside him .
Parsing [sent. 1656 len. 42]: `` Well , then , if you think you could keep up with me if you did n't have it , why 'n' t you leave it somewhere , and come back and get it after the fire 's over ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1657 len. 8]: `` No place to leave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1658 len. 6]: She laughed , and pointed .
Parsing [sent. 1659 len. 12]: `` Why 'n' t you leave it at grandpa 's ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1660 len. 11]: `` Will you wait for me and start fair ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1661 len. 5]: `` Come on ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1662 len. 25]: They obliqued across the street , still running forward , and at their grandfather 's gate Herbert turned in and sped toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 1663 len. 18]: `` Take it around to the kitchen and give it to Kitty Silver , '' Florence called .
Parsing [sent. 1664 len. 13]: `` Tell Kitty Silver to take care of it for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 1665 len. 27]: But Herbert was in no mind to follow her advice ; a glance over his shoulder showed that Florence was taking another unfair advantage of him .
Parsing [sent. 1666 len. 5]: `` You wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1667 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 1668 len. 10]: `` You stand still till I get back there !
Parsing [sent. 1669 len. 10]: You got half a mile start a ` ready !
Parsing [sent. 1670 len. 9]: You wait till we can start even ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1671 len. 34]: But Florence was skipping lightly away and she caroled over her shoulder , waving her hand in mocking farewell as she began to run : `` Ole Mister Slowpoke ca n't catch me !
Parsing [sent. 1672 len. 10]: Ole Mister Slowpoke could n't catch a flea ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1673 len. 7]: `` I 'll show you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1674 len. 38]: he bellowed , and , not to lose more time , he dashed up the steps of the deserted veranda , thrust his basket deep underneath a wicker settee , and ran violently after his elusive cousin .
Parsing [sent. 1675 len. 33]: She kept a tantalizing distance between them , but when they reached the fire it was such a grand one they forgot all their differences -- and also all about the basket .
Parsing [sent. 1676 len. 38]: CHAPTER NINE Noble Dill came from his father 's house , after dinner that evening , a youth in blossom , like the shrubberies and garden beds in the dim yards up and down Julia 's Street .
Parsing [sent. 1677 len. 39]: All cooled and bathed and in new clothes of white , he took his thrilled walk through the deep summer twilight , on his way to that ineffable Front Porch where sat Julia , misty in the dusk .
Parsing [sent. 1678 len. 84]: The girlish little new moon had perished naïvely out of the sky ; the final pinkness of the west was gone ; blue evening held the quiet world ; and overhead , between the branches of the maple trees , were powdered all those bright pin points of light that were to twinkle on generations of young lovers after Noble Dill , each one , like Noble , walking the same fragrant path in summer twilights to see the Prettiest Girl of All .
Parsing [sent. 1679 len. 52]: Now and then there came to the faintly throbbing ears of the pedestrian a murmur of voices from lawns where citizens sat cooling after the day 's labour , or a tinkle of laughter from where maidens dull -LRB- not being Julia -RRB- sat on verandas vacant of beauty and glamour .
Parsing [sent. 1680 len. 29]: For these poor things , Noble felt a wondering and disdainful pity ; he pitied everything in the world that was not on the way to starry Julia .
Parsing [sent. 1681 len. 67]: Eight nights had passed since he , himself , had seen her , but to-day she had replied -LRB- over the telephone -RRB- that Mr. Atwater seemed to have settled down again , and she believed it might be no breach of tact for Noble to call that evening -- especially as she would be on the veranda , and he need n't ring the bell .
Parsing [sent. 1682 len. 8]: Would she be alone -- for once ?
Parsing [sent. 1683 len. 10]: It was improbable , yet it could be hoped .
Parsing [sent. 1684 len. 34]: But as he came hoping up the street , another already sat beside Julia , sharing with her the wicker settee on the dim porch , and this was the horn-rimmed young poet .
Parsing [sent. 1685 len. 47]: Newland had , as usual , a new poem with him ; and as others had proved of late that they could sit on Julia 's veranda as long as he could , he had seized the first opportunity to familiarize her with this latest work .
Parsing [sent. 1686 len. 51]: The veranda was dark , and to go indoors to the light might have involved too close a juxtaposition to peculiar old Mr. Atwater who was in the library ; but the resourceful Newland , foreseeing everything , had brought with him a small pocket flashlight to illumine his manuscript .
Parsing [sent. 1687 len. 26]: `` It 's _ vers libre _ , of course , '' he said as he moved the flashlight over the sheets of scribbled paper .
Parsing [sent. 1688 len. 17]: `` I think I told you I was beginning to give all the old forms up .
Parsing [sent. 1689 len. 17]: It 's the one new movement , and I felt I ought to master it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1690 len. 15]: `` Of course , '' she said sympathetically , though with a little nervousness .
Parsing [sent. 1691 len. 29]: `` Be just a wee bit careful with the flashlight -- about turning it toward the window , I mean -- and read in your nice low voice .
Parsing [sent. 1692 len. 11]: I always like poetry best when it 's almost whispered .
Parsing [sent. 1693 len. 13]: I think it sounds more musical that way , I mean . ''
Parsing [sent. 1694 len. 3]: Newland obeyed .
Parsing [sent. 1695 len. 27]: His voice was hushed and profoundly appreciative of the music in itself and in his poem , as he read : `` I -- And Love !
Parsing [sent. 1696 len. 12]: Lush white lilies line the pool Like laces limned on looking-glasses !
Parsing [sent. 1697 len. 12]: I tread the lilies underfoot , Careless how they love me !
Parsing [sent. 1698 len. 10]: Still white maidens woo me , Win me not !
Parsing [sent. 1699 len. 3]: But thou !
Parsing [sent. 1700 len. 6]: Thou art a cornflower Sapphire-eyed !
Parsing [sent. 1701 len. 3]: I bend !
Parsing [sent. 1702 len. 7]: Cornflower , I ask a question .
Parsing [sent. 1703 len. 9]: O flower , speak -- '' Julia spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1704 len. 38]: `` I 'm afraid , '' she said , while Newland 's spirit filled with a bitterness extraordinary even in an interrupted poet ; -- `` I 'm afraid it 's Mr. Dill coming up the walk .
Parsing [sent. 1705 len. 20]: We 'll have to postpone -- '' She rose and went to the steps to greet the approaching guest .
Parsing [sent. 1706 len. 9]: `` How nice of you to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1707 len. 16]: Noble , remaining on the lowest step , clung to her hand in a fever .
Parsing [sent. 1708 len. 6]: `` Nice to come ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1709 len. 4]: he said hoarsely .
Parsing [sent. 1710 len. 24]: `` It 's eight days -- eight days -- eight days since -- '' `` Mr. Sanders is here , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1711 len. 16]: `` It 's so dark on this big veranda people can hardly see each other .
Parsing [sent. 1712 len. 7]: Come up and sit with us .
Parsing [sent. 1713 len. 14]: I do n't have to introduce you two men to each other . ''
Parsing [sent. 1714 len. 6]: She did not , indeed .
Parsing [sent. 1715 len. 32]: They said `` H'lo , Dill '' and `` H'lo Sanders '' in a manner of such slighting superiority that only the utmost familiarity could have bred a contempt so magnificent .
Parsing [sent. 1716 len. 25]: Then , when the three were seated , Mr. Sanders thought well to add : `` How 's rent collecting these days , Dill ?
Parsing [sent. 1717 len. 12]: Still hustling around among those darky shanties over in Bucktown ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1718 len. 44]: In the dark Noble moved convulsively , but contrived to affect a light laugh , or a sound meant for one , as he replied , in a voice not entirely under control : `` How 's the ole poetry , Sanders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1719 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1720 len. 4]: Newland demanded sharply .
Parsing [sent. 1721 len. 7]: `` What did you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1722 len. 12]: `` I said : ` How 's the ole poetry ? '
Parsing [sent. 1723 len. 15]: Do you read it to all your relations the way you used to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1724 len. 7]: `` See here , Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1725 len. 10]: `` Well , what you want , Sanders ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1726 len. 14]: `` You try to talk about things you understand , '' said Newland .
Parsing [sent. 1727 len. 36]: `` You better keep your mind on collecting four dollars a week from some poor coloured widow , and do n't -- '' `` I 'd _ rather _ keep my mind on that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1728 len. 6]: Noble was inspired to retort .
Parsing [sent. 1729 len. 30]: `` Your Aunt Georgina told my mother that ever since you began thinkin ' you could write poetry the life your family led was just -- '' Newland interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 1730 len. 28]: He knew the improper thing his Aunt Georgina had said , and he was again , and doubly , infuriated by the prospect of its repetition here .
Parsing [sent. 1731 len. 24]: He began fiercely : `` Dill , you see here -- '' `` Your Aunt Georgina said -- '' Both voices had risen .
Parsing [sent. 1732 len. 12]: Plainly it was time for someone to say : `` Gentlemen !
Parsing [sent. 1733 len. 3]: Gentlemen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1734 len. 52]: Julia glanced anxiously through the darkness of the room beyond the open window beside her , to where the light of the library lamp shone upon a door ajar ; and she was the more nervous because Noble , to give the effect of coolness , had lit an Orduma cigarette .
Parsing [sent. 1735 len. 16]: She laughed amiably , as if the two young gentlemen were as amiable as she .
Parsing [sent. 1736 len. 11]: `` I 've thought of something , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1737 len. 23]: `` Let 's take the settee and some chairs down on the lawn where we can sit and see the moon . ''
Parsing [sent. 1738 len. 11]: `` There is n't any , '' Noble remarked vacantly .
Parsing [sent. 1739 len. 12]: `` Let 's go , anyhow , '' she said cheerily .
Parsing [sent. 1740 len. 5]: `` Come on . ''
Parsing [sent. 1741 len. 18]: Her purpose was effected ; the belligerents were diverted , and Noble lifted the light wicker settee .
Parsing [sent. 1742 len. 10]: `` I 'll carry this , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1743 len. 6]: `` It 's no trouble .
Parsing [sent. 1744 len. 17]: Sanders can carry a chair -- I guess he 'd be equal to that much . ''
Parsing [sent. 1745 len. 19]: He stumbled , dropped the settee , and lifted a basket , its contents covered with a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 1746 len. 12]: `` Somebody must have -- '' `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1747 len. 10]: `` It 's a basket , '' said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1748 len. 5]: `` How curious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1749 len. 6]: Julia peered through the darkness .
Parsing [sent. 1750 len. 15]: `` I wonder who could have left that market basket out _ here _ .
Parsing [sent. 1751 len. 7]: I suppose -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 1752 len. 21]: `` Our cook does do more idiotic things than -- I 'll go ask her if it 's ours . ''
Parsing [sent. 1753 len. 27]: She stepped quickly into the house , leaving two concentrations of inimical silence behind her , but she returned almost immediately , followed by Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 1754 len. 16]: `` It 's no use to argue , '' Julia was saying as they came .
Parsing [sent. 1755 len. 37]: `` You did your marketing and simply and plainly left it out there because you were too shiftless to -- '' `` No 'm , '' Mrs. Silver protested in a high voice of defensive complaint .
Parsing [sent. 1756 len. 22]: `` No 'm , Miss Julia , I ain ' lef no baskit on _ no _ front po ` che !
Parsing [sent. 1757 len. 45]: I got jus ' th ` ee markit baskits in the livin ' worl ' an ' they ev ' y las ' one an ' all sittin ' right where I kin lay my han 's on 'em behime my back do ' .
Parsing [sent. 1758 len. 43]: No 'm , Miss Julia , I take my solemn oaf I ain ' lef no -- '' But here she debouched upon the porch , and in spite of the darkness perceived herself to be in the presence of distinguished callers .
Parsing [sent. 1759 len. 41]: `` Pahdon me , '' she said loftily , her tone altering at once , `` I beg leaf to insis ' I better take thishere baskit back to my kitchen an ' see whut-all 's insiden of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1760 len. 20]: With an elegant gesture she received the basket from Noble Dill and took the handle over her ample forearm .
Parsing [sent. 1761 len. 4]: `` Hum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1762 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 1763 len. 11]: `` Thishere ole basket kine o ' heavy , too .
Parsing [sent. 1764 len. 12]: I wunner whut-all she _ is _ got in her ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1765 len. 11]: And she groped within the basket , beneath the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 1766 len. 42]: Now , it was the breath of Kitty Silver 's life to linger , when she could , in a high atmosphere ; and she was a powerful gossip , exorbitantly interested in her young mistress 's affairs and all callers .
Parsing [sent. 1767 len. 24]: Therefore it was beyond her not to seize upon any excuse that might detain her for any time whatever in her present surroundings .
Parsing [sent. 1768 len. 8]: `` Pusserve jugs , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1769 len. 5]: `` Pusserve or pickle .
Parsing [sent. 1770 len. 6]: Cai n't tell which . ''
Parsing [sent. 1771 len. 15]: `` You can in the kitchen , '' Julia said , with pointed suggestion .
Parsing [sent. 1772 len. 11]: `` Of course you ca n't in the dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 1773 len. 14]: But still Mrs. Silver snatched at the fleeting moment and did not go .
Parsing [sent. 1774 len. 15]: `` Tell by smellin ' 'em , '' she murmured , seemingly to herself .
Parsing [sent. 1775 len. 21]: With ease she unscrewed the top of one of the jars ; then held the open jar to her nose .
Parsing [sent. 1776 len. 15]: `` Do n't smell to me exackly like no pusserves , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 1777 len. 7]: `` Nor yit like no pickles .
Parsing [sent. 1778 len. 36]: Do n't smell to me -- '' She hesitated , sniffed the jar again , and then inquired in a voice quickly grown anxious : `` Whut _ is _ all thishere in thishere jug ?
Parsing [sent. 1779 len. 22]: Seem like to _ me _ -- '' But here she interrupted herself to utter a muffled exclamation , not coherent .
Parsing [sent. 1780 len. 17]: Instantly she added some words suitable to religious observances , but in a voice of passion .
Parsing [sent. 1781 len. 39]: At the same time , with a fine gesture , she hurled the jar and the basket from her , and both came in contact with the wall , not far away , with a sound of breakage .
Parsing [sent. 1782 len. 9]: `` Why , what -- '' Julia began .
Parsing [sent. 1783 len. 9]: `` Kitty Silver , are you crazy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1784 len. 29]: But Kitty Silver was moving hurriedly toward the open front door , where appeared , at that moment , Mr. Atwater in his most irascible state of peculiarity .
Parsing [sent. 1785 len. 39]: He began : `` What was that heathenish -- '' Shouting , Mrs. Silver jostled by him , and , though she disappeared into the house , a trail of calamitous uproar marked her passage to the kitchen .
Parsing [sent. 1786 len. 7]: `` What thing has happened ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1787 len. 4]: Mr. Atwater demanded .
Parsing [sent. 1788 len. 6]: `` Is she -- ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1789 len. 6]: His daughter interrupted him . ''
Parsing [sent. 1790 len. 5]: _ Oh _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1791 len. 20]: was all she said , and sped by him like a bit of blown thistledown , into the house .
Parsing [sent. 1792 len. 26]: He grasped at her as she passed him ; then suddenly he made other gestures , and , like Kitty Silver , used Jacobean phrases .
Parsing [sent. 1793 len. 51]: But now there were no auditors , for Noble Dill and Newland Sanders , after thoughtlessly following a mutual and natural impulse to step over and examine the fallen basket , had both gone out to the street , where they lingered a while , then decided to go home .
Parsing [sent. 1794 len. 24]: ... Later , that evening , Florence and Herbert remembered the c ` lection ; so they came for it , a mistake .
Parsing [sent. 1795 len. 28]: Discovering the fragments upon the veranda , they made the much more important mistake of entering the house to demand an explanation , which they received immediately .
Parsing [sent. 1796 len. 17]: It was delivered with so much vigour , indeed , that Florence was surprised and hurt .
Parsing [sent. 1797 len. 61]: And yet , the most important of her dreamy wishes of the afternoon had been fulfilled : the c ` lection had been useful to Noble Dill , for Mr. Atwater had smelled the smell of an Orduma cigarette and was just on the point of coming out to say some harsh things , when the c ` lection interfered .
Parsing [sent. 1798 len. 60]: And as Florence was really responsible for its having been in a position to interfere , so to say , she had actually in a manner protected her protégé and also shown some of that power of which she had boasted when she told him that sometimes she made members of her family `` step around pretty lively . ''
Parsing [sent. 1799 len. 15]: Another of her wishes appeared to be on the way to fulfilment , too .
Parsing [sent. 1800 len. 36]: She had hoped that something memorable might be done with the c ` lection , and the interview with her grandfather , her Aunt Julia , and Kitty Silver seemed to leave this beyond doubt .
Parsing [sent. 1801 len. 45]: CHAPTER TEN Now August came , that florid lazy month when mid-summer dawdles along in trailing greeneries , and the day is like some jocund pagan , all flushed and asleep , with dripping beard rosy in a wine bowl of fat vine leaves .
Parsing [sent. 1802 len. 27]: Yet , in this languorous time there may befall a brisker night , cool and lively as an intrusive boy -- a night made for dancing .
Parsing [sent. 1803 len. 29]: On such a night a hasty thought might put it as desirable that all the world should be twenty-two years old and in love , like Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 1804 len. 51]: Upon the white bed in his room , as he dressed , lay the flat black silhouettes of his short evening coat and trousers , side by side , trim from new pressing ; and whenever he looked at them Noble felt rich , tall , distinguished , and dramatic .
Parsing [sent. 1805 len. 25]: It is a mistake , as most literary legends are mistakes , to assume that girls are the only people subject to before-the-party exhilaration .
Parsing [sent. 1806 len. 62]: At such times a girl is often in the anxious yet determined mood of a runner before a foot race , or she may be merely hopeful ; some are merry and some are grim , but arithmetical calculation of some sort , whether glorious or uneasy , is busy in their eyes as they pin and pat before their mirrors .
Parsing [sent. 1807 len. 16]: To behold romance gone light-headed , turn to the humbler sort of man-creature under twenty-three .
Parsing [sent. 1808 len. 32]: Alone in his room , he may enact for you scenes of flowery grace and most capricious gallantry , rehearsals as unconscious as the curtsies of field daisies in a breeze .
Parsing [sent. 1809 len. 37]: He has neither doubt nor certainty of his charm ; he has no arithmetic at all , and is often so free of calculation that he does not even pull down the shades at his windows .
Parsing [sent. 1810 len. 35]: Unfortunately for the neighbours , and even for passers-by , since Noble 's room had a window visible from the street , his prophetic mother had closed his shutters before he began to dress .
Parsing [sent. 1811 len. 47]: Thus she deprived honest folk of what surely must have been to them the innocent pleasure of seeing a very young man in light but complete underwear , lifting from his head a Panama hat , new that day , in a series of courteous salutations .
Parsing [sent. 1812 len. 42]: At times , during this same stage of his toilet , they might have had even more entertainment : -- before putting on his socks Noble `` one-stepped '' for several minutes , still retaining upon his head the new hat .
Parsing [sent. 1813 len. 36]: This was a hat of double value to him ; not only was it pleasant to behold in his mirror , but it was engaged in solidifying for the evening the arrangement of his hair .
Parsing [sent. 1814 len. 18]: It may be admitted that he was a little giddy , for the dance was Julia 's .
Parsing [sent. 1815 len. 48]: Mr. Atwater had been summoned to New York on a blessed business that would keep him a fortnight , and his daughter , alert to the first flash of opportunity , had almost instantly summoned musicians , florists , a caterer , and set plans before them .
Parsing [sent. 1816 len. 42]: Coincidentally , Noble had chanced to see Mr. Atwater driving down Julia 's Street that morning , a travelling bag beside him , and , immediately putting aside for the day all business cares , hurried to the traveller 's house .
Parsing [sent. 1817 len. 32]: Thus he forestalled , for the time being , that competition which helped to make caring for Julia so continuous a strain upon whatever organ is the seat of the anxieties .
Parsing [sent. 1818 len. 56]: Kind Julia , busy as she was , agreed to dance the first dance with him , and the last -- those being considered of such significance that he would be entitled to the perquisites of a special cavalier ; for instance , a seat beside her during the serving of the customary light repast .
Parsing [sent. 1819 len. 16]: In such high fortune , no wonder he was a little giddy as he dressed !
Parsing [sent. 1820 len. 17]: The process of clothing himself was disconnected , being broken by various enacted fancies and interludes .
Parsing [sent. 1821 len. 39]: Having approached the length of one sock toward the completion of his toilet , he absently dropped the other upon the floor , and danced again ; his expression and attitude signifying that he clasped a revered partner .
Parsing [sent. 1822 len. 35]: Releasing her from this respectful confinement , he offered the invisible lady a gracious arm and walked up and down the room with a stateliness tempered to rhythm , a cakewalk of strange refinement .
Parsing [sent. 1823 len. 30]: Phrases seemed to be running in his head , impromptus symbolic of the touching and romantic , for he spoke them half aloud hi a wistful yet uplifted manner .
Parsing [sent. 1824 len. 6]: `` Oh , years ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1825 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 1826 len. 14]: `` Oh , years so fair ; oh , night so rare ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1827 len. 21]: Then he added , in a deeper voice : `` For life is but a golden dream so sweetly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1828 len. 59]: Other whimsies came forth from him as the dressing slowly continued , though one might easily be at fault in attempting to fathom what was his thought when , during the passage of his right foot through the corresponding leg of his trousers , he exclaimed commandingly : `` Now , Jocko , for the stirrup cup ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1829 len. 9]: Jack boots and a faithful squire , probably .
Parsing [sent. 1830 len. 33]: During the long and dreamy session with his neck gear he went back to the softer _ motif _ : `` Oh , years so fair ; oh , night so rare !
Parsing [sent. 1831 len. 11]: For life is but a golden dream so sweetly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1832 len. 35]: Then , pausing abruptly to look at his coat , so smoothly folded upon the bed , he addressed it : `` O noblest sample of the tailor 's dext ` rous art ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1833 len. 25]: This was too much courtesy , for the coat was `` ready-made , '' and looked nobler upon the bed than upon its owner .
Parsing [sent. 1834 len. 57]: In fact , it was by no means a dext ` rous sample ; but evidently Noble believed in it with a high and satisfying faith ; and he repeated his compliment to it as he put it on : `` Come , noblest sample of the tailor 's art ; I 'll don thee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1835 len. 39]: During these processes he had been repeatedly summoned to descend to the family dinner , and finally his mother came lamenting and called up from the front hall that `` everything '' was `` all getting cold ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1836 len. 48]: But by this time he was on his way , and though he went back to leave his hat in his room , unwilling to confide it to the hat-rack below , he presently made his appearance in the dining-room and took his seat at the table .
Parsing [sent. 1837 len. 38]: This mere sitting , however , appeared to be his whole conception of dining ; he seemed as unaware of his mother 's urging food upon him as if he had been a Noble Dill of waxwork .
Parsing [sent. 1838 len. 18]: Several tunes he lifted a fork and set it down without guiding it to its accustomed destination .
Parsing [sent. 1839 len. 31]: Food was far from his thoughts or desires , and if he really perceived its presence at all , it appeared to him as something vaguely ignoble upon the horizon .
Parsing [sent. 1840 len. 50]: But he was able to partake of coffee ; drank two cups feverishly , his hand visibly unsteady ; and when his mother pointed out this confirmation of many prophecies that cigarettes would ruin him , he asked if anybody had noticed whether or not it was cloudy outdoors .
Parsing [sent. 1841 len. 21]: At that his father looked despondent , for the open windows of the dining-room revealed an evening of fragrant clarity .
Parsing [sent. 1842 len. 30]: `` I see , I see , '' Noble returned pettishly when the fine state of this closely adjacent weather was pointed out to him by his old-maid sister .
Parsing [sent. 1843 len. 10]: `` It would n't be raining , of course .
Parsing [sent. 1844 len. 8]: Not on a night like this . ''
Parsing [sent. 1845 len. 4]: He jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 1846 len. 10]: `` It 's time for me to go . ''
Parsing [sent. 1847 len. 4]: Mrs. Dill laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1848 len. 9]: `` It 's only a little after seven .
Parsing [sent. 1849 len. 10]: Julia wo n't be through her own dinner yet .
Parsing [sent. 1850 len. 21]: You must n't -- '' But with a tremulous smile , Noble shook his head and hurriedly left the room .
Parsing [sent. 1851 len. 33]: He went upstairs for his hat , and while there pinned a geranium blossom upon his lapel , for it may be admitted that in boutonnières his taste was as yet unformed .
Parsing [sent. 1852 len. 34]: Coming down again , he took a stick under his arm and was about to set forth when he noticed a little drift of talcum powder upon one of his patent leather shoes .
Parsing [sent. 1853 len. 40]: After carefully removing this accretion and adding a brighter lustre to the shoe by means of friction against the back of his ankle , he decided to return to his room and brush the affected portion of his trousers .
Parsing [sent. 1854 len. 49]: Here a new reverie arrested him ; he stood with the brush in his hand for some time ; then , not having used it , he dropped it gently upon the bed , lit an Orduma cigarette , descended , and went forth to the quiet street .
Parsing [sent. 1855 len. 53]: As he walked along Julia 's Street toward Julia 's Party , there was something in his mien and look more dramatic than mere sprightliness ; and when he came within sight of the ineffable house and saw its many lights shining before him , he breathed with profundity , half halting .
Parsing [sent. 1856 len. 17]: Again he murmured : `` Oh , years so fair ; oh , night so rare !
Parsing [sent. 1857 len. 11]: For life is but a golden dream so sweetly . ''
Parsing [sent. 1858 len. 6]: At the gate he hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 1859 len. 9]: Perhaps -- perhaps he was a little early .
Parsing [sent. 1860 len. 10]: It might be better to walk round the block .
Parsing [sent. 1861 len. 12]: He executed this parade , and again hesitated at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 1862 len. 24]: He could see into the brightly lighted hall , beyond the open double doors ; and it contained nothing except its usual furniture .
Parsing [sent. 1863 len. 8]: Once more he walked round the block .
Parsing [sent. 1864 len. 9]: The hall was again in the same condition .
Parsing [sent. 1865 len. 5]: Again he went on .
Parsing [sent. 1866 len. 65]: When he had been thrice round the block after that , he discovered human beings in the hall ; they were Florence , in a gala costume , and Florence 's mother , evidently arrived to be assistants at the party , for , with the helpful advice of a coloured manservant , they were arranging some bunches of flowers on two hall tables .
Parsing [sent. 1867 len. 28]: Their leisurely manner somewhat emphasized the air of earliness that hung about the place , and Noble thought it better to continue to walk round the block .
Parsing [sent. 1868 len. 46]: The third time after that , when he completed his circuit , the musicians were just arriving , and their silhouettes , headed by that of the burdened bass fiddler , staggered against the light of the glowing doorway like a fantasia of giant beetles .
Parsing [sent. 1869 len. 21]: Noble felt that it would be better to let them get settled , and therefore walked round the block again .
Parsing [sent. 1870 len. 33]: Not far from the corner above Julia 's , as he passed , a hoarse and unctuous voice , issuing out of an undistinguishable lawn , called his name : `` Noble !
Parsing [sent. 1871 len. 4]: Noble Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1872 len. 42]: And when Noble paused , Julia 's Uncle Joseph came waddling forth from the dimness and rested his monstrous arms upon the top of the fence , where a street light revealed them as shirt-sleeved and equipped with a palm-leaf fan .
Parsing [sent. 1873 len. 11]: `` What _ is _ the matter , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1874 len. 5]: Mr. Atwater inquired earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 1875 len. 4]: `` Matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1876 len. 3]: Noble repeated .
Parsing [sent. 1877 len. 4]: `` Matter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1878 len. 12]: `` We 're kind of upset , '' said Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 1879 len. 44]: `` My wife and I been just sittin ' out here in our front yard , not doing any harm to anybody , and here it 's nine times we 've counted you passing the place -- always going the same way ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1880 len. 12]: He spoke as with complaint , a man with a grievance .
Parsing [sent. 1881 len. 11]: `` It 's kind of ghostlike , '' he added .
Parsing [sent. 1882 len. 18]: `` We 'd give a good deal to know what _ you _ make of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 1883 len. 4]: Noble was nonplussed .
Parsing [sent. 1884 len. 7]: `` Why -- '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 1885 len. 13]: `` Why -- '' `` How do you get _ back _ ?
Parsing [sent. 1886 len. 6]: That 's the mystery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1887 len. 4]: said Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 1888 len. 12]: `` You 're always walkin ' down street and never up .
Parsing [sent. 1889 len. 24]: You know my wife 's never been too strong a woman , Noble , and all this is n't doing her any good .
Parsing [sent. 1890 len. 21]: Besides , we sort of figured out that you ought really to be at Julia 's dance this evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 1891 len. 9]: `` I am , '' said Noble nervously .
Parsing [sent. 1892 len. 10]: `` I mean that 's where I 'm going .
Parsing [sent. 1893 len. 5]: I 'm going there .
Parsing [sent. 1894 len. 6]: I 'm going there . ''
Parsing [sent. 1895 len. 10]: `` That 's what 's upsetting us so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1896 len. 5]: the fat man exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 1897 len. 7]: `` You keep on going there !
Parsing [sent. 1898 len. 23]: Just when we 've decided you must _ be _ there , at last , here you come , going there again .
Parsing [sent. 1899 len. 9]: Well , do n't let me detain you .
Parsing [sent. 1900 len. 30]: But if you do decide to go in , some time , Noble , I 'm afraid you are n't going to be able to do much dancing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1901 len. 14]: Noble , who had begun to walk on , halted in sudden panic .
Parsing [sent. 1902 len. 23]: Did this sinister fear of Mr. Atwater 's mean that , as an uncle , he had heard Julia was suddenly ill ?
Parsing [sent. 1903 len. 7]: `` Why wo n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1904 len. 4]: he asked quickly .
Parsing [sent. 1905 len. 11]: `` Is anything -- '' `` Your poor feet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1906 len. 6]: said Mr. Atwater , withdrawing .
Parsing [sent. 1907 len. 6]: `` Good-night , Noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 1908 len. 37]: The youth went on , somewhat disturbed ; it seemed to him that this uncle , though Julia 's , was either going queer in the head or had chosen a poor occasion to be facetious .
Parsing [sent. 1909 len. 17]: Next time , probably , it would be better to walk round the block below this .
Parsing [sent. 1910 len. 12]: But it was no longer advisable to walk round any block .
Parsing [sent. 1911 len. 45]: When he came to the happy gateway , the tuning of instruments and a fanfare of voices sounded from within the house ; girls in light wraps were fluttering through the hall with young men ; it was `` time for the party ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1912 len. 5]: And Noble went in .
Parsing [sent. 1913 len. 18]: Throughout the accomplishment of the entrance he made , his outside and his inside were directly contradictory .
Parsing [sent. 1914 len. 55]: His inside was almost fluttering : there might have been a nest of nervous young birds in his chest ; but as he went upstairs to the `` gentlemen 's dressing-room , '' to leave his hat and stick , this flopping and scrambling within him was never to be guessed from his outside .
Parsing [sent. 1915 len. 30]: His outside was unsympathetic , even stately ; he greeted his fellow guests with negligent hauteur , while his glance seemed to say : `` Only peasantry here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1916 len. 64]: CHAPTER ELEVEN The stairway was crowded as he descended ; and as he looked down upon the heads and shoulders of the throng below , in Julia 's hall , the thought came to him that since he had the first and last dances and supper engaged with Julia , the hostess , this was almost the next thing to being the host .
Parsing [sent. 1917 len. 15]: It was a pleasing thought , and a slight graciousness now flavoured his salutations .
Parsing [sent. 1918 len. 32]: At the foot of the stairs he became part of the file of young people who were moving into one of the large rooms where Julia stood to `` receive . ''
Parsing [sent. 1919 len. 53]: And then , between two heads before him , he caught a first glimpse of her ; -- and all the young birds fluttering in his chest burst into song ; his heart fainted , his head ballooned , his feet seemed to dangle from him at the ends of two strings .
Parsing [sent. 1920 len. 11]: There glowed sapphire-eyed Julia ; never had she been prettier .
Parsing [sent. 1921 len. 33]: The group closed , shutting out the vision , and he found himself able to dry his brow and get back his breath before moving forward in a cold and aristocratic attitude .
Parsing [sent. 1922 len. 18]: Then he became incapable of any attitude -- he was before her , and she greeted him .
Parsing [sent. 1923 len. 37]: A buzzing of the universe confused him : he would have stood forever , but pressure from behind pushed him on ; and so , enveloped in a scented cloud , he passed into a corner .
Parsing [sent. 1924 len. 34]: He tried to remember what he had said to her , but could not ; perhaps it would have discouraged him to know that all he had said was , `` Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1925 len. 16]: Now there rattled out a challenge of drums ; loud music struck upon the air .
Parsing [sent. 1926 len. 36]: Starting instantly to go to Julia , Noble 's left leg first received the electric impulse and crossed his laggard right ; but he was no pacer , and thus stumbled upon himself and plunged .
Parsing [sent. 1927 len. 32]: Still convulsive , he came headlong before her , and was the only person near who remained unaware that his dispersal of an intervening group had the appearance of extreme unconventionality .
Parsing [sent. 1928 len. 12]: Noble knew nothing except that this was his dance with Her .
Parsing [sent. 1929 len. 6]: Then heaven played with him .
Parsing [sent. 1930 len. 8]: She came close and touched him exquisitely .
Parsing [sent. 1931 len. 19]: She placed a lovely hand upon his shoulder , her other lovely cool hand in one of his .
Parsing [sent. 1932 len. 7]: The air filled with bursting stars .
Parsing [sent. 1933 len. 3]: They danced .
Parsing [sent. 1934 len. 18]: Noble was conscious of her within his clasping arm , but conscious of her as nothing human .
Parsing [sent. 1935 len. 31]: The fluffy white bodice pressed by his hand seemed to be that of some angel doll ; the charming shoulder that sometimes touched his was made of a divine mist .
Parsing [sent. 1936 len. 31]: Only the pretty head , close to his , was actual ; the black-sapphire eyes gave him a little blue-black glance , now and then , and seemed to laugh .
Parsing [sent. 1937 len. 13]: In truth , they did , though Julia 's lips remained demure .
Parsing [sent. 1938 len. 36]: So far as Noble was able to comprehend what he was doing , he was floating rhythmically to a faint , far music ; but he was almost unconscious , especially from the knees down .
Parsing [sent. 1939 len. 32]: But to the eye of observers incapable of perceiving that Noble was floating , it appeared that he was out of step most of the time , and danced rather hoppingly .
Parsing [sent. 1940 len. 34]: However , these mannerisms were no novelty with him , and it can not be denied that girls at dances usually hurried impulsively away to speak to somebody when they saw him coming .
Parsing [sent. 1941 len. 26]: One such creature even went so far as to whisper to Julia now , during a collision : `` How 'd you get caught ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1942 len. 36]: Julia was loyal ; she gave no sign of comprehension , but valiantly swung onward with Noble , bumped and bumping everywhere , in spite of the most extraordinary and graceful dexterity on her part .
Parsing [sent. 1943 len. 19]: `` That 's one reason she 's such a terrible belle , '' a damsel whispered to another .
Parsing [sent. 1944 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1945 len. 25]: `` The way she 'll be just as nice to anybody like Noble Dill as she is to anybody , '' said the first .
Parsing [sent. 1946 len. 21]: `` Look at her now : she wo n't laugh at him a bit , though everybody else is . ''
Parsing [sent. 1947 len. 14]: `` Well , I would n't laugh either , '' said the other .
Parsing [sent. 1948 len. 7]: `` Not in Julia 's position .
Parsing [sent. 1949 len. 9]: I 'd be too busy being afraid . ''
Parsing [sent. 1950 len. 5]: `` What of ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1951 len. 8]: `` Of getting a sprained ankle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1952 len. 13]: It is well that telepathy remains , as a science , lethargic .
Parsing [sent. 1953 len. 42]: Speculation sets before us the prospect of a Life Beyond in which every thought is communicated without the intervention of speech : a state wherein all neighbours and neighbourhoods would promptly be dispersed and few friendships long endure , one fears .
Parsing [sent. 1954 len. 59]: If to Noble Dill 's active consciousness had penetrated merely the things thought about him and his dancing , in this one short period of time before the music for that dance stopped , he might easily have been understood if he had hurried forth , obtained explosives , and blown up the place , himself indeed included .
Parsing [sent. 1955 len. 23]: As matters providentially were in reality , when the music stopped he stood confounded : he thought the dance had just begun .
Parsing [sent. 1956 len. 21]: His mouth remained open until the necessary gestures of articulation intermittently closed it as he said : '' _ Oh !
Parsing [sent. 1957 len. 8]: _ That was _ divine _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1958 len. 4]: Too-gentle Julia agreed .
Parsing [sent. 1959 len. 21]: `` You said I could have part of some in between the first and last , '' he reminded her .
Parsing [sent. 1960 len. 12]: `` Can I have the first part of the next ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1961 len. 3]: She laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1962 len. 6]: `` I 'm afraid not .
Parsing [sent. 1963 len. 30]: The next is Mr. Clairdyce 's and I really _ promised _ him I would n't give _ any _ of his away or let anybody cut in . ''
Parsing [sent. 1964 len. 28]: `` Well , then , '' said Noble , frowning a little , `` would you be willing for me to cut in on the third ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1965 len. 6]: `` I 'm afraid not .
Parsing [sent. 1966 len. 15]: That 's Newland Sanders ' , and I promised him the same thing . ''
Parsing [sent. 1967 len. 9]: `` Well , the one after that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1968 len. 13]: `` No , that one 's Mr. Clairdyce 's , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 1969 len. 7]: `` It _ is _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1970 len. 5]: Noble was greatly disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 1971 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 1972 len. 10]: `` Two that quick with old Baldy Clairdyce ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1973 len. 17]: he exclaimed , raising his voice , but unaware of the fervour with which he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 1974 len. 22]: `` Two with that old -- '' '' _ Sh _ , Noble , '' she said , though she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 1975 len. 26]: `` He is n't really old ; he 's just middle-aged , and only the least bit bald , just enough to be distinguished-looking . ''
Parsing [sent. 1976 len. 14]: `` Well , you know what _ I _ think of him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1977 len. 9]: he returned with a vehemence not moderated . ''
Parsing [sent. 1978 len. 26]: _ I _ do n't think he 's distinguished-looking ; I think he 's simply and plainly a regular old -- '' '' _ Sh !
Parsing [sent. 1979 len. 7]: _ '' Julia warned him again .
Parsing [sent. 1980 len. 15]: `` He 's standing with some people just behind us , '' she added .
Parsing [sent. 1981 len. 22]: `` Well , then , '' said Noble , `` can I cut in on the next one after that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1982 len. 7]: She consulted a surreptitious little card .
Parsing [sent. 1983 len. 18]: `` I 'm afraid you 'll have to wait till quite a little later on , Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1984 len. 8]: That one is poor Mr. Ridgely 's .
Parsing [sent. 1985 len. 22]: I promised him I would n't -- '' `` Then can I cut in on the next one after that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 1986 len. 15]: `` It 's Mr. Clairdyce 's , '' said Julia -- and she blushed .
Parsing [sent. 1987 len. 5]: `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1988 len. 3]: said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 1989 len. 8]: `` Oh , my goodness ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 1990 len. 3]: _ Sh !
Parsing [sent. 1991 len. 27]: _ I 'm afraid people -- '' `` Let 's go out on the porch , '' said Noble , whose manner had suddenly become desperate .
Parsing [sent. 1992 len. 18]: `` Let 's go out and get some air where we can talk this thing over . ''
Parsing [sent. 1993 len. 20]: `` I 'm afraid I 'd better not just now , '' she returned , glancing over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 1994 len. 13]: `` You see , all the people are n't here yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 1995 len. 25]: `` You 've got an aunt here , '' said Noble , `` and a sister-in-law and a little niece : I saw 'em .
Parsing [sent. 1996 len. 21]: They can -- '' `` I 'm afraid I 'd better stay indoors just now , '' she said persuasively .
Parsing [sent. 1997 len. 10]: `` We can talk here just as well . ''
Parsing [sent. 1998 len. 6]: `` We ca n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 1999 len. 4]: he insisted feverishly .
Parsing [sent. 2000 len. 7]: `` We ca n't , Julia !
Parsing [sent. 2001 len. 9]: I 've got something to say , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2002 len. 160]: Julia , you gave me the first dance and the last dance , and of course sitting together at supper , or whatever there is , and you know as well as I do that means it 's just the same as if you were n't giving this party but it was somewhere else and I took you to it , and it 's always understood you _ never _ dance more with anybody else than the one you went with , when you go with that person to a place , because that 's the rights of it ; and other towns it 's just the same way ; they do that way there , just the same as here ; they do that way everywhere , because nobody else has got a right to cut in and dance more with you than the one you go with , when you goes to a place with that one .
Parsing [sent. 2003 len. 25]: Julia , do n't you see that 's the regular way it is , and the only fair way it ought to be ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2004 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2005 len. 10]: `` Were n't you even _ listening _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2006 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 2007 len. 25]: `` Yes , indeed , but -- '' `` Julia , '' he said desperately , `` let 's go out on the porch .
Parsing [sent. 2008 len. 10]: I want to explain just the way I feel .
Parsing [sent. 2009 len. 10]: Let 's go out on the porch , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2010 len. 34]: If we stay here , somebody 's just bound to interrupt us any minute before I can explain the way I -- '' But the prophecy was fulfilled even before it was concluded .
Parsing [sent. 2011 len. 22]: A group of loudly chattering girls and their escorts of the moment bore down upon Julia , and shattered the tête-à-tête .
Parsing [sent. 2012 len. 63]: Dislodged from Julia 's side by a large and eager girl , whom he had hated ever since she was six years old and he five , Noble found himself staggering in a kind of suburb ; for the large girl 's disregard of him , as she shouldered in , was actually physical , and too powerful for him to resist .
Parsing [sent. 2013 len. 60]: She wished to put her coarse arm round Julia 's waist , it appeared , and the whole group burbled and clamoured : the party was _ perfictly _ glorious ; so was the waxed floor ; so was Julia , my _ dear _ , so was the music , the weather , and the din they made !
Parsing [sent. 2014 len. 9]: Noble felt that his rights were being outraged .
Parsing [sent. 2015 len. 30]: Until the next dance began , every moment of her time was legally his -- yet all he could even see of her was the top of her head .
Parsing [sent. 2016 len. 6]: And the minutes were flying .
Parsing [sent. 2017 len. 23]: He stood on tiptoe , thrust his head forward over the large girl 's odious shoulder , and shouted : `` Julia !
Parsing [sent. 2018 len. 9]: Let 's go out on the porch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2019 len. 7]: No one seemed to hear him .
Parsing [sent. 2020 len. 7]: `` Julia -- '' _ Boom !
Parsing [sent. 2021 len. 7]: _ Rackety - _ Boom _ !
Parsing [sent. 2022 len. 14]: The drummer walloped his drums ; a saxophone squawked , and fiddles squealed .
Parsing [sent. 2023 len. 61]: Hereupon appeared a tall authoritative man , at least thirty-two years old , and all swelled up with himself , as interpreted by Noble and several other friends of Julia 's -- though this , according to quite a number of people -LRB- all feminine -RRB- was only another way of saying that he was a person of commanding presence .
Parsing [sent. 2024 len. 40]: He wore a fully developed moustache , an easy smile , clothes offensively knowing ; and his hair began to show that scarcity which Julia felt gave him distinction -- a curious theory , but natural to her age .
Parsing [sent. 2025 len. 48]: What really did give this Clairdyce some air of distinction , however , was the calmness with which he walked through the group that had dislodged Noble Dill , and the assurance with which he put his arm about Julia and swept her away in the dance .
Parsing [sent. 2026 len. 16]: Noble was left alone in the middle of the floor , but not for long .
Parsing [sent. 2027 len. 12]: Couples charged him , and he betook himself to the wall .
Parsing [sent. 2028 len. 10]: The party , for him , was already ruined .
Parsing [sent. 2029 len. 48]: Sometimes , as he stood against the wall , there would be swirled to him , out of all the comminglements of other scents , a faint , faint hint of heliotrope and then Julia would be borne masterfully by , her flying skirts just touching him .
Parsing [sent. 2030 len. 52]: And sometimes , out of the medley of all other sounds , there would reach his ear a little laugh like a run of lightly plucked harp strings , and he would see her shining dark hair above her partner 's shoulder as they swept again near him for an instant .
Parsing [sent. 2031 len. 35]: And always , though she herself might be concealed from him , he could only too painfully mark where she danced : the overtopping head of the tall Clairdyce was never lost to view .
Parsing [sent. 2032 len. 24]: The face on the front part of that disliked head wore continuously a confident smile , which had a bad effect on Noble .
Parsing [sent. 2033 len. 21]: It seemed to him desecration that a man with so gross a smile should be allowed to dance with Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2034 len. 38]: And that she should smile back at her partner , and with such terrible kindness -- as Noble twice saw her smile -- this was like a calamity happening to her white soul without her knowing it .
Parsing [sent. 2035 len. 21]: If she should ever marry that man -- well , it would be the old story : May and December !
Parsing [sent. 2036 len. 24]: Noble shuddered , and the drums , the fiddles , the bass fiddle , and the saxophone seemed to have an evil sound .
Parsing [sent. 2037 len. 44]: When the music stopped he caromed hastily through the room toward Julia , but she was in a thicket of her guests when he arrived , and for several moments Mr. Clairdyce 's broad back kept intervening -- almost intentionally , it seemed .
Parsing [sent. 2038 len. 30]: When Noble tried to place himself in a position to attract Julia 's attention , this back moved , too , and Noble 's nose but pressed black cloth .
Parsing [sent. 2039 len. 21]: And the noise everybody made was so baffling that , in order to be heard , Julia herself was shouting .
Parsing [sent. 2040 len. 23]: Finally Noble contrived to squirm round the obtrusive back , and protruded his strained face among all the flushed and laughing ones .
Parsing [sent. 2041 len. 11]: `` Julia , I got to -- '' he began .
Parsing [sent. 2042 len. 32]: But this was just at the climax of a story that three people were telling at the same time , Julia being one of them , and he received little attention .
Parsing [sent. 2043 len. 33]: `` Julia , '' he said hoarsely ; `` I got something I want to _ tell _ you about -- '' He raised his voice : `` Julia , come on !
Parsing [sent. 2044 len. 11]: Let 's go out on the _ porch _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2045 len. 8]: Nobody even knew that he was there .
Parsing [sent. 2046 len. 28]: Nevertheless , the tall and solid Clairdyce was conscious of him , but only , it proved , as one is conscious of something to rest upon .
Parsing [sent. 2047 len. 37]: His elbow , a little elevated , was at the height of Noble 's shoulder , and this heavy elbow , without its owner 's direct or active cognizance , found for itself a comfortable support .
Parsing [sent. 2048 len. 39]: Then , as the story reached its conclusion , this old Clairdyce joined the general mirth so heartily as to find himself quite overcome , and he allowed most of his weight to depend upon the supported elbow .
Parsing [sent. 2049 len. 5]: Noble sank like feathers .
Parsing [sent. 2050 len. 3]: `` Here !
Parsing [sent. 2051 len. 6]: What you doin ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2052 len. 4]: he said hotly .
Parsing [sent. 2053 len. 13]: `` I 'll thank you to keep off o ' me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2054 len. 29]: Old Baldy recovered his balance without being aware what had threatened it , while his elbow , apparently of its own volition , groped for its former pedestal .
Parsing [sent. 2055 len. 8]: Noble evaded it , and pushed forward .
Parsing [sent. 2056 len. 7]: `` Julia , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2057 len. 29]: `` I _ got _ to say some -- '' But the accursed music began again , and horn-rimmed Newland Sanders already had his arm about her waist .
Parsing [sent. 2058 len. 8]: They disappeared into the ruck of dancers .
Parsing [sent. 2059 len. 7]: `` Well , by George ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2060 len. 3]: said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 2061 len. 15]: `` By George , I 'm goin ' to _ do _ something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2062 len. 15]: CHAPTER TWELVE He went outdoors and smoked Orduma cigarettes , one after the other .
Parsing [sent. 2063 len. 21]: Dances and intermissions succeeded each other but Noble had `` enough of _ that _ , for one while ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2064 len. 4]: So he muttered .
Parsing [sent. 2065 len. 45]: And remembering how Julia had told him that he was killing himself with cigarettes , `` All right , '' he said now , as he bitterly lighted his fifth at the spark of the fourth ; -- `` I hope I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2066 len. 10]: `` Lot o ' difference it 'd make ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2067 len. 27]: he said , as he lighted the eighth of a series that must , all told , have contained nearly as much tobacco as a cigar .
Parsing [sent. 2068 len. 41]: And , leaning back against the trunk of one of the big old walnut trees in the yard , he gazed toward the house , where the open window nearest him splashed with colour like a bright and crowded aquarium .
Parsing [sent. 2069 len. 9]: `` To _ her _ , anyway ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2070 len. 20]: he added , with a slight remorse , remembering that his mother had frequently shown him evidences of affection .
Parsing [sent. 2071 len. 40]: Yes , his mother would care , and his father and sisters would be upset , but Julia -- when the friends of the family were asked to walk by for a last look , would she be one ?
Parsing [sent. 2072 len. 48]: What optimism remained to him presented a sketch of Julia , in black , borne from the room in the arms of girl friends who tried in vain to hush her ; but he was unable to give this more hopeful fragment an air of great reality .
Parsing [sent. 2073 len. 57]: Much more probably , when word came to her that he had smoked himself to death , she would be a bride , dancing at Niagara Falls with her bald old husband -- and she would only laugh and pause to toss a faded rose out of the window , and then go right on dancing .
Parsing [sent. 2074 len. 29]: But perhaps , some day , when tears had taught her the real meaning of life with such a man -- `` You -- _ wow _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2075 len. 3]: Noble jumped .
Parsing [sent. 2076 len. 27]: From the darkness of the yard beside the house there came a grievous howl , distressful to the spinal marrow , a sound of animal pain .
Parsing [sent. 2077 len. 29]: It was repeated even more passionately , and another voice was also heard , one both hoarsely bass and falsetto in the articulation of a single syllable . ''
Parsing [sent. 2078 len. 3]: _ Ouch !
Parsing [sent. 2079 len. 27]: _ '' There were sounds of violent scuffing , and the bass-falsetto voice cried : `` What 's that you _ stuck _ me with ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2080 len. 7]: and another : `` Drag her !
Parsing [sent. 2081 len. 8]: Drag her back by her feet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2082 len. 52]: These alarms came from the almost impenetrable shadows of the small orchard beside the house ; and from the same quarter was heard the repeated contact of a heavy body , seemingly wooden or metallic , with the ground ; but high over this there rose a shrieking : `` Help !
Parsing [sent. 2083 len. 2]: Help !
Parsing [sent. 2084 len. 9]: Oh , _ hay _ - yulp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2085 len. 5]: This voice was girlish .
Parsing [sent. 2086 len. 8]: `` Hay - _ yulp _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2087 len. 33]: Noble dashed into the orchard , and at once fell prostrate upon what seemed a log , but proved to be a large and solidly packed ice-cream freezer lying on its side .
Parsing [sent. 2088 len. 41]: Dark forms scrambled over the fence and vanished , but as Noble got to his feet he was joined by a dim and smallish figure in white -- though more light would have disclosed a pink sash girdling its middle .
Parsing [sent. 2089 len. 14]: It was the figure of Miss Florence Atwater , seething with furious agitations .
Parsing [sent. 2090 len. 5]: `` Vile thieves ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2091 len. 3]: she panted .
Parsing [sent. 2092 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2093 len. 20]: Noble asked , brushing at his knees , while Florence made some really necessary adjustments of her own attire .
Parsing [sent. 2094 len. 6]: `` Who were they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2095 len. 19]: `` It was my own cousin , Herbert , and that nasty little Henry Rooter and their gang .
Parsing [sent. 2096 len. 19]: Herbert thinks he hass to act perfectly horrable all the time , now his voice is changing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2097 len. 8]: said Florence , her emotion not abated .
Parsing [sent. 2098 len. 22]: `` Tried to steal this whole ice-cream freezer off the back porch and sneak it over the fence and eat it !
Parsing [sent. 2099 len. 24]: I stuck a pretty long pin in Herbert and two more of 'em , every bit as far as it would go . ''
Parsing [sent. 2100 len. 17]: And in the extremity of her indignation , she added : `` The dirty robbers ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2101 len. 7]: `` Did they hurt you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2102 len. 10]: `` You bet your life they did n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2103 len. 4]: the child responded .
Parsing [sent. 2104 len. 10]: `` Tried to drag me back to the house !
Parsing [sent. 2105 len. 4]: By the feet !
Parsing [sent. 2106 len. 13]: I guess I gave 'em enough o ' _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2107 len. 46]: Then , tugging the prostrate freezer into an upright position , she exclaimed darkly : `` I expect I gave ole Mister Herbert and some of the others of 'em just a few kicks they wo n't be in such a hurry to forget ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2108 len. 37]: And in spite of his own gloomy condition , Noble was able , upon thinking over matters , to spare some commiseration for Herbert and his friend , that nasty little Henry Rooter and their gang .
Parsing [sent. 2109 len. 9]: They seemed to have been at a disadvantage .
Parsing [sent. 2110 len. 19]: `` I suppose I 'd better carry the freezer back to the kitchen porch , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2111 len. 8]: `` Somebody may want it . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2112 len. 5]: ` Somebody ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2113 len. 3]: Florence exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2114 len. 42]: `` Why , there 's only two of these big freezers , and if I had n't happened to suspeck somep 'n and be layin ' for those vile thieves , half the party would n't get _ any _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2115 len. 71]: And as an afterthought , when Noble had pantingly restored the heavy freezer to its place by the kitchen door , she said : `` Or else they 'd had to have such little saucers of it nobody would of been any way _ like _ satisfied , and prob ` ly all the fam ` ly that 's here assisting would of had to go without any at all .
Parsing [sent. 2116 len. 12]: That 'd ` a ' been the worst of it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2117 len. 43]: She opened the kitchen door , and to those within explained loudly what dangers had been averted , directing that both freezers be placed indoors under guard ; then she rejoined Noble , who was walking slowly back to the front yard .
Parsing [sent. 2118 len. 21]: `` I guess it 's pretty lucky you happened to be hangin ' around out here , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2119 len. 14]: `` I guess that 's about the luckiest thing ever happened to me .
Parsing [sent. 2120 len. 14]: The way it looks to me , I guess you saved my life .
Parsing [sent. 2121 len. 23]: If you had n't chased 'em away , I would n't been a bit surprised if that gang would killed me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2122 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2123 len. 3]: said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 2124 len. 23]: `` They would n't -- '' `` You do n't know 'em like I do , '' the romantic child assured him .
Parsing [sent. 2125 len. 17]: `` I know that gang pretty well , and I would n't been a bit surprised .
Parsing [sent. 2126 len. 6]: I would n't been ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2127 len. 12]: `` But -- '' She tossed her head , signifying recklessness .
Parsing [sent. 2128 len. 24]: `` Guess ` twould n't make much difference to anybody particular , whether they did or not , '' said this strange Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2129 len. 31]: Noble regarded her with astonishment ; they had reached the front yard , and paused under the trees where the darkness was mitigated by the light from the shining windows .
Parsing [sent. 2130 len. 17]: `` Why , you ought n't to talk that way , Florence , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2131 len. 16]: `` Think of your mamma and papa and your -- and your Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2132 len. 6]: She tossed her head again .
Parsing [sent. 2133 len. 3]: `` Pooh !
Parsing [sent. 2134 len. 20]: They 'd all of 'em just say : ` Good ribbons to bad rubbish , ' I guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2135 len. 39]: However , she seemed far from despondent about this ; in fact , she was naturally pleased with her position as a young girl saved from the power of ruffians by a rescuer who was her Very Ideal .
Parsing [sent. 2136 len. 20]: `` I bet if I died , they would n't even have a funeral , '' she said cheerfully .
Parsing [sent. 2137 len. 12]: `` They 'd proba ` ly just leave me lay . ''
Parsing [sent. 2138 len. 20]: The curiosities of the human mind are found not in high adventure : they are everywhere in the commonplace .
Parsing [sent. 2139 len. 28]: Never for a moment did it strike Noble Dill that Florence 's turn to the morbid bore any resemblance to his recent visions of his own funeral .
Parsing [sent. 2140 len. 25]: He failed to perceive that the two phenomena were produced out of the same laboratory jar and were probably largely chemical , at that .
Parsing [sent. 2141 len. 6]: `` Why , Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2142 len. 3]: he exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2143 len. 9]: `` That 's a dreadful way to feel .
Parsing [sent. 2144 len. 12]: I 'm sure your -- your Aunt Julia loves you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2145 len. 16]: `` Oh , well , '' Florence returned lightly ; -- `` maybe she does .
Parsing [sent. 2146 len. 11]: I do n't care whether she does or not . ''
Parsing [sent. 2147 len. 19]: And now she made a deduction , the profundity of which his condition made him unable to perceive .
Parsing [sent. 2148 len. 25]: `` It makes less difference to anybody whether their aunts love 'em or not than whether pretty near anybody else at all does . ''
Parsing [sent. 2149 len. 12]: `` But not your Aunt _ Julia _ '' he urged .
Parsing [sent. 2150 len. 27]: `` Your Aunt _ Julia _ -- '' `` I do n't care whether she does than any other aunt I got , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2151 len. 18]: `` All of 'em 's just aunts , and that 's all there is to it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2152 len. 44]: `` But , Florence , your Aunt _ Julia _ -- '' `` She 's nothin ' in the world but my _ aunt _ , '' Florence insisted , and her emphasis showed that she was trying hard to make him understand .
Parsing [sent. 2153 len. 11]: `` She 's just the same as all of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 2154 len. 19]: I do n't get anything more from her than I do from any the rest of 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 2155 len. 12]: Her auditor was dumfounded , but not by Florence 's morals .
Parsing [sent. 2156 len. 23]: The cold-blooded calculation upon which her family affections seemed to be founded , this aboriginal straightforwardness of hers , passed over him .
Parsing [sent. 2157 len. 22]: What shocked him was her appearing to see Julia as all of a piece with a general lot of ordinary aunts .
Parsing [sent. 2158 len. 32]: Helplessly , he muttered again : `` But your Aunt _ Julia _ -- '' `` There she is now , '' said Florence , pointing to the window nearest them .
Parsing [sent. 2159 len. 33]: `` They 've stopped dancing for a while so 's that ole Mister Clairdyce can get a chance to sing somep ` n. Mamma told me he was goin ' to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2160 len. 33]: Dashing chords sounded from a piano invisible to Noble and his companion ; the windows exhibited groups of deferentially expectant young people ; and then a powerful barytone began a love song .
Parsing [sent. 2161 len. 43]: From the yard the singer could not be seen , but Julia could be : she stood in the demurest attitude ; and no one needed to behold the vocalist to know that the scoundrel was looking pointedly and romantically at her .
Parsing [sent. 2162 len. 20]: `` Dee-urra-face that holds soswee tasmile for me , Wairyew nah tmine how darrrk the worrrl dwooed be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2163 len. 45]: To Noble , suffering at every pore , this was less a song than a bellowing ; and in truth the confident Mr. Clairdyce did `` let his voice out , '' for he was seldom more exhilarated than when he shook the ceiling .
Parsing [sent. 2164 len. 39]: The volume of sound he released upon his climaxes was impressive , and the way he slid up to them had a great effect , not indoors alone , but upon Florence , enraptured out under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2165 len. 15]: `` Oh , is n't it be - _ you _ - tiful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2166 len. 3]: she murmured .
Parsing [sent. 2167 len. 15]: Her humid eyes were fixed upon Noble , who was unconscious of the honour .
Parsing [sent. 2168 len. 16]: Florence was susceptible to anything purporting to be music , and this song moved her .
Parsing [sent. 2169 len. 46]: Throughout its delivery from Mr. Clairdyce 's unseen chest , her large eyes dwelt upon Noble , and it is not at all impossible that she was applying the tender words to him , just as the vehement Clairdyce was patently addressing them to Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2170 len. 48]: On he sang , while Noble , staring glassily at the demure lady , made a picture of himself leaping unexpectedly through the window , striding to the noisy barytone , striking him down , and after stamping on him several times , explaining : `` There !
Parsing [sent. 2171 len. 10]: That 's for your insolence to our hostess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2172 len. 25]: But he did not actually permit himself these solaces ; he only clenched and unclenched his fingers several times , and continued to listen .
Parsing [sent. 2173 len. 21]: `` Geev a-mee yewr ra-smile , The luv va-ligh TIN yew rise , Life cooed not hold a fairrerr paradise .
Parsing [sent. 2174 len. 22]: Geev a-mee the righ to luv va-yew all the wile , My worrlda for AIV-vorr , The sunshigh NUV vyewr-ra-smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2175 len. 26]: The conclusion was thunderous , and as a great noise under such circumstances is an automatic stimulant of enthusiasm , the applause was thunderous too .
Parsing [sent. 2176 len. 13]: Several girls were unable to subdue their outcries of `` Charming ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2177 len. 11]: and '' _ Won _ - derf ` l ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2178 len. 17]: -- not even after Mr. Clairdyce had begun to sing the same song as an encore .
Parsing [sent. 2179 len. 18]: When this was concluded , a sigh , long and deep , was heard under the trees .
Parsing [sent. 2180 len. 5]: It came from Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2181 len. 60]: Her eyes , wanly gleaming , like young oysters in the faint light , were still fixed on Noble ; and there can be little doubt that just now there was at least one person in the world , besides his mother , who saw him in a glamour as something rare , obs , exquisite , and elegant .
Parsing [sent. 2182 len. 20]: `` I think that was the most be - _ you _ - tiful thing I ever heard ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2183 len. 17]: she said ; and then , noting a stir within the house , she became practical .
Parsing [sent. 2184 len. 10]: `` They 're starting refreshments , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2185 len. 16]: `` We better hurry in , Mr. Dill , so 's to get good places .
Parsing [sent. 2186 len. 12]: Thanks to me , there 's plenty to go round . ''
Parsing [sent. 2187 len. 21]: She moved toward the house , but , observing that he did not accompany her , paused and looked back .
Parsing [sent. 2188 len. 14]: `` Are n't you goin ' to come in , Mr. Dill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2189 len. 5]: `` I guess not .
Parsing [sent. 2190 len. 11]: Do n't tell any one I 'm out here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2191 len. 5]: `` I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 2192 len. 17]: But are n't you goin ' to come in for -- '' He shook his head .
Parsing [sent. 2193 len. 15]: `` No , I 'm going to wait out here a while longer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2194 len. 15]: `` But , '' she said , `` it 's _ refreshments _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2195 len. 7]: `` I do n't want any .
Parsing [sent. 2196 len. 13]: I -- I 'm going to smoke some more , instead . ''
Parsing [sent. 2197 len. 14]: She looked at him wistfully , then even more wistfully toward the house .
Parsing [sent. 2198 len. 21]: Evidently she was of a divided mind : her feeling for Noble fought with her feeling for `` refreshments . ''
Parsing [sent. 2199 len. 27]: Such a struggle could not endure for long : a whiff of coffee conjured her nose , and a sound of clinking china witched her ear .
Parsing [sent. 2200 len. 26]: `` Well , '' she said , `` I guess I ought to have some nourishment , '' and betook herself hurriedly into the house .
Parsing [sent. 2201 len. 5]: Noble lit another Orduma .
Parsing [sent. 2202 len. 38]: He would follow the line of conduct he had marked out for himself : he would not take his place by Julia for the supper interval -- perhaps that breach of etiquette would `` show '' her .
Parsing [sent. 2203 len. 34]: He could see her no longer -- she had moved out of range -- but he imagined her , asking everywhere : `` Has n't _ any _ one seen Mr. Dill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2204 len. 59]: And he thought of her as biting her lip nervously , perhaps , and replying absently to sallies and quips -- perhaps even having to run upstairs to her own room to dash something sparkling from her eyes , and , maybe , to look angrily in her glass for an instant and exclaim , `` Fool ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2205 len. 15]: For Julia was proud , and not used to be treated in this way .
Parsing [sent. 2206 len. 51]: He felt the least bit soothed , and , lightly flicking the ash from his Orduma with his little finger , an act indicating some measure of restored composure , he strolled to the other side of the house and brought other fields of vision into view through other windows .
Parsing [sent. 2207 len. 8]: Abruptly his stroll came to an end .
Parsing [sent. 2208 len. 47]: There sat Julia , flushed and joyous , finishing her supper in company with old Baldy Clairdyce , Newland Sanders , George Plum , seven or eight other young gentlemen , and some inconsidered adhering girls -- the horrible barytone sitting closest of all to Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2209 len. 37]: Moreover , upon that very moment the orchestra , in the hall beyond , thought fit to pay the recent vocalist a sickening compliment , and began to play `` The Sunshine of Your Smile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2210 len. 52]: Thereupon , with Julia herself first taking up the air in a dulcet soprano , all of the party , including the people in the other rooms , sang the dreadful song in chorus , the beaming Clairdyce exerting such demoniac power as to be heard tremendously over all other voices .
Parsing [sent. 2211 len. 22]: He had risen for this effort , and to Noble , below the window , everything in his mouth was visible .
Parsing [sent. 2212 len. 19]: The lone listener had a bitter thought , though it was a longing , rather than a thought .
Parsing [sent. 2213 len. 18]: For the first time in his life he wished that he had adopted the profession of dentistry .
Parsing [sent. 2214 len. 23]: `` Geev a-mee the righ to luv va-yew ALL the wile , My worrrlda for AIV-vorr , The sunshigh NUV vyewr-ra-smile ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2215 len. 51]: The musicians swung into dance music ; old Baldy closed the exhibition with an operatic gesture -LRB- for which alone , if for nothing else , at least one watcher thought the showy gentleman deserved hanging -RRB- , and this odious gesture concluded with a seizure of Julia 's hand .
Parsing [sent. 2216 len. 21]: She sprang up eagerly ; he whirled her away , and the whole place fluctuated in the dance once more .
Parsing [sent. 2217 len. 27]: `` Well , now , '' said Noble , between his teeth -- `` now , I _ am _ goin ' to do something ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2218 len. 26]: He turned his back upon that painful house , walked out to the front gate , opened it , passed through , and looked southward .
Parsing [sent. 2219 len. 26]: Not quite two blocks away there shone the lights of a corner drug store , still open to custom though the hour was nearing midnight .
Parsing [sent. 2220 len. 49]: He walked straight to the door of this place , which stood ajar , but paused before entering , and looked long and nervously at the middle-aged proprietor who was unconscious of his regard , and lounged in a chair , drowsily stroking a cat upon his lap .
Parsing [sent. 2221 len. 4]: Noble walked in .
Parsing [sent. 2222 len. 15]: `` Good evening , '' said the proprietor , rising and brushing himself languidly .
Parsing [sent. 2223 len. 9]: `` Cat hairs , '' he said apologetically .
Parsing [sent. 2224 len. 8]: `` Sheddin ' , I reckon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2225 len. 22]: Then , as he went behind the counter , he inquired : `` How 's the party goin ' off ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2226 len. 11]: `` It 's -- it 's -- '' Noble hesitated .
Parsing [sent. 2227 len. 16]: `` I stepped in to -- to -- '' The druggist opened a glass case .
Parsing [sent. 2228 len. 21]: `` Aw right , '' he said , blinking , and tossed upon the counter a package of Orduma cigarettes .
Parsing [sent. 2229 len. 28]: `` Old Atwater 'd have convulsions , I reckon , '' he remarked , `` if he had to lay awake and listen to all that noise .
Parsing [sent. 2230 len. 22]: Price ai n't changed , '' he added , referring humorously to the purchase he mistakenly supposed Noble wished to make .
Parsing [sent. 2231 len. 13]: `` F'teen cents , same as yesterday and the day before . ''
Parsing [sent. 2232 len. 8]: Noble placed the sum upon the counter .
Parsing [sent. 2233 len. 11]: `` I -- I was thinking -- '' He gulped .
Parsing [sent. 2234 len. 4]: `` Huh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2235 len. 20]: said the druggist placidly , for he was too sleepy to perceive the strangeness of his customer 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 2236 len. 39]: Noble lighted an Orduma with an unsteady hand , leaned upon the counter , and inquired in a voice that he strove to make casual : `` Is -- is the soda fountain still running this late ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2237 len. 4]: `` Sure . ''
Parsing [sent. 2238 len. 10]: `` I did n't know , '' said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 2239 len. 22]: `` I suppose you have more calls for soda water than you do for -- for -- for real liquor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2240 len. 4]: The druggist laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2241 len. 29]: `` Funny thing : I reckon we do n't have more 'n half the calls for real liquor than what we used to before we went dry . ''
Parsing [sent. 2242 len. 4]: Noble breathed deeply .
Parsing [sent. 2243 len. 19]: `` I s ` pose you probably sell quite a good deal of it though , at that .
Parsing [sent. 2244 len. 22]: By the glass , I mean -- such as a glass of something kind of strong -- like -- like whiskey .
Parsing [sent. 2245 len. 9]: That is , I sort of supposed so .
Parsing [sent. 2246 len. 12]: I mean I thought I 'd ask you about this . ''
Parsing [sent. 2247 len. 10]: `` No , '' said the druggist , yawning .
Parsing [sent. 2248 len. 14]: `` It never did pay well -- not on this corner , anyhow .
Parsing [sent. 2249 len. 16]: Once there used to be a little money in it , but not much . ''
Parsing [sent. 2250 len. 5]: He roused himself somewhat .
Parsing [sent. 2251 len. 8]: `` Well , it 's about twelve .
Parsing [sent. 2252 len. 13]: Anything you wanted ` cept them Ordumas before I close up ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2253 len. 4]: Noble gulped again .
Parsing [sent. 2254 len. 6]: He had grown pale . ''
Parsing [sent. 2255 len. 18]: _ I _ want -- '' he said abruptly , then his heart seemed to fail him .
Parsing [sent. 2256 len. 15]: `` I want a glass of -- '' Once more he stopped and swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 2257 len. 13]: His shoulders drooped , and he walked across to the soda fountain .
Parsing [sent. 2258 len. 16]: `` Well , '' he said , `` I 'll take a chocolate sundae . ''
Parsing [sent. 2259 len. 36]: The thought of going back to Julia 's party was unendurable , yet a return was necessary on account of his new hat , the abandonment of which he did not for a moment consider .
Parsing [sent. 2260 len. 25]: But about half way , as he walked slowly along , he noticed an old horse-block at the curbstone , and sat down there .
Parsing [sent. 2261 len. 25]: He could hear the music at Julia 's , sometimes loud and close at hand , sometimes seeming to be almost a mile away .
Parsing [sent. 2262 len. 5]: `` All right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2263 len. 9]: he said , so bitter had he grown .
Parsing [sent. 2264 len. 3]: `` Dance !
Parsing [sent. 2265 len. 8]: Go on and _ dance _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2266 len. 39]: ... When finally he reëntered Julia 's gate , he shuffled up the walk , his head drooping , and ascended the steps and crossed the veranda and the threshold of the front door in the same manner .
Parsing [sent. 2267 len. 5]: Julia stood before him .
Parsing [sent. 2268 len. 7]: `` Noble _ Dill _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2269 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2270 len. 30]: As for Noble , his dry throat refused its office ; he felt that he might never be able to speak to Julia again , even if he tried .
Parsing [sent. 2271 len. 12]: `` Where in the world have you been all evening ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2272 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2273 len. 6]: `` Why , Jew-Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2274 len. 3]: he quavered .
Parsing [sent. 2275 len. 10]: `` Did you notice that I was gone ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2276 len. 8]: `` Did I ` notice ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2277 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2278 len. 13]: `` You never came near me all evening after the first dance !
Parsing [sent. 2279 len. 6]: Not even at supper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2280 len. 13]: `` You would n't -- you did n't -- '' he faltered .
Parsing [sent. 2281 len. 23]: `` You would n't do anything all evening except dance with that old Clairdyce and listen to him trying to sing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2282 len. 20]: But Julia would let no one suffer if she could help it ; and she could always help Noble .
Parsing [sent. 2283 len. 14]: She made her eyes mysterious and used a voice of honey and roses .
Parsing [sent. 2284 len. 21]: `` You do n't think I 'd _ rather _ have danced with him , do you , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2285 len. 9]: Immediately sparks seemed to crackle about his head .
Parsing [sent. 2286 len. 3]: He started .
Parsing [sent. 2287 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2288 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2289 len. 24]: The scent of heliotrope enveloped him ; she laughed her silver harp-strings laugh , and lifted her arms toward the dazzled young man .
Parsing [sent. 2290 len. 11]: `` It 's the last dance , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2291 len. 12]: `` Do n't you want to dance it with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2292 len. 54]: Then to the spectators it seemed that Noble Dill went hopping upon a waxed floor and upon Julia 's little slippers ; he was bumped and bumping everywhere ; but in reality he floated in Elysian ether , immeasurably distant from earth , his hand just touching the bodice of an angelic doll .
Parsing [sent. 2293 len. 55]: Then , on his way home , a little later , with his new hat on the back of his head , his stick swinging from his hand , and a semi-fragrant Orduma between his lips , his condition was precisely as sweet as the condition in which he had walked to the party .
Parsing [sent. 2294 len. 62]: No echoes of `` The Sunshine of Your Smile '' cursed his memory -- that lover 's little memory fresh washed in heliotrope -- and when his mother came to his door , after he got home , and asked him if he 'd had `` a nice time at the party , '' he said : `` Just glorious ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2295 len. 4]: and believed it .
Parsing [sent. 2296 len. 66]: CHAPTER THIRTEEN It was a pretty morning , two weeks after Julia 's Dance ; and blue and lavender shadows , frayed with mid-summer sunshine , waggled gayly across the grass beneath the trees of the tiny orchard , but trembled with timidity as they hurried over the abnormal surfaces of Mrs. Silver as she sat upon the steps of the `` back porch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2297 len. 35]: Her right hand held in security one end of a leather leash ; the other end of the leash was fastened to a new collar about the neck of an odd and fascinating dog .
Parsing [sent. 2298 len. 22]: Seated upon the brick walk at her feet , he was regarding her with a gravity that seemed to discomfort her .
Parsing [sent. 2299 len. 20]: She was unable to meet his gaze , and constantly averted her own whenever it furtively descended to his .
Parsing [sent. 2300 len. 21]: In fact , her expression and manner were singular , denoting embarrassment , personal hatred , and a subtle bedazzlement .
Parsing [sent. 2301 len. 17]: She could not look at him , yet could not keep herself from looking at him .
Parsing [sent. 2302 len. 80]: There was something here that arose out of the depths of natural character ; it was intrinsic in the two personalities , that is to say ; and was in addition to the bitterness consequent upon a public experience , just past , which had been brought upon Mrs. Silver partly by the dog 's appearance -LRB- in particular the style and colour of his hair -RRB- and partly by his unprecedented actions in her company upon the highway .
Parsing [sent. 2303 len. 11]: She addressed him angrily , yet with a profound uneasiness .
Parsing [sent. 2304 len. 4]: `` Dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2305 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2306 len. 20]: `` You ai n't feelin ' as skittish as whut you did , li'l while ago , is you ?
Parsing [sent. 2307 len. 3]: My glory !
Parsing [sent. 2308 len. 17]: I dess would like to lay my han ' to you ' hide once , Mister !
Parsing [sent. 2309 len. 25]: I take an ' lam you this livin ' minute if I right sho ' you would n't take an ' bite me . ''
Parsing [sent. 2310 len. 56]: She jerked the leash vindictively , upon which the dog at once `` sat up '' on his haunches , put his forepaws together above his nose , in an attitude of prayer , and looked at her inscrutably from under the great bang of hair that fell like a black chrysanthemum over his forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2311 len. 23]: Beneath this woolly lambrequin his eyes were visible as two garnet sparks of which the coloured woman was only too nervously aware .
Parsing [sent. 2312 len. 3]: She gasped .
Parsing [sent. 2313 len. 21]: `` Look-a-here , dog , who 's went an ' ast you to take an ' pray fer 'em ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2314 len. 6]: He remained motionless and devout .
Parsing [sent. 2315 len. 7]: `` My goo ` niss ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2316 len. 5]: she said to him .
Parsing [sent. 2317 len. 33]: `` If you goin ' keep on thisaway whut you _ is _ been , I 'm goin ' to up an ' go way from here , ri ' now ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2318 len. 7]: Then she said a remarkable thing .
Parsing [sent. 2319 len. 6]: `` Listen here , Mister !
Parsing [sent. 2320 len. 29]: I ain ' never los ' no gran ' child , an ' I ain ' goin ' ` dop ' no stranger fer one , neither ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2321 len. 14]: The explanation rests upon the looks and manners of him whom she addressed .
Parsing [sent. 2322 len. 13]: This dog was of a kind at the top of dog kingdoms .
Parsing [sent. 2323 len. 26]: His size was neither insignificant nor great ; probably his weight would have been between a fourth and a third of a St. Bernard 's .
Parsing [sent. 2324 len. 120]: He had the finest head for adroit thinking that is known among dogs ; and he had an athletic body , the forepart muffled and lost in a mass of corded black fleece , but the rest of him sharply clipped from the chest aft ; and his trim , slim legs were clipped , though tufts were left at his ankles , and at the tip of his short tail , with two upon his hips , like fanciful buttons of an imaginary jacket ; for thus have such dogs been clipped to a fashion proper and comfortable for them ever since -LRB- and no doubt long before -RRB- an Imperial Roman sculptor so chiselled one in bas-relief .
Parsing [sent. 2325 len. 47]: In brief , this dog , who caused Kitty Silver so much disquietude , as she sat upon the back steps at Mr. Atwater 's , belonged to that species of which no Frenchman ever sees a specimen without smiling and murmuring : '' _ Caniche !
Parsing [sent. 2326 len. 17]: _ '' He was that golden-hearted little clown of all the world , a French Poodle .
Parsing [sent. 2327 len. 45]: To arrive at what underlay Mrs. Silver 's declaration that she had never lost a grandchild and had no intention of adopting a stranger in the place of one , it should be first understood that in many respects she was a civilized person .
Parsing [sent. 2328 len. 40]: The quality of savagery , barbarism , or civilization in a tribe may be tested by the relations it characteristically maintains with domestic animals ; and tribes that eat dogs are often inferior to those inclined to ceremonial cannibalism .
Parsing [sent. 2329 len. 31]: Likewise , the civilization , barbarism , or savagery of an individual may be estimated by the same test , which sometimes gives us evidence of sporadic reversions to mud .
Parsing [sent. 2330 len. 22]: Such reversions are the stomach priests : whatever does not minister to their own bodily inwards is a `` parasite . ''
Parsing [sent. 2331 len. 21]: Dogs are `` parasites '' ; they should not live , because to fat and eat them somehow appears uncongenial .
Parsing [sent. 2332 len. 29]: `` Kill Dogs and Feed Pigs , '' they write to the papers , and , with a Velasquez available , would burn it rather than go chilly .
Parsing [sent. 2333 len. 17]: `` Kill dogs , feed pigs , and let _ me _ eat the pigs ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2334 len. 29]: they cry , even under no great stress , these stern economists who have not noticed how wasteful the Creator is proved to be if He made themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2335 len. 9]: They take the strictly intestinal view of life .
Parsing [sent. 2336 len. 14]: It is not intelligent ; parasite bacilli will get them in the end .
Parsing [sent. 2337 len. 7]: Mrs. Silver was not of these .
Parsing [sent. 2338 len. 34]: True , she sometimes professed herself averse to all `` animals , '' but this meant nothing more than her unwillingness to have her work increased by their introduction into the Atwater household .
Parsing [sent. 2339 len. 16]: No ; the appearance of the dog had stirred something queer and fundamental within her .
Parsing [sent. 2340 len. 20]: All coloured people look startled the first time they see a French Poodle , but there is a difference .
Parsing [sent. 2341 len. 18]: Most coloured men do not really worry much about being coloured , but many coloured women do .
Parsing [sent. 2342 len. 42]: In the expression of a coloured man , when he looks at a black and woolly French Poodle , there is something fonder and more indulgent than there is in the expression of a coloured woman when she looks at one .
Parsing [sent. 2343 len. 19]: In fact , when some coloured women see a French Poodle they have the air of being insulted .
Parsing [sent. 2344 len. 26]: Now , when Kitty Silver had first set eyes on this poodle , an hour earlier , she looked , and plainly was , dumfounded .
Parsing [sent. 2345 len. 26]: Never in her life had she seen a creature so black , so incredibly black , or with hair so kinky , so incredibly kinky .
Parsing [sent. 2346 len. 37]: Julia had not observed Mrs. Silver closely nor paused to wonder what thoughts were rousing in her mind , but bade her take the poodle forth for exercise outdoors and keep him strictly upon the leash .
Parsing [sent. 2347 len. 37]: Without protest , though wearing a unique expression , Kitty obeyed ; she walked round the block with this mystifying dog ; and during the promenade had taken place the episode that so upset her nerves .
Parsing [sent. 2348 len. 33]: She had given a little jerk to the leash , speaking sharply to the poodle in reproach for some lingering near a wonderful sidewalk smell , imperceptible to any one except himself .
Parsing [sent. 2349 len. 13]: Instantly the creature rose and walked beside her on his hind legs .
Parsing [sent. 2350 len. 58]: He continued to parade in this manner , rapidly , but nevertheless as if casually , without any apparent inconvenience ; and Mrs. Silver , never having seen a dog do such a thing before , for more than a yard or so , and then only under the pressure of many inducements , was unfavourably impressed .
Parsing [sent. 2351 len. 34]: In fact , she had definitely a symptom of M. Maeterlinck 's awed feeling when he found himself left alone with the talking horses : `` With _ whom _ was she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2352 len. 6]: `` Look-a-here , dog ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2353 len. 4]: she said breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 2354 len. 8]: `` Who you tryin ' to skeer ?
Parsing [sent. 2355 len. 9]: _ You _ ai n't no person ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2356 len. 6]: And then a blow fell .
Parsing [sent. 2357 len. 48]: It came from an elderly but ever undignified woman of her own race , who paused , across the street , and stood teetering from side to side in joyful agitation , as she watched the approach of Mrs. Silver with her woolly little companion beside her .
Parsing [sent. 2358 len. 47]: When this smaller silhouette in ink suddenly walked upright , the observer 's mouth fell open , and there was reason to hope that it might remain so , in silence , especially as several other pedestrians had stopped to watch the poodle 's uncalled-for exhibition .
Parsing [sent. 2359 len. 13]: But all at once the elderly rowdy saw fit to become uproarious .
Parsing [sent. 2360 len. 4]: `` Hoopsee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2361 len. 3]: she shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2362 len. 10]: `` Oooh , _ Gran ` ma _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2363 len. 83]: * * * * * And so , when the poodle `` sat up , '' unbid , to pray , while Kitty Silver rested upon the back steps , on her return from the excursion , she fiercely informed him that she had never lost a grandchild and that she would not adopt a stranger in place of one ; her implication being that he , a stranger , had been suggested for the position and considered himself eligible for it .
Parsing [sent. 2364 len. 10]: He continued to pray , not relaxing a hair .
Parsing [sent. 2365 len. 12]: `` Listen to me , dog , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2366 len. 13]: `` Is you a dog , or is n't you a dog ?
Parsing [sent. 2367 len. 9]: Whut _ is _ you , anyway ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2368 len. 7]: But immediately she withdrew the question .
Parsing [sent. 2369 len. 9]: `` I ai n't astin ' you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2370 len. 4]: she exclaimed superstitiously .
Parsing [sent. 2371 len. 44]: `` If you is n't no dog , do n't you take an ' tell me whut you is : you take an ' keep it to you ` se ` f , 'cause I don ' want to listen to it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2372 len. 27]: For the garnet eyes beneath the great black chrysanthemum indeed seemed to hint that their owner was about to use human language in a human voice .
Parsing [sent. 2373 len. 36]: Instead , however , he appeared to be content with his little exhibition , allowed his forepaws to return to the ground , and looked at her with his head wistfully tilted to one side .
Parsing [sent. 2374 len. 9]: This reassured her and even somewhat won her .
Parsing [sent. 2375 len. 36]: There stirred within her that curious sense of relationship evoked from the first by his suggestive appearance ; fondness was being born , and an admiration that was in a way a form of Narcissism .
Parsing [sent. 2376 len. 14]: She addressed him in a mollified voice : `` Whut you want now ?
Parsing [sent. 2377 len. 22]: Don ' tell me you ' hungry , 'cause you awready done et two dog biskit an ' big saucer milk .
Parsing [sent. 2378 len. 18]: Whut you stick you ' ole black face crossways at _ me _ fer , honey ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2379 len. 16]: But just then the dog rose to look pointedly toward the corner of the house .
Parsing [sent. 2380 len. 9]: `` Somebody 's coming , '' he meant .
Parsing [sent. 2381 len. 10]: `` Who you spectin ' , li'l dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2382 len. 4]: Mrs. Silver inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2383 len. 22]: Florence and Herbert came round the house , Herbert trifling with a tennis ball and carrying a racket under his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2384 len. 6]: Florence was peeling an orange .
Parsing [sent. 2385 len. 7]: `` For Heavenses ' sakes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2386 len. 3]: Florence cried .
Parsing [sent. 2387 len. 14]: `` Kitty Silver , where on earth 'd this dog come from ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2388 len. 8]: `` B'long you ' Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2389 len. 8]: `` When 'd she get him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2390 len. 5]: `` Dess to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2391 len. 8]: `` Who gave him to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2392 len. 8]: `` She ai n't sayin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2393 len. 9]: `` You mean she wo n't tell ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2394 len. 12]: `` She ai n't sayin ' , '' Kitty Silver repeated .
Parsing [sent. 2395 len. 5]: `` I ast her .
Parsing [sent. 2396 len. 34]: I say , I say : ` Miss Julia , ma'am , ' I say , ` Miss Julia , ma'am , who ever sen ' you sech a unlandish-lookin ' dog ? '
Parsing [sent. 2397 len. 3]: I say .
Parsing [sent. 2398 len. 12]: All she say when I ast her : ` Nemmine ! '
Parsing [sent. 2399 len. 6]: she say , dess thataway .
Parsing [sent. 2400 len. 4]: ` Nemmine ! '
Parsing [sent. 2401 len. 3]: she say .
Parsing [sent. 2402 len. 16]: I reckon she ai n't goin ' tell nobody who give her this dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2403 len. 14]: `` He 's certainly a mighty queer-lookin ' dog , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2404 len. 16]: `` I 've seen a few like that , but I ca n't remember where .
Parsing [sent. 2405 len. 9]: What kind is he , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2406 len. 11]: `` Miss Julia tell me he a poogle dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2407 len. 18]: `` A poodle , '' Florence corrected her , and then turned to Herbert in supercilious astonishment .
Parsing [sent. 2408 len. 5]: `` A French Poodle !
Parsing [sent. 2409 len. 3]: My goodness !
Parsing [sent. 2410 len. 22]: I should think you were old enough to know that much , anyway -- goin ' on fourteen years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2411 len. 12]: `` Well , I did know it , '' he declared .
Parsing [sent. 2412 len. 18]: `` I kind of knew it , anyhow ; but I sort of forgot it for once .
Parsing [sent. 2413 len. 11]: Do you know if he bites , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2414 len. 4]: She was noncommittal .
Parsing [sent. 2415 len. 9]: `` He ai n't bit nobody yit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2416 len. 13]: `` I do n't believe he 'll bite , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2417 len. 7]: `` I bet he likes me .
Parsing [sent. 2418 len. 14]: He looks like he was taking a fancy to me , Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2419 len. 6]: What 's his name ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2420 len. 4]: `` Gammire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2421 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2422 len. 4]: `` Gammire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2423 len. 6]: `` What a funny name !
Parsing [sent. 2424 len. 8]: Are you sure , Kitty Silver ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2425 len. 17]: `` Gammire whut you ' Aunt Julia tole _ me _ , '' Mrs. Silver insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2426 len. 21]: `` You kin go on in the house an ' ast her ; she 'll tell you the same . ''
Parsing [sent. 2427 len. 31]: `` Well , anyway , I 'm not afraid of him , '' said Florence ; and she stepped closer to the poodle , extending her hand to caress him .
Parsing [sent. 2428 len. 32]: Then she shouted as the dog , at her gesture , rose to his hind legs , and , as far as the leash permitted , walked forward to meet her .
Parsing [sent. 2429 len. 8]: She flung her arms about him rapturously .
Parsing [sent. 2430 len. 8]: `` Oh , the lovely thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2431 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2432 len. 8]: `` He walks on his hind legs !
Parsing [sent. 2433 len. 9]: Why , he 's crazy about me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2434 len. 9]: `` Let him go , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2435 len. 16]: `` I bet he do n't like you any more than he does anybody else .
Parsing [sent. 2436 len. 20]: Leave go of him , and I bet he shows he likes me better than he does you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2437 len. 12]: But when Florence released him , Gammire caressed them both impartially .
Parsing [sent. 2438 len. 23]: He leaped upon one , then upon the other , and then upon Kitty Silver with a cordiality that almost unseated her .
Parsing [sent. 2439 len. 11]: `` Let him off the leash , '' Florence cried .
Parsing [sent. 2440 len. 13]: `` He wo n't run away , 'cause the gates are shut .
Parsing [sent. 2441 len. 11]: Let him loose and see what he 'll do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2442 len. 21]: Mrs. Silver snapped the catch of the leash , and Gammire departed in the likeness of a ragged black streak .
Parsing [sent. 2443 len. 31]: With his large and eccentric ears flapping back in the wind and his afterpart hunched in , he ran round and round the little orchard like a dog gone wild .
Parsing [sent. 2444 len. 50]: Altogether a comedian , when he heard children shrieking with laughter , he circled the more wildly ; then all upon an unexpected instant came to a dead halt , facing his audience , his nose on the ground between his two forepaws , his hindquarters high and unstooping .
Parsing [sent. 2445 len. 43]: And , seeing they laughed at this , too , he gave them enough of it , then came back to Kitty Silver and sat by her feet , a spiral of pink tongue hanging from a wide-open mouth roofed with black .
Parsing [sent. 2446 len. 8]: Florence resumed the peeling of her orange .
Parsing [sent. 2447 len. 14]: `` Who do you _ think _ gave Gammire to Aunt Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2448 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2449 len. 10]: `` I ai n't stedyin ' about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 2450 len. 12]: `` Yes , but who do you _ guess _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2451 len. 28]: `` I ai n't -- '' `` Well , but if you had to be burned to death or guess somebody , who would you guess ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2452 len. 14]: `` I haf to git burn ' up , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2453 len. 20]: `` Ev ' y las ' caller whut comes here _ is _ give her some doggone animal awready .
Parsing [sent. 2454 len. 154]: Mista Sammerses , he give her them two Berjum cats , an ' ole Mister Ridgways whut los ' his wife , he give you ' Aunt Julia them two canaries that tuck an ' hopped out the cage an ' then out the window , las ' week , one day , when you ' grampaw was alone in the room with 'em ; an ' Mista George Plummers , he give her that Airydale dog you ' grampaw tuck an ' give to the milkman ; an ' Mista Ushers , he give her them two pups whut you ' grampaw tuck an ' skeer off the place soon as he laid eyes on 'em , an ' thishere Mista Clairidge , he give her that ole live allagatuh from Florida whut I foun ' lookin ' at me over the aidge o ' my kitchen sink -- ugly ole thing !

Parsing [sent. 2457 len. 13]: So how anybody goin ' guess who sen ' her thishere Gammire ?
Parsing [sent. 2458 len. 19]: Nobody lef ' whut ai n't awready sen ' her one an ' had the gift spile . ''
Parsing [sent. 2459 len. 10]: `` Yes , there is , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2460 len. 4]: `` Who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2461 len. 5]: `` Noble Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 2462 len. 9]: `` That there li'l young Mista Dills ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2463 len. 4]: Kitty Silver cried .
Parsing [sent. 2464 len. 4]: `` Listen me !
Parsing [sent. 2465 len. 7]: Thishere dog ` spensive dog . ''
Parsing [sent. 2466 len. 16]: `` I do n't care ; I bet Noble Dill gave him to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2467 len. 4]: Mrs. Silver hooted .
Parsing [sent. 2468 len. 4]: `` Go way !
Parsing [sent. 2469 len. 23]: That there young li'l Mista Dills , he ain ' nev ' did show no class , no way nor no time .

Parsing [sent. 2485 len. 11]: `` I do n't care , '' Florence said stubbornly .
Parsing [sent. 2486 len. 48]: `` He could of saved up and saved up , and if he saved up long enough he could of got enough money to buy a dog like Gammire , because you can get money enough for anything if you 're willing to save up long enough .
Parsing [sent. 2487 len. 14]: Anyway , I bet he 's the one gave him to her . ''
Parsing [sent. 2488 len. 7]: Herbert joined Kitty Silver in laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2489 len. 14]: `` Florence is always talkin ' about Noble Dill , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2490 len. 12]: `` She 's sort of crazy , anyway , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 2491 len. 13]: -LSB- Illustration : _ `` Herbert attempted to continue the drowning out .

Parsing [sent. 2495 len. 8]: `` I caught it from my cousins .
Parsing [sent. 2496 len. 31]: Anyhow , I do n't think there 's a single one of any that wants to marry Aunt Julia that 's got the slightest co ` parison to Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 2497 len. 10]: I admire him because he 's so uncouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2498 len. 6]: `` He so who ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2499 len. 4]: Kitty Silver inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2500 len. 4]: `` Uncouth . ''
Parsing [sent. 2501 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm , '' said Mrs. Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2502 len. 11]: `` It 's in the ditchanary , '' Florence explained .
Parsing [sent. 2503 len. 20]: `` It means rare , elegant , exquisite , obs , unknown , and a whole lot else . ''
Parsing [sent. 2504 len. 9]: `` It does not , '' Herbert interposed .
Parsing [sent. 2505 len. 8]: `` It means kind of countrified . ''
Parsing [sent. 2506 len. 14]: `` You go look in the ditchanary , '' his cousin said severely .
Parsing [sent. 2507 len. 18]: `` Then , maybe , you 'll know what you 're talkin ' about just for once .
Parsing [sent. 2508 len. 19]: Anyhow , I _ do _ like Noble Dill , and I bet so does Aunt Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 2509 len. 6]: Kitty Silver shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2510 len. 8]: `` He lose his struggle , honey !
Parsing [sent. 2511 len. 10]: Miss Julia , she out fer the big class .

Parsing [sent. 2514 len. 25]: But thishere young li'l Mista Dills , I kine o ' got strong notion he liable not come no mo ' ` tall ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2515 len. 17]: Her tone had become one of reminiscent amusement , which culminated in a burst of laughter .
Parsing [sent. 2516 len. 4]: `` Whee ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2517 len. 3]: she concluded .
Parsing [sent. 2518 len. 22]: `` After las ' night , I reckon thishere Mista Dills better keep away from the place -- yes 'm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2519 len. 11]: Florence looked thoughtful , and for the time said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 2520 len. 18]: It was Herbert who asked : `` Why 'd Noble Dill better stay away from here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2521 len. 14]: `` You ' grampaw , '' Mrs. Silver said , shaking her head .
Parsing [sent. 2522 len. 6]: `` You ' grampaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2523 len. 6]: `` What about grandpa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2524 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 2525 len. 10]: `` What 'd he do last night ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2526 len. 4]: ` Do ' ?
Parsing [sent. 2527 len. 5]: Oh , me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2528 len. 25]: Then Mrs. Silver uttered sounds like the lowing of kine , whereby she meant to indicate her inability to describe Mr. Atwater 's performance .
Parsing [sent. 2529 len. 34]: `` Well , ma'am , '' she said , in the low and husky voice of simulated exhaustion , `` all I got to say : you ' grampaw beat hisse ` f !

Parsing [sent. 2531 len. 5]: `` How d'you mean ?

Parsing [sent. 2536 len. 6]: `` What started him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2537 len. 8]: `` Whut _ start _ him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2538 len. 7]: Mrs. Silver echoed with sudden loudness .
Parsing [sent. 2539 len. 6]: `` My goo ` niss !
Parsing [sent. 2540 len. 34]: He _ b ` en _ started ev ' since the very firs ' time he ev ' lay eyes on him prancin ' up the front walk to call on Miss Julia .

Parsing [sent. 2542 len. 16]: `` I mean , '' said Herbert , `` what started him last night ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2543 len. 9]: `` Them cigareets , '' said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2544 len. 27]: `` Them cigareets whut thishere Noble Dills smoke whiles he settin ' out on the front po ` che callin ' on you ' Aunt Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2545 len. 10]: You ' grampaw mighty funny man about smellin ' !

Parsing [sent. 2555 len. 19]: She say : ` Smell o ' cigareet dess deligh ` ful li'l smell , ' she say .

Parsing [sent. 2560 len. 5]: Oh , ladies ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2561 len. 7]: `` What 'd he say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2562 len. 4]: Herbert asked eagerly .
Parsing [sent. 2563 len. 14]: `` He di 'n' say nothin ' , '' Mrs. Silver replied eloquently .
Parsing [sent. 2564 len. 5]: `` He hollered . ''
Parsing [sent. 2565 len. 7]: `` What did he holler ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2566 len. 44]: `` He want know di 'n' he never tell her thishere Dills ca n't smoke no mo ' cigareets on his property , an ' di 'n' he tell her he was 'n' goin ' allow him on the place if he did ?
Parsing [sent. 2567 len. 21]: He say she got to go back on the po ` che an ' run thishere li'l Dills off home .
Parsing [sent. 2568 len. 28]: He say he give her fair choice ; she kin run him off , or else he go on out and chase him away hisse ` f .

Parsing [sent. 2570 len. 17]: He say -- '' She was confirmed in this report by an indignant interruption from Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2571 len. 13]: `` That 's just what he did say , the old thing !
Parsing [sent. 2572 len. 35]: I heard him , myself , and if you care to ask _ me _ , I 'll be glad to inform you that I think grandpa 's conduck was simply insulting ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2573 len. 6]: ` Deed it were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2574 len. 4]: said Mrs. Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2575 len. 15]: `` An ' dess whut he claim hisse ' f he mean it fer !
Parsing [sent. 2576 len. 16]: But you tell me , please , how you hear whut you ' grampaw say ?
Parsing [sent. 2577 len. 18]: He mighty noisy , but you nev ' could a-hear him plumb to whur you live . ''
Parsing [sent. 2578 len. 10]: `` I was n't home , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2579 len. 7]: `` I was over here . ''
Parsing [sent. 2580 len. 27]: `` Then you mus ' ` a ' made you ` se ' f mighty skimpish , 'cause _ I _ ai n't seen you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2581 len. 5]: `` Nobody saw me .
Parsing [sent. 2582 len. 19]: I was n't in the house , '' said Florence , `` I was out in front . ''
Parsing [sent. 2583 len. 9]: `` Whurbouts ` out in front ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2584 len. 20]: `` Well , I was sitting on the ground , up against the latticework of the front porch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2585 len. 5]: `` Whut fur ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2586 len. 11]: `` Well , it was dark , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2587 len. 15]: `` I just kind of wanted to see what might be going on . ''
Parsing [sent. 2588 len. 20]: `` An ' you hear all whut you ' grampaw take on about an ' ev ` ything ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2589 len. 6]: `` I should say so !
Parsing [sent. 2590 len. 15]: You could of heard him _ lots _ farther than where I was . ''
Parsing [sent. 2591 len. 8]: `` Lan ' o ' misery ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2592 len. 4]: Kitty Silver cried .
Parsing [sent. 2593 len. 23]: `` If you done hear him whur you was , thishere li'l Dills mus ' a-hear him _ mighty _ plain ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2594 len. 4]: `` He did .
Parsing [sent. 2595 len. 6]: How could he help it ?
Parsing [sent. 2596 len. 47]: He heard every word , and pretty soon he came down off the porch and stood a minute ; then he went on out the gate , and I do n't know whether he went home or not , because it was too dark to see .
Parsing [sent. 2597 len. 8]: But he did n't come back . ''
Parsing [sent. 2598 len. 9]: `` Yo ' right he didn ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2599 len. 4]: exclaimed Mrs. Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2600 len. 15]: `` I reckon he got fo ` thought ` nough fer that , anyhow !
Parsing [sent. 2601 len. 15]: I bet he ai n't nev ' _ goin ' _ come back neither .
Parsing [sent. 2602 len. 17]: You ' grampaw say he goin ' be fix fer him , if he do . ''
Parsing [sent. 2603 len. 16]: `` Yes , that was while he was standing there , '' said Florence ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 2604 len. 9]: `` He heard all that , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 2605 len. 26]: `` Miss Julia , she s ` picion ' he done hear somep 'm ` nother , I guess , '' Kitty Silver went on .
Parsing [sent. 2606 len. 51]: `` She shet the liberry do ' right almos ' on you ' grampaw 's nose , whiles he still a-rampin ' , an ' she slip out on the po ` che , an ' take look ` roun ' ; then go on up to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 2607 len. 28]: I ` uz up there , while after that , turn ' down her bed ; an ' she injoyin ' herse ' f readin ' book .
Parsing [sent. 2608 len. 23]: She feel kine o ' put out , I reckon , but she ai n't stedyin ' about no young li'l Dills .
Parsing [sent. 2609 len. 29]: She want 'em all to have nice time an ' like her , but she goin ' lose this one , an ' she got plenty to spare .
Parsing [sent. 2610 len. 13]: She show too much class fer to fret about no Dills . ''
Parsing [sent. 2611 len. 10]: `` I do n't care , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2612 len. 21]: `` I think she ought to whether she does or not , because I bet he was feeling just awful .
Parsing [sent. 2613 len. 11]: And I think grandpa behaved like an ole hoodlum . ''
Parsing [sent. 2614 len. 11]: `` That 'll do , '' Herbert admonished her sternly .
Parsing [sent. 2615 len. 14]: `` You show some respect for your relations , if you please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2616 len. 14]: But his loyalty to the Atwater family had a bad effect on Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2617 len. 9]: `` Oh , _ will _ I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2618 len. 4]: she returned promptly .
Parsing [sent. 2619 len. 26]: `` Well , then , if you care to inquire _ my _ opinion , I just politely think grandpa ought to be hanged . ''
Parsing [sent. 2620 len. 14]: `` See here -- '' But Florence and Kitty Silver interrupted him simultaneously .
Parsing [sent. 2621 len. 8]: `` Look at _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2622 len. 3]: Florence cried .
Parsing [sent. 2623 len. 5]: `` My name ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2624 len. 4]: exclaimed Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2625 len. 12]: It was the strange taste of Gammire that so excited them .
Parsing [sent. 2626 len. 36]: Florence had peeled her orange and divided it rather fairly into three parts , but the vehemence she exerted in speaking of her grandfather had caused her to drop one of these upon the ground .
Parsing [sent. 2627 len. 18]: Gammire promptly ate it , `` sat up '' and adjusted his paws in prayer for more .
Parsing [sent. 2628 len. 7]: `` Now you listen me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2629 len. 4]: said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2630 len. 28]: `` I ai n't see no dog eat orange in all my days , an ' I ai n't see nobody else whut see dog eat orange !
Parsing [sent. 2631 len. 28]: No , ma'am , an ' I ai n't nev ' hear o ' nobody else whut ev ' see nobody whut see dog eat orange ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2632 len. 7]: Herbert decided to be less impressed .
Parsing [sent. 2633 len. 17]: `` Oh , I 've heard of dogs that 'd eat apples , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2634 len. 11]: `` Yes , and watermelon and nuts and things . ''
Parsing [sent. 2635 len. 24]: As he spoke he played with the tennis ball upon his racket , and concluded by striking the ball high into the air .
Parsing [sent. 2636 len. 29]: Its course was not true ; and it descended far over toward the orchard , where Herbert ran to catch it -- but he was not quick enough .
Parsing [sent. 2637 len. 47]: At the moment the ball left the racket Gammire abandoned his prayers : his eyes , like a careful fielder 's , calculating and estimating , followed the swerve of the ball in the breeze , and when it fell he was on the correct spot .
Parsing [sent. 2638 len. 4]: He caught it .
Parsing [sent. 2639 len. 3]: Herbert shouted .
Parsing [sent. 2640 len. 10]: `` He caught it on the _ fly _ !
Parsing [sent. 2641 len. 7]: It must have been an accident .
Parsing [sent. 2642 len. 13]: Here -- '' And he struck the ball into the air again .
Parsing [sent. 2643 len. 49]: It went high -- twice as high as the house -- and again Gammire `` judged '' it ; continuously shifting his position , his careful eyes never leaving the little white globe , until just before the last instant of its descent he was motionless beneath it .
Parsing [sent. 2644 len. 9]: He caught it again , and Herbert whooped .
Parsing [sent. 2645 len. 15]: Gammire brought the ball to him and invited him to proceed with the game .
Parsing [sent. 2646 len. 25]: That there might be no mistaking his desire , Gammire `` sat up '' and prayed ; nor did he find Herbert anything loth .
Parsing [sent. 2647 len. 30]: Out of nine chances Gammire `` muffed '' the ball only twice , both times excusably , and Florence once more flung her arms about the willing performer . ''
Parsing [sent. 2648 len. 16]: _ Who _ do you s ` pose trained this wonderful , darling doggie ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2649 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2650 len. 7]: Mrs. Silver shook her marvelling head .
Parsing [sent. 2651 len. 16]: `` He mus ' ` a ' _ come _ thataway , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 2652 len. 22]: `` I bet nobody ' t all ain ' train him ; he do whut he want to hisse ` f .
Parsing [sent. 2653 len. 11]: That Gammire don ' ast nobody to train him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2654 len. 6]: `` Oh , goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2655 len. 7]: Florence said , with sudden despondency .
Parsing [sent. 2656 len. 6]: `` It 's awful ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2657 len. 5]: `` Whut is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2658 len. 17]: `` To think of as lovely a dog as this having to face grandpa ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 2659 len. 6]: ` Face ' him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2660 len. 5]: Kitty Silver echoed forebodingly .
Parsing [sent. 2661 len. 16]: `` I reckon you ' grampaw do mo 'n dess ` face ' him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2662 len. 11]: `` That 's what I mean , '' Florence explained .
Parsing [sent. 2663 len. 14]: `` I expect he 's just brute enough to drive him off . ''
Parsing [sent. 2664 len. 9]: `` Yes 'm , '' said Mrs. Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2665 len. 15]: `` He git madder ev ' y time somebody sen ' her new pet .
Parsing [sent. 2666 len. 17]: You ' grampaw mighty nervous man , an ' everlas 'n' ly do hate animals . ''
Parsing [sent. 2667 len. 11]: `` He has n't seen Gammire , has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2668 len. 11]: `` Do n't look like it , do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2669 len. 4]: said Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2670 len. 6]: `` Dog here yit . ''
Parsing [sent. 2671 len. 34]: `` Well , then I -- '' Florence paused , glancing at Herbert , for she had just been visited by a pleasant idea and had no wish to share it with him .
Parsing [sent. 2672 len. 9]: `` Is Aunt Julia in the house ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2673 len. 9]: `` She were , li'l while ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 2674 len. 20]: `` I want to see her about somep 'n I ought to see her about , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2675 len. 10]: `` I 'll be out in a minute . ''
Parsing [sent. 2676 len. 21]: CHAPTER FOURTEEN She ran into the house , and found Julia seated at a slim-legged desk , writing a note .
Parsing [sent. 2677 len. 10]: `` Aunt Julia , it 's about Gammire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2678 len. 4]: `` Gamin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2679 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2680 len. 7]: `` His name is Gamin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2681 len. 10]: `` Kitty Silver says his name 's Gammire . ''
Parsing [sent. 2682 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2683 len. 4]: `` She would .
Parsing [sent. 2684 len. 7]: His name is Gamin , though .
Parsing [sent. 2685 len. 14]: He 's a little Parisian rascal , and his name is Gamin . ''
Parsing [sent. 2686 len. 13]: `` Well , Aunt Julia , I 'd rather call him Gammire .
Parsing [sent. 2687 len. 7]: How much did he cost ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2688 len. 23]: `` I do n't know ; he was brought to me only this morning , and I have n't asked yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2689 len. 11]: `` But I thought somebody gave him to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 2690 len. 7]: `` Yes ; somebody did . ''
Parsing [sent. 2691 len. 26]: `` Well , I mean , '' said Florence , `` how much did the person that gave him to you pay for him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2692 len. 3]: Julia sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2693 len. 15]: `` I just explained , I have n't had a chance to ask . ''
Parsing [sent. 2694 len. 4]: Florence looked hurt .
Parsing [sent. 2695 len. 14]: `` I do n't mean you _ would _ ask 'em right out .
Parsing [sent. 2696 len. 28]: I just meant : Would n't you be liable to kind of hint around an ' give 'em a chance to tell you how much it was ?
Parsing [sent. 2697 len. 41]: You know perfeckly well it 's the way most the fam ` ly do when they give each other somep 'n pretty expensive , Christmas or birthdays , and I thought proba ` ly you 'd -- '' `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2698 len. 22]: I should n't be surprised , Florence , if nobody _ ever _ got to know how much Gamin cost . ''
Parsing [sent. 2699 len. 18]: `` Well -- '' Florence said , and decided to approach her purpose on a new tack .
Parsing [sent. 2700 len. 8]: `` Who was it trained him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2701 len. 36]: `` I understand that the person who gave him to me has played with him at times during the few days he 's been keeping him , but has n't ` trained ' him particularly .
Parsing [sent. 2702 len. 14]: French Poodles almost learn their own tricks if you give them a chance .
Parsing [sent. 2703 len. 18]: It 's natural to them ; they love to be little clowns if you let them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2704 len. 13]: `` But who was this person that gave him to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2705 len. 3]: Julia laughed .
Parsing [sent. 2706 len. 14]: `` It 's a secret , Florence -- like Gamin 's price . ''
Parsing [sent. 2707 len. 6]: At this Florence looked piqued .
Parsing [sent. 2708 len. 13]: `` Well , I guess I got _ some _ manners ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2709 len. 3]: she exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2710 len. 36]: `` I know as well as you do , Aunt Julia , there 's no etiquette in coming right square out and asking how much it was when somebody goes and makes you a present .
Parsing [sent. 2711 len. 19]: I 'm certainly enough of a lady to keep my mouth shut when it 's more polite to !
Parsing [sent. 2712 len. 21]: But I do n't see what harm there is in telling who it is that gives anybody a present . ''
Parsing [sent. 2713 len. 18]: `` No harm at all , '' Julia murmured as she sealed the note she had written .
Parsing [sent. 2714 len. 9]: Then she turned smilingly to face her niece .
Parsing [sent. 2715 len. 9]: `` Only I 'm not going to . ''
Parsing [sent. 2716 len. 42]: `` Well , then , Aunt Julia '' -- and now Florence came to her point -- `` what I wanted to know is just simply the plain and simple question : Will you give this dog Gammire to me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2717 len. 19]: Julia leaned forward , laughing , and suddenly clapped her hands together , close to Florence 's face .
Parsing [sent. 2718 len. 8]: `` No , I wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2719 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2720 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2721 len. 12]: The niece frowned , lines of anxiety appearing upon her forehead .
Parsing [sent. 2722 len. 9]: `` Well , why wo n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2723 len. 8]: `` I wo n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2724 len. 13]: `` But , Aunt Julia , I think you ought to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2725 len. 7]: `` Why ought I to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2726 len. 7]: `` Because -- '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2727 len. 8]: `` Well , it 's necessary . ''
Parsing [sent. 2728 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2729 len. 18]: `` Because you know as well as I do what 's bound to happen to him ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2730 len. 5]: `` What is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2731 len. 11]: `` Grandpa 'll chase him off , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 2732 len. 38]: `` He 'll take after him the minute he lays eyes on him , and scare him to death -- and then he 'll get lost , and he wo n't be _ anybody 's _ dog !
Parsing [sent. 2733 len. 37]: I should think you 'd just as lief he 'd be my dog as have him chased all over town till a street car hits him or somep ` n. '' But Julia shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2734 len. 8]: `` That has n't happened yet . ''
Parsing [sent. 2735 len. 19]: `` It _ did _ happen with every other one you ever had , '' Florence urged plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 2736 len. 17]: `` He chased 'em every last one off the place , and they never came back .
Parsing [sent. 2737 len. 30]: You know perfectly well , Aunt Julia , grandpa 's just bound to hate this dog , and you know just exactly how he 'll act about him . ''
Parsing [sent. 2738 len. 11]: `` No , I do n't , '' said Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2739 len. 8]: `` Not just _ exactly _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 2740 len. 13]: `` Well , anyway , you know he 'll behave awful . ''
Parsing [sent. 2741 len. 10]: `` It 's probable , '' the aunt admitted .
Parsing [sent. 2742 len. 9]: `` He always does , '' Florence continued .
Parsing [sent. 2743 len. 11]: `` He behaves awful about everything I ever heard about .
Parsing [sent. 2744 len. 28]: He -- '' `` I 'll go pretty far with you , Florence , '' Julia interposed , `` but we 'd better leave him a loophole .
Parsing [sent. 2745 len. 18]: You know he 's a constant attendant at church and contributes liberally to many good causes . ''
Parsing [sent. 2746 len. 9]: `` Oh , you know what I mean !
Parsing [sent. 2747 len. 10]: I mean he always acts horrable about anything pleasant .
Parsing [sent. 2748 len. 26]: Of course I know he 's a _ good _ man , and everything ; I just mean the way he behaves is perfeckly disgusting .
Parsing [sent. 2749 len. 13]: So what 's the use your not givin ' me this dog ?
Parsing [sent. 2750 len. 21]: You wo n't have him yourself as soon as grandpa comes home to lunch in an hour or so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2751 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , I will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2752 len. 12]: `` Grandpa has n't already seen him , has he ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2753 len. 4]: `` No . ''
Parsing [sent. 2754 len. 17]: `` Then what makes you say -- '' `` He is n't coming home to lunch .
Parsing [sent. 2755 len. 12]: He wo n't be home till five o'clock this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 2756 len. 32]: `` Well , then , about six you wo n't have any dog , and poor little Gammire 'll get run over by an automobile some time this very evening ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2757 len. 12]: Florence 's voice became anguished in the stress of her appeal .
Parsing [sent. 2758 len. 15]: `` Aunt Julia , _ wo n't _ you give me this dog ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2759 len. 5]: Julia shook her head .
Parsing [sent. 2760 len. 10]: `` Wo n't you , _ please _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2761 len. 6]: `` No , dear . ''
Parsing [sent. 2762 len. 19]: `` Aunt Julia , if it was Noble Dill gave you this dog -- '' `` Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2763 len. 4]: her aunt exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 2764 len. 12]: `` What in the world makes you imagine such absurd things ?
Parsing [sent. 2765 len. 5]: Poor Mr. Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2766 len. 42]: `` Well , if it was , I think you ought to give Gammire to me because I _ like _ Noble Dill , and I -- '' But here her aunt laughed again and looked at her with some curiosity .
Parsing [sent. 2767 len. 6]: `` You still do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2768 len. 3]: she asked .
Parsing [sent. 2769 len. 5]: `` What for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2770 len. 39]: `` Well , '' said Florence , swallowing , `` he may be rather smallish for a man , but he 's very uncouth and distingrished-looking , and I think he does n't get to enjoy himself much .
Parsing [sent. 2771 len. 49]: Grandpa talks about him so torrably and -- and -- '' Here , such was the unexpected depth of her feeling that she choked , whereupon her aunt , overcome with laughter , but nevertheless somewhat touched , sprang up and threw two pretty arms about her charmingly .
Parsing [sent. 2772 len. 8]: `` You _ funny _ Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2773 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 2774 len. 9]: `` Then will you give me Gammire ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2775 len. 4]: Florence asked instantly .
Parsing [sent. 2776 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 2777 len. 17]: We 'll bring him in the house now , and you can stay for lunch . ''
Parsing [sent. 2778 len. 16]: Florence was imperfectly consoled , but she had a thought that brightened her a little .
Parsing [sent. 2779 len. 26]: `` Well , there 'll be an awful time when grandpa comes home this afternoon -- but it certainly will be inter ` sting ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2780 len. 39]: She proved a true prophet , at least to the extent that when Mr. Atwater opened his front gate that afternoon he was already in the presence of a deeply interested audience whose observation was unknown to him .
Parsing [sent. 2781 len. 58]: Through the interstices of the lace curtains at an open window , the gaze of Julia and Florence was concentrated upon him in a manner that might have disquieted even so opinionated and peculiar a man as Mr. Atwater , had he been aware of it ; and Herbert likewise watched him fixedly from an unseen outpost .
Parsing [sent. 2782 len. 44]: Herbert had shown some recklessness , declaring loudly that he intended to lounge in full view ; but when the well-known form of the ancestor was actually identified , coming up the street out of the distance , the descendant changed his mind .
Parsing [sent. 2783 len. 15]: The good green earth ceased to seem secure ; and Herbert climbed a tree .
Parsing [sent. 2784 len. 33]: He surrounded himself with the deepest foliage ; and beneath him some outlying foothills of Kitty Silver were visible , where she endeavoured to lurk in the concealment of a lilac bush .
Parsing [sent. 2785 len. 8]: Gammire was the only person in view .
Parsing [sent. 2786 len. 26]: He sat just in the middle of the top step of the veranda , and his air was that of an endowed and settled institution .
Parsing [sent. 2787 len. 42]: What passing traffic there was interested him but vaguely , not affecting the world to which he belonged -- that world being this house and yard , of which he felt himself now , beyond all question , the official dog .
Parsing [sent. 2788 len. 30]: It had been a rather hard-working afternoon , for he had done everything suggested to him as well as a great many other things that he thought of himself .
Parsing [sent. 2789 len. 52]: He had also made it clear that he had taken a fancy to everybody , but recognized Julia to be the head of the house and of his own universe ; and though he was at the disposal of all her family and friends , he was at her disposal first .
Parsing [sent. 2790 len. 15]: Whithersoever she went , there would he go also , unless she otherwise commanded .
Parsing [sent. 2791 len. 20]: Just now she had withdrawn , closing the door , but he understood that she intended no permanent exclusion .
Parsing [sent. 2792 len. 8]: Who was this newcomer at the gate ?
Parsing [sent. 2793 len. 10]: The newcomer came to a halt , staring intolerantly .
Parsing [sent. 2794 len. 10]: Then he advanced , slamming the gate behind him .
Parsing [sent. 2795 len. 8]: `` Get out o ' here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2796 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2797 len. 8]: `` You get off the place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2798 len. 45]: Gammire regarded him seriously , not moving , while Mr. Atwater cast an eye about the lawn , seeming to search for something , and his gaze , thus roving , was arrested by a slight movement of great areas behind a lilac bush .
Parsing [sent. 2799 len. 25]: It appeared that the dome of some public building had covered itself with antique textiles and was endeavouring to hide there -- a failure .
Parsing [sent. 2800 len. 5]: `` Kitty Silver ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2801 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2802 len. 7]: `` What are you doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2803 len. 4]: `` Suh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2804 len. 14]: Debouching sidewise she came into fuller view , but retired a few steps .
Parsing [sent. 2805 len. 11]: `` Whut I doin ' whur , Mista Atwater ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2806 len. 12]: `` How 'd that dog get on my front steps ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2807 len. 6]: Her face became noncommittal entirely .
Parsing [sent. 2808 len. 4]: `` Thishere dog ?
Parsing [sent. 2809 len. 9]: He just settin ' there , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2810 len. 10]: `` How 'd he get in the yard ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2811 len. 12]: `` Mus ' somebody up an ' brung him in . ''
Parsing [sent. 2812 len. 6]: `` Who did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2813 len. 15]: `` You mean : Who up an ' brung him in , suh ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2814 len. 11]: `` I mean : Who does he belong to ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2815 len. 8]: `` Mus ' be Miss Julia 's .
Parsing [sent. 2816 len. 9]: I reckon he is , so fur . ''
Parsing [sent. 2817 len. 3]: `` What !
Parsing [sent. 2818 len. 12]: She knows I do n't allow dogs on the place . ''
Parsing [sent. 2819 len. 4]: `` Yessuh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2820 len. 10]: Mr. Atwater 's expression became more outraged and determined .
Parsing [sent. 2821 len. 32]: `` You mean to say that somebody 's trying to give her another dog after all I 've been through with -- '' `` It look that way , suh . ''
Parsing [sent. 2822 len. 6]: `` Who did it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2823 len. 36]: `` Miss Julia ai n't sayin ' ; an ' me , I don ' know who done it no mo 'n the lilies of the valley whut toil not neither do they spins . ''
Parsing [sent. 2824 len. 24]: In response , Mr. Atwater was guilty of exclamations lacking in courtesy ; and turning again toward Gammire , he waved his arm .
Parsing [sent. 2825 len. 15]: `` Did n't you hear me tell you to get out of here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2826 len. 30]: Gammire observed the gesture , and at once `` sat up , '' placing his forepaws over his nose in prayer , but Mr. Atwater was the more incensed .
Parsing [sent. 2827 len. 12]: `` Get out of here , you woolly black scoundrel ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2828 len. 19]: Mrs. Silver uttered a cry of injury before she perceived that she had mistaken her employer 's intention .
Parsing [sent. 2829 len. 41]: Gammire also appeared to mistake it , for he came down upon the lawn , rose to his full height , on his `` hind legs , '' and in that humanlike posture `` walked '' in a wide circle .
Parsing [sent. 2830 len. 19]: He did this with an affectation of conscientiousness thoroughly hypocritical ; for he really meant to be humorous .
Parsing [sent. 2831 len. 5]: `` My heavens ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2832 len. 6]: Mr. Atwater cried , lamenting .
Parsing [sent. 2833 len. 12]: `` Somebody 's given her one of those things at last !
Parsing [sent. 2834 len. 34]: I do n't like _ any _ kind of dog , but if there 's one dam thing on earth I _ wo n't _ stand , it 's a trick poodle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2835 len. 42]: And while the tactless Gammire went on , `` walking '' a circle round him , Mr. Atwater 's eye furiously searched the borders of the path , the lawn , and otherwheres , for anything that might serve as missile .
Parsing [sent. 2836 len. 31]: He had never kicked a dog , or struck one with his hand , in his life ; he had a theory that it was always better to throw something .
Parsing [sent. 2837 len. 5]: `` Idiot poodle ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2838 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 2839 len. 21]: But Gammire 's tricks were not idiocy in the eyes of Mr. Atwater 's daughter , as she watched them .
Parsing [sent. 2840 len. 93]: They had brought to her mind the tricks of the Jongleur of Notre Dame , who had nothing to offer heaven itself , to mollify heaven 's rulers , except his entertainment of juggling and nonsense ; so that he sang his thin jocosities and played his poor tricks before the sacred figure of the Madonna ; but when the pious would have struck him down for it , she miraculously came to life just long enough to smile on him and show that he was right to offer his absurd best .
Parsing [sent. 2841 len. 39]: And thus , as Julia watched the little Jongleur upon the lawn , she saw this was what he was doing : offering all he knew , hoping that someone might laugh at him , and like him .
Parsing [sent. 2842 len. 46]: And , not curiously , after all , if everything were known , she found herself thinking of another foolish creature , who had nothing in the world to offer anybody , except what came out of the wistfulness of a foolish , loving heart .
Parsing [sent. 2843 len. 44]: Then , though her lips smiled faintly as she thought of Noble Dill , all at once a brightness trembled along the eyelids of the Prettiest Girl in Town , and glimmered over , a moment later , to shine upon her cheek .
Parsing [sent. 2844 len. 6]: `` You get out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2845 len. 13]: Mr. Atwater shouted , `` D'ye hear me , you poodle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2846 len. 11]: He found the missile , a stone of fair diameter .
Parsing [sent. 2847 len. 6]: He hurled it violently . ''
Parsing [sent. 2848 len. 8]: _ There _ , darn you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2849 len. 11]: The stone missed , and Gammire fled desperately after it .
Parsing [sent. 2850 len. 8]: `` You get over that fence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2851 len. 4]: Mr. Atwater cried .
Parsing [sent. 2852 len. 35]: `` You wait till I find another rock and I 'll -- '' He began to search for another stone , but , before he could find one , Gammire returned with the first .
Parsing [sent. 2853 len. 12]: He deposited it upon the ground at Mr. Atwater 's feet .
Parsing [sent. 2854 len. 10]: `` There 's your rock , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2855 len. 19]: Mr. Atwater looked down at him fiercely , and through the black chrysanthemum two garnet sparks glinted waggishly .
Parsing [sent. 2856 len. 27]: `` Did n't you hear me tell you what I 'd do if you did n't get out o ' here , you darn poodle ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2857 len. 16]: Gammire `` sat up , '' placed his forepaws together over his nose and prayed .
Parsing [sent. 2858 len. 10]: `` There 's your rock , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2859 len. 24]: And he added , as clearly as if he used a spoken language , `` Let 's get on with the game ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2860 len. 7]: Mr. Atwater turned to Kitty Silver .
Parsing [sent. 2861 len. 21]: `` Does he -- does he know how to speak , or shake hands , or anything like that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2862 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 2863 len. 31]: * * * * * The next morning , as the peculiar old man sat at breakfast , he said to the lady across the table : `` Look here .
Parsing [sent. 2864 len. 8]: Who did give Gamin to us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2865 len. 12]: Julia bit her lip ; she even cast down her eyes .
Parsing [sent. 2866 len. 8]: `` Well , who was it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2867 len. 5]: Her demureness still increased .
Parsing [sent. 2868 len. 8]: `` It was -- Noble Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 2869 len. 22]: Mr. Atwater was silent ; he looked down and caught a clownish garnet gleam out of a blackness neighbouring his knee .
Parsing [sent. 2870 len. 10]: `` Well , see here , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 2871 len. 20]: `` Why ca n't you -- why ca n't you -- '' `` Why ca n't I what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2872 len. 30]: `` Why ca n't you sit out in the yard the next time he calls here , instead of on the porch where it blows all through the house ?
Parsing [sent. 2873 len. 16]: It 's just as pleasant to sit under the trees , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2874 len. 7]: `` Pleasanter , '' said Julia .
Parsing [sent. 2875 len. 46]: CHAPTER FIFTEEN By the end of October , with the dispersal of foliage that has served all summer long as a screen for whatever small privacy may exist between American neighbours , we begin to perceive the rise of our autumn high tides of gossip .
Parsing [sent. 2876 len. 79]: At this season of the year , in our towns of moderate size and ambition , where apartment houses have not yet condensed and at the same time sequestered the population , one may look over back yard beyond back yard , both up and down the street ; especially if one takes the trouble to sit for an hour or so daily , upon the top of a high fence at about the middle of a block .
Parsing [sent. 2877 len. 68]: Of course an adult who followed such a course would be thought peculiar , no doubt he would be subject to inimical comment ; but boys are considered so inexplicable that they have gathered for themselves many privileges denied their parents and elders , and a boy can do such a thing as this to his full content , without anybody 's thinking about it at all .
Parsing [sent. 2878 len. 51]: So it was that Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Jr. , sat for a considerable time upon such a fence , after school hours , every afternoon of the last week in October ; and only one person particularly observed him or was stimulated to any mental activity by his procedure .
Parsing [sent. 2879 len. 28]: Even at that , this person was affected only because she was Herbert 's relative , of an age sympathetic to his and of a sex antipathetic .
Parsing [sent. 2880 len. 46]: In spite of the fact that Herbert , thus seriously disporting himself on his father 's back fence , attracted only an audience of one -LRB- and she hostile at a rather distant window -RRB- his behaviour might well have been thought piquant by anybody .
Parsing [sent. 2881 len. 21]: After climbing to the top of the fence he would produce from interior pockets a small memorandum-book and a pencil .
Parsing [sent. 2882 len. 37]: His expression was gravely alert , his manner more than businesslike ; yet nobody could have failed to comprehend that he was enjoying himself , especially when his attitude became tenser , as it frequently did .
Parsing [sent. 2883 len. 79]: Then he would rise , balancing himself at adroit ease , his feet one before the other on the inner rail , below the top of the boards , and with eyes dramatically shielded beneath a scoutish palm , he would gaze sternly in the direction of some object or movement that had attracted his attention and then , having satisfied himself of something or other , he would sit and decisively enter a note in his memorandum-book .
Parsing [sent. 2884 len. 50]: He was not always alone ; sometimes he was joined by a friend , male , and , though shorter than Herbert , about as old ; and this companion was inspired , it seemed , by motives precisely similar to those from which sprang Herbert 's own actions .
Parsing [sent. 2885 len. 50]: Like Herbert he would sit upon the top of the high fence ; like Herbert he would rise at intervals , for the better study of something this side the horizon ; then , also like Herbert , he would sit again and write firmly in a little notebook .
Parsing [sent. 2886 len. 25]: And seldom in the history of the world have any such sessions been invested by the participants with so intentional an appearance of importance .
Parsing [sent. 2887 len. 16]: That was what most irritated their lone observer at the somewhat distant upstairs back window .
Parsing [sent. 2888 len. 64]: The important importance of Herbert and his friend was so extreme as to be all too plainly visible across four intervening broad back yards ; in fact , there was sometimes reason to suspect that the two performers were aware of their audience and even of her goaded condition ; and that they deliberately increased the outrageousness of their importance on her account .
Parsing [sent. 2889 len. 30]: And upon the Saturday of that week , when the notebook writers were upon the fence the greater part of the afternoon , Florence 's fascinated indignation became vocal .
Parsing [sent. 2890 len. 5]: `` Vile Things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2891 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 2892 len. 15]: Her mother , sewing beside another window of the room , looked up inquiringly .
Parsing [sent. 2893 len. 7]: `` What are , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2894 len. 11]: `` Cousin Herbert and that nasty little Henry Rooter . ''
Parsing [sent. 2895 len. 8]: `` Are you watching them again ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2896 len. 4]: her mother asked .
Parsing [sent. 2897 len. 31]: `` Yes , I am , '' said Florence ; and added tartly , `` Not because I care to , but merely to amuse myself at their expense . ''
Parsing [sent. 2898 len. 19]: Mrs. Atwater murmured , `` Could n't you find some other way to amuse yourself , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2899 len. 18]: `` I do n't call this amusement , '' the inconsistent girl responded , not without chagrin .
Parsing [sent. 2900 len. 32]: `` Think I 'd spend all my days starin ' at Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Junior , and that nasty little Henry Rooter , and call it _ amusement _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2901 len. 9]: `` Then why do you do it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2902 len. 12]: `` Why do I do _ what _ , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2903 len. 17]: Florence inquired , as in despair of Mrs. Atwater 's ever learning to put things clearly .
Parsing [sent. 2904 len. 13]: `` Why do you ` spend all your days ' watching them ?
Parsing [sent. 2905 len. 20]: You do n't seem able to keep away from the window , and it appears to make you irritable .
Parsing [sent. 2906 len. 28]: I should think if they would n't let you play with them you 'd be too proud -- '' `` Oh , good heavens , mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2907 len. 12]: `` Do n't use such expressions , Florence , please . ''
Parsing [sent. 2908 len. 33]: `` Well , '' said Florence , `` I got to use _ some _ expression when you accuse me of wantin ' to ` play ' with those two vile things !
Parsing [sent. 2909 len. 17]: My goodness mercy , mamma , I do n't want to ` play ' with 'em !
Parsing [sent. 2910 len. 25]: I 'm more than four years old , I guess ; though you do n't ever seem willing to give me credit for it .
Parsing [sent. 2911 len. 31]: I do n't haf to ` play ' all the time , mamma : and anyway , Herbert and that nasty little Henry Rooter are n't playing , either . ''
Parsing [sent. 2912 len. 6]: `` Are n't they ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2913 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater inquired .
Parsing [sent. 2914 len. 40]: `` I thought the other day you said you wanted them to let you play with them at being a newspaper reporter or editor or something like that , and they were rude and told you to go away .
Parsing [sent. 2915 len. 6]: Was n't that it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2916 len. 3]: Florence sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2917 len. 13]: `` No , mamma , it cert ` nly was n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 2918 len. 9]: `` They were n't rude to you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2919 len. 10]: `` Yes , they cert ` nly were ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2920 len. 17]: `` Well , then -- '' `` Mamma , _ ca n't _ you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2921 len. 15]: Florence turned from the window to beseech Mrs. Atwater 's concentration upon the matter .
Parsing [sent. 2922 len. 10]: `` It is n't ' _ playing _ ' !
Parsing [sent. 2923 len. 32]: I did n't want to ` play ' being a reporter ; _ they _ ai n't ` playing ' -- '' '' _ Are n't _ playing , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2924 len. 4]: `` Yes 'm .
Parsing [sent. 2925 len. 4]: They 're not .
Parsing [sent. 2926 len. 14]: Herbert 's got a real printing-press ; Uncle Joseph gave it to him .
Parsing [sent. 2927 len. 16]: It 's a _ real _ one , mamma , ca n't you understand ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2928 len. 10]: `` I 'll try , '' said Mrs. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 2929 len. 13]: `` You must n't get so excited about it , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2930 len. 6]: `` I 'm not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2931 len. 4]: Florence returned vehemently .
Parsing [sent. 2932 len. 23]: `` I guess it 'd take more than those two vile things and their old printing-press to get _ me _ excited !
Parsing [sent. 2933 len. 19]: _ I _ do n't care what they do ; it 's far less than nothing to me !
Parsing [sent. 2934 len. 20]: All _ I _ wish is they 'd fall off the fence and break their vile ole necks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2935 len. 19]: With this manifestation of impersonal calmness , she turned again to the window ; but her mother protested .
Parsing [sent. 2936 len. 21]: `` Do quit watching those foolish boys ; you must n't let them upset you so by their playing . ''
Parsing [sent. 2937 len. 3]: Florence moaned .
Parsing [sent. 2938 len. 11]: `` They do n't ` upset ' me , mamma !
Parsing [sent. 2939 len. 11]: They have no effects on me by the slightest degree !
Parsing [sent. 2940 len. 17]: And I _ told _ you , mamma , they 're not ` playing ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 2941 len. 8]: `` Then what are they doing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2942 len. 9]: `` Well , they 're having a newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 2943 len. 15]: They got the printing-press and an office in Herbert 's stable , and everything .
Parsing [sent. 2944 len. 92]: They got somebody to give 'em some ole banisters and a railing from a house that was torn down somewheres , and then they got it stuck up in the stable loft , so it runs across with a kind of a gate in the middle of these banisters , and on one side is the printing-press and a desk from that nasty little Henry Rooter 's mother 's attic ; and a table and some chairs , and a map on the wall ; and that 's their newspaper office .
Parsing [sent. 2945 len. 43]: They go out and look for what 's the news , and write it down in lead pencil ; and then they go up to their office and write it in ink ; and then they print it for their newspaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 2946 len. 11]: `` But what do they do on the fence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2947 len. 18]: `` That 's where they go to watch what the news is , '' Florence explained morosely .
Parsing [sent. 2948 len. 17]: `` They think they 're so grand , sittin ' up there , pokin ' around !
Parsing [sent. 2949 len. 12]: They go other places , too ; and they ask people .
Parsing [sent. 2950 len. 12]: That 's all they said _ I _ could be ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2951 len. 9]: Here the lady 's bitterness became strongly intensified .
Parsing [sent. 2952 len. 29]: `` They said maybe I could be one o ' the ones they asked if I knew anything , sometimes , if they happened to think of it !
Parsing [sent. 2953 len. 23]: I just respectf ` ly told 'em I 'd decline to wipe my oldest shoes on 'em to save their lives ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2954 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater sighed .
Parsing [sent. 2955 len. 11]: `` You must n't use such expressions , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 2956 len. 14]: `` I do n't see why not , '' the daughter promptly objected .
Parsing [sent. 2957 len. 16]: `` They 're a lot more refined than the expressions they used on me ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2958 len. 14]: `` Then I 'm very glad you did n't play with them . ''
Parsing [sent. 2959 len. 13]: But at this , Florence once more gave way to filial despair .
Parsing [sent. 2960 len. 13]: `` Mamma , you just _ ca n't _ see through anything !
Parsing [sent. 2961 len. 15]: I 've said anyhow fifty times they ai n't -- are n't -- playing !
Parsing [sent. 2962 len. 20]: They 're getting up a _ real _ newspaper , and have people _ buy _ it and everything .
Parsing [sent. 2963 len. 42]: They been all over this part of town and got every aunt and uncle they have besides their own fathers and mothers , and some people in the neighbourhood , and Kitty Silver and two or three other coloured people besides .
Parsing [sent. 2964 len. 34]: They 're going to charge twenty-five cents a year , collect-in-advance because they want the money first ; and even papa gave 'em a quarter last night ; he told me so . ''
Parsing [sent. 2965 len. 14]: `` How often do they intend to publish their paper , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2966 len. 10]: Mrs. Atwater inquired absently , having resumed her sewing .
Parsing [sent. 2967 len. 20]: `` Every week ; and they 're goin ' to have the first one a week from to-day . ''
Parsing [sent. 2968 len. 8]: `` What do they call it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2969 len. 7]: `` The North End Daily Oriole .
Parsing [sent. 2970 len. 18]: It 's the silliest name I ever heard for a newspaper ; and I told 'em so .
Parsing [sent. 2971 len. 15]: I told 'em what _ I _ thought of it , I guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2972 len. 7]: `` Was that the reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2973 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater asked .
Parsing [sent. 2974 len. 9]: `` Was it what reason , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2975 len. 17]: `` Was it the reason they would n't let you be a reporter with them ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2976 len. 4]: `` Poot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2977 len. 5]: Florence exclaimed airily . ''
Parsing [sent. 2978 len. 14]: _ I _ did n't want anything to do with their ole paper .
Parsing [sent. 2979 len. 31]: But anyway I did n't make fun o ' their callin ' it ` The North End Daily Oriole ' till after they said I could n't be in it .
Parsing [sent. 2980 len. 10]: _ Then _ I did , you bet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2981 len. 19]: `` Florence , do n't say -- '' `` Mamma , I got to say somep ` n !
Parsing [sent. 2982 len. 66]: Well , I told 'em I would n't be in their ole paper if they begged me on their bented knees ; and I said if they begged me a thousand years I would n't be in any paper with such a crazy name and I would n't tell 'em any news if I knew the President of the United States had the scarlet fever !
Parsing [sent. 2983 len. 33]: I just politely informed 'em they could say what they liked , if they was dying _ I _ declined so much as wipe the oldest shoes I got on 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2984 len. 16]: `` But why _ would n't _ they let you be on the paper ? ''
Parsing [sent. 2985 len. 4]: her mother insisted .
Parsing [sent. 2986 len. 6]: Upon this Florence became analytical .
Parsing [sent. 2987 len. 11]: `` Just so 's they could act so important . ''
Parsing [sent. 2988 len. 16]: And she added , as a consequence , `` They ought to be arrested ! ''
Parsing [sent. 2989 len. 22]: Mrs. Atwater murmured absently , but forbore to press her inquiry ; and Florence was silent , in a brooding mood .
Parsing [sent. 2990 len. 28]: The journalists upon the fence had disappeared from view , during her conversation with her mother ; and presently she sighed , and quietly left the room .
Parsing [sent. 2991 len. 52]: She went to her own apartment , where , at a small and rather battered little white desk , after a period of earnest reverie , she took up a pen , wet the point in purple ink , and without great effort or any critical delayings , produced a poem .
Parsing [sent. 2992 len. 39]: It was in a sense an original poem , though like the greater number of all literary projections , it was so strongly inspirational that the source of its inspiration might easily become manifest to a cold-blooded reader .
Parsing [sent. 2993 len. 50]: Nevertheless , to the poetess herself , as she explained later in good faith , the words just seemed to _ come to _ her ; -- doubtless with either genius or some form of miracle implied ; for sources of inspiration are seldom recognized by inspired writers themselves .
Parsing [sent. 2994 len. 43]: She had not long ago been party to a musical Sunday afternoon at her Great-Uncle Joseph 's house , where Mr. Clairdyce sang some of his songs again and again , and her poem may have begun to coagulate within her then .
Parsing [sent. 2995 len. 102]: THE ORGANEST BY FLORENCE ATWATER The organest was seated at his organ in a church , In some beautiful woods of maple and birch , He was very weary while he played upon the keys , But he was a great organest and always played with ease , When the soul is weary , And the wind is dreary , I would like to be an organest seated all day at the organ , Whether my name might be Fairchild or Morgan , I would play music like a vast amen , The way it sounds in a church of men .
Parsing [sent. 2996 len. 39]: Florence read her poem seven or eight times , the deepening pleasure of her expression being evidence that repetition failed to denature this work , but on the contrary , enhanced an appreciative surprise at its singular merit .
Parsing [sent. 2997 len. 34]: Finally she folded the sheet of paper with a delicate carefulness unusual to her , and placed it in her skirt pocket ; then she went downstairs and out into the back yard .
Parsing [sent. 2998 len. 45]: Her next action was straightforward and anything but prudish ; she climbed the high wooden fences , one after the other , until she came to a pause at the top of that whereon the two journalists had lately made themselves so odiously impressive .
Parsing [sent. 2999 len. 28]: Before her , if she had but taken note of them , were a lesson in history and the markings of a profound transition in human evolution .
Parsing [sent. 3000 len. 22]: Beside the old frame stable was a little brick garage , obviously put to the daily use intended by its designer .
Parsing [sent. 3001 len. 23]: Quite as obviously the stable was obsolete ; anybody would have known from its outside that there was no horse within it .
Parsing [sent. 3002 len. 12]: There , visible , was the end of the pastoral age .
Parsing [sent. 3003 len. 7]: All this was lost upon Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3004 len. 25]: She sat upon the fence , her gaze unfavourably though wistfully fixed upon a sign of no special aesthetic merit above the stable door .
Parsing [sent. 3005 len. 64]: THE NORTH END DAILY ORIOLE ATWATER & ROOTER OWNERS & PROPREITORS SUBSCRIBE NOW 25 CENTS The inconsistency of the word `` daily '' did not trouble Florence ; moreover , she had found no fault with `` Oriole '' until the Owners & Propreitors had explained to her in the plainest terms known to their vocabularies that she was excluded from the enterprise .
Parsing [sent. 3006 len. 45]: Then , indeed , she had been reciprocally explicit in regard not only to them and certain personal characteristics of theirs , which she pointed out as fundamental , but in regard to any newspaper which should deliberately call itself an `` Oriole . ''
Parsing [sent. 3007 len. 80]: The partners remained superior in manner , though unable to conceal a natural resentment ; they had adopted `` Oriole '' not out of a sentiment for the city of Baltimore , nor , indeed , on account of any ornithologic interest of theirs , but as a relic left over from an abandoned club or secret society , which they had previously contemplated forming , its members to be called `` The Orioles '' for no reason whatever .
Parsing [sent. 3008 len. 59]: The two friends had talked of this plan at many meetings throughout the summer , and when Mr. Joseph Atwater made his great-nephew the unexpected present of a printing-press , and a newspaper consequently took the place of the club , Herbert and Henry still entertained an affection for their former scheme and decided to perpetuate the name .
Parsing [sent. 3009 len. 41]: They were the more sensitive to attack upon it by an ignorant outsider and girl like Florence , and her chance of ingratiating herself with them , if that could be now her intention , was not a promising one .
Parsing [sent. 3010 len. 30]: She descended from the fence with pronounced inelegance , and , approaching the old double doors of the `` carriage-house , '' which were open , paused to listen .
Parsing [sent. 3011 len. 25]: Sounds from above assured her that the editors were editing -- or at least that they could be found at their place of business .
Parsing [sent. 3012 len. 34]: Therefore , she ascended the cobwebby stairway , emerged from it into the former hay loft , and thus made her appearance in the printing-room of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 3013 len. 31]: Herbert , frowning with the burden of composition , sat at a table beyond the official railing , and his partner was engaged at the press , earnestly setting type .
Parsing [sent. 3014 len. 39]: This latter person -LRB- whom Florence so seldom named otherwise than as `` that nasty little Henry Rooter '' -RRB- was of a pure , smooth , fair-haired appearance , and strangely clean for his age and occupation .
Parsing [sent. 3015 len. 42]: His profile was of a symmetry he had not yet himself begun to appreciate ; his dress was scrupulous and modish ; and though he was short , nothing outward about him confirmed the more sinister of Florence 's two adjectives .
Parsing [sent. 3016 len. 23]: Nevertheless , her poor opinion of him was plain in her expression as she made her present intrusion upon his working hours .
Parsing [sent. 3017 len. 5]: He seemed to reciprocate .
Parsing [sent. 3018 len. 3]: `` Listen !
Parsing [sent. 3019 len. 15]: Did n't I and Herbert tell you to keep out o ' here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3020 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3021 len. 7]: `` Look at her , Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 3022 len. 6]: She 's back again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3023 len. 23]: `` You get out o ' here , Florence , '' said Herbert , abandoning his task with a look of pain .
Parsing [sent. 3024 len. 25]: `` How often we got to tell you we do n't want you around here when we 're in our office like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3025 len. 7]: `` For Heaven 's sake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3026 len. 7]: Henry Rooter thought fit to add .
Parsing [sent. 3027 len. 29]: `` Ca n't you quit runnin ' up and down our office stairs once in a while , long enough for us to get our newspaper work done ?
Parsing [sent. 3028 len. 12]: Ca n't you give us a little _ peace _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3029 len. 26]: The pinkiness of Florence 's altering complexion was justified ; she had not been within a thousand miles of their old office for four days .
Parsing [sent. 3030 len. 33]: With some heat she stated this to be the fact , adding , `` And I only came then because I knew somebody ought to see that this stable is n't ruined .
Parsing [sent. 3031 len. 17]: It 's my own uncle and aunt 's stable , I guess , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3032 len. 14]: Answer me that , if you 'll kindly please to do so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3033 len. 14]: `` It 's my father and mother 's stable , '' Herbert asserted .
Parsing [sent. 3034 len. 22]: `` Have n't I got a right to say who 's allowed in my own father and mother 's stable ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3035 len. 11]: `` You have not , '' the prompt Florence replied .
Parsing [sent. 3036 len. 22]: `` It 's my own uncle and aunt 's stable , and I got as much right here as anybody . ''
Parsing [sent. 3037 len. 6]: `` You have not ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3038 len. 5]: Henry Rooter protested hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3039 len. 15]: `` This is n't either your ole aunt and uncle 's stable . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3040 len. 7]: _ It is n't _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3041 len. 7]: `` No , it is not !
Parsing [sent. 3042 len. 7]: This is n't anybody 's stable .
Parsing [sent. 3043 len. 54]: It 's my and Herbert 's Newspaper Building , and I guess you have n't got the face to stand there and claim you got a right to go in a Newspaper Building and say you got a right there when everybody tells you to stay outside of it , I guess ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3044 len. 8]: `` Oh , have n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3045 len. 12]: `` No , you ` have n't -- I ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3046 len. 5]: Mr. Rooter maintained bitterly .
Parsing [sent. 3047 len. 38]: `` You just walk down town and go in any Newspaper Buildings down there and tell 'em you got a right to stay there all day long when they tell you to get out o ' there !
Parsing [sent. 3048 len. 4]: Just try it !
Parsing [sent. 3049 len. 7]: That 's all I ask ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3050 len. 7]: Florence uttered a cry of derision .
Parsing [sent. 3051 len. 23]: `` And pray , whoever told you I was bound to do everything you ask me to , Mister Henry Rooter ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3052 len. 28]: And she concluded by reverting to that hostile impulse , so ancient , which , in despair of touching an antagonist effectively , reflects upon his ancestors .
Parsing [sent. 3053 len. 17]: `` If you got anything you want to ask , you go ask your grandmother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3054 len. 4]: `` Here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3055 len. 6]: Herbert sprang to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 3056 len. 10]: `` You try and behave like a lady ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3057 len. 7]: `` Who 'll make me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3058 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3059 len. 25]: `` You got to behave like a lady as long as you 're in our Newspaper Building , anyway , '' Herbert said ominously .
Parsing [sent. 3060 len. 27]: `` If you expect to come up here after you been told five dozen times to keep out -- '' `` For Heaven 's sakes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3061 len. 4]: his partner interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3062 len. 14]: `` When we goin ' to get our newspaper _ work _ done ?
Parsing [sent. 3063 len. 17]: She 's _ your _ cousin ; I should think you could get her out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3064 len. 14]: `` Well , I 'm goin ' to , ai n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3065 len. 4]: Herbert protested plaintively .
Parsing [sent. 3066 len. 13]: `` I expect to get her out , do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3067 len. 7]: `` Oh , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3068 len. 8]: Miss Atwater inquired , with severe mockery .
Parsing [sent. 3069 len. 14]: `` Pray , how would you expect to accomplish it , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3070 len. 34]: Herbert looked desperate , but was unable to form a reply consistent with a few new rules of etiquette and gallantry that he had begun to observe during the past year or so .
Parsing [sent. 3071 len. 12]: `` Now , see here , Florence , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3072 len. 32]: `` You 're old enough to know when people tell you to keep out of a place , why , it means they want you to stay away from there . ''
Parsing [sent. 3073 len. 7]: Florence remained cold to this reasoning .
Parsing [sent. 3074 len. 6]: `` Oh , Poot ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3075 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 3076 len. 7]: `` Now , look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3077 len. 11]: her cousin remonstrated , and went on with his argument .
Parsing [sent. 3078 len. 46]: `` We got our newspaper work to do , and you ought to have sense enough to know newspaper work like this newspaper work we got on _ our _ hands here is n't -- well , it ai n't any child 's play . ''
Parsing [sent. 3079 len. 19]: His partner appeared to approve of the expression , for he nodded severely and then used it himself .
Parsing [sent. 3080 len. 16]: `` No , you _ bet _ it is n't any child 's play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3081 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3082 len. 9]: `` No , sir , '' Herbert continued .
Parsing [sent. 3083 len. 18]: `` This newspaper work we got on our hands here is n't any child 's play . ''
Parsing [sent. 3084 len. 11]: `` No , sir , '' Henry Rooter again agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3085 len. 17]: `` Newspaper work like this is n't any child 's play at _ all _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3086 len. 15]: `` It is n't any child 's play , Florence , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3087 len. 13]: `` It ai n't any child 's play at all , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3088 len. 59]: If it was just child 's play or something like that , why , it would n't matter so much your always pokin ' up here , and -- '' `` Well , '' his partner interrupted judicially ; -- `` we would n't want her around , even if it _ was _ child 's play . ''
Parsing [sent. 3089 len. 15]: `` No , we would n't ; that 's so , '' Herbert agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3090 len. 13]: `` We would n't want you around , anyhow , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3091 len. 7]: Here his tone became more plaintive .
Parsing [sent. 3092 len. 20]: `` So , for mercy 's sakes ca n't you go on home and give us a little rest ?
Parsing [sent. 3093 len. 7]: What you want , anyhow ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3094 len. 23]: `` Well , I guess it 's about time you was askin ' me that , '' she said , not unreasonably .
Parsing [sent. 3095 len. 46]: `` If you 'd asked me that in the first place , instead of actin ' like you 'd never been taught anything , and was only fit to associate with hoodlums , perhaps my time is of _ some _ value , myself ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3096 len. 38]: Here the lack of rhetorical cohesion was largely counteracted by the strong expressiveness of her tone and manner , which made clear her position as a person of worth , dealing with the lowest of her inferiors .
Parsing [sent. 3097 len. 79]: She went on , not pausing : `` I thought being as I was related to you , and all the family and everybody else is goin ' to haf to read your ole newspaper , anyway it 'd be a good thing if what was printed in it was n't _ all _ a disgrace to the family , because the name of our family 's got mixed up with this newspaper ; -- so here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3098 len. 20]: Thus speaking , she took the poem from her pocket and with dignity held it forth to her cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3099 len. 6]: `` What 's that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3100 len. 8]: Herbert inquired , not moving a hand .
Parsing [sent. 3101 len. 16]: He was but an amateur , yet already enough of an editor to be suspicious .
Parsing [sent. 3102 len. 10]: `` It 's a poem , '' Florence said .
Parsing [sent. 3103 len. 32]: `` I do n't know whether I exackly ought to have it in your ole newspaper or not , but on account of the family 's sake I guess I better .
Parsing [sent. 3104 len. 6]: Here , take it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3105 len. 14]: Herbert at once withdrew a few steps , placing his hands behind him .
Parsing [sent. 3106 len. 51]: `` Listen here , '' he said ; -- `` you think we got time to read a lot o ' nothin ' in your ole hand-writin ' that nobody can read anyhow , and then go and toil and moil to print it on our printin ' - press ?
Parsing [sent. 3107 len. 18]: I guess we got work enough printin ' what we write for our newspaper our own selves !
Parsing [sent. 3108 len. 19]: My goodness , Florence , I _ told _ you this is n't any child 's play ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3109 len. 11]: For the moment , Florence appeared to be somewhat baffled .
Parsing [sent. 3110 len. 7]: `` Well , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3111 len. 34]: `` Well , you better put this poem in your ole newspaper if you want to have anyhow one thing in it that wo n't make everybody sick that reads it . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3112 len. 9]: _ I _ wo n't do it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3113 len. 4]: Herbert said decisively .
Parsing [sent. 3114 len. 8]: `` What you take us for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3115 len. 4]: his partner added .
Parsing [sent. 3116 len. 10]: `` All right , then , '' Florence responded .
Parsing [sent. 3117 len. 17]: `` I 'll go and tell Uncle Joseph and he 'll take this printing-press back . ''
Parsing [sent. 3118 len. 8]: `` He will not take it back .
Parsing [sent. 3119 len. 35]: I already did tell him how you kept pokin ' around , tryin ' to _ run _ everything , and how we just worried our lives out tryin ' to keep you away .
Parsing [sent. 3120 len. 17]: He said he bet it was a hard job ; that 's what Uncle Joseph said !
Parsing [sent. 3121 len. 11]: So go on , tell him anything you want to .
Parsing [sent. 3122 len. 14]: You do n't get your ole poem in _ our _ newspaper ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3123 len. 13]: `` Not if she lived to be two hunderd years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3124 len. 4]: Henry Rooter added .
Parsing [sent. 3125 len. 6]: Then he had an afterthought .
Parsing [sent. 3126 len. 9]: `` Not unless she pays for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3127 len. 7]: `` How do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3128 len. 8]: Herbert asked , puzzled by this codicil .
Parsing [sent. 3129 len. 13]: Now Henry 's brow had become corrugated with no little professional impressiveness .
Parsing [sent. 3130 len. 13]: `` You know what we were talkin ' about this morning ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3131 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3132 len. 21]: `` How the right way to run our newspaper , we ought to have some advertisements in it and everything ?
Parsing [sent. 3133 len. 10]: Well , we want money , do n't we ?
Parsing [sent. 3134 len. 27]: We could put this poem in our newspaper like an advertisement ; -- that is , if Florence has got any money , we could . ''
Parsing [sent. 3135 len. 3]: Herbert frowned .
Parsing [sent. 3136 len. 14]: `` If her ole poem is n't too long I guess we could .
Parsing [sent. 3137 len. 10]: Here , let 's see it , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3138 len. 26]: And , taking the sheet of paper in his hand , he studied the dimensions of the poem , without paining himself to read it .
Parsing [sent. 3139 len. 16]: `` Well , I guess , maybe we can do it , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3140 len. 10]: `` How much ought we to charge her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3141 len. 33]: This question sent Henry Rooter into a state of calculation , while Florence observed him with veiled anxiety ; but after a time he looked up , his brow showing continued strain .
Parsing [sent. 3142 len. 21]: `` Do you keep a bank , Florence -- for nickels and dimes and maybe quarters , you know ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3143 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3144 len. 10]: It was her cousin who impulsively replied for her .
Parsing [sent. 3145 len. 11]: `` No , she do n't , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3146 len. 11]: `` Not since I was about seven years old ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3147 len. 24]: And Florence added sharply , though with dignity : `` Do you still make mud pies in your back yard , pray ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3148 len. 7]: `` Now , see here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3149 len. 3]: Henry objected .
Parsing [sent. 3150 len. 16]: `` Try and be a lady anyway for a few minutes , ca n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 3151 len. 22]: I got to figure out how much we got to charge you for your ole poem , do n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3152 len. 26]: `` Well , then , '' Florence returned , `` you better ask _ me _ somep 'n about that , had n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3153 len. 18]: `` Well , '' said Henry Rooter , `` have you got any money at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3154 len. 8]: `` No , I have n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3155 len. 10]: `` Have you got any money with you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3156 len. 7]: `` Yes , I have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3157 len. 7]: `` How much is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3158 len. 8]: `` I wo n't tell you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3159 len. 3]: Henry frowned .
Parsing [sent. 3160 len. 25]: `` I guess we ought to make her pay about two dollars and a half , '' he said , turning to his partner .
Parsing [sent. 3161 len. 46]: Herbert became deferential ; it seemed to him that he had formed a business association with a genius , and for a moment he was dazzled ; then he remembered Florence 's financial capacities , always well known to him , and he looked depressed .
Parsing [sent. 3162 len. 7]: Florence , herself , looked indignant .
Parsing [sent. 3163 len. 8]: `` Two dollars and a half ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3164 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3165 len. 35]: `` Why , I could buy this whole place for two dollars and a half , printing-press , railing , and all -- yes , and you thrown in , Mister Henry Rooter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3166 len. 11]: `` See here , Florence , '' Henry said earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3167 len. 12]: `` Have n't you got two dollars and a half ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3168 len. 8]: `` Of course she has n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3169 len. 5]: his partner assured him .
Parsing [sent. 3170 len. 14]: `` She never had two dollars and a half in her life ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3171 len. 20]: `` Well , then , '' said Henry gloomily , `` what we goin ' to do about it ?
Parsing [sent. 3172 len. 13]: How much _ you _ think we ought to charge her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3173 len. 6]: Herbert 's expression became noncommittal .
Parsing [sent. 3174 len. 26]: `` Just let me think a minute , '' he said , and with his hand to his brow he stepped behind the unsuspicious Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3175 len. 43]: `` I got to think , '' he murmured ; then with the straightforwardness of his age , he suddenly seized his damsel cousin from the rear and held her in a tight but far from affectionate embrace , pinioning her arms .
Parsing [sent. 3176 len. 7]: She shrieked , `` Murder ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3177 len. 7]: and `` Let me go ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3178 len. 4]: and `` Help !
Parsing [sent. 3179 len. 3]: Hay-yulp ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3180 len. 10]: `` Look in her pocket , '' Herbert shouted .
Parsing [sent. 3181 len. 15]: `` She keeps her money in her skirt pocket when she 's got any .
Parsing [sent. 3182 len. 9]: It 's on the left side of her .
Parsing [sent. 3183 len. 7]: Do n't let her kick you !
Parsing [sent. 3184 len. 4]: Look out ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3185 len. 6]: `` I got it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3186 len. 10]: said the dexterous Henry , retreating and exhibiting coins .
Parsing [sent. 3187 len. 12]: `` It 's one dime and two nickels -- twenty cents .
Parsing [sent. 3188 len. 8]: Has she got any more pockets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3189 len. 8]: `` No , I have n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3190 len. 10]: Florence fiercely informed him , as Herbert released her .
Parsing [sent. 3191 len. 22]: `` And I guess you better hand that money back if you do n't want to be arrested for stealing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3192 len. 5]: But Henry was unmoved .
Parsing [sent. 3193 len. 9]: `` Twenty cents , '' he said calculatingly .
Parsing [sent. 3194 len. 26]: `` Well , all right ; it is n't much , but you can have your poem in our newspaper for twenty cents , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3195 len. 23]: If you do n't want to pay that much , why , take your ole twenty cents and go on away . ''
Parsing [sent. 3196 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3197 len. 13]: `` That 's as cheap as we 'll do it , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3198 len. 7]: Take it or leave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3199 len. 12]: `` Take it or leave it , '' Henry Rooter agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3200 len. 18]: `` That 's the way to talk to her ; take it or leave it , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3201 len. 13]: If you do n't take it you got to leave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3202 len. 11]: Florence was indignant , but she decided to take it .
Parsing [sent. 3203 len. 9]: `` All right , '' she said coldly .
Parsing [sent. 3204 len. 14]: `` I would n't pay another cent if I died for it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3205 len. 32]: `` Well , you have n't got another cent , so that 's all right , '' Mr. Rooter remarked ; and he honourably extended an open palm toward his partner .
Parsing [sent. 3206 len. 20]: `` Here , Herbert ; you can have the dime , or the two nickels , whichever you rather .
Parsing [sent. 3207 len. 18]: It makes no difference to me ; I 'd as soon have one as the other . ''
Parsing [sent. 3208 len. 11]: Herbert took the two nickels , and turned to Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3209 len. 17]: `` See here , Florence , '' he said , in a tone of strong complaint .
Parsing [sent. 3210 len. 11]: `` This business is all done and paid for now .
Parsing [sent. 3211 len. 14]: What you want to hang around here any _ more _ for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3212 len. 15]: `` Yes , Florence , '' his partner faithfully seconded him , at once .
Parsing [sent. 3213 len. 29]: `` We have n't got any more time to waste around here to-day , and so what you want to stand around in the way and everything for ?
Parsing [sent. 3214 len. 12]: You ought to know yourself we do n't want you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3215 len. 13]: `` I 'm not in the way , '' said Florence hotly .
Parsing [sent. 3216 len. 8]: `` Whose way am I in ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3217 len. 28]: `` Well , anyhow , if you do n't go , '' Herbert informed her , `` we 'll carry you downstairs and lock you out . ''
Parsing [sent. 3218 len. 10]: `` I 'd just like to see you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3219 len. 7]: she returned , her eyes flashing .
Parsing [sent. 3220 len. 13]: `` Just you dare to lay a finger on me again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3221 len. 38]: And she added , `` Anyway , if you did , those ole doors have n't got any lock on 'em : I 'll come right back in and walk right straight up the stairs again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3222 len. 5]: Herbert advanced toward her .
Parsing [sent. 3223 len. 13]: `` Now you pay attention , to me , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3224 len. 19]: `` You 've paid for your ole poem , and we got to have some peace around here .
Parsing [sent. 3225 len. 19]: I 'm goin ' straight over to your mother and ask her to come and get you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3226 len. 4]: Florence gave up .
Parsing [sent. 3227 len. 13]: `` What difference would _ that _ make , Mister Taddletale ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3228 len. 5]: she inquired mockingly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3229 len. 14]: _ I _ would n't be here when she came , would I ?
Parsing [sent. 3230 len. 30]: I 'll thank you to notice there 's some value to my time , myself ; and I 'll just politely ask you to excuse me , pray ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3231 len. 24]: CHAPTER SIXTEEN With a proud air she crushingly departed , returning to her own home far from dissatisfied with what she had accomplished .
Parsing [sent. 3232 len. 60]: Moreover , she began to expand with the realization of a new importance ; and she was gratified with the effect upon her parents , at dinner that evening , when she informed them that she had written a poem , which was to be published in the prospective first number of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 3233 len. 8]: `` Written a _ poem _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3234 len. 4]: said her father .
Parsing [sent. 3235 len. 6]: `` Well , I declare !
Parsing [sent. 3236 len. 9]: Why , that 's remarkable , Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3237 len. 16]: `` I 'm glad the boys were nice about it , '' said her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3238 len. 28]: `` I should have feared they could n't appreciate it , after being so cross to you about letting you have anything to do with the printing-press .
Parsing [sent. 3239 len. 12]: They must have thought it was a very good poem . ''
Parsing [sent. 3240 len. 9]: `` Where is the poem , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3241 len. 4]: Mr. Atwater asked .
Parsing [sent. 3242 len. 19]: `` Let 's read it and see what our little girl can do when she really tries . ''
Parsing [sent. 3243 len. 52]: Unfortunately Florence had not a copy , and when she informed her father of this fact , he professed himself greatly disappointed as well as eager for the first appearance of _ The Oriole _ , that he might felicitate himself upon the evidence of his daughter 's heretofore unsuspected talent .
Parsing [sent. 3244 len. 69]: Florence was herself anxious for the newspaper 's début , and she made her anxiety so clear to Atwater & Rooter , Owners & Propreitors , every afternoon after school , during the following week , that by Thursday further argument and repartee on their part were felt to be indeed futile ; and in order to have a little peace around there , they carried her downstairs .
Parsing [sent. 3245 len. 50]: At least , they defined their action as `` carrying , '' and , having deposited her in the yard , they were obliged to stand guard at the doors , which they closed and contrived to hold against her until her strength was worn out for that day .
Parsing [sent. 3246 len. 4]: Florence consoled herself .
Parsing [sent. 3247 len. 60]: During the week she dropped in on all the members of `` the family '' -- her grandfather , uncles and aunts and cousins , her great-aunts and great-uncles -- and in each instance , after no protracted formal preliminaries , lightly remarked that she wrote poetry now ; her first to appear in the forthcoming _ Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 3248 len. 15]: And when Great-Aunt Carrie said , `` Why , Florence , you 're wonderful !
Parsing [sent. 3249 len. 11]: I could n't write a poem to save my life .
Parsing [sent. 3250 len. 38]: I never _ could _ see how they do it , '' Florence laughed , made a deprecatory little side motion with her head , and responded , `` Why , Aunt Carrie , that 's nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3251 len. 9]: It just kind of comes to you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3252 len. 55]: This also served as her explanation when some of her school friends expressed their admiration , after being told the news in confidence ; though to one of the teachers she said , smiling ruefully , as in remembrance of midnight oil , `` It _ does _ take work , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3253 len. 50]: * * * * * When opportunity offered , upon the street , she joined people she knew -LRB- or even rather distant acquaintances -RRB- to walk with them a little way and lead the conversation to the subject of poetry , including her own contribution to that art .
Parsing [sent. 3254 len. 65]: Altogether , if Florence was not in a fair way to become a poetic celebrity it was not her own fault but entirely that of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ , which was to make its appearance on Saturday , but failed to do so on account of too much enthusiasm on the part of Atwater & Rooter in manipulating the printing-press .
Parsing [sent. 3255 len. 23]: It broke , had to be repaired ; and Florence , her nerves upset by the accident , demanded her money back .
Parsing [sent. 3256 len. 32]: This was impossible , and the postponement proved to be but an episode ; moreover , it gave her time to let more people know of the treat that was coming .
Parsing [sent. 3257 len. 6]: Among these was Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 3258 len. 38]: Until the Friday following her disappointment she had found no opportunity to acquaint her Very Ideal with the news ; and but for an encounter partly due to chance , he might not have heard of it .
Parsing [sent. 3259 len. 42]: A sentimental enrichment of colour in her cheeks was the result of her catching sight of him , as she was on the point of opening and entering her own front door , that afternoon , on her return from school .
Parsing [sent. 3260 len. 10]: He was passing the house , walking somewhat dreamily .
Parsing [sent. 3261 len. 30]: Florence stepped into the sheltering vestibule , peeping round it with earnest eyes to watch him as he went by ; obviously he had taken no note of her .
Parsing [sent. 3262 len. 29]: Satisfied of this , she waited until he was at a little distance , then ran lightly down to the gate , hurried after him and joined him .
Parsing [sent. 3263 len. 7]: `` Why , Mr. Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3264 len. 11]: she exclaimed , in her mother 's most polished manner .
Parsing [sent. 3265 len. 9]: `` How supprising to see _ you _ !
Parsing [sent. 3266 len. 21]: I presume as we both happen to be walking the same direction we might just 's well keep together . ''
Parsing [sent. 3267 len. 7]: `` Surprising to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3268 len. 4]: Noble said vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 3269 len. 13]: `` I have n't been away anywhere in particular , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3270 len. 9]: Then , at a thought , he brightened .
Parsing [sent. 3271 len. 10]: `` I 'm glad to see you , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3272 len. 21]: Do you know if any of your family or relatives have heard when your Aunt Julia is coming home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3273 len. 4]: `` Aunt Julia ?
Parsing [sent. 3274 len. 10]: She 's out of town , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3275 len. 18]: `` She 's visiting different people she used to know when she was away at school . ''
Parsing [sent. 3276 len. 11]: `` Yes , I know , '' Mr. Dill returned .
Parsing [sent. 3277 len. 10]: `` But she 's been gone six weeks . ''
Parsing [sent. 3278 len. 73]: `` Oh , I do n't believe it 's that long , '' Florence said casually ; then with more earnestness : `` Mr. Dill , I was goin ' to ask you somep ` n -- it 's kind of a funny question for _ me _ to ask , but -- '' `` Yes , she has , '' Noble interrupted , not aware that his remark was an interruption .
Parsing [sent. 3279 len. 9]: `` Oh , yes , she has ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3280 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3281 len. 8]: `` It was six weeks day-before-yesterday afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 3282 len. 29]: I saw your father downtown this morning , and he said he did n't know that any of the family had heard just when she was coming home .
Parsing [sent. 3283 len. 21]: I thought maybe some of your relatives had a letter from her by this afternoon 's mail , perhaps . ''
Parsing [sent. 3284 len. 9]: `` I guess not , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3285 len. 15]: `` Mr. Dill , there was a question I thought I 'd ask you .
Parsing [sent. 3286 len. 29]: It 's kind of a funny question for _ me _ -- '' `` Are you _ sure _ nobody 's heard from your Aunt Julia to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3287 len. 3]: Noble insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3288 len. 7]: `` I guess they have n't .
Parsing [sent. 3289 len. 34]: Mr. Dill , I was goin ' to ask you -- '' `` It 's strange , '' he murmured , `` I do n't see how people can enjoy visits that long .
Parsing [sent. 3290 len. 15]: I should think they 'd get anxious about what might happen at home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3291 len. 36]: `` Oh , grandpa 's all right ; he says he kind of likes to have the house nice and quiet to himself ; and anyway Aunt Julia enjoys visiting , '' Florence assured him .
Parsing [sent. 3292 len. 19]: `` Aunt Fanny saw a newspaper from one the places where Aunt Julia 's visiting her school room-mate .
Parsing [sent. 3293 len. 22]: It had her picture in it and called her ` the famous Northern Beauty ' ; it was down South somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3294 len. 32]: Well , Mr. Dill , I was just sayin ' I believe I 'd ask you -- '' But a sectional rancour seemed all at once to affect the young man .
Parsing [sent. 3295 len. 5]: `` Oh , yes .
Parsing [sent. 3296 len. 9]: I heard about that , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3297 len. 10]: `` Your Aunt Fanny lent my mother the newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3298 len. 45]: Those people in _ that _ part of the country -- well -- '' He paused , remembering that it was only Florence he addressed ; and he withheld from utterance his opinion that the Civil War ought to be fought all over again .
Parsing [sent. 3299 len. 29]: `` Your father said your grandfather had n't heard from her for several days , and even then she had n't said when she was coming home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3300 len. 13]: `` No , I expect she did n't , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3301 len. 38]: `` Mr. Dill , I was goin ' to ask you somep ` n -- it 's kind of a queer kind of question for _ me _ to ask , I guess -- '' She paused .
Parsing [sent. 3302 len. 76]: However , he did not interrupt her , seeming preoccupied with gloom ; whereupon Florence permitted herself a deprecatory laugh , and continued , `` It might be you 'd answer yes , or it might be you 'd answer no ; but anyway I was goin ' to ask you -- it 's kind of a funny question for _ me _ to ask , I expect -- but do you like poetry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3303 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3304 len. 29]: `` Well , as things have turned out lately I guess it 's kind of a funny question , Mr. Dill , but do you like poetry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3305 len. 21]: Noble 's expression took on a coldness ; for the word brought to his mind a thought of Newland Sanders .
Parsing [sent. 3306 len. 7]: `` Do I like poetry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3307 len. 3]: said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 3308 len. 8]: `` No , I do n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3309 len. 34]: Florence was momentarily discouraged ; but at her age people usually possess an invaluable faculty , which they lose later in life ; and it is a pity that they do lose it .
Parsing [sent. 3310 len. 37]: At thirteen -- especially the earlier months of thirteen -- they are still able to set aside and dismiss from their minds almost any facts , no matter how audibly those facts have asked for recognition .
Parsing [sent. 3311 len. 67]: Children superbly allow themselves to become deaf , so to speak , to undesirable circumstances ; most frequently , of course , to undesirable circumstances in the way of parental direction ; so that fathers , mothers , nurses , or governesses , not comprehending that this mental deafness is for the time being entirely genuine , are liable to hoarseness both of throat and temper .
Parsing [sent. 3312 len. 40]: Thirteen is an age when the fading of this gift or talent , one of the most beautiful of childhood , begins to impair its helpfulness under the mistaken stress of discipline ; but Florence retained something of it .
Parsing [sent. 3313 len. 20]: In a moment or two Noble Dill 's disaffection toward poetry was altogether as if it did not exist .
Parsing [sent. 3314 len. 54]: She coughed , inclined her head a little to one side , in her mother 's manner of politeness to callers , and , repeating her deprecatory laugh , remarked : `` Well , of course it 's kind of a funny question for _ me _ to ask , of course . ''
Parsing [sent. 3315 len. 7]: `` What is , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3316 len. 4]: Noble inquired absently .
Parsing [sent. 3317 len. 44]: `` Well -- what I was saying was that ` course it 's sort of queer _ me _ askin ' if you liked poetry , of course , on account of my _ writing _ poetry the way I do now . ''
Parsing [sent. 3318 len. 28]: She looked up at him with a bright readiness to respond modestly to whatever exclamation his wonder should dictate ; but Noble 's attention had straggled again .
Parsing [sent. 3319 len. 9]: `` Has she written your mother lately ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3320 len. 3]: he asked .
Parsing [sent. 3321 len. 10]: Florence 's expression denoted a mental condition slightly disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3322 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3323 len. 18]: `` It 's goin ' to be printed in _ The North End Daily Oriole _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3324 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3325 len. 4]: `` My poem .
Parsing [sent. 3326 len. 52]: It 's about a vast amen -- anyhow , that 's proba ` ly the best thing in it , I guess -- and they 're goin ' to have it out to-morrow , or else they 'll have to settle with _ me _ ; that 's one thing certain !
Parsing [sent. 3327 len. 21]: I 'll bring one over to your house and leave it at the door for you , Mr. Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3328 len. 13]: Noble had but a confused notion of what she thus generously promised .
Parsing [sent. 3329 len. 14]: However , he said , `` Thank you , '' and nodded vaguely .
Parsing [sent. 3330 len. 20]: `` Of course , I do n't know as it 's so awful good , '' Florence admitted insincerely .
Parsing [sent. 3331 len. 24]: `` The family all seem to think it 's something pretty much ; but I do n't know if it is or not .
Parsing [sent. 3332 len. 9]: _ Really _ , I do n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3333 len. 10]: `` No , '' said Noble , still confused .
Parsing [sent. 3334 len. 6]: `` I suppose not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3335 len. 18]: `` I 'm half way through another one I think myself 'll be a good deal better .
Parsing [sent. 3336 len. 32]: I 'm not goin ' as fast with it as I did with the other one , and I expect it 'll be quite a ways ahead of this one . ''
Parsing [sent. 3337 len. 8]: She again employed the deprecatory little laugh .
Parsing [sent. 3338 len. 12]: `` I do n't know how I do it , myself .
Parsing [sent. 3339 len. 28]: The family all think it 's sort of funny I do n't know how I do it , myself ; but that 's the way it is .
Parsing [sent. 3340 len. 26]: They all say if they could do it they 're sure they 'd know how they did it ; but I guess they 're wrong .
Parsing [sent. 3341 len. 18]: I presume if you can do it , why , it just _ comes _ to you .
Parsing [sent. 3342 len. 15]: Do n't you presume that 's the way it is , Mr. Dill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3343 len. 7]: `` I -- guess so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3344 len. 10]: They had reached his gate , and he stopped .
Parsing [sent. 3345 len. 14]: `` You 're sure none of your family have heard anything to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3346 len. 4]: he asked anxiously .
Parsing [sent. 3347 len. 5]: `` From Aunt Julia ?
Parsing [sent. 3348 len. 8]: I do n't think they have . ''
Parsing [sent. 3349 len. 8]: He sighed , and opened the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3350 len. 9]: `` Well , good evening , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3351 len. 5]: `` Good evening . ''
Parsing [sent. 3352 len. 60]: Her eyes followed him wistfully as he passed within the enclosure ; then she turned and walked quickly toward her own home ; but at the corner of the next fence she called back over her shoulder , `` I 'll leave it with your mother for you , if you 're not home when I bring it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3353 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3354 len. 8]: he shouted , from his front door .
Parsing [sent. 3355 len. 12]: `` I 'll leave it with your _ mother _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3356 len. 5]: `` Leave what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3357 len. 7]: `` The _ poem _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3358 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3359 len. 3]: said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 3360 len. 4]: `` Thanks ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3361 len. 46]: But when his mother handed him a copy of the first issue of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ , the next day , when he came home to lunch , he read it without edification ; there was nothing about Julia in it .

Parsing [sent. 3388 len. 27]: Atwater & Rooter News Paper Building 25 cents per YEAR Such was the first issue , complete , of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 3389 len. 73]: What had happened to the poem was due partly to Atwater & Rooter 's natural lack of experience in a new and exacting trade ; partly to their enviable unconsciousness of any necessity for proof-reading ; and somewhat to their haste in getting through the final and least interesting stage of their undertaking ; for of course so far as the printers were concerned , the poem was mere hack work anti-climax .
Parsing [sent. 3390 len. 31]: And as they later declared , under fire , anybody that could make out more than three words in five of Florence 's ole handwriting was welcome to do it .
Parsing [sent. 3391 len. 24]: Besides , what did it matter if a little bit was left out at the end of one or two of the lines ?
Parsing [sent. 3392 len. 17]: They could n't be expected to run the lines out over their margin , could they ?
Parsing [sent. 3393 len. 58]: And they never knew anything crazier than makin ' all this fuss , because : Well , what if some of it was n't printed just exactly right , who in the world was goin ' to notice it , and what was the difference of just a few words different in that ole poem , anyhow ?
Parsing [sent. 3394 len. 23]: For by the time these explanations -LRB- so to call them -RRB- took place , Florence was indeed makin ' a fuss .
Parsing [sent. 3395 len. 19]: Her emotion , at first , had been happily stimulated at sight of `` BY Florence Atwater . ''
Parsing [sent. 3396 len. 66]: A singular tenderness had risen in her -- a tremulous sense as of something almost sacred coming at last into its own ; and she hurried to distribute , gratis , among relatives and friends , several copies of the _ Oriole _ , paying for them , too -LRB- though not without injurious argument -RRB- , at the rate of two cents a copy .
Parsing [sent. 3397 len. 29]: But upon returning to her own home , she became calm enough -LRB- for a moment or so -RRB- to look over the poem with attention to details .
Parsing [sent. 3398 len. 40]: She returned hastily to the Newspaper Building , but would have been wiser to remain away , since all subscribers had received their copies by the time she got there ; and under the circumstances little reparation was practicable .
Parsing [sent. 3399 len. 31]: She ended her oration -- or professed to end it -- by declaring that she would never have another poem in their ole vile newspaper as long as she lived .
Parsing [sent. 3400 len. 8]: `` You 're right about that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3401 len. 5]: Henry Rooter agreed heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3402 len. 12]: `` We would n't _ let _ another one in it .
Parsing [sent. 3403 len. 5]: Not for fifty dollars !
Parsing [sent. 3404 len. 67]: Just look at all the trouble we took , moiling and toiling , to get your ole poem printed as nice as we could , so it would n't ruin our newspaper , and then you come over here and go on like this , and all this and that , why , I would n't go through it again for a _ hunderd _ dollars !
Parsing [sent. 3405 len. 15]: We 're makin ' good money anyhow , with our newspaper , Florence Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 3406 len. 15]: You need n't think we depend on _ you _ for our living ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3407 len. 10]: `` That 's so , '' his partner declared .
Parsing [sent. 3408 len. 13]: `` We knew you would n't be satisfied , anyway , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3409 len. 7]: Did n't we , Henry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3410 len. 8]: `` I should say we did ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3411 len. 6]: `` Yes , sir ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3412 len. 3]: said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3413 len. 36]: `` Right when we were havin ' the worst time tryin ' to print it and make out some o ' the words , I said right then we were just throwing away our time .

Parsing [sent. 3417 len. 10]: Is n't that what I said , Henry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3418 len. 22]: `` Yes , it is ; and I said then you were right , and you _ are _ right ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3419 len. 11]: `` Cert ` nly I am , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3420 len. 19]: `` Did n't I tell you she 'd be just the way some the family say she is ?
Parsing [sent. 3421 len. 18]: A good many of 'em say she 'd find fault with the undertaker at her own funeral .
Parsing [sent. 3422 len. 9]: That 's just exactly what I said ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3423 len. 7]: `` Oh , you did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3424 len. 6]: Florence burlesqued a polite interest .
Parsing [sent. 3425 len. 8]: `` How _ vir_ry considerate of you !
Parsing [sent. 3426 len. 28]: Then , perhaps you 'll try to be a gentleman enough for one simple moment to allow me to tell you my last remarks on this subject .
Parsing [sent. 3427 len. 15]: I 've said enough -- '' `` Oh , _ have _ you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3428 len. 6]: Herbert interrupted with violent sarcasm .
Parsing [sent. 3429 len. 5]: `` Oh , no !
Parsing [sent. 3430 len. 4]: Say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3431 len. 7]: Florence , say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3432 len. 26]: At this , Henry Rooter loudly shouted with applausive hilarity ; whereupon Herbert , rather surprised at his own effectiveness , naturally repeated his waggery .
Parsing [sent. 3433 len. 7]: `` Say not so , Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3434 len. 4]: Say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3435 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3436 len. 9]: `` I 'll tell you one thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3437 len. 8]: his lady cousin cried , thoroughly infuriated .
Parsing [sent. 3438 len. 34]: `` I wish to make just one last simple remark that I would care to soil myself with in _ your _ respects , Mister Herbert Illingsworth Atwater and Mister Henry Rooter ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3439 len. 10]: `` Oh , say not so , Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3440 len. 4]: they both entreated .
Parsing [sent. 3441 len. 5]: `` Say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3442 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3443 len. 14]: `` I 'll just simply state the simple truth , '' Florence announced .
Parsing [sent. 3444 len. 53]: `` In the first place , you 're goin ' to live to see the day when you 'll come and beg me on your bented knees to have me put poems or anything I want to in your ole newspaper , but I 'll just _ laugh _ at you ! '
Parsing [sent. 3445 len. 5]: _ Indeed _ ? '
Parsing [sent. 3446 len. 4]: I 'll say !
Parsing [sent. 3447 len. 14]: ` So you come beggin ' around _ me _ , do you ?
Parsing [sent. 3448 len. 5]: Ha , ha ! '
Parsing [sent. 3449 len. 5]: I 'll say ! '
Parsing [sent. 3450 len. 11]: I guess it 's a little too late for that !
Parsing [sent. 3451 len. 17]: Why , I would n't -- ' '' `` Oh , say not so , Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3452 len. 7]: Say not so ! '' '' '
Parsing [sent. 3453 len. 14]: _ Me _ to allow you to have one of my poems ? '
Parsing [sent. 3454 len. 13]: I 'll say , ` Much less than _ that _ ! '
Parsing [sent. 3455 len. 35]: I 'll say , ` because even if I was wearing the oldest shoes I got in the world I would n't take the trouble to -- ' '' Her conclusion was drowned out .
Parsing [sent. 3456 len. 11]: `` Oh , _ Florence _ , say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3457 len. 6]: Say not so , Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3458 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3459 len. 43]: CHAPTER SEVENTEEN The hateful entreaty still murmured in her resentful ears , that night , as she fell asleep ; and she passed into the beginnings of a dream with her lips slightly dimpling the surface of her pillow in belated repartee .
Parsing [sent. 3460 len. 29]: And upon waking , though it was Sunday , her first words , half slumbrous in the silence of the morning , were , `` Vile Things ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3461 len. 49]: Her faculties became more alert during the preparation of a toilet that was to serve not only for breakfast , but with the addition of gloves , a hat , and a blue-velvet coat , for Church and Sunday-school as well ; and she planned a hundred vengeances .
Parsing [sent. 3462 len. 44]: That is to say , her mind did not occupy itself with plots possible to make real ; but rather it dabbled among those fragmentary visions that love to overlap and displace one another upon the changeful retina of the mind 's eye .
Parsing [sent. 3463 len. 44]: In all of these pictures , wherein prevailingly she seemed to be some sort of deathly powerful Queen of Poetry , the postures assumed by the figures of Messrs. Atwater and Rooter -LRB- both in an extremity of rags -RRB- were miserably suppliant .
Parsing [sent. 3464 len. 11]: So she soothed herself a little -- but not long .
Parsing [sent. 3465 len. 24]: Herbert , in the next pew , in church , and Henry in the next beyond that , were perfect compositions in smugness .
Parsing [sent. 3466 len. 44]: They were cold , contented , aristocratic ; and had an imperturbable understanding between themselves -LRB- even then perceptible to the sensitive Florence -RRB- that she was a nuisance now capably disposed of by their beautiful discovery of `` Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3467 len. 11]: Florence 's feelings were unbecoming to the place and occasion .
Parsing [sent. 3468 len. 34]: But at four o'clock , that afternoon , she was assuaged into a milder condition by the arrival , according to an agreement made in Sunday-school , of the popular Miss Patty Fairchild .
Parsing [sent. 3469 len. 27]: Patty was thirteen and a half ; an exquisite person with gold-dusted hair , eyes of singing blue , and an alluring air of sweet self-consciousness .
Parsing [sent. 3470 len. 28]: Henry Rooter and Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Jr. , out gathering news , saw her entering Florence 's gate , and immediately forgot that they were reporters .
Parsing [sent. 3471 len. 16]: They became silent , gradually moving toward the house of their newspaper 's sole poetess .
Parsing [sent. 3472 len. 29]: Florence and Patty occupied themselves indoors for half an hour ; then went out in the yard to study a mole 's tunnel that had interested Florence recently .
Parsing [sent. 3473 len. 48]: They followed it across the lawn at the south side of the house , discussing the habits of moles and other matters of zoölogy ; and finally lost the track near the fence , which was here the `` side fence '' and higher than their heads .
Parsing [sent. 3474 len. 43]: Patty looked through a knot-hole to see if the tunnel was visible in the next yard , but , without reporting upon her observations , she turned , as if carelessly , and leaned back against the fence , covering the knot-hole .
Parsing [sent. 3475 len. 30]: `` Florence , '' she said , in a tone softer than she had been using heretofore ; -- `` Florence , do you know what I think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3476 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3477 len. 10]: Could you see any more tracks over there ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3478 len. 25]: `` Florence , '' said Patty ; -- `` I was just going to tell you something , only maybe I better not . ''
Parsing [sent. 3479 len. 5]: `` Why not ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3480 len. 3]: Florence inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3481 len. 8]: `` Go on and tell me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3482 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Patty gently .
Parsing [sent. 3483 len. 9]: `` You might think it was silly . ''
Parsing [sent. 3484 len. 8]: `` No , I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3485 len. 9]: `` Yes , you _ might _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3486 len. 8]: `` I promise I wo n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3487 len. 21]: `` Well , then -- oh , Florence I 'm _ sure _ you 'll think it 's silly ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3488 len. 10]: `` I _ promised _ I would n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 3489 len. 13]: `` Well -- I do n't think I better say it . ''
Parsing [sent. 3490 len. 8]: `` Go on , '' Florence urged .
Parsing [sent. 3491 len. 10]: `` Patty , you _ got _ to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3492 len. 14]: `` Well , then , if I got to , '' said Patty .
Parsing [sent. 3493 len. 33]: `` What I was going to say , Florence : Do n't you think your cousin Herbert and Henry Rooter have got the nicest eyes of any boy in town ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3494 len. 5]: _ Who _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3495 len. 4]: Florence was astounded .
Parsing [sent. 3496 len. 12]: `` I do , '' Patty said in her charming voice .
Parsing [sent. 3497 len. 18]: `` I think Herbert and Henry 've got the nicest eyes of any boy in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3498 len. 5]: `` You do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3499 len. 4]: Florence cried incredulously .
Parsing [sent. 3500 len. 9]: `` Yes , I really do , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3501 len. 19]: I think Herbert Atwater and Henry Rooter have got the nicest eyes of any boy in town . ''
Parsing [sent. 3502 len. 14]: `` Well , I never heard anything like _ this _ before ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3503 len. 3]: Florence declared .
Parsing [sent. 3504 len. 21]: `` But _ do n't _ you think they 've got the nicest eyes of any boy in town ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3505 len. 5]: Patty insisted , appealingly .
Parsing [sent. 3506 len. 16]: `` I think , '' said Florence , `` their eyes are just horrable ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3507 len. 5]: `` What ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3508 len. 52]: _ Herbert 's _ eyes , '' continued Florence , ardently , `` are the very worst lookin ' ole squinty eyes I ever saw , and that nasty little Henry _ Rooter 's _ eyes -- '' But Patty had suddenly become fidgety ; she hurried away from the fence .
Parsing [sent. 3509 len. 11]: `` Come over here , Florence , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3510 len. 16]: `` Let 's go over to the other side of the yard and talk . ''
Parsing [sent. 3511 len. 11]: It was time for her to take some such action .
Parsing [sent. 3512 len. 37]: Messrs. Atwater and Rooter , seated quietly together upon a box on the other side of the fence -LRB- though with their backs to the knot-hole -RRB- , were beginning to show signs of inward disturbance .
Parsing [sent. 3513 len. 22]: Already flushed with the unexpected ineffabilities overheard , their complexions had grown even pinker upon Florence 's open-hearted expressions of opinion .
Parsing [sent. 3514 len. 24]: Slowly they turned their heads to look at the fence , upon the other side of which stood the maligner of their eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3515 len. 39]: Not that they cared what _ that _ ole girl thought -- but she ought n't to be allowed to go around talking like this and perhaps prejudicing everybody that had a kind word to say for them .
Parsing [sent. 3516 len. 21]: `` Come on over here , Florence , '' called Patty huskily , from the other side of the yard .
Parsing [sent. 3517 len. 8]: `` Let 's talk over here . ''
Parsing [sent. 3518 len. 7]: Florence was puzzled , but consented .
Parsing [sent. 3519 len. 11]: `` What you want to talk over here for ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3520 len. 9]: she asked as she came near her friend .
Parsing [sent. 3521 len. 12]: `` Oh , I do n't know , '' said Patty .
Parsing [sent. 3522 len. 11]: `` Let 's go out in the front yard . ''
Parsing [sent. 3523 len. 35]: She led the way round the house , and a moment later uttered a cry of surprise as the firm of Atwater & Rooter , passing along the pavement , hesitated at the gate .
Parsing [sent. 3524 len. 21]: Their celebrated eyes showed doubt for a moment , then a brazenness : Herbert and Henry decided to come in .
Parsing [sent. 3525 len. 9]: `` Is n't this the funniest thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3526 len. 3]: cried Patty .
Parsing [sent. 3527 len. 16]: `` After what I just said awhile ago -- _ you _ know , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3528 len. 9]: Do n't you dare to tell 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3529 len. 9]: `` I cert ` nly wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3530 len. 23]: her hostess promised , and , turning inhospitably to the two callers , `` What on earth you want around here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3531 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3532 len. 10]: Herbert chivalrously took upon himself the duty of response .
Parsing [sent. 3533 len. 18]: `` Look here ; this is my own aunt and uncle 's yard , is n't it ?
Parsing [sent. 3534 len. 17]: I guess if I want to come in it I got a perfect right to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3535 len. 12]: `` I should say so , '' his partner said warmly .
Parsing [sent. 3536 len. 7]: `` Why , of course ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3537 len. 5]: the cordial Patty agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3538 len. 12]: `` We can play some nice Sunday games , or something .
Parsing [sent. 3539 len. 15]: Let 's sit on the porch steps and think what to do . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3540 len. 13]: _ I _ just as soon , '' said Henry Rooter . ''
Parsing [sent. 3541 len. 13]: _ I _ got nothin ' p ` ticular to do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3542 len. 10]: `` I have n't either , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 3543 len. 10]: Thereupon , Patty sat between them on the steps .
Parsing [sent. 3544 len. 9]: `` This is _ per-feckly _ grand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3545 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 3546 len. 21]: `` Come on , Florence , are n't you going to sit down with all the rest of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3547 len. 11]: `` Well , pray kindly excuse _ me _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3548 len. 45]: said Miss Atwater ; and she added that she would neither sit on the same steps with Herbert Atwater and Henry Rooter , nor , even if they entreated her with accompanying genuflections , would she have anything else whatever to do with them .
Parsing [sent. 3549 len. 56]: She concluded with a reference to the oldest pair of shoes she might ever come to possess ; and withdrew to the railing of the veranda at a point farthest from the steps ; and , seated there , swinging one foot rhythmically , she sang hymns in a tone at once plaintive and inimical .
Parsing [sent. 3550 len. 19]: It was not lost upon her , however , that her withdrawal had little effect upon her guests .
Parsing [sent. 3551 len. 66]: They chattered gaily , and Patty devised , or remembered , harmless little games that could be played by a few people as well as by many ; and the three participants were so congenial and noisy and made so merry , that before long Florence was unable to avoid the impression that whether she liked it or not she was giving quite a party .
Parsing [sent. 3552 len. 37]: At times the noted eyes of Atwater & Rooter were gentled o'er with the soft cast of enchantment , especially when Patty felt called upon to reprove the two with little coquetries of slaps and pushes .
Parsing [sent. 3553 len. 71]: Noted for her sprightliness , she was never sprightlier ; her pretty laughter tooted continuously , and the gentlemen accompanied it with doting sounds so repulsive to Florence that without being actively conscious of what she did , she embodied the phrase , `` perfeckly sickening , '' in the hymn she was crooning , and repeated it over and over to the air of `` Rock of Ages . ''
Parsing [sent. 3554 len. 34]: `` Now I tell you what let 's play , '' the versatile Patty proposed , after exhausting the pleasures of `` Geography , '' `` Ghosts '' and other tests of intellect .
Parsing [sent. 3555 len. 8]: `` Let 's play ` Truth . '
Parsing [sent. 3556 len. 72]: We 'll each take a piece o ' paper and a pencil , and then each of us asks the other one some question , and we haf to write down the answer and sign your name and fold it up so nobody can see it except the one that asked the question , and we haf to keep it a secret and never tell as long as we live . ''
Parsing [sent. 3557 len. 9]: `` All right , '' said Henry Rooter .
Parsing [sent. 3558 len. 15]: `` I 'll be the one to ask you a question , Patty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3559 len. 8]: `` No , '' Herbert said promptly .
Parsing [sent. 3560 len. 12]: `` I ought to be the one to ask Patty . ''
Parsing [sent. 3561 len. 6]: `` Why ought you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3562 len. 3]: Henry demanded .
Parsing [sent. 3563 len. 6]: `` Why ought you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3564 len. 4]: `` Listen ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3565 len. 14]: Patty cried , '' _ I _ know the way we 'll do .
Parsing [sent. 3566 len. 32]: I 'll ask each of you a question -- we haf to whisper it -- and each one of you 'll ask me one , and then we 'll write it .
Parsing [sent. 3567 len. 7]: That 'll be simply grand ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3568 len. 9]: She clapped her hands ; then checked herself .
Parsing [sent. 3569 len. 10]: `` Oh , I guess we ca n't either .
Parsing [sent. 3570 len. 19]: We have n't got any paper and pencils unless -- '' Here she seemed to recall her hostess .
Parsing [sent. 3571 len. 7]: `` Oh , Florrie , dear !
Parsing [sent. 3572 len. 13]: Run in the house and get us some paper and pencils . ''
Parsing [sent. 3573 len. 44]: Florence gave no sign other than to increase the volume of her voice as she sang : `` Perf ` ly sick ` ning , clef ' for me , let me _ perf ' _ ly sick-kin - _ ning _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3574 len. 34]: `` We got plenty , '' said Herbert ; whereupon he and Henry produced pencils and their professional note-books , and supplied their fair friend and themselves with material for `` Truth . ''
Parsing [sent. 3575 len. 14]: `` Come on , Patty , whisper me whatever you want to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3576 len. 20]: `` No ; I ought to have her whisper _ me _ , first , '' Henry Rooter objected .
Parsing [sent. 3577 len. 22]: `` I 'll write the answer to _ any _ question ; I do n't care what it 's about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3578 len. 21]: `` Well , it 's got to be the _ truth _ , you know , '' Patty warned them .
Parsing [sent. 3579 len. 21]: `` We all haf to write down just exackly the truth on our word of honour and sign our name .
Parsing [sent. 3580 len. 3]: Promise ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3581 len. 4]: They promised earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 3582 len. 8]: `` All right , '' said Patty .
Parsing [sent. 3583 len. 23]: `` Now I 'll whisper Henry a question first , and then you can whisper yours to me first , Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 3584 len. 30]: This seemed to fill all needs happily , and the whispering and writing began , and continued with a coziness little to the taste of the piously singing Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3585 len. 52]: She altered all previous opinions of her friend Patty , and when the latter finally closed the session on the steps , and announced that she must go home , the hostess declined to accompany her into the house to help her find where she had left her hat and wrap .
Parsing [sent. 3586 len. 16]: `` I have n't the _ least _ idea where I took 'em off ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3587 len. 7]: Patty declared in the airiest manner .
Parsing [sent. 3588 len. 32]: `` If you wo n't come with me , Florrie , s ` pose you just call in the front door and tell your mother to get 'em for me . ''
Parsing [sent. 3589 len. 29]: `` Oh , they 're _ somewhere _ in there , '' Florence said coldly , not ceasing to swing her foot , and not turning her head .
Parsing [sent. 3590 len. 33]: `` You can find 'em by yourself , I presume , or if you ca n't I 'll have our maid throw 'em out in the yard or somep 'n to-morrow . ''
Parsing [sent. 3591 len. 9]: `` Well , _ thank _ you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3592 len. 10]: Miss Fairchild rejoined , as she entered the house .
Parsing [sent. 3593 len. 20]: The two boys stood waiting , having in mind to go with Patty as far as her own gate .
Parsing [sent. 3594 len. 14]: `` That 's a _ pretty _ way to speak to company ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3595 len. 9]: Herbert addressed his cousin with heavily marked severity .
Parsing [sent. 3596 len. 24]: `` Next time you do anything like that I 'll march straight in the house and inform your mother of the fact . ''
Parsing [sent. 3597 len. 10]: Florence still swung her foot and looked dreamily away .
Parsing [sent. 3598 len. 38]: She sang , to the air of `` Rock of Ages '' : `` Henry Rooter , Herbert , too -- they make me sick , they make me sick , that 's what they do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3599 len. 13]: However , they were only too well prepared with their annihilating response .
Parsing [sent. 3600 len. 7]: `` Oh , say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3601 len. 6]: Florence , say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3602 len. 3]: _ Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3603 len. 6]: _ Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3604 len. 51]: They even sent this same odious refrain back to her from the street , as they departed with their lovely companion ; and , so tenuous is feminine loyalty sometimes , under these stresses , Miss Fairchild mingled her sweet , tantalizing young soprano with their changing and cackling falsetto .
Parsing [sent. 3605 len. 7]: `` Say not so , Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3606 len. 6]: Oh , say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3607 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3608 len. 56]: CHAPTER EIGHTEEN They went satirically down the street , their chumminess with one another bountifully increased by their common derision of the outsider on the porch ; and even at a distance they still contrived to make themselves intolerable ; looking back over their shoulders , at intervals , with say-not-so expressions on their faces .
Parsing [sent. 3609 len. 23]: Even when these faces were far enough away to be but yellowish oval planes , their say-not-so expressions were still bitingly eloquent .
Parsing [sent. 3610 len. 39]: Now a northern breeze chilled the air , as the hateful three became indistinguishable in the haze of autumn dusk , whereupon Florence stopped swinging her foot , left the railing , and went morosely into the house .
Parsing [sent. 3611 len. 50]: And here it was her fortune to make two discoveries vital to her present career ; the first arising out of a conversation between her father and mother in the library , where a gossipy fire of soft coal encouraged this proper Sunday afternoon entertainment for man and wife .
Parsing [sent. 3612 len. 13]: `` Sit down and rest , Florence , '' said her mother .
Parsing [sent. 3613 len. 16]: `` I 'm afraid you play too hard when Patty and the boys are here .
Parsing [sent. 3614 len. 12]: Do sit down quietly and rest yourself a little while . ''
Parsing [sent. 3615 len. 25]: And as Florence obeyed , Mrs. Atwater turned to her husband , resuming : `` Well , that 's what _ I _ said .
Parsing [sent. 3616 len. 17]: I told Aunt Carrie I thought the same way about it that _ you _ did .
Parsing [sent. 3617 len. 27]: Of course nobody _ ever _ knows what Julia 's going to do next , and nobody needs to be surprised at anything she does do .
Parsing [sent. 3618 len. 37]: Ever since she came home from school , about four-fifths of all the young men in town have been wild about her -- and so 's every old bachelor , for the matter of that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3619 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' Mr. Atwater added .
Parsing [sent. 3620 len. 9]: `` And every old widower , too . ''
Parsing [sent. 3621 len. 7]: His wife warmly accepted the amendment .
Parsing [sent. 3622 len. 14]: `` And every old widower , too , '' she said , nodding .
Parsing [sent. 3623 len. 3]: `` Rather !
Parsing [sent. 3624 len. 30]: And of course Julia 's just done exactly as she pleased about everything , and naturally she 's going to do as she pleases about _ this _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3625 len. 19]: `` Well , of course it 's her own affair , Mollie , '' Mr. Atwater said mildly .
Parsing [sent. 3626 len. 26]: `` She could n't be expected to consult the whole Atwater family connection before she -- '' `` Oh , no , '' she agreed .
Parsing [sent. 3627 len. 8]: `` I do n't say she could .
Parsing [sent. 3628 len. 35]: Still , it _ is _ rather upsetting , coming so suddenly like this , when not one of the family has ever seen him -- never even heard his very name before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3629 len. 24]: -LSB- Illustration : _ '' ` Well , men ... I do n't want to see any loafin ' around here , men .
Parsing [sent. 3630 len. 14]: I expect I 'll have a pretty good newspaper this week . ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3631 len. 16]: _ -RSB- `` Well , that part of it is n't especially strange , Mollie .
Parsing [sent. 3632 len. 15]: He was born and brought up in a town three hundred miles from here .
Parsing [sent. 3633 len. 28]: I do n't see just how we _ could _ have heard his name unless he visited here or got into the papers in some way . ''
Parsing [sent. 3634 len. 10]: Mrs. Atwater seemed unwilling to yield a mysterious point .
Parsing [sent. 3635 len. 36]: She rocked decorously in her rocking-chair , shook her head , and after setting her lips rigidly , opened them to insist that she could never change her mind : Julia had acted very abruptly .
Parsing [sent. 3636 len. 23]: `` Why could n't she have let her poor father know at least a _ few _ days before she did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3637 len. 4]: Mr. Atwater sighed .
Parsing [sent. 3638 len. 23]: `` Why , she explains in her letter that she only knew it , herself , an hour before she wrote . ''
Parsing [sent. 3639 len. 6]: `` Her poor father ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3640 len. 5]: his wife repeated commiseratingly .
Parsing [sent. 3641 len. 18]: `` Why , Mollie , I do n't see how father 's especially to be pitied . ''
Parsing [sent. 3642 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3643 len. 4]: said Mrs. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 3644 len. 23]: `` That old man , to have to live in that big house all alone , except a few negro servants ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3645 len. 5]: `` Why , no !
Parsing [sent. 3646 len. 39]: About half the houses in the neighbourhood , up and down the street , are fully occupied by close relatives of his : I doubt if he 'll be really as lonely as he 'd like to be .
Parsing [sent. 3647 len. 21]: And he 's often said he 'd give a great deal if Julia had been a plain , unpopular girl .
Parsing [sent. 3648 len. 17]: I 'm strongly of the opinion , myself , that he 'll be pleased about this .
Parsing [sent. 3649 len. 12]: Of course it may upset him a little at first . ''
Parsing [sent. 3650 len. 9]: `` Yes ; I think it will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3651 len. 7]: Mrs. Atwater shook her head forebodingly .
Parsing [sent. 3652 len. 15]: `` And he is n't the only one it 's going to upset . ''
Parsing [sent. 3653 len. 13]: `` No , he is n't , '' her husband admitted seriously .
Parsing [sent. 3654 len. 48]: `` That 's always been the trouble with Julia ; she never could bear to seem disappointing ; and so , of course , I suppose every one of 'em has a special idea that he 's really about the top of the list with her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3655 len. 16]: `` Every last one of 'em is positive of it , '' said Mrs. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 3656 len. 10]: `` That was Julia 's way with 'em ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3657 len. 17]: `` Yes , Julia 's always been much too kind-hearted for other people 's good . ''
Parsing [sent. 3658 len. 13]: Thus Mr. Atwater summed up Julia ; and he was her brother .
Parsing [sent. 3659 len. 16]: Additionally , since he was the older , he had known her since her birth .
Parsing [sent. 3660 len. 29]: `` If you ask _ me _ , '' said his wife , `` I 'll really be surprised if it all goes through without a suicide . ''
Parsing [sent. 3661 len. 14]: `` Oh , not quite suicide , perhaps , '' Mr. Atwater protested .
Parsing [sent. 3662 len. 13]: `` I 'm glad it 's a fairly dry town though . ''
Parsing [sent. 3663 len. 8]: She failed to fathom his simple meaning .
Parsing [sent. 3664 len. 4]: `` Why ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3665 len. 19]: `` Well , some of 'em might feel _ that _ desperate at least , '' he explained .
Parsing [sent. 3666 len. 12]: `` Prohibition 's a safeguard for the disappointed in love . ''
Parsing [sent. 3667 len. 31]: This phrase and a previous one stirred Florence , who had been sitting quietly , according to request , and `` resting '' , but not resting her curiosity . ''
Parsing [sent. 3668 len. 11]: _ Who 's _ disappointed in love , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3669 len. 13]: she inquired with an explosive eagerness that slightly startled her preoccupied parents .
Parsing [sent. 3670 len. 28]: `` What _ is _ all this about Aunt Julia , and grandpa goin ' to live alone , and people committing suicide and prohibition and everything ?
Parsing [sent. 3671 len. 10]: What _ is _ all this , mamma ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3672 len. 6]: `` Nothing , Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 3673 len. 3]: `` Nothing !
Parsing [sent. 3674 len. 21]: That 's what you always say about the very most inter ` sting things that happen in the whole family !
Parsing [sent. 3675 len. 10]: What _ is _ all this , papa ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3676 len. 14]: `` It 's nothing that would be interesting to little girls , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3677 len. 6]: Merely some family matters . ''
Parsing [sent. 3678 len. 5]: `` My goodness ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3679 len. 3]: Florence exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3680 len. 14]: `` I 'm not a ` little girl ' any more , papa !
Parsing [sent. 3681 len. 9]: You 're _ always _ forgetting my age !
Parsing [sent. 3682 len. 27]: And if it 's a family matter I belong to the family , I guess , about as much as anybody else , do n't I ?
Parsing [sent. 3683 len. 28]: Grandpa himself is n't any _ more _ one of the family than I am , I do n't care _ how _ old he is ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3684 len. 9]: This was undeniable , and her father laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3685 len. 19]: `` It 's really nothing you 'd care about one way or the other , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3686 len. 18]: `` Well , I 'd care about it if it 's a secret , '' Florence insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3687 len. 19]: `` If it 's a secret I 'd want to know it , whatever it 's about . ''
Parsing [sent. 3688 len. 14]: `` Oh , it is n't a secret , particularly , I suppose .
Parsing [sent. 3689 len. 25]: At least , it 's not to be made public for a time ; it 's only to be known in the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 3690 len. 32]: `` Well , did n't I just _ prove _ I 'm as much one o ' the family as -- '' `` Never mind , '' her father said soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 3691 len. 22]: `` I do n't suppose there 's any harm in your knowing it -- if you wo n't go telling everybody .
Parsing [sent. 3692 len. 13]: Your Aunt Julia has just written us that she 's engaged . ''
Parsing [sent. 3693 len. 15]: Mrs. Atwater uttered an exclamation , but she was too late to check him .
Parsing [sent. 3694 len. 12]: `` I 'm afraid you ought n't to have told Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3695 len. 15]: She _ is n't _ just the most discreet -- '' `` Pshaw ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3696 len. 3]: he laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3697 len. 25]: `` She certainly is ` one of the family ' , however , and Julia wrote that all of the family might be told .
Parsing [sent. 3698 len. 16]: You 'll not speak of it outside the family , will you , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3699 len. 33]: But Florence was not yet able to speak of it , even inside the family ; so surprising , sometimes , are parents ' theories of what will not interest their children .
Parsing [sent. 3700 len. 25]: She sat staring , her mouth open , and in the uncertain illumination of the room these symptoms of her emotional condition went unobserved .
Parsing [sent. 3701 len. 22]: `` I say , you wo n't speak of Julia 's engagement outside the family , will you , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3702 len. 4]: `` Papa ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3703 len. 3]: she gasped .
Parsing [sent. 3704 len. 12]: `` Did Aunt Julia write she was _ engaged _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3705 len. 4]: `` Yes . ''
Parsing [sent. 3706 len. 8]: `` To get _ married _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3707 len. 7]: `` It would seem so . ''
Parsing [sent. 3708 len. 8]: `` To _ who _ ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3709 len. 13]: ` To whom , ' Florence , '' her mother suggested primly .
Parsing [sent. 3710 len. 4]: `` Mamma ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3711 len. 4]: the daughter cried .
Parsing [sent. 3712 len. 11]: `` Who 's Aunt Julia engaged to get married to ?
Parsing [sent. 3713 len. 4]: Noble Dill ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3714 len. 9]: `` Good gracious , _ no _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3715 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater exclaimed .
Parsing [sent. 3716 len. 6]: `` What an absurd idea !
Parsing [sent. 3717 len. 20]: It 's to a young man in the place she 's visiting -- a stranger to all of us .
Parsing [sent. 3718 len. 10]: Julia only met him a few weeks ago . ''
Parsing [sent. 3719 len. 20]: Here she forgot Florence , and turned again to her husband , wearing her former expression of experienced foreboding .
Parsing [sent. 3720 len. 8]: `` It 's just as I said .
Parsing [sent. 3721 len. 13]: It 's exactly like Julia to do such a reckless thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3722 len. 29]: `` But as we do n't know anything at all about the young man , '' he remonstrated , `` how do you know it 's reckless ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3723 len. 10]: `` How do you know he 's young ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3724 len. 5]: Mrs. Atwater retorted crisply .
Parsing [sent. 3725 len. 16]: `` All in the world she said about him was that he 's a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 3726 len. 21]: He may be a widower , for all we know , or divorced , with seven or eight children . ''
Parsing [sent. 3727 len. 8]: `` Oh , no , Mollie ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3728 len. 9]: `` Why , he _ might _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3729 len. 3]: she insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3730 len. 31]: `` For all we know , he may be a widower for the third or fourth _ time _ , or divorced , with any _ number _ of children !
Parsing [sent. 3731 len. 19]: If such a person proposed to Julia , you know yourself she 'd hate to be disappointing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3732 len. 4]: Her husband laughed .
Parsing [sent. 3733 len. 30]: `` I do n't think she 'd go so far as to actually accept ` such a person ' and write home to announce her engagement to the family .
Parsing [sent. 3734 len. 59]: I suppose most of her swains here have been in the habit of proposing to her just as frequently as she was unable to prevent them from going that far ; and while I do n't think she 's been as discouraging with them as she might have been , she 's never really accepted any of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3735 len. 8]: She 's never been engaged before . ''
Parsing [sent. 3736 len. 8]: `` No , '' Mrs. Atwater admitted .
Parsing [sent. 3737 len. 6]: `` Not to this extent !
Parsing [sent. 3738 len. 15]: She 's never quite announced it to the family before , that is . ''
Parsing [sent. 3739 len. 17]: `` Yes ; I 'd hate to have Julia 's job when she comes back ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3740 len. 6]: Julia 's brother admitted ruefully .
Parsing [sent. 3741 len. 5]: `` What job ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3742 len. 8]: `` Breaking it to her admirers . ''
Parsing [sent. 3743 len. 14]: `` Oh , _ she _ is n't going to do that ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3744 len. 12]: `` She 'll have to , now , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3745 len. 27]: `` She 'll either have to write the news to 'em , or else tell 'em , face to face , when she comes home . ''
Parsing [sent. 3746 len. 8]: `` She wo n't do either . ''
Parsing [sent. 3747 len. 12]: `` Why , how could she get out of it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3748 len. 5]: His wife smiled pityingly .
Parsing [sent. 3749 len. 14]: `` She has n't set a time for coming home , has she ?
Parsing [sent. 3750 len. 23]: Do n't you know enough of Julia 's ways to see she 'll never in the world stand up to the music ?
Parsing [sent. 3751 len. 77]: She writes that all the family can be told , because she knows the news will leak out , here and there , in confidence , little by little , so by the time she gets home they 'll all have been through their first spasms , and after that she hopes they 'll just send her some forgiving flowers and greet her with manly hand-clasps -- and get ready to usher at the wedding ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3752 len. 16]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Atwater , `` I 'm afraid you 're right .
Parsing [sent. 3753 len. 18]: It does seem rather like Julia to stay away till the first of the worst is over .
Parsing [sent. 3754 len. 9]: I 'm really sorry for some of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 3755 len. 33]: I suppose it _ will _ get whispered about , and they 'll hear it ; and there are some of the poor things that might take it pretty hard . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 3756 len. 8]: ` Take it pretty hard ! ' ''
Parsing [sent. 3757 len. 5]: his wife echoed loudly .
Parsing [sent. 3758 len. 21]: `` There 's _ one _ of 'em , at least , who 'll just merely lose his reason ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3759 len. 5]: `` Which one ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3760 len. 5]: `` Noble Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 3761 len. 32]: At this , the slender form of Florence underwent a spasmodic seizure in her chair , but as the fit was short and also noiseless , it passed without being noticed .
Parsing [sent. 3762 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' said Mr. Atwater thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 3763 len. 7]: `` I suppose he will . ''
Parsing [sent. 3764 len. 6]: `` He certainly will ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3765 len. 4]: Mrs. Atwater declared .
Parsing [sent. 3766 len. 49]: `` Noble 's mother told me last week that he 'd got so he was just as liable to drop a fountain-pen in his coffee as a lump of sugar ; and when any one speaks to him he either does n't know it , or else jumps .
Parsing [sent. 3767 len. 21]: When he says anything , himself , she says they can scarcely ever make out what he 's talking about .
Parsing [sent. 3768 len. 26]: He was trying enough before Julia went away ; but since she 's been gone Mrs. Dill says he 's like nothing in her experience .
Parsing [sent. 3769 len. 19]: She says he does n't inherit it ; Mr. Dill was n't anything like this about her . ''
Parsing [sent. 3770 len. 5]: Mr. Atwater smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 3771 len. 10]: `` Mrs. Dill was n't anything like Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 3772 len. 8]: `` No , '' said his wife .
Parsing [sent. 3773 len. 8]: `` She was quite a sensible girl .
Parsing [sent. 3774 len. 22]: I 'd hate to be in her place now , though , when she tells Noble about _ this _ . ''
Parsing [sent. 3775 len. 17]: `` How can Mrs. Dill tell him , since she does n't know it herself ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3776 len. 19]: `` Well -- perhaps she ought to know it , so that she _ could _ tell him .
Parsing [sent. 3777 len. 19]: _ Somebody _ ought to tell him , and it ought to be done with the greatest tact .
Parsing [sent. 3778 len. 45]: It ought to be broken to him with the most delicate care and sympathy , or the consequences -- '' `` Nobody could foretell the consequences , '' her husband interrupted : -- `` no matter how tactfully it 's broken to Noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 3779 len. 14]: `` No , '' she said , `` I suppose that 's true .
Parsing [sent. 3780 len. 22]: I think the poor thing 's likely to lose his reason unless it _ is _ done tactfully , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 3781 len. 14]: `` Do you think we really ought to tell Mrs. Dill , Mollie ?
Parsing [sent. 3782 len. 9]: I mean , seriously : Do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3783 len. 14]: For some moments she considered his question , then replied , `` No .
Parsing [sent. 3784 len. 58]: It 's possible we 'd be following a Christian course in doing it ; but still we 're rather bound not to speak of it outside the family , and when it does get outside the family I think we 'd better not be the ones responsible -- especially since it might easily be traced to us .
Parsing [sent. 3785 len. 18]: I think it 's usually better to keep out of things when there 's any doubt . ''
Parsing [sent. 3786 len. 9]: `` Yes , '' he said , meditating .
Parsing [sent. 3787 len. 18]: `` I never knew any harm to come of people 's sticking to their own affairs . ''
Parsing [sent. 3788 len. 44]: But as he and his wife became silent for a time , musing in the firelight , their daughter 's special convictions were far from coinciding with theirs , although she , likewise , was silent -- a singularity they should have observed .
Parsing [sent. 3789 len. 44]: So far were they from a true comprehension of her , they were unaware that she had more than a casual , young-cousinly interest in Julia Atwater 's engagement and in those possible consequences to Noble Dill just sketched with some intentional exaggeration .
Parsing [sent. 3790 len. 37]: They did not even notice her expression when Mr. Atwater snapped on the light , in order to read ; and she went quietly out of the library and up the stairs to her own room .
Parsing [sent. 3791 len. 28]: * * * * * On the floor , near her bed , where Patty Fairchild had left her coat and hat , Florence made another discovery .
Parsing [sent. 3792 len. 25]: Two small , folded slips of paper lay there , dropped by Miss Fairchild when she put on her coat in the darkening room .
Parsing [sent. 3793 len. 34]: They were the replies to Patty 's whispered questions in the game on the steps -- the pledged Truth , written by Henry Rooter and Herbert Atwater on their sacred words and honours .
Parsing [sent. 3794 len. 47]: The infatuated pair had either overestimated Patty 's caution , or else each had thought she would so prize his little missive that she would treasure it in a tender safety , perhaps pinned upon her blouse -LRB- at the first opportunity -RRB- over her heart .
Parsing [sent. 3795 len. 77]: It is positively safe to say that neither of the two veracities would ever have been set upon paper had Herbert and Henry any foreshadowing that Patty might be careless ; and the partners would have been seized with the utmost horror could they have conceived the possibility of their trustful messages ever falling into the hands of the relentless creature who now , without an instant 's honourable hesitation , unfolded and read them . ''
Parsing [sent. 3796 len. 24]: _ Yes if I got to tell the truth I know I have got pretty eyes _ , '' Herbert had unfortunately written .
Parsing [sent. 3797 len. 67]: `` I _ am glad you think so too Patty because your eyes are too Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Jr. _ '' And Mr. Henry Rooter had likewise ruined himself in a coincidental manner : '' _ Well Patty my eyes are pretty but suppose I would like to trade with yours because you have beautiful eyes also , sure as my name is Henry Rooter .
Parsing [sent. 3798 len. 26]: _ '' Florence stood close to the pink-shaded electric drop-light over her small white dressing-table , reading again and again these pathetically honest little confidences .
Parsing [sent. 3799 len. 32]: Her eyelids were withdrawn to an unprecedented retirement , so remarkably she stared ; while her mouth seemed to prepare itself for the attempted reception of a bulk beyond its capacity .
Parsing [sent. 3800 len. 44]: And these plastic tokens , so immoderate as to be ordinarily the consequence of nothing short of horror , were overlaid by others , subtler and more gleaming , which wrought the true significance of the contortion -- a joy that was dumfounding .
Parsing [sent. 3801 len. 72]: Her thoughts were first of Fortune 's kindness in selecting her for a favour so miraculously dovetailing into the precise need of her life ; then she considered Henry and Herbert , each at this hour probably brushing his hair in preparation for the Sunday evening meal , and both touchingly unconscious of the calamity now befalling them ; but what eventually engrossed her mind was a thought about Wallie Torbin .
Parsing [sent. 3802 len. 42]: This Master Torbin , fourteen years of age , was in all the town the boy most dreaded by his fellow-boys , and also by girls , including many of both sexes who knew him only by sight -- and hearing .
Parsing [sent. 3803 len. 34]: He had no physical endowment or attainment worth mention ; but boys who could `` whip him with one hand '' became sycophants in his presence ; the terror he inspired was moral .
Parsing [sent. 3804 len. 48]: He had a special over-development of a faculty exercised clumsily enough by most human beings , especially in their youth ; in other words , he had a genius -- not , however , a genius having to do with anything generally recognized as art or science .
Parsing [sent. 3805 len. 65]: True , if he had been a violinist prodigy or mathematical prodigy , he would have had some respect from his fellows -- about equal to that he might have received if he were gifted with some pleasant deformity , such as six toes on a foot -- but he would never have enjoyed such deadly prestige as had actually come to be his .
Parsing [sent. 3806 len. 13]: In brief , then , Wallie Torbin had a genius for mockery .
Parsing [sent. 3807 len. 23]: Almost from his babyhood he had been a child of one purpose : to increase by burlesques the sufferings of unfortunate friends .
Parsing [sent. 3808 len. 40]: If one of them wept , Wallie incessantly pursued him , yelping in horrid mimicry ; if one were chastised he could not appear out-of-doors for days except to encounter Wallie and a complete rehearsal of the recent agony .
Parsing [sent. 3809 len. 5]: `` Quit , Papa !
Parsing [sent. 3810 len. 8]: _ Pah _ - puh , quee-yet !
Parsing [sent. 3811 len. 11]: I 'll _ never _ do it again , Pah-puh !
Parsing [sent. 3812 len. 15]: Oh , _ lem me _ alone , Pah - _ puh _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3813 len. 63]: As he grew older , his insatiate curiosity enabled him to expose unnumbered weaknesses , indiscretions , and social misfortunes on the part of acquaintances and schoolmates ; and to every exposure his noise and energy gave a hideous publicity : the more his victim sought privacy the more persistently he was followed by Wallie , vociferous and attended by hilarious spectators .
Parsing [sent. 3814 len. 30]: But above all other things , what most stimulated the demoniac boy to prodigies of satire was a tender episode or any symptom connected with the dawn of love .
Parsing [sent. 3815 len. 52]: Florence herself had suffered at intervals throughout her eleventh summer because Wallie discovered that Georgie Beck had sent her a valentine ; and the humorist 's many , many squealings of that valentine 's affectionate quatrain finally left her unable to decide which she hated the more , Wallie or Georgie .
Parsing [sent. 3816 len. 35]: That was the worst of Wallie : he never `` let up '' ; and in Florence 's circle there was no more sobering threat than , `` I 'll tell Wallie Torbin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3817 len. 50]: As for Henry Rooter and Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Jr. , they would as soon have had a Head-hunter on their trail as Wallie Torbin in the possession of anything that could incriminate them in an implication of love -- or an acknowledgment -LRB- in their own handwriting ! -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 3818 len. 5]: of their own beauty .
Parsing [sent. 3819 len. 37]: The fabric of civilized life is interwoven with blackmail : even some of the noblest people do favours for other people who are depended upon not to tell somebody something that the noblest people have done .
Parsing [sent. 3820 len. 43]: Blackmail is born into us all , and our nurses teach us more blackmail by threatening to tell our parents if we wo n't do this and that -- and our parents threaten to tell the doctor -- and so we learn !
Parsing [sent. 3821 len. 11]: Blackmail is part of the daily life of a child .
Parsing [sent. 3822 len. 33]: Displeased , his first resort to get his way with other children is a threat to `` tell , '' but by-and-by his experience discovers the mutual benefit of honour among blackmailers .
Parsing [sent. 3823 len. 39]: Therefore , at eight it is no longer the ticket to threaten to tell the teacher ; and , a little later , threatening to tell any adult at all is considered something of a breakdown in morals .
Parsing [sent. 3824 len. 45]: Notoriously , the code is more liable to infraction by people of the physically weaker sex , for the very reason , of course , that their inferiority of muscle so frequently compels such a sin , if they are to have their way .
Parsing [sent. 3825 len. 10]: But for Florence there was now no such temptation .
Parsing [sent. 3826 len. 45]: Looking to the demolition of Atwater & Rooter , an exposure before adults of the results of `` Truth '' would have been an effect of the sickliest pallor compared to what might be accomplished by a careful use of the catastrophic Wallie Torbin .
Parsing [sent. 3827 len. 65]: * * * * * On Sunday evening it was her privileged custom to go to the house of fat old Great-Uncle Joseph and remain until nine o'clock , in chatty companionship with Uncle Joseph and Aunt Carrie , his wife , and a few other relatives -LRB- including Herbert -RRB- who were in the habit of dropping in there , on Sunday evenings .
Parsing [sent. 3828 len. 33]: In summer , lemonade and cake were frequently provided ; in the autumn , one still found cake , and perhaps a pitcher of clear new cider : apples were a certainty .
Parsing [sent. 3829 len. 57]: This evening was glorious : there were apples and cider and cake , with walnuts , perfectly cracked , and a large open-hearted box of candy ; for Uncle Joseph and Aunt Carrie had foreseen the coming of several more Atwaters than usual , to talk over the new affairs of their beautiful relative , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 3830 len. 59]: Seldom have any relative 's new affairs been more thoroughly talked over than were Julia 's that evening ; though all the time by means of symbols , since it was thought wiser that Herbert and Florence should not yet be told of Julia 's engagement ; and Florence 's parents were not present to confess their indiscretion .
Parsing [sent. 3831 len. 29]: Julia was referred to as `` the traveller '' ; other makeshifts were employed with the most knowing caution , and all the while Florence merely ate inscrutably .
Parsing [sent. 3832 len. 13]: The more sincere Herbert was placid ; the foods absorbing his attention .
Parsing [sent. 3833 len. 34]: `` Well , all I say is , the traveller better enjoy herself on her travels , '' said Aunt Fanny , finally , as the subject appeared to be wearing toward exhaustion .
Parsing [sent. 3834 len. 29]: `` She certainly is in for it when the voyaging is over and she arrives in the port she sailed from , and has to show her papers .
Parsing [sent. 3835 len. 27]: I agree with the rest of you : she 'll have a great deal to answer for , and most of all about the shortest one .
Parsing [sent. 3836 len. 17]: My own opinion is that the shortest one is going to burst like a balloon . ''
Parsing [sent. 3837 len. 24]: `` The shortest one , '' as the demure Florence had understood from the first , was none other than her Very Ideal .
Parsing [sent. 3838 len. 20]: Now she looked up from the stool where she sat with her back against a pilaster of the mantelpiece .
Parsing [sent. 3839 len. 15]: `` Uncle Joseph , '' she said ; -- `` I was just thinking .
Parsing [sent. 3840 len. 8]: What is a person 's reason ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3841 len. 17]: The fat gentleman , rosy with firelight and cider , finished his fifth glass before responding .
Parsing [sent. 3842 len. 19]: `` Well , there _ are _ persons I never could find any reason for at all . '
Parsing [sent. 3843 len. 6]: A person 's reason ' ?
Parsing [sent. 3844 len. 15]: What do you mean , ' a person 's reason , ' Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3845 len. 21]: `` I mean : like when somebody says , ` They 'll lose their reason , ' '' she explained .
Parsing [sent. 3846 len. 31]: `` Has everybody got a reason , and if they have , what is it , and how do they lose it , and what would they do then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3847 len. 3]: `` Oh !
Parsing [sent. 3848 len. 4]: I see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3849 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3850 len. 6]: `` You need n't worry .
Parsing [sent. 3851 len. 32]: I suppose since you heard it you 've been hunting all over yourself for your reason and looking to see if there was one hanging out of anybody else , somewhere .
Parsing [sent. 3852 len. 14]: No ; it 's something you ca n't see , ordinarily , Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3853 len. 16]: Losing your reason is just another way of saying , ` going crazy ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3854 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3855 len. 9]: she murmured , and appeared to be disturbed .
Parsing [sent. 3856 len. 18]: At this , Herbert thought proper to offer a witticism for the pleasure of the company . ''
Parsing [sent. 3857 len. 25]: _ You _ know , Florence , '' he said , `` it only means acting like _ you _ most always do . ''
Parsing [sent. 3858 len. 36]: He applauded himself with a burst of changing laughter ranging from a bullfrog croak to a collapsing soprano ; then he added : `` Espeshually when you come around my and Henry 's Newspaper Building !
Parsing [sent. 3859 len. 21]: You cert ` nly ` lose your reason ' every time you come around _ that _ ole place ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3860 len. 34]: `` Well , course I haf to act like the people that 's already there , '' Florence retorted , not sharply , but in a musing tone that should have warned him .
Parsing [sent. 3861 len. 13]: It was not her wont to use a quiet voice for repartee .
Parsing [sent. 3862 len. 10]: Thinking her humble , he laughed the more raucously .
Parsing [sent. 3863 len. 6]: `` Oh , Florence ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3864 len. 4]: he besought her .
Parsing [sent. 3865 len. 5]: `` Say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3866 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3867 len. 6]: `` Children , children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3868 len. 4]: Uncle Joseph remonstrated .
Parsing [sent. 3869 len. 10]: Herbert changed his tone ; he became seriously plaintive .
Parsing [sent. 3870 len. 12]: `` Well , she does act that way , Uncle Joseph !
Parsing [sent. 3871 len. 22]: When she comes around there you 'd think we were runnin ' a lunatic asylum , the way she takes on .
Parsing [sent. 3872 len. 9]: She hollers and bellers and squalls and squawks .
Parsing [sent. 3873 len. 41]: The least little teeny thing she do n't like about the way we run our paper , she comes flappin ' over there and goes to screechin ' around you could hear her out at the Poor House Farm ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3874 len. 13]: `` Now , now , Herbert , '' his Aunt Fanny interposed .
Parsing [sent. 3875 len. 20]: `` Poor little Florence is n't saying anything impolite to you -- not right now , at any rate .
Parsing [sent. 3876 len. 15]: Why do n't you be a little sweet to her just for once ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3877 len. 12]: Her unfortunate expression revolted all the manliness in Herbert 's bosom .
Parsing [sent. 3878 len. 11]: `` Be a little _ sweet _ to her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3879 len. 19]: he echoed with poignant incredulity , and then in candour made plain how poorly Aunt Fanny inspired him .
Parsing [sent. 3880 len. 18]: `` I just exackly as soon be a little sweet to an alligator , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 3881 len. 6]: `` Oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3882 len. 4]: said Aunt Carrie .
Parsing [sent. 3883 len. 5]: `` I would ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3884 len. 3]: Herbert insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3885 len. 5]: `` Or a mosquito .
Parsing [sent. 3886 len. 21]: I 'd rather , to _ either _ of 'em , 'cause anyway they do n't make so much noise .
Parsing [sent. 3887 len. 22]: Why , you just ought to _ hear _ her , '' he went on , growing more and more severe .
Parsing [sent. 3888 len. 36]: `` You ought to just come around our Newspaper Building any afternoon you please , after school , when Henry and I are tryin ' to do our work in anyway _ some _ peace .
Parsing [sent. 3889 len. 22]: Why , she just squawks and squalls and squ -- '' `` It must be terrible , '' Uncle Joseph interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3890 len. 15]: `` What do you do all that for , Florence , every afternoon ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3891 len. 20]: `` Just for exercise , '' she answered dreamily ; and her placidity the more exasperated her journalist cousin .
Parsing [sent. 3892 len. 31]: `` She does it because she thinks _ she _ ought to be runnin ' our own newspaper , my and Henry 's ; that 's why she does it !
Parsing [sent. 3893 len. 48]: She thinks she knows more about how to run newspapers than anybody alive ; but there 's one thing she 's goin ' to find out ; and that is , she do n't get anything _ more _ to do with my and Henry 's newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3894 len. 24]: We would n't have another single one of her ole poems in it , no matter how much she offered to pay us !
Parsing [sent. 3895 len. 26]: Uncle Joseph , I think you ought to _ tell _ her she 's got no business around my and Henry 's Newspaper Building . ''
Parsing [sent. 3896 len. 26]: `` But , Herbert , '' Aunt Fanny suggested ; -- `` you might let Florence have a little share in it of some sort .
Parsing [sent. 3897 len. 8]: Then everything would be all right . ''
Parsing [sent. 3898 len. 5]: `` It would ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3899 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3900 len. 8]: `` It _ woo _ - wud ?
Parsing [sent. 3901 len. 21]: Oh , my goodness , Aunt Fanny , I guess you 'd like to see our newspaper just utterably ruined !
Parsing [sent. 3902 len. 22]: Why , we would n't let that girl have any more to do with it than we would some horse ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3903 len. 6]: `` Oh , oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3904 len. 10]: both Aunt Fanny and Aunt Carrie exclaimed , shocked .
Parsing [sent. 3905 len. 9]: `` We would n't , '' Herbert insisted .
Parsing [sent. 3906 len. 17]: `` A horse would know any amount more how to run a newspaper than she does .
Parsing [sent. 3907 len. 35]: Soon as we got our printing-press , we said right then that we made up our minds Florence Atwater was n't ever goin ' to have a single thing to do with our newspaper .
Parsing [sent. 3908 len. 18]: If you let her have anything to do with anything she wants to run the whole thing .
Parsing [sent. 3909 len. 39]: But she might just as well learn to stay away from our Newspaper Building , because after we got her out yesterday we fixed a way so 's she 'll never get in _ there _ again ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3910 len. 6]: Florence looked at him demurely .
Parsing [sent. 3911 len. 8]: `` Are you sure , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3912 len. 3]: she inquired .
Parsing [sent. 3913 len. 7]: `` Just you try it ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3914 len. 9]: he advised her , and he laughed tauntingly .
Parsing [sent. 3915 len. 16]: `` Just come around to-morrow and try it ; that 's all I ask ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3916 len. 14]: `` I cert ` nly intend to , '' she responded with dignity .
Parsing [sent. 3917 len. 11]: `` I may have a slight supprise for you . ''
Parsing [sent. 3918 len. 11]: `` Oh , _ Florence _ , say not so !
Parsing [sent. 3919 len. 6]: Say not so , Florence !
Parsing [sent. 3920 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3921 len. 39]: At this , she looked full upon him , and already she had something in the nature of a surprise for him ; for so powerful was the still balefulness of her glance that he was slightly startled .
Parsing [sent. 3922 len. 11]: `` I might say not so , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3923 len. 23]: `` I might , if I was speaking of what pretty eyes you say yourself you know you have , Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 3924 len. 4]: It staggered him .
Parsing [sent. 3925 len. 9]: `` What -- what do you mean ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3926 len. 11]: `` Oh , nothin ' , '' she replied airily .
Parsing [sent. 3927 len. 20]: Herbert began to be mistrustful of the solid earth : somewhere there was a fearful threat to his equipoise .
Parsing [sent. 3928 len. 8]: `` What you talkin ' about ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3929 len. 17]: he said with an effort to speak scornfully ; but his sensitive voice almost failed him .
Parsing [sent. 3930 len. 10]: `` Oh , nothin ' , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 3931 len. 41]: `` Just about what pretty eyes you know you have , and Patty 's being pretty , too , and so you 're glad she thinks yours are pretty , the way _ you _ do -- and everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3932 len. 4]: Herbert visibly gulped .
Parsing [sent. 3933 len. 18]: He believed that Patty had betrayed him ; had betrayed the sworn confidence of `` Truth ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3934 len. 14]: `` That 's all I was talkin ' about , '' Florence added .
Parsing [sent. 3935 len. 12]: `` Just about how you knew you had such pretty eyes .
Parsing [sent. 3936 len. 6]: Say not so , Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 3937 len. 5]: Say not so ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3938 len. 5]: `` Look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3939 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 3940 len. 18]: `` When 'd you see Patty again between this afternoon and when you came over here ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3941 len. 10]: `` What makes you think I saw her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3942 len. 7]: `` Did you telephone her ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3943 len. 8]: `` What makes you think so ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3944 len. 5]: Once more Herbert gulped .
Parsing [sent. 3945 len. 23]: `` Well , I guess you 're ready to believe anything anybody tells you , '' he said , with palsied bravado .
Parsing [sent. 3946 len. 14]: `` You do n't believe everything Patty Fairchild says , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3947 len. 5]: `` Why , Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 3948 len. 11]: Does n't she always tell the _ truth _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3949 len. 3]: `` Her ?
Parsing [sent. 3950 len. 29]: Why , half the time , '' poor Herbert babbled , `` you ca n't tell whether she 's just makin ' up what she says or not .
Parsing [sent. 3951 len. 29]: If you 've gone and believed everything that ole girl told you , you have n't got even what little sense I used to think you had ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3952 len. 23]: So base we are under strain , sometimes -- so base when our good name is threatened with the truth of us !
Parsing [sent. 3953 len. 31]: `` I would n't believe anything she said , '' he added , in a sickish voice , `` if she told me fifty times and crossed her heart ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3954 len. 22]: `` Would n't you if she said you _ wrote down _ how pretty you knew your eyes were , Herbert ?
Parsing [sent. 3955 len. 14]: Would n't you if it was on paper in your own handwriting ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3956 len. 13]: `` What 's this about Herbert having ` pretty eyes ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3957 len. 17]: Uncle Joe inquired , again bringing general attention to the young cousins ; and Herbert shuddered .
Parsing [sent. 3958 len. 11]: This fat uncle had an unpleasant reputation as a joker .
Parsing [sent. 3959 len. 24]: The nephew desperately fell back upon the hopeless device of attempting to drown out his opponent 's voice as she began to reply .
Parsing [sent. 3960 len. 10]: He became vociferous with scornful laughter , badly cracked .
Parsing [sent. 3961 len. 6]: `` Florence got mad ! ''
Parsing [sent. 3962 len. 12]: he shouted , mingling the purported information with hoots and cacklings .
Parsing [sent. 3963 len. 20]: `` She got mad because I and Henry played some games with Patty and would n't let her play !
Parsing [sent. 3964 len. 14]: She 's tryin ' to make up stories on us to get even .
Parsing [sent. 3965 len. 5]: She made it up !
Parsing [sent. 3966 len. 6]: It 's all made up !
Parsing [sent. 3967 len. 13]: She -- '' `` No , no , '' Mr. Atwater interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 3968 len. 6]: `` Let Florence tell us .
Parsing [sent. 3969 len. 17]: Florence , what was it about Herbert 's knowing he had ` pretty eyes ' ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3970 len. 8]: Herbert attempted to continue the drowning out .
Parsing [sent. 3971 len. 3]: He bawled .
Parsing [sent. 3972 len. 8]: `` She made it _ up _ !
Parsing [sent. 3973 len. 10]: It 's somep 'n she made up her_self _ !
Parsing [sent. 3974 len. 28]: She -- '' `` Herbert , '' said Uncle Joseph ; -- `` if you do n't keep quiet , I 'll take back the printing-press . ''
Parsing [sent. 3975 len. 11]: Herbert substituted a gulp for the continuation of his noise .
Parsing [sent. 3976 len. 30]: `` Now , Florence , '' said Uncle Joseph , `` tell us what you were saying about how Herbert knows he has such ` pretty eyes ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 3977 len. 10]: Then it seemed to Herbert that a miracle befell .
Parsing [sent. 3978 len. 7]: Florence looked up , smiling modestly .
Parsing [sent. 3979 len. 15]: `` Oh , it was n't anything , Uncle Joseph , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 3980 len. 16]: `` I was Just trying to tease Herbert any way I could think of . ''
Parsing [sent. 3981 len. 8]: `` Oh , was that all ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3982 len. 14]: A hopeful light faded out of Uncle Joseph 's large and inexpressive face .
Parsing [sent. 3983 len. 13]: `` I thought perhaps you 'd detected him in some indiscretion . ''
Parsing [sent. 3984 len. 11]: Florence laughed , `` I was just teasin ' him .
Parsing [sent. 3985 len. 9]: It was n't anything , Uncle Joseph . ''
Parsing [sent. 3986 len. 8]: Hereupon , Herbert resumed a confused breathing .
Parsing [sent. 3987 len. 18]: Dazed , he remained uneasy , profoundly so : and gratitude was no part of his emotion .
Parsing [sent. 3988 len. 40]: He well understood that in conflicts such as these Florence was never susceptible to impulses of compassion ; in fact , if there was warfare between them , experience had taught him to be wariest when she seemed kindest .
Parsing [sent. 3989 len. 38]: He moved away from her , and went into another room where his condition was one of increasing mental discomfort , though he looked over the pictures in his great-uncle 's copy of `` Paradise Lost . ''
Parsing [sent. 3990 len. 17]: These illustrations , by M. Gustave Doré , failed to aid in reassuring his troubled mind .
Parsing [sent. 3991 len. 31]: When Florence left the house , he impulsively accompanied her , maintaining a nervous silence as they walked the short distance between Uncle Joseph 's front gate and her own .
Parsing [sent. 3992 len. 7]: There , however , he spoke .
Parsing [sent. 3993 len. 4]: `` Look here !
Parsing [sent. 3994 len. 19]: You do n't haf to go and believe everything that ole girl told you , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3995 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Florence heartily .
Parsing [sent. 3996 len. 8]: `` I do n't haf to . ''
Parsing [sent. 3997 len. 15]: `` Well , look here , '' he urged , helpless but to repeat .
Parsing [sent. 3998 len. 20]: `` You do n't haf to believe whatever it was she went and told you , do you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 3999 len. 13]: `` What was it you think she told me , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4000 len. 8]: `` All that guff -- you know .
Parsing [sent. 4001 len. 14]: Well , whatever it was you _ said _ she told you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4002 len. 9]: `` I did n't , '' said Florence .
Parsing [sent. 4003 len. 13]: `` I did n't say she told me anything at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4004 len. 11]: `` Well , she did , did n't she ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4005 len. 11]: `` Why , no , '' Florence replied , lightly .
Parsing [sent. 4006 len. 11]: `` She did n't say anything to _ me _ .
Parsing [sent. 4007 len. 34]: Only I 'm glad to have your _ opinion _ of her , how she 's such a story-teller and all -- if I ever want to tell her , and everything ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4008 len. 15]: But Herbert had greater alarms than this , and the greater obscured the lesser .
Parsing [sent. 4009 len. 24]: `` Look here , '' he said , `` if she did n't tell you , how 'd you know it then ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4010 len. 8]: `` How 'd I know what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4011 len. 26]: `` That -- that big story about my ever writin ' I knew I had '' -- he gulped again -- `` pretty eyes . ''
Parsing [sent. 4012 len. 9]: `` Oh , about _ that _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4013 len. 11]: Florence said , and swung the gate shut between them .
Parsing [sent. 4014 len. 77]: `` Well , I guess it 's too late to tell you to-night , Herbert ; but maybe if you and that nasty little Henry Rooter do every single thing I tell you to , and do it just _ exackly _ like I tell you from this time on , why maybe -- I only say ` maybe ' -- well , maybe I 'll tell you some day when I feel like it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4015 len. 54]: She ran up the path and up the veranda steps , but paused before opening the front door , and called back to the waiting Herbert : `` The only person I 'd ever _ think _ of tellin ' about it before I tell you would be a boy I know . ''
Parsing [sent. 4016 len. 26]: She coughed , and added as by an afterthought , `` He 'd just love to know all about it ; I know he would .
Parsing [sent. 4017 len. 20]: So , when I tell anybody about it I 'll only tell just you and this other boy . ''
Parsing [sent. 4018 len. 6]: `` What other boy ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4019 len. 3]: Herbert demanded .
Parsing [sent. 4020 len. 15]: And her reply , thrilling through the darkness , left him demoralized with horror .
Parsing [sent. 4021 len. 5]: `` Wallie Torbin ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4022 len. 28]: CHAPTER NINETEEN The next afternoon , about four o'clock , Herbert stood gloomily at the main entrance of Atwater & Rooter 's Newspaper Building awaiting his partner .
Parsing [sent. 4023 len. 39]: The other entrances were not only nailed fast but massively barricaded ; and this one -LRB- consisting of the ancient carriage-house doors , opening upon a driveway through the yard -RRB- had recently been made effective for exclusion .
Parsing [sent. 4024 len. 71]: A long and heavy plank leaned against the wall , near by , ready to be set in hook-shaped iron supports fastened to the inner sides of the doors ; and when the doors were closed , with this great plank in place , a person inside the building might seem entitled to count upon the enjoyment of privacy , except in case of earthquake , tornado , or fire .
Parsing [sent. 4025 len. 39]: In fact , the size of the plank and the substantial quality of the iron fastenings could be looked upon , from a certain viewpoint , as a real compliment to the energy and persistence of Florence Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 4026 len. 29]: Herbert had been in no complimentary frame of mind , however , when he devised the obstructions , nor was he now in such a frame of mind .
Parsing [sent. 4027 len. 27]: He was pessimistic in regard to his future , and also embarrassed in anticipation of some explanations it would be necessary to make to his partner .
Parsing [sent. 4028 len. 48]: He strongly hoped that Henry 's regular after-school appearance at the Newspaper Building would precede Florence 's , because these explanations required both deliberation and tact , and he was convinced that it would be almost impossible to make them at all if Florence got there first .
Parsing [sent. 4029 len. 56]: He understood that he was unfortunately within her power ; and he saw that it would be dangerous to place in operation for her exclusion from the Building this new mechanism contrived with such hopeful care , and at a cost of two dollars and twenty-five cents taken from the _ Oriole 's _ treasury .
Parsing [sent. 4030 len. 34]: What he wished Henry to believe was that for some good reason , which Herbert had not yet been able to invent , it would be better to show Florence a little politeness .
Parsing [sent. 4031 len. 60]: He had a desperate hope that he might find some diplomatic way to prevail on Henry to be as subservient to Florence as she had seemed to demand , and he was determined to touch any extremity of unveracity , rather than permit the details of his answer in `` Truth '' to come to his partner 's knowledge .
Parsing [sent. 4032 len. 22]: Henry Rooter was not Wallie Torbin ; but in possession of material such as this he could easily make himself intolerable .
Parsing [sent. 4033 len. 30]: Therefore , it was in a flurried state of mind that Herbert waited ; and when his friend appeared , over the fence , his perturbation was not decreased .
Parsing [sent. 4034 len. 13]: He even failed to notice the unusual gravity of Henry 's manner .
Parsing [sent. 4035 len. 5]: `` Hello , Henry !
Parsing [sent. 4036 len. 13]: I thought I would n't start in working till you got here .
Parsing [sent. 4037 len. 29]: I did n't want to haf to come all the way downstairs again to open the door and hi ` st our good ole plank up again . ''
Parsing [sent. 4038 len. 16]: `` I see , '' said Henry , glancing nervously at their good ole plank .
Parsing [sent. 4039 len. 34]: `` Well , I guess Florence 'll never get in _ this _ good ole door -- that is , she wo n't if we do n't let her , or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4040 len. 17]: This final clause would have astonished Herbert if he had been less preoccupied with his troubles .
Parsing [sent. 4041 len. 8]: `` You bet she wo n't ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4042 len. 4]: he said mechanically .
Parsing [sent. 4043 len. 68]: `` She could n't ever get in here again -- if the _ family _ did n't go intafering around and give me the dickens and everything , because they think -- they _ say _ they do , anyhow -- they say they think -- they think -- '' He paused , disguising a little choke as a cough of scorn for the family 's thinking .
Parsing [sent. 4044 len. 10]: `` What did you say your family think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4045 len. 4]: Henry asked absently .
Parsing [sent. 4046 len. 18]: `` Well , they say we ought to let her have a share in our newspaper . ''
Parsing [sent. 4047 len. 18]: Again he paused , afraid to continue lest his hypocrisy appear so bare-faced as to invite suspicion .
Parsing [sent. 4048 len. 27]: `` Well , maybe we _ ought _ , '' he said finally , his eyes guiltily upon his toe , which slowly scuffed the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4049 len. 18]: `` I do n't say we ought , and I do n't say we ought n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4050 len. 21]: He expected at the least a sharp protest from his partner , who , on the contrary , surprised him .
Parsing [sent. 4051 len. 18]: `` Well , that 's the way _ I _ look at it , '' Henry said .
Parsing [sent. 4052 len. 17]: `` I do n't say we ought and I do n't say we ought n't . ''
Parsing [sent. 4053 len. 17]: And he , likewise , stared at the toe of a shoe that scuffed the ground .
Parsing [sent. 4054 len. 21]: Herbert felt a little better ; this particular subdivision of his difficulties seemed to be working out with unexpected ease .
Parsing [sent. 4055 len. 20]: `` I do n't say we will and I do n't say we wo n't , '' Henry added .
Parsing [sent. 4056 len. 10]: `` That 's the way I look at it .
Parsing [sent. 4057 len. 39]: My father and mother are always talkin ' to me : how I got to be polite and everything , and I guess maybe it 's time I began to pay some ` tention to what they say .
Parsing [sent. 4058 len. 17]: You do n't have your father and mother for always , you know , Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 4059 len. 12]: Herbert 's mood at once chimed with this unprecedented filial melancholy .
Parsing [sent. 4060 len. 9]: `` No , you do n't , Henry .
Parsing [sent. 4061 len. 10]: That 's what I often think about , myself .
Parsing [sent. 4062 len. 38]: No , sir , a fellow does n't have his father and mother to advise him our whole life , and you ought to do a good deal what they say while they 're still alive . ''
Parsing [sent. 4063 len. 44]: `` That 's what I say , '' Henry agreed gloomily ; and then , without any alteration of his tone , or of the dejected thoughtfulness of his attitude , he changed the subject in a way that painfully startled his companion .
Parsing [sent. 4064 len. 11]: `` Have you seen Wallie Torbin to-day , Herbert ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4065 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4066 len. 9]: `` Have you seen Wallie Torbin to-day ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4067 len. 3]: Herbert swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 4068 len. 16]: `` Why , what makes -- what makes you ask me that , Henry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4069 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4070 len. 7]: `` Oh , nothin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4071 len. 11]: Henry still kept his eyes upon his gloomily scuffing toe .
Parsing [sent. 4072 len. 33]: `` I just wondered , because I did n't happen to see him in school this afternoon when I happened to look in the door of the Eight-A when it was open .
Parsing [sent. 4073 len. 12]: I did n't want to know on account of anything particular .
Parsing [sent. 4074 len. 57]: I just happened to say that about him because I did n't have anything else to think about just then , so I just happened to think about him , the way you do when you have n't got anything much on your mind and might get to thinkin ' about you ca n't tell what .
Parsing [sent. 4075 len. 23]: That 's all the way it was ; I just happened to kind of wonder if he was around anywhere maybe . ''
Parsing [sent. 4076 len. 16]: Henry 's tone was obviously , even elaborately , sincere ; and Herbert was reassured .
Parsing [sent. 4077 len. 13]: `` Well , I did n't see him , '' he responded .
Parsing [sent. 4078 len. 7]: `` Maybe he 's sick . ''
Parsing [sent. 4079 len. 12]: `` No , he is n't , '' his friend said .
Parsing [sent. 4080 len. 17]: `` Florence said she saw him chasin ' his dog down the street about noon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4081 len. 10]: At this Herbert 's uneasiness was uncomfortably renewed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4082 len. 5]: _ Florence _ did ?
Parsing [sent. 4083 len. 7]: Where 'd you see Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4084 len. 4]: Mr. Rooter swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 4085 len. 14]: `` A little while ago , '' he said , and again swallowed .
Parsing [sent. 4086 len. 9]: `` On the way home from school . ''
Parsing [sent. 4087 len. 7]: `` Look -- look here ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4088 len. 9]: Herbert was flurried to the point of panic .
Parsing [sent. 4089 len. 21]: `` Henry -- did Florence -- did she go and tell you -- did she tell you -- ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4090 len. 19]: _ I _ did n't hardly notice what she was talkin ' about , '' Henry said doggedly .
Parsing [sent. 4091 len. 19]: `` She did n't have anything to say that _ I 'd _ ever care two cents about .
Parsing [sent. 4092 len. 37]: She came up behind me and walked along with me a ways , but I got too many things on my mind to hardly pay the least attention to anything _ she _ ever talks about .
Parsing [sent. 4093 len. 27]: She 's a girl what I think about her the less people pay any ` tention to what she says the better off they are . ''
Parsing [sent. 4094 len. 17]: `` That 's the way with me , Henry , '' his partner assured him earnestly .
Parsing [sent. 4095 len. 13]: `` I never pay any notice to what _ she _ says .
Parsing [sent. 4096 len. 33]: The way I figure it out about _ her _ , Henry , everybody 'd be a good deal better off if nobody ever paid the least notice to anything she says .
Parsing [sent. 4097 len. 11]: I never even notice what she says , myself . ''
Parsing [sent. 4098 len. 10]: `` I do n't either , '' said Henry .
Parsing [sent. 4099 len. 38]: `` All _ I _ think about is what my father and mother say , because I 'm not goin ' to have their advice all the rest o ' my life , after they 're dead .
Parsing [sent. 4100 len. 24]: If they want me to be polite , why , I 'll do it and that 's all there is about it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4101 len. 11]: `` It 's the same way with me , Henry .
Parsing [sent. 4102 len. 60]: If she comes flappin ' around here blattin ' and blubbin ' how she 's goin ' to have somep 'n to do with our newspaper , why , the only reason _ I 'd _ ever let her would be because my _ family _ say I ought to show more politeness to her than up to now .
Parsing [sent. 4103 len. 13]: I would n't do it on any other account , Henry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4104 len. 19]: `` Neither would I. That 's just the same way _ I _ look at it , Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 4105 len. 23]: If I ever begin to treat her any better , she 's got my father and mother to thank , not me .
Parsing [sent. 4106 len. 36]: That 's the only reason _ I 'd _ be willing to say we better leave the plank down and let her in , if she comes around here like she 's liable to . ''
Parsing [sent. 4107 len. 8]: `` Well , '' said Herbert . ''
Parsing [sent. 4108 len. 6]: _ I 'm _ willing .
Parsing [sent. 4109 len. 13]: I do n't want to get in trouble with the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 4110 len. 28]: And they mounted the stairs to their editorial , reportorial , and printing rooms ; and began to work in a manner not only preoccupied but apprehensive .
Parsing [sent. 4111 len. 32]: At intervals they would give each other a furtive glance , and then seem to reflect upon their fathers ' and mothers ' wishes and the troublous state of the times .
Parsing [sent. 4112 len. 10]: Florence did not keep them waiting long , however .
Parsing [sent. 4113 len. 16]: She might have been easier to bear had her manner of arrival been less assured .
Parsing [sent. 4114 len. 50]: She romped up the stairs , came skipping across the old floor , swinging her hat by a ribbon , flung open the gate in the sacred railing , and , flouncing into the principal chair , immodestly placed her feet on the table in front of that chair .
Parsing [sent. 4115 len. 21]: Additionally , such was her lively humour , she affected to light and smoke the stub of a lead pencil .
Parsing [sent. 4116 len. 25]: `` Well , men , '' she said heartily , `` I do n't want to see any loafin ' around here , men .
Parsing [sent. 4117 len. 53]: I expect I 'll have a pretty good newspaper this week ; yes , sir , a pretty good newspaper , and I guess you men got to jump around a good deal to do everything I think of , or else maybe I guess I 'll have to turn you off .
Parsing [sent. 4118 len. 13]: I do n't want to haf to do that , men . ''
Parsing [sent. 4119 len. 19]: The blackmailed partners made no reply , on account of an inability that was perfect for the moment .
Parsing [sent. 4120 len. 25]: They stared at her helplessly , though not kindly ; for in their expressions the conflict between desire and policy was almost staringly vivid .
Parsing [sent. 4121 len. 25]: And such was their preoccupation , each with the bitterness of his own case , that neither wondered at the other 's strange complaisance .
Parsing [sent. 4122 len. 21]: Florence made it clear to them that henceforth she was the editor of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 4123 len. 13]: -LRB- She said she had decided not to change the name . -RRB-
Parsing [sent. 4124 len. 26]: She informed them that they were to be her printers ; she did not care to get all inky and nasty herself , she said .
Parsing [sent. 4125 len. 21]: She would , however , do all the writing for her newspaper , and had with her a new poem .
Parsing [sent. 4126 len. 36]: Also , she would furnish all the news and it would be printed just as she wrote it , and printed _ nicely _ , too , or else -- She left the sentence unfinished .
Parsing [sent. 4127 len. 25]: Thus did this cool hand take possession of an established industry , and in much the same fashion did she continue to manage it .
Parsing [sent. 4128 len. 23]: There were unsuppressible protests ; there was covert anguish ; there was even a strike -- but it was a short one .
Parsing [sent. 4129 len. 28]: When the printers remained away from their late Newspaper Building , on Wednesday afternoon , Florence had an interview with Herbert after dinner at his own door .
Parsing [sent. 4130 len. 51]: He explained coldly that Henry and he had grown tired of the printing-press and had decided to put in all their spare time building a theatre in Henry 's attic ; but Florence gave him to understand that the theatre could not be ; she preferred the _ Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 4131 len. 92]: Henry and Herbert had both stopped `` speaking '' to Patty Fairchild , for each believed her treacherous to himself ; but Florence now informed Herbert that far from depending on mere hearsay , she had in her own possession the confession of his knowledge that he had ocular beauty ; that she had discovered the paper where Patty had lost it ; and that it was now in a secure place , and in an envelope , upon the outside of which was already written , `` For Wallie Torbin .
Parsing [sent. 4132 len. 8]: Kindness of Florence A. '' Herbert surrendered .
Parsing [sent. 4133 len. 19]: So did Henry Rooter , a little later that evening , after a telephoned conversation with the slave-driver .
Parsing [sent. 4134 len. 15]: Therefore , the two miserable printers were back in their places the next afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4135 len. 48]: They told each other that the theatre they had planned was n't so much after all ; and anyhow your father and mother did n't last all your life , and it was better to do what they wanted , and be polite while they were alive .
Parsing [sent. 4136 len. 27]: And on Saturday the new _ Oriole _ , now in every jot and item the inspired organ of feminism , made its undeniably sensational appearance .
Parsing [sent. 4137 len. 33]: A copy , neatly folded , was placed in the hand of Noble Dill , as he set forth for his place of business , after lunching at home with his mother .
Parsing [sent. 4138 len. 40]: Florence was the person who placed it there ; she came hurriedly from somewhere in the neighbourhood , out of what yard or alley he did not notice , and slipped the little oblong sheet into his lax fingers .
Parsing [sent. 4139 len. 4]: `` There ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4140 len. 4]: she said breathlessly .
Parsing [sent. 4141 len. 30]: `` There 's a good deal about you in it this week , Mr. Dill , and I guess -- I guess -- '' `` What , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4142 len. 35]: `` I guess maybe you 'll -- '' She looked up at him shyly ; then , with no more to say , turned and ran back in the direction whence she had come .
Parsing [sent. 4143 len. 28]: Noble walked on , not at once examining her little gift , but carrying it absently in fingers still lax at the end of a dangling arm .
Parsing [sent. 4144 len. 9]: There was no life in him for anything .
Parsing [sent. 4145 len. 4]: Julia was away .
Parsing [sent. 4146 len. 2]: Away !
Parsing [sent. 4147 len. 32]: And yet the dazzling creature looked at him from sky , from earth , from air ; looked at him with the most poignant kindness , yet always shook her head !
Parsing [sent. 4148 len. 59]: She had answered his first letter by a kind little note , his second by a kinder and littler one , and his third , fourth , fifth , and sixth by no note at all ; but by the kindest message -LRB- through one of her aunts -RRB- that she was thinking about him a great deal .
Parsing [sent. 4149 len. 8]: And even this was three weeks ago .
Parsing [sent. 4150 len. 9]: Since then from Julia -- nothing at all !
Parsing [sent. 4151 len. 9]: But yesterday something a little stimulating had happened .
Parsing [sent. 4152 len. 36]: On the street , downtown , he had come face to face , momentarily , with Julia 's father ; and for the first time in Noble 's life Mr. Atwater nodded to him pleasantly .
Parsing [sent. 4153 len. 8]: Noble went on his way , elated .
Parsing [sent. 4154 len. 11]: Was there not something almost fatherly in this strange greeting ?
Parsing [sent. 4155 len. 26]: An event so singular might be interpreted in the happiest way : What had Julia written her father , to change him so toward Noble ?
Parsing [sent. 4156 len. 26]: And Noble was still dreamily interpreting as he walked down the street with _ The North End Daily Oriole _ idle in an idle hand .
Parsing [sent. 4157 len. 30]: He found a use for that hand presently , and , having sighed , lifted it to press it upon his brow , but did not complete the gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4158 len. 34]: As his hand came within the scope of his gaze , levelled on the unfathomable distance , he observed that the fingers held a sheet of printed paper ; and he remembered Florence .
Parsing [sent. 4159 len. 15]: Instead of pressing his brow he unfolded the journal she had thrust upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4160 len. 33]: As he began to read , his eye was lustreless , his gait slack and dreary ; but soon his whole demeanour changed , it can not be said for the better .

Parsing [sent. 4191 len. 34]: CHAPTER TWENTY Throughout that afternoon adult members of the Atwater family connection made futile efforts to secure all the copies of the week 's edition of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 4192 len. 6]: It could not be done .
Parsing [sent. 4193 len. 11]: It was a trying time for `` the family . ''
Parsing [sent. 4194 len. 66]: Great Aunt Carrie said that she had the `` worst afternoon of any of 'em , '' because young Newland Sanders came to her house at two and did not leave until five ; all the time counting over , one by one , the hours he 'd spent with Julia since she was seventeen and turned out , unfortunately , to be a Beauty .
Parsing [sent. 4195 len. 49]: Newland had not restrained himself , Aunt Carrie said , and long before he left she wished Julia had never been born -- and as for Herbert Illingsworth Atwater , Junior , the only thing to do with him was to send him to some strict Military School .
Parsing [sent. 4196 len. 31]: Florence 's father telephoned to her mother from downtown at three , and said that Mr. George Plum and the ardent vocalist , Clairdyce , had just left his office .
Parsing [sent. 4197 len. 34]: They had not called in company , however , but coincidentally ; and each had a copy of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ , already somewhat worn with folding and unfolding .
Parsing [sent. 4198 len. 52]: Mr. Clairdyce 's condition was one of desperate calm , Florence 's father said , but Mr. Plum 's agitation left him rather unpresentable for the street , though he had finally gone forth with his hair just as he had rumpled it , and with his hat in his hand .
Parsing [sent. 4199 len. 17]: They wished the truth , they said : Was it true or was it not true ?
Parsing [sent. 4200 len. 34]: Mr. Atwater had told them that he feared Julia was indeed engaged , though he knew nothing of her fiancé 's previous marriage or marriages , or of the number of his children .
Parsing [sent. 4201 len. 10]: They had responded that they cared nothing about that .
Parsing [sent. 4202 len. 16]: This man Crum 's record was a matter of indifference to them , they said .
Parsing [sent. 4203 len. 17]: All they wanted to know was whether Julia was engaged or not -- and she was !
Parsing [sent. 4204 len. 45]: `` The odd thing to _ me _ , '' Mr. Atwater continued to his wife , `` is where on earth Herbert could have got his story about this Crum 's being a widower , and divorced , and with all those children .
Parsing [sent. 4205 len. 25]: Do you know if Julia 's written any of the family about these things and they have n't told the rest of us ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4206 len. 8]: `` No , '' said Mrs. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 4207 len. 8]: `` I 'm sure she has n't .
Parsing [sent. 4208 len. 27]: Every letter she 's written to any of us has passed all through the family , and I know I 've seen every one of 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4209 len. 17]: She 's never said anything about him at all , except that he was a lawyer .
Parsing [sent. 4210 len. 37]: I 'm sure _ I _ ca n't imagine where Herbert got his awful information ; I never thought he was the kind of boy to just make up such things out of whole cloth . ''
Parsing [sent. 4211 len. 79]: Florence , sitting quietly in a chair near by , with a copy of `` Sesame and Lilies '' in her lap , listened to her mother 's side of this conversation with an expression of impersonal interest ; and if she could have realized how completely her parents had forgotten -LRB- naturally enough -RRB- the details of their first rambling discussion of Julia 's engagement , she might really have felt as little alarm as she showed .
Parsing [sent. 4212 len. 23]: `` Well , '' said Mr. Atwater , `` I 'm glad _ our _ branch of the family is n't responsible .
Parsing [sent. 4213 len. 29]: That 's a comfort , anyhow , especially as people are reading copies of Herbert 's dreadful paper all up and down the town , my clerk says .
Parsing [sent. 4214 len. 50]: He tells me that over at the Unity Trust Company , where young Murdock Hawes is cashier , they only got hold of one copy , but typewrote it and multigraphed it , and some of 'em have already learned it by heart to recite to poor young Hawes .
Parsing [sent. 4215 len. 26]: He 's the one who sent Julia the three fivepound boxes of chocolates from New York all at the same time , you remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 4216 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' Mrs. Atwater sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4217 len. 5]: `` Poor thing ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4218 len. 12]: `` Florence is out among the family , I suppose ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4219 len. 3]: he inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4220 len. 8]: `` No ; she 's right here .
Parsing [sent. 4221 len. 10]: She 's just started to read Ruskin this afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4222 len. 15]: She says she 's going to begin and read all of him straight through .
Parsing [sent. 4223 len. 11]: That 's very nice , do n't you think ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4224 len. 7]: He seemed to muse before replying .
Parsing [sent. 4225 len. 18]: `` I think that 's very nice , at her age especially , '' Mrs. Atwater urged .
Parsing [sent. 4226 len. 6]: `` Do n't you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4227 len. 3]: `` Ye-es !
Parsing [sent. 4228 len. 4]: Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4229 len. 6]: At least I suppose so .
Parsing [sent. 4230 len. 22]: Ah -- you do n't think -- of course she has n't had anything at all to do with this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4231 len. 13]: `` Well , I do n't _ see _ how she could .
Parsing [sent. 4232 len. 44]: You know Aunt Fanny told us how Herbert declared before them all , only last Sunday night , that Florence should never have one thing to do with his printing-press , and said they would n't even let her come near it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4233 len. 8]: `` Yes , that 's a fact .
Parsing [sent. 4234 len. 15]: I 'm glad Herbert made it so clear that she ca n't be implicated .
Parsing [sent. 4235 len. 14]: I suppose the family are all pretty well down on Uncle Joseph ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4236 len. 14]: `` Uncle Joseph is being greatly blamed , '' said Mrs. Atwater primly .
Parsing [sent. 4237 len. 28]: `` He really ought to have known better than to put such an instrument as a printing-press into the hands of an irresponsible boy of that age .
Parsing [sent. 4238 len. 13]: Of course it simply encouraged him to print all kinds of things .
Parsing [sent. 4239 len. 49]: We none of us think Uncle Joseph ever dreamed that Herbert would publish , anything exactly like _ this _ , and of course Uncle Joseph says himself he never dreamed such a thing ; he 's said so time and time and time again , all afternoon .
Parsing [sent. 4240 len. 9]: But of course he 's greatly blamed . ''
Parsing [sent. 4241 len. 18]: `` I suppose there 've been quite a good many of 'em over there blaming him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4242 len. 4]: her husband inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4243 len. 19]: `` Yes -- until he telephoned to a garage and hired a car and went for a drive .
Parsing [sent. 4244 len. 20]: He said he had plenty of money with him and did n't know when he 'd be back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4245 len. 10]: `` Serves him right , '' said Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 4246 len. 9]: `` Does anybody know where Herbert is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4247 len. 5]: `` Not yet ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4248 len. 12]: `` Well -- '' and he returned to a former theme .
Parsing [sent. 4249 len. 11]: `` I _ am _ glad we are n't implicated .
Parsing [sent. 4250 len. 11]: Florence is right there with you , you say ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4251 len. 8]: `` Yes , '' Mrs. Atwater replied .
Parsing [sent. 4252 len. 8]: `` She 's right here , reading .
Parsing [sent. 4253 len. 11]: You are n't worried about her , are you ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4254 len. 3]: she added .
Parsing [sent. 4255 len. 13]: `` Oh , no ; I 'm sure it 's all right .
Parsing [sent. 4256 len. 11]: I only thought -- '' `` Only thought what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4257 len. 49]: `` Well , it _ did _ strike me as curious , '' said Mr. Atwater ; `` especially after Aunt Fanny 's telling us how Herbert declared Florence could never have a single thing to do with his paper again -- '' `` Well , what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4258 len. 29]: `` Well , here 's her poem right at the top of it , and a _ very _ friendly item about her history mark of last June .
Parsing [sent. 4259 len. 18]: It does n't seem like Herbert to be so complimentary to Florence , all of a sudden .
Parsing [sent. 4260 len. 12]: Just struck me as rather curious ; that 's all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4261 len. 25]: `` Why , yes , '' said Mrs. Atwater , `` it does seem a little odd , when you think of it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4262 len. 24]: `` Have you _ asked _ Florence if she had anything to do with getting out this week 's _ Oriole _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4263 len. 24]: `` Why , no ; it never occurred to me , especially after what Aunt Fanny told us , '' said Mrs. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 4264 len. 8]: `` I 'll ask her now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4265 len. 11]: But she was obliged to postpone putting the intended question .
Parsing [sent. 4266 len. 26]: `` Sesame and Lilies '' lay sweetly upon the seat of the chair that Florence had occupied ; but Florence herself had gone somewhere else .
Parsing [sent. 4267 len. 60]: She had gone for a long , long ramble ; and pedestrians who encountered her , and happened to notice her expression , were interested ; and as they went on their way several of them interrupted the course of their meditations to say to themselves that she was the most thoughtful looking young girl they had ever seen .
Parsing [sent. 4268 len. 25]: There was a touch of wistfulness about her , too ; as of one whose benevolence must renounce all hope of comprehension and reward .
Parsing [sent. 4269 len. 33]: Now , among those who observed her unusual expression was a gentleman of great dimensions disposed in a closed automobile that went labouring among mudholes in an unpaved outskirt of the town .
Parsing [sent. 4270 len. 40]: He rapped upon the glass before him , to get the driver 's attention , and a moment later the car drew up beside Florence , as she stood in a deep reverie at the intersection of two roads .
Parsing [sent. 4271 len. 13]: Uncle Joseph opened the door and took his cigar from his mouth .
Parsing [sent. 4272 len. 10]: `` Get in , Florence , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4273 len. 10]: `` I 'll take you for a ride . ''
Parsing [sent. 4274 len. 36]: She started violently ; whereupon he restored the cigar to his mouth , puffed upon it , breathing heavily the while as was his wont , and added , `` I 'm not going home .
Parsing [sent. 4275 len. 9]: I 'm out for a nice long ride .
Parsing [sent. 4276 len. 4]: Get in . ''
Parsing [sent. 4277 len. 13]: `` I was takin ' a walk , '' she said dubiously .
Parsing [sent. 4278 len. 21]: `` I haf to take a whole lot of exercise , and I ought to walk and walk and walk .
Parsing [sent. 4279 len. 11]: I guess I ought to keep on walkin ' . ''
Parsing [sent. 4280 len. 8]: `` Get in , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4281 len. 6]: `` I 'm out riding .
Parsing [sent. 4282 len. 13]: I do n't know _ when _ I 'll get home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4283 len. 17]: Florence stepped in , Uncle Joseph closed the door , and the car slowly bumped onward .
Parsing [sent. 4284 len. 8]: `` You know where Herbert is ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4285 len. 4]: Uncle Joseph inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4286 len. 12]: `` No , '' said Florence , in a gentle voice .
Parsing [sent. 4287 len. 8]: `` I do , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4288 len. 59]: `` Herbert and your friend Henry Rooter came to our house with one of the last copies of the _ Oriole _ they were distributing to subscribers ; and after I read it I kind of foresaw that the feller responsible for their owning a printing-press was going to be in some sort of family trouble or other .
Parsing [sent. 4289 len. 44]: I had quite a talk with 'em and they hinted they had n't had much to do with this number of the paper , except the mechanical end of it ; but they would n't come out right full with what they meant .
Parsing [sent. 4290 len. 52]: They seemed to have some good reason for protecting a third party , and said quite a good deal about their fathers and mothers being but mortal and so on ; so Henry and Herbert thought they ought n't to expose this third party -- whoever she may happen to be .
Parsing [sent. 4291 len. 39]: Well , I thought they better not stay too long , because I was compromised enough already , without being seen in their company ; and I gave 'em something to help 'em out with at the movies .
Parsing [sent. 4292 len. 38]: You can stay at movies an awful long time , and if you 've got money enough to go to several of 'em , why , you 're fixed for pretty near as long as you please .
Parsing [sent. 4293 len. 27]: A body ought to be able to live a couple o ' months at the movies for nine or ten dollars , I should think . ''
Parsing [sent. 4294 len. 31]: He was silent for a time , then asked , `` I do n't suppose your papa and mamma will be worrying about you , will they , Florence ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4295 len. 6]: `` Oh , no ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4296 len. 4]: she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4297 len. 6]: `` Not in the least !
Parsing [sent. 4298 len. 17]: There was nothin ' at all for me to do at our house this afternoon . ''
Parsing [sent. 4299 len. 28]: `` That 's good , '' he said , `` because before we go back I was thinking some of driving around by way of Texas . ''
Parsing [sent. 4300 len. 9]: Florence looked at him trustfully and said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4301 len. 29]: It seemed to her that he suspected something ; she was not sure ; but his conversation was a little peculiar , though not in the least sinister .
Parsing [sent. 4302 len. 24]: Indeed she was able to make out that he had more the air of an accomplice than of a prosecutor or a detective .
Parsing [sent. 4303 len. 30]: Nevertheless , she was convinced that far , far the best course for her to pursue , during the next few days , would be one of steadfast reserve .
Parsing [sent. 4304 len. 38]: And such a course was congenial to her mood , which was subdued , not to say apprehensive ; though she was sure her recent conduct , if viewed sympathetically , would be found at least Christian .
Parsing [sent. 4305 len. 12]: The trouble was that probably it would not be viewed sympathetically .
Parsing [sent. 4306 len. 45]: No one would understand how carefully and tactfully she had prepared the items of the _ Oriole _ to lead suavely up to the news of Aunt Julia 's engagement and break it to Noble Dill in a manner that would save his reason .
Parsing [sent. 4307 len. 59]: Therefore , on account of this probable lack of comprehension on the part of the family and public , it seemed to her that the only wise and good course to follow would be to claim nothing for herself , but to allow Herbert and Henry to remain undisturbed in full credit for publishing the _ Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 4308 len. 17]: This involved a disappointment , it is true ; nevertheless , she decided to bear it .
Parsing [sent. 4309 len. 12]: She had looked forward to surprising `` the family '' delightfully .
Parsing [sent. 4310 len. 96]: As they fluttered in exclamation about her , she had expected to say , `` Oh , the _ poem _ is n't so much , I guess -- I wrote it quite a few days ago and I 'm writing a couple new ones now -- but I did take quite a lot o ' time and trouble with the rest of the paper , because I had to write every single word of it , or else let Henry and Herbert try to , and ` course they 'd just of ruined it .
Parsing [sent. 4311 len. 30]: Oh , it is n't so much to talk about , I guess ; it just sort of _ comes _ to me to do things that way . ''
Parsing [sent. 4312 len. 31]: Thirteen attempts to exercise a great philanthropy , and every grown person in sight , with the possible exception of Great-Uncle Joseph , goes into wholly unanticipated fits of horror .
Parsing [sent. 4313 len. 45]: Cause and effect have no honest relation : Fate operates without justice or even rational sequence ; life and the universe appear to be governed , not in order and with system , but by Chance , becoming sinister at any moment without reason .
Parsing [sent. 4314 len. 44]: And while Florence , thus a pessimist , sat beside fat Uncle Joseph during their long , long drive , relatives of hers were indeed going into fits ; at least , so Florence would have described their gestures and incoherences of comment .
Parsing [sent. 4315 len. 31]: Moreover , after the movies , straight into such a fitful scene did the luckless Herbert walk when urged homeward by thoughts of food , at about six that evening .
Parsing [sent. 4316 len. 11]: Henry Rooter had strongly advised him against entering the house .
Parsing [sent. 4317 len. 11]: `` You better not , '' he said earnestly . ''
Parsing [sent. 4318 len. 11]: _ Honest _ , you better not , Herbert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4319 len. 23]: `` Well , we got apple dumplings for dinner , '' Herbert said , his tone showing the strain of mental uncertainty .
Parsing [sent. 4320 len. 14]: `` Eliza told me this morning we were goin ' to have 'em .
Parsing [sent. 4321 len. 18]: I kind of hate to go in , but I guess I better , Henry . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4322 len. 14]: _ You _ wo n't see any apple dumplings , '' Henry predicted .
Parsing [sent. 4323 len. 13]: `` Well , I believe I better try it , Henry . ''
Parsing [sent. 4324 len. 8]: `` You better come home with me .
Parsing [sent. 4325 len. 13]: My father and mother 'll be perfectly willing to have you . ''
Parsing [sent. 4326 len. 9]: `` I know that , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 4327 len. 16]: `` But I guess I better go in and try it , anyhow , Henry .
Parsing [sent. 4328 len. 16]: I did n't have anything to do with what 's in the _ Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 4329 len. 10]: It 's every last word ole Florence 's doing .
Parsing [sent. 4330 len. 18]: I have n't got any more right to be picked on for that than a child . ''
Parsing [sent. 4331 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' Henry admitted .
Parsing [sent. 4332 len. 40]: `` But if you go and tell 'em so , I bet she 'd get even with you some way that would probably get _ me _ in trouble , too , before we get through with the job .
Parsing [sent. 4333 len. 15]: _ I _ would n't tell 'em if I was you , Herbert ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4334 len. 41]: `` Well , I was n't intending to , '' Herbert responded gloomily ; and the thought of each , unknown to the other , was the same , consisting of a symbolic likeness of Wallie Torbin at his worst .
Parsing [sent. 4335 len. 28]: `` I _ ought _ to tell on Florence ; by rights I ought , '' said Herbert ; `` but I 've decided I wo n't .
Parsing [sent. 4336 len. 11]: There 's no tellin ' what she would n't do .
Parsing [sent. 4337 len. 26]: Not that she could do anything to _ me _ , particyourly -- '' `` Nor me , either , '' his friend interposed hurriedly .
Parsing [sent. 4338 len. 10]: `` I do n't worry about anything like that !
Parsing [sent. 4339 len. 11]: Still , if I was you I would n't tell .
Parsing [sent. 4340 len. 12]: She 's only a girl , we got to remember . ''
Parsing [sent. 4341 len. 7]: `` Yes , '' said Herbert .
Parsing [sent. 4342 len. 42]: `` That 's the way _ I _ look at it , Henry ; and the way I look at it is just simply this : long as she _ is _ a girl , why , simply let her go .
Parsing [sent. 4343 len. 24]: You ca n't tell what she 'd do , and so what 's the use to go and tell on a girl ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4344 len. 16]: `` That 's the way _ I _ look at it , '' Henry agreed .
Parsing [sent. 4345 len. 6]: `` What 's the use ?
Parsing [sent. 4346 len. 18]: If I was in your place , I 'd act just the same way you do . ''
Parsing [sent. 4347 len. 20]: `` Well , '' said Herbert , `` I guess I better go on in the house , Henry .
Parsing [sent. 4348 len. 9]: It 's a good while after dark . ''
Parsing [sent. 4349 len. 10]: `` You 're makin ' a big mistake ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4350 len. 7]: Henry Rooter called after him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4351 len. 16]: _ You _ wo n't see any apple dumplings , I bet a hunderd dollars !
Parsing [sent. 4352 len. 9]: You better come on home with me . ''
Parsing [sent. 4353 len. 21]: Herbert no more than half opened his front door before he perceived that his friend 's advice had been excellent .
Parsing [sent. 4354 len. 45]: So clearly Herbert perceived this , that he impulsively decided not to open the door any farther , but on the contrary to close it and retire ; and he would have done so , had his mother not reached forth and detained him .
Parsing [sent. 4355 len. 45]: She was , in fact , just inside that door , standing in the hall with one of his great-aunts , one of his aunts , two aunts-by-marriage , and an elderly unmarried cousin , who were all just on the point of leaving .
Parsing [sent. 4356 len. 18]: However , they changed their minds and decided to remain , now that Herbert was among them .
Parsing [sent. 4357 len. 59]: The captive 's father joined them , a few minutes later , but it had already become clear to Herbert that _ The North End Daily Oriole _ was in one sense a thing of the past , though in another sense this former owner and proprietor was certain that he would never hear the last of it .
Parsing [sent. 4358 len. 62]: However , on account of the life of blackmail and slavery now led by the members of the old régime , the _ Oriole 's _ extinction was far less painful to Herbert than his father supposed ; and the latter wasted a great deal of severity , insisting that the printing-press should be returned that very night to Uncle Joseph .
Parsing [sent. 4359 len. 19]: Herbert 's heartiest retrospective wish was that the ole printing-press had been returned to Uncle Joseph long ago .
Parsing [sent. 4360 len. 12]: `` If you can find him to give it to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4361 len. 4]: Aunt Harriet suggested .
Parsing [sent. 4362 len. 25]: `` Nobody _ knows _ where he goes when he gets the way he did this afternoon when we were discussing it with him !
Parsing [sent. 4363 len. 10]: I only hope he 'll be back to-night ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4364 len. 13]: `` He ca n't stay away forever , '' Aunt Fanny remarked .
Parsing [sent. 4365 len. 35]: `` That garage is charging him five dollars an hour for the automobile he 's in , and surely even Joseph will decide there 's a limit to wildness _ some _ time ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4366 len. 17]: `` I do n't care when he comes back , '' Herbert 's father declared grimly .
Parsing [sent. 4367 len. 29]: `` Whenever he does he 's got to take that printing-press back -- and Herbert will be let out of the house long enough to carry it over .
Parsing [sent. 4368 len. 10]: His mother or I will go with him . ''
Parsing [sent. 4369 len. 7]: Herbert bore much more than this .
Parsing [sent. 4370 len. 22]: He had seated himself on the third step of the stairway , and maintained as much dogged silence as he could .
Parsing [sent. 4371 len. 14]: Once , however , they got a yelp of anguish out of him .
Parsing [sent. 4372 len. 14]: It was when Cousin Virginia said : `` Oh , Herbert , Herbert !
Parsing [sent. 4373 len. 12]: How could you make up that terrible falsehood about Mr. Crum ?
Parsing [sent. 4374 len. 23]: And , _ think _ of it ; right on the same page with your cousin Florence 's pure little poem ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4375 len. 15]: Herbert uttered sounds incoherent but loud , and expressive of a supreme physical revulsion .
Parsing [sent. 4376 len. 21]: The shocked audience readily understood that he liked neither Cousin Virginia 's chiding nor Cousin Florence 's pure little poem .
Parsing [sent. 4377 len. 4]: `` Shame ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4378 len. 4]: said his father .
Parsing [sent. 4379 len. 4]: Herbert controlled himself .
Parsing [sent. 4380 len. 35]: It could be seen that his spirit was broken , when Aunt Fanny mourned , shaking her head at him , smiling ruefully : `` Oh , if boys could only be girls ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4381 len. 6]: Herbert just looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 4382 len. 42]: `` The worst thing , '' said his father ; -- `` that is , if there 's any part of it that 's worse than another -- the worst thing about it all is this rumour about Noble Dill . ''
Parsing [sent. 4383 len. 8]: `` What about that poor thing ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4384 len. 4]: Aunt Harriet asked .
Parsing [sent. 4385 len. 7]: `` We have n't heard . ''
Parsing [sent. 4386 len. 29]: `` Why , I walked up from downtown with old man Dill , '' said Mr. Atwater , `` and the Dill family are all very much worried .
Parsing [sent. 4387 len. 50]: It seems that Noble started downtown after lunch , as usual , and pretty soon he came back to the house and he had a copy of this awful paper that little Florence had given him , and -- '' '' _ Who _ gave it to him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4388 len. 5]: Aunt Fanny asked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4389 len. 5]: _ Who _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4390 len. 5]: `` Little Florence . ''
Parsing [sent. 4391 len. 12]: `` Why , that 's curious , '' Cousin Virginia murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4392 len. 12]: `` I must telephone and ask her mother about that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4393 len. 21]: The brooding Herbert looked up , and there was a gleam in his dogged eye ; but he said nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4394 len. 9]: `` Go on , '' Aunt Harriet urged .
Parsing [sent. 4395 len. 7]: `` What did Noble do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4396 len. 31]: `` Why , his mother said he just went up to his room and changed his shoes and necktie -- '' `` I thought so , '' Aunt Fanny whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4397 len. 4]: `` Crazy ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4398 len. 35]: `` And then , '' Mr. Atwater continued , `` he left the house and she supposed he 'd gone down to the office ; but she was uneasy , and telephoned his father .
Parsing [sent. 4399 len. 5]: Noble had n't come .
Parsing [sent. 4400 len. 52]: He did n't come all afternoon , and he did n't go back to the house ; and they telephoned around to every place he _ could _ go that they know of , and they could n't find him or hear anything about him at all -- not anywhere . ''
Parsing [sent. 4401 len. 7]: Mr. Atwater coughed , and paused .
Parsing [sent. 4402 len. 23]: `` But what , '' Aunt Harriet cried ; -- '' _ what _ do they think 's become of him ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4403 len. 16]: `` Old man Dill said they were all pretty anxious , '' said Mr. Atwater .
Parsing [sent. 4404 len. 15]: `` They 're afraid Noble has -- they 're afraid he 's disappeared . ''
Parsing [sent. 4405 len. 4]: Aunt Fanny screamed .
Parsing [sent. 4406 len. 26]: Then , in perfect accord , they all turned to look at Herbert , who rose and would have retired upstairs had he been permitted .
Parsing [sent. 4407 len. 25]: As that perturbing evening wore on , word gradually reached the most outlying members of the Atwater family connection that Noble Dill was missing .
Parsing [sent. 4408 len. 14]: Ordinarily , this bit of news would have caused them no severe anxiety .
Parsing [sent. 4409 len. 40]: Noble 's person and intellect were so commonplace -- `` insignificant '' was the term usually preferred in his own circle -- that he was considered to be as nearly negligible as it is charitable to consider a fellow-being .
Parsing [sent. 4410 len. 50]: True , there was one thing that set him apart ; he was found worthy of a superlative when he fell in love with Julia ; and of course this distinction caused him to become better known and more talked about than he had been in his earlier youth .
Parsing [sent. 4411 len. 68]: However , the eccentricities of a person in such an extremity of love are seldom valued except as comedy , and even then with no warmth of heart for the comedian , but rather with an incredulous disdain ; so it is safe to say that under other circumstances , Noble might have been missing , indeed , and few of the Atwaters would have missed him .
Parsing [sent. 4412 len. 41]: But as matters stood they worried a great deal about him , fearing that a rash act on his part might reflect notoriety upon themselves on account of their beautiful relative -- and _ The North End Daily Oriole _ .
Parsing [sent. 4413 len. 84]: And when nine o'clock came and Mrs. Dill reported to Herbert 's father , over the telephone , that nothing had yet been heard of her son , the pressure of those who were blaming the _ Oriole _ more than they blamed Julia became so wearing that Herbert decided he would rather spend the remaining days of his life running away from Wallie Torbin than put in any more of such a dog 's evening as he _ was _ putting in .
Parsing [sent. 4414 len. 5]: Thus he defined it .
Parsing [sent. 4415 len. 15]: He made a confession ; that is to say , it was a proclamation .
Parsing [sent. 4416 len. 5]: He proclaimed his innocence .
Parsing [sent. 4417 len. 54]: He began history with a description of events distinctly subsequent to Sunday pastimes with Patty Fairchild , and explained how he and Henry had felt that their parents would not always be with them , and as their parents wished them to be polite , they had resolved to be polite to Florence .
Parsing [sent. 4418 len. 11]: Proceeding , he related in detail her whole journalistic exploit .
Parsing [sent. 4419 len. 77]: Of the matter in hand he told the perfect and absolute truth -- and was immediately refuted , confuted , and demonstrated to be a false witness by Aunt Fanny , Aunt Carrie , and Cousin Virginia , who had all heard him vehemently declare , no longer ago than the preceding Sunday evening , that he and his partner had taken secure measures to prevent Florence from ever again setting foot within the Newspaper Building .
Parsing [sent. 4420 len. 47]: In addition , he was quite showered with definitions ; and these , though so various , all sought to phrase but the one subject : his conduct in seeking to drag Florence into the mire , when she was absent and could not defend herself .
Parsing [sent. 4421 len. 42]: Poor Florence would answer later in the evening , he was told severely ; and though her cause was thus championed against the slander , it is true that some of her defenders felt stirrings of curiosity in regard to Florence .
Parsing [sent. 4422 len. 17]: In fact , there was getting to be something almost like a cloud upon her reputation .
Parsing [sent. 4423 len. 46]: There were several things for her to explain ; -- among them , her taking it upon herself to see that Noble received a copy of the _ Oriole _ , and also her sudden departure from home and rather odd protraction of absence therefrom .
Parsing [sent. 4424 len. 10]: It was not thought she was in good company .
Parsing [sent. 4425 len. 27]: Uncle Joseph had telephoned from a suburb that they were dining at a farmhouse and would thence descend to the general region of the movies . ''
Parsing [sent. 4426 len. 16]: _ Nobody _ knows what that man 'll do , when he decides to ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4427 len. 5]: Aunt Carrie said nervously .
Parsing [sent. 4428 len. 10]: `` Letting the poor child stay up so late !
Parsing [sent. 4429 len. 16]: She ought to be in bed this minute , even if it is Saturday night !
Parsing [sent. 4430 len. 26]: Or else she ought to be here to listen to her own bad little cousin trying to put his terrible responsibility on her shoulders . ''
Parsing [sent. 4431 len. 45]: One item of this description of himself the badgered Herbert could not bear in silence , although he had just declared that since the truth was so ill-respected among his persecutors he would open his mouth no more until the day of his death .
Parsing [sent. 4432 len. 22]: He passed over `` bad , '' but furiously stated his height in feet , inches , and fractions of inches .
Parsing [sent. 4433 len. 8]: Aunt Fanny shook her head in mourning .
Parsing [sent. 4434 len. 12]: `` That may be , Herbert , '' she said gently .
Parsing [sent. 4435 len. 21]: `` But you must try to realize it ca n't bring poor young Mr. Dill back to his family . ''
Parsing [sent. 4436 len. 7]: Again Herbert just looked at her .
Parsing [sent. 4437 len. 41]: He had no indifference more profound than that upon which her strained conception of the relation between cause and effect seemed to touch ; -- from his point of view , to be missing should be the lightest of calamities .
Parsing [sent. 4438 len. 36]: It is true that he was concerned with the restoration of Noble Dill to the rest of the Dills so far as such an event might affect his own incomparable misfortunes , but not otherwise .
Parsing [sent. 4439 len. 46]: He regarded Noble and Noble 's disappearance merely as unfair damage to himself , and he continued to look at this sorrowing great-aunt of his until his thoughts made his strange gaze appear to her so hardened that she shook her head and looked away .
Parsing [sent. 4440 len. 7]: `` Poor young Mr. Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4441 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4442 len. 25]: `` If someone could only have been with him and kept talking to him until he got used to the idea a little ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4443 len. 5]: Cousin Virginia nodded comprehendingly .
Parsing [sent. 4444 len. 14]: `` Yes , it might have tided him over , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4445 len. 29]: `` He was n't handsome , nor impressive , of course , nor anything like that , but he always spoke so nicely to people on the street .
Parsing [sent. 4446 len. 14]: I 'm sure he never harmed even a kitten , poor soul ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4447 len. 15]: `` I 'm sure he never did , '' Herbert 's mother agreed gently .
Parsing [sent. 4448 len. 6]: `` Not even a kitten .
Parsing [sent. 4449 len. 9]: I do wonder where he is now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4450 len. 10]: But Aunt Fanny uttered a little cry of protest .
Parsing [sent. 4451 len. 9]: `` I 'm afraid we may hear ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4452 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4453 len. 5]: `` Any moment ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4454 len. 29]: CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE These sympathetic women had unanimously set their expectation in so romantically pessimistic a groove that the most tragic news of Noble would have surprised them little .
Parsing [sent. 4455 len. 48]: But if the truth of his whereabouts could have been made known to them , as they sat thus together at what was developing virtually into his wake , with Herbert as a compulsory participant , they would have turned the session into a riot of amazement .
Parsing [sent. 4456 len. 31]: Noble was in the very last place -LRB- they would have said , when calmer -RRB- where anybody in the world could have even madly dreamed of looking for him !
Parsing [sent. 4457 len. 8]: They would have been right about it .
Parsing [sent. 4458 len. 34]: No one could have expected to find Noble to-night inside the old , four-square brick house of H. I. Atwater , Senior , chief of the Atwaters and father of too gentle Julia .
Parsing [sent. 4459 len. 60]: Moreover , Mr. Atwater himself was not at present in the house ; he had closed and locked it the day before , giving the servants a week 's vacation and telling them not to return till he sent for them ; and he had then gone out of town to look over a hominy-mill he thought of buying .
Parsing [sent. 4460 len. 25]: And yet , as the wake went on , there was a light in the house , and under that light sat Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 4461 len. 23]: Returning home , after Florence had placed the shattering paper within his hand , Noble had changed his shoes and his tie .
Parsing [sent. 4462 len. 11]: He was but a mechanism ; he had no motive .
Parsing [sent. 4463 len. 45]: The shoes he put on were no better than those he took off ; the fresh tie was no lovelier than the one he had worn ; nor had it even the lucidity to be a purple one , as the banner of grief .
Parsing [sent. 4464 len. 21]: No ; his action was , if so viewed , `` crazy , '' as Aunt Fanny had called it .
Parsing [sent. 4465 len. 10]: Agitation first took this form ; that was all .
Parsing [sent. 4466 len. 36]: Love and change of dress are so closely allied ; and in happier days , when Noble had come home from work and would see Julia in the evening , he usually changed his clothes .
Parsing [sent. 4467 len. 16]: No doubt there is some faint tracery here , probably too indistinct to repay contemplation .
Parsing [sent. 4468 len. 37]: When he left the house he walked rapidly downtown , and toward the end of this one-mile journey he ran ; but as he was then approaching the railway station , no one thought him eccentric .
Parsing [sent. 4469 len. 40]: He was , however , for when he entered the station he went to a bench and sat looking upward for more than ten minutes before he rose , went to a ticket window and asked for a time-table .
Parsing [sent. 4470 len. 5]: `` What road ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4471 len. 4]: the clerk inquired .
Parsing [sent. 4472 len. 9]: `` All points South , '' said Noble .
Parsing [sent. 4473 len. 38]: He placed the time-table , still folded , in his pocket , rested an elbow on the brass apron of the window , and would have given himself up to reflections , though urged to move away .
Parsing [sent. 4474 len. 60]: Several people , wishing to buy tickets , had formed a line behind him ; they perceived that Noble had nothing more to say to the clerk , and the latter encouraged their protests , even going so far as to inquire : `` For heaven 's sakes , ca n't you let these folk buy their tickets ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4475 len. 22]: And since Noble still did not move : `` My gosh , have n't you got no _ feet _ ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4476 len. 3]: `` Feet ?
Parsing [sent. 4477 len. 9]: Oh , yes , '' said Noble gently .
Parsing [sent. 4478 len. 7]: `` I 'm going away . ''
Parsing [sent. 4479 len. 7]: And went back to his seat .
Parsing [sent. 4480 len. 9]: Afterwhile , he sought to study his time-table .
Parsing [sent. 4481 len. 28]: Ordinarily , his mind was one of those able to decipher and comprehend railway time-tables ; he had few gifts , but this was one of them .
Parsing [sent. 4482 len. 38]: It failed him now ; so he wandered back to the ticket-window , and , after urgent coaching , eventually took his place at the end instead of at the head of the line that waited there .
Parsing [sent. 4483 len. 45]: In his turn he came again to the window , and departed from it after a conversation with the clerk that left the latter in accord with Aunt Fanny Atwater 's commiserating adjective , though the clerk 's own pity was expressed in argot .
Parsing [sent. 4484 len. 6]: `` The poor nut ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4485 len. 7]: he explained to his next client .
Parsing [sent. 4486 len. 36]: `` Wants to buy a ticket on a train that do n't pull out until ten thirty-five to-night ; and me fillin ' it all out , stampin ' it and everything , what for ?
Parsing [sent. 4487 len. 17]: Turned out all his pockets and could n't come within eight dollars o ' the price !
Parsing [sent. 4488 len. 7]: Where you want to go ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4489 len. 27]: Noble went back to his bench and sat there for a long time , though there was no time , long or short , for him .
Parsing [sent. 4490 len. 14]: He was not yet consciously suffering ; nor was he thinking at all .
Parsing [sent. 4491 len. 21]: True , he had a dim , persistent impulse to action -- or why should he be at the station ?
Parsing [sent. 4492 len. 22]: -- but for the clearest expression of his condition it is necessary to borrow a culinary symbol ; he was jelling .
Parsing [sent. 4493 len. 19]: But the state of shock was slowly dispersing , while a perception of approaching anguish as slowly increased .
Parsing [sent. 4494 len. 15]: He was beginning to swallow nothing at intervals and the intervals were growing shorter .
Parsing [sent. 4495 len. 18]: Dusk was misting down , outdoors , when with dragging steps he came out of the station .
Parsing [sent. 4496 len. 36]: He looked hazily up and down the street , where the corner-lamps and shop-windows now were lighted ; and , after dreary hesitation , he went in search of a pawn-shop , and found one .
Parsing [sent. 4497 len. 29]: The old man who operated it must have been a philanthropist , for Noble was so fortunate as to secure a loan of nine dollars upon his watch .
Parsing [sent. 4498 len. 19]: Surprised at this , he returned to the station , and went back to the same old bench .
Parsing [sent. 4499 len. 27]: It was fully occupied , and he stood for some time looking with vague reproach at the large family of coloured people who had taken it .
Parsing [sent. 4500 len. 47]: He had a feeling that he lived there and that these coloured people were trespassers ; but upon becoming aware that part of an orange was being rubbed over his left shoe by the youngest of the children , he groaned abruptly and found another bench .
Parsing [sent. 4501 len. 56]: A little after six o'clock a clanging and commotion in the train-shed outside , attending the arrival of a `` through express , '' stirred him from his torpor , and he walked heavily across the room to the same ticket-window he had twice blocked ; but there was no queue attached to it now .
Parsing [sent. 4502 len. 25]: He rested his elbow upon the apron and his chin upon his hand , while the clerk waited until he should state his wishes .
Parsing [sent. 4503 len. 13]: This was a new clerk , who had just relieved the other .
Parsing [sent. 4504 len. 3]: `` Well !
Parsing [sent. 4505 len. 3]: Well ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4506 len. 5]: he said at last .
Parsing [sent. 4507 len. 11]: `` I 'll take it now , '' Noble responded .
Parsing [sent. 4508 len. 8]: `` What 'll you take now ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4509 len. 5]: `` That ticket . ''
Parsing [sent. 4510 len. 5]: `` What ticket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4511 len. 12]: `` The same one I wanted before , '' Noble sighed .
Parsing [sent. 4512 len. 46]: The clerk gave him a piercing look , glanced out of the window and saw that there were no other clients , then went to a desk at the farther end of his compartment , and took up some clerical work he had in hand .
Parsing [sent. 4513 len. 25]: Noble leaned upon the apron of the window , waiting ; and if he thought anything , he thought the man was serving him .
Parsing [sent. 4514 len. 65]: The high , vaulted room became resonant with voices and the blurred echoes of mingling footsteps on the marble floor , as passengers from the express hurried anxiously to the street , or more gaily straggled through , shouting with friends who came to greet them ; and among these moving groups there walked a youthful fine lady noticeably enlivening to the dullest eye .
Parsing [sent. 4515 len. 52]: She was preceded by a brisk porter who carried two travelling-bags of a rich sort , as well as a sack of implements for the game of golf ; and she was warm in dark furs , against which the vasty clump of violets she wore showed dewy gleamings of blue .
Parsing [sent. 4516 len. 22]: At sight of Noble Dill , more than pensive at the ticket-window , she hesitated , then stopped and observed him .
Parsing [sent. 4517 len. 30]: That she should observe anybody was in a way a coincidence , for , as it happened , she was herself the most observed person in all the place .
Parsing [sent. 4518 len. 50]: She was veiled in two veils , but she had been seen in the train without these , and some of her fellow-travellers , though strangers to her , were walking near her in a hypocritical way , hoping still not to lose sight of her , even veiled .
Parsing [sent. 4519 len. 55]: And although the shroudings permitted the most meagre information of her features , what they did reveal was harmfully piquant ; moreover , there was a sweetness of figure , a disturbing grace ; while nothing could disguise her air of wearing that many violets casually as a daily perquisite and matter of course .
Parsing [sent. 4520 len. 10]: -LSB- Illustration : _ `` He stared at her .
Parsing [sent. 4521 len. 19]: His elbow sagged away from the window ; the whole person of Noble Dill seemed near collapse . ''
Parsing [sent. 4522 len. 24]: _ -RSB- So this observed lady stopped and observed Noble , who in return observed her not at all , being but semi-conscious .
Parsing [sent. 4523 len. 33]: Looked upon thoughtfully , it is a coincidence that we breathe ; certainly it is a mighty coincidence that we speak to one another and comprehend ; for these are true marvels .
Parsing [sent. 4524 len. 23]: But what petty interlacings of human action so pique our sense of the theatrical that we call them coincidences and are astonished !
Parsing [sent. 4525 len. 66]: That Julia should arrive during Noble 's long process of buying a ticket to go to her was stranger than that she stopped to look at him , though still not comparable in strangeness to the fact that either of them , or any living creature , stood upon the whirling earth ; -- yet when Noble Dill comprehended what was happening he was amazed .
Parsing [sent. 4526 len. 5]: She spoke to him .
Parsing [sent. 4527 len. 4]: `` Noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4528 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4529 len. 5]: He stared at her .
Parsing [sent. 4530 len. 18]: His elbow sagged away from the window ; the whole person of Noble Dill seemed near collapse .
Parsing [sent. 4531 len. 8]: He shook ; he had no voice .
Parsing [sent. 4532 len. 14]: `` I just this minute got off the train , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4533 len. 8]: `` Are you going away somewhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4534 len. 18]: `` No , '' he whispered ; then obtained command of a huskiness somewhat greater in volume .
Parsing [sent. 4535 len. 8]: `` I 'm just standing here . ''
Parsing [sent. 4536 len. 15]: `` I told the porter to get me a taxicab , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4537 len. 17]: `` If you 're going home for dinner I 'll drop you at your house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4538 len. 27]: `` I -- I 'm -- I -- '' His articulation encountered unsurmountable difficulties , but Julia had been with him through many such trials aforetime .
Parsing [sent. 4539 len. 16]: She said briskly , `` I 'm awfully hungry and I want to get home .
Parsing [sent. 4540 len. 8]: Come on -- if you like ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4541 len. 35]: He walked waveringly at her side through the station , and followed her into the dim interior of the cab , which became fragrant of violets -- an emanation at once ineffable and poisonous .
Parsing [sent. 4542 len. 33]: `` I 'm so glad I happened to run across you , '' she said , as they began to vibrate tremulously in unison with the fierce little engine that drew them .
Parsing [sent. 4543 len. 9]: `` I want to hear all the news .
Parsing [sent. 4544 len. 6]: Nobody knows I 'm home .
Parsing [sent. 4545 len. 31]: I did n't write or telegraph to a soul ; and I 'll be a complete surprise to father and everybody -- I do n't know how pleasant a one !
Parsing [sent. 4546 len. 16]: _ You _ did n't seem so frightfully glad to see me , Noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4547 len. 5]: `` Am I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4548 len. 3]: he whispered .
Parsing [sent. 4549 len. 15]: `` I mean -- I mean -- I mean : Did n't I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4550 len. 4]: `` No ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4551 len. 3]: she laughed .
Parsing [sent. 4552 len. 8]: `` You looked -- you looked shocked !
Parsing [sent. 4553 len. 32]: It could n't have been because I 'm ill or anything , because I 'm not ; and if I were you could n't have told it through these two veils .
Parsing [sent. 4554 len. 12]: Possibly I 'd better take your expression as a compliment . ''
Parsing [sent. 4555 len. 12]: She paused , then asked hesitatingly , `` Shall I ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4556 len. 25]: This was the style for which the Atwaters held Julia responsible ; but they were mistaken : she was never able to control it .
Parsing [sent. 4557 len. 16]: Now she went cheerily on : `` Perhaps not , as you do n't answer .
Parsing [sent. 4558 len. 7]: I should n't be so bold !
Parsing [sent. 4559 len. 14]: Do you suppose anybody at all will be glad to see me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4560 len. 20]: `` I -- I -- '' He seemed to hope that words would come in their own good time .
Parsing [sent. 4561 len. 4]: `` Noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4562 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4563 len. 8]: `` Do n't be so glum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4564 len. 22]: And she touched his arm with her muff , a fluffy contact causing within him a short convulsion , naturally invisible .
Parsing [sent. 4565 len. 17]: `` Noble , are n't you going to tell me what 's all the news ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4566 len. 13]: `` There 's -- some , '' he managed to inform her .
Parsing [sent. 4567 len. 7]: `` Some -- some news . ''
Parsing [sent. 4568 len. 6]: `` What is it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4569 len. 17]: `` It 's -- it 's -- '' `` Never mind , '' she said soothingly .
Parsing [sent. 4570 len. 9]: `` Get your breath ; I can wait .
Parsing [sent. 4571 len. 12]: I hope nothing 's wrong in your family , Noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 4572 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4573 len. 5]: Oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4574 len. 24]: `` It is n't just my turning up unexpectedly that 's upset you so , of course , '' she dared to say .
Parsing [sent. 4575 len. 16]: `` Naturally , I know better than to think such a thing as that . ''
Parsing [sent. 4576 len. 6]: `` Oh , Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4577 len. 3]: he said .
Parsing [sent. 4578 len. 6]: `` Oh , Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4579 len. 8]: `` What is it , Noble ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4580 len. 11]: `` Noth-ing , '' he murmured , disjointing the word .
Parsing [sent. 4581 len. 24]: `` How odd you happened to be there at the station , '' she said , `` just when my train came in !
Parsing [sent. 4582 len. 11]: You 're sure you were n't going away anywhere ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4583 len. 8]: `` No ; oh , no . ''
Parsing [sent. 4584 len. 8]: She was thoughtful , then laughed confidentially .
Parsing [sent. 4585 len. 17]: `` You 're the only person in town that knows I 'm home , Noble . ''
Parsing [sent. 4586 len. 10]: `` I 'm glad , '' he said humbly .
Parsing [sent. 4587 len. 4]: She laughed again .
Parsing [sent. 4588 len. 12]: `` I came all of a sudden -- on an impulse .
Parsing [sent. 4589 len. 6]: It 's a little idiotic .
Parsing [sent. 4590 len. 10]: I 'll tell you all about it , Noble .
Parsing [sent. 4591 len. 19]: You see , ten or twelve days ago I wrote the family a more or less indiscreet letter .
Parsing [sent. 4592 len. 34]: That is , I told them something I wanted them to be discreet about , and , of course , when I got to thinking it over , I knew they would n't .
Parsing [sent. 4593 len. 33]: You see , I wrote them something I wanted them to keep a secret , but the more I thought about it , the more I saw I 'd better hurry back .
Parsing [sent. 4594 len. 19]: Yesterday it got into my head that I 'd better jump on the next train for home ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4595 len. 11]: She paused , then added , `` So I did !
Parsing [sent. 4596 len. 33]: About ten or twelve days is as long as anybody has a right to expect the Atwater family connection to keep the deadliest kind of a secret , is n't it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4597 len. 36]: And as he did not respond , she explained , modestly , `` Of course , it was n't a very deadly secret ; it was really about something of only the least importance . ''
Parsing [sent. 4598 len. 17]: The jar of this understatement restored Noble 's voice to a sudden and startling loudness . ''
Parsing [sent. 4599 len. 8]: ` Only the least importance ' ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4600 len. 3]: he shouted .
Parsing [sent. 4601 len. 8]: `` With a man named Crum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4602 len. 4]: `` What ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4603 len. 6]: she cried `` Crum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4604 len. 3]: Noble insisted .
Parsing [sent. 4605 len. 13]: `` That 's exactly what it said his name was ! '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4606 len. 10]: _ What _ said his name was ? '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4607 len. 7]: _ The North End Daily Oriole !
Parsing [sent. 4608 len. 12]: _ '' `` What in heaven 's name is that ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4609 len. 22]: `` It 's the children 's paper , Herbert 's and Florence 's : your own niece and nephew , Julia !
Parsing [sent. 4610 len. 14]: You do n't mean you deny it , do you , Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4611 len. 13]: She was in great confusion : `` Do I deny what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4612 len. 8]: `` That his name 's Crum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4613 len. 4]: Noble said passionately .
Parsing [sent. 4614 len. 27]: `` That his name 's Crum and that he 's a widower and he 's been divorced and 's got nobody knows how many children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4615 len. 6]: Julia sought to collect herself .
Parsing [sent. 4616 len. 15]: `` I do n't know what you 're talking about , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4617 len. 42]: `` If you mean that I happened to meet a very charming man while I was away , and that his name happened to be Crum , I do n't know why I should go to the trouble of denying it .
Parsing [sent. 4618 len. 20]: But if Mr. Crum has had the experiences you say he has , it is certainly news to me !
Parsing [sent. 4619 len. 12]: I think someone told me he was only twenty-six years old .
Parsing [sent. 4620 len. 6]: He looked rather younger . ''
Parsing [sent. 4621 len. 10]: `` You ` think someone told ' you ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4622 len. 3]: Noble groaned .
Parsing [sent. 4623 len. 5]: `` Oh , Julia !
Parsing [sent. 4624 len. 17]: And here it is , all down in black and white , in my pocket ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4625 len. 14]: `` I have n't the slightest idea what you 're talking about . ''
Parsing [sent. 4626 len. 26]: Julia 's tone was cold , and she drew herself up haughtily , though the gesture was ineffective in the darkness of that quivering interior .
Parsing [sent. 4627 len. 21]: The quivering stopped just then , however , as the taxicab came to a rather abrupt halt before her house .
Parsing [sent. 4628 len. 13]: `` Will you come in with me a moment , please ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4629 len. 7]: Julia said as she got out .
Parsing [sent. 4630 len. 25]: `` There are some things I want to ask you -- and I 'm sure my father has n't come home from downtown yet .
Parsing [sent. 4631 len. 13]: There 's no light in the front part of the house . ''
Parsing [sent. 4632 len. 30]: CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO There was no light in any other part of the house , they discovered , after abandoning the front door bell for an excursion to the rear .
Parsing [sent. 4633 len. 29]: `` That 's disheartening to a hungry person , '' Julia remarked : and then remembered that she had a key to the front door in her purse .
Parsing [sent. 4634 len. 27]: She opened the door , and lighted the hall chandelier while Noble brought in her bags from the steps where the taxicab driver had left them .
Parsing [sent. 4635 len. 13]: `` There 's nobody home at all , '' Julia said thoughtfully .
Parsing [sent. 4636 len. 6]: `` Not even Gamin . ''
Parsing [sent. 4637 len. 3]: `` No .
Parsing [sent. 4638 len. 12]: Nobody , '' her sad companion agreed , shaking his head .
Parsing [sent. 4639 len. 7]: `` Nobody at all , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 4640 len. 5]: Nobody at all . ''
Parsing [sent. 4641 len. 22]: Rousing himself , he went back for the golf tools , and with a lingering gentleness set them in a corner .
Parsing [sent. 4642 len. 9]: Then , dumbly , he turned to go .
Parsing [sent. 4643 len. 9]: `` Wait , please , '' said Julia .
Parsing [sent. 4644 len. 28]: `` I want to ask you a few things -- especially about what you 've got ` all down in black and white ' in your pocket .
Parsing [sent. 4645 len. 46]: Will you shut the front door , if you please , and go into the library and turn on the lights and wait there while I look over the house and see if I can find why it 's all closed up like this ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4646 len. 13]: Noble went into the library and found the control of the lights .
Parsing [sent. 4647 len. 7]: She came hurrying in after him .
Parsing [sent. 4648 len. 5]: `` It 's chilly .
Parsing [sent. 4649 len. 11]: The furnace seems to be off , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4650 len. 39]: `` I 'll -- '' But instead of declaring her intentions , she enacted them ; taking a match from a little white porcelain trough on the mantelpiece and striking it on the heel of her glittering shoe .
Parsing [sent. 4651 len. 18]: Then she knelt before the grate and set the flame to paper beneath the kindling-wood and coal .
Parsing [sent. 4652 len. 39]: `` You must n't freeze , '' she said , with a thoughtful kindness that killed him ; and as she went out of the room he died again ; -- for she looked back over her shoulder .
Parsing [sent. 4653 len. 23]: She had pushed up her veils and this was his first sight of that disastrous face in long empty weeks and weeks .
Parsing [sent. 4654 len. 57]: Now he realized that all his aching reveries upon its contours had shown but pallid likenesses ; for here was the worst thing about Julia 's looks ; -- even her most extravagant suitor , in absence , could not dream an image of her so charming as he found herself when he saw her again .
Parsing [sent. 4655 len. 10]: Thus , seeing Julia again was always a discovery .
Parsing [sent. 4656 len. 58]: And this glance over her shoulder as she left a room -- not a honeyed glance but rather inscrutable , yet implying that she thought of the occupant , and might continue to think of him while gone from him -- this was one of those ways of hers that experience could never drill out of her .
Parsing [sent. 4657 len. 17]: `` I 'm Robinson Crusoe , Noble , '' she said , when she came back .
Parsing [sent. 4658 len. 15]: `` I suppose I might as well take off my furs , though . ''
Parsing [sent. 4659 len. 16]: But first she unfastened the great bouquet she wore and tossed it upon a table .
Parsing [sent. 4660 len. 24]: Noble was standing close to the table , and he moved away from it hurriedly -- a revulsion that she failed to notice .
Parsing [sent. 4661 len. 28]: She went on to explain , as she dropped her cloak and stole upon a chair : `` Papa 's gone away for at least a week .
Parsing [sent. 4662 len. 6]: He 's taken his ulster .
Parsing [sent. 4663 len. 34]: It does n't make any difference what the weather is , but when he 's going away for a week or longer , he always takes it with him , except in summer .
Parsing [sent. 4664 len. 18]: If he 's only going to be gone two or three days he takes his short overcoat .
Parsing [sent. 4665 len. 41]: And unless I 'm here when he leaves town he always gives the servants a holiday till he gets back ; so they 've gone and even taken Gamin with 'em , and I 'm all alone in the house .
Parsing [sent. 4666 len. 27]: I ca n't get even Kitty Silver back until to-morrow , and then I 'll probably have to hunt from house to house among her relatives .
Parsing [sent. 4667 len. 33]: Papa left yesterday , because the numbers on his desk calender are pulled off up to to-day , and that 's the first thing he does when he comes down for breakfast .
Parsing [sent. 4668 len. 13]: So here I am , Robinson Crusoe for to-night at least . ''
Parsing [sent. 4669 len. 28]: `` I suppose , '' said Noble huskily , `` I suppose you 'll go to some of your aunts or brothers or cousins or something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4670 len. 7]: `` No , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4671 len. 26]: `` My trunk may come up from the station almost any time , and if I close the house they 'll take it back . ''
Parsing [sent. 4672 len. 10]: `` You need n't bother about that , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 4673 len. 7]: I 'll look after it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4674 len. 4]: `` How ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4675 len. 15]: `` I could sit on the porch till it comes , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4676 len. 13]: `` I 'd tell 'em you wanted 'em to leave it . ''
Parsing [sent. 4677 len. 5]: He hesitated , painfully .
Parsing [sent. 4678 len. 39]: `` I -- if you want to lock up the house I -- I could wait out on the porch with your trunk , to see that it was safe , until you come back to-morrow morning . ''
Parsing [sent. 4679 len. 14]: She looked full at him , and he plaintively endured the examination . ''
Parsing [sent. 4680 len. 3]: _ Noble !
Parsing [sent. 4681 len. 22]: _ '' Undoubtedly she had a moment 's shame that any creature should come to such a pass for her sake .
Parsing [sent. 4682 len. 6]: `` What crazy nonsense ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4683 len. 13]: she said ; and sat upon a stool before the crackling fire .
Parsing [sent. 4684 len. 19]: `` Do sit down , Noble -- unless your dinner will be waiting for you at home ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4685 len. 7]: `` No , '' he murmured .
Parsing [sent. 4686 len. 7]: `` They never wait for me .
Parsing [sent. 4687 len. 12]: Do n't you want me to look after your trunk ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4688 len. 13]: `` Not by sitting all night with it on the porch ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4689 len. 3]: she said .
Parsing [sent. 4690 len. 9]: `` I 'm going to stay here myself .
Parsing [sent. 4691 len. 19]: I 'm not going out ; I do n't want to see any of the family to-night . ''
Parsing [sent. 4692 len. 10]: `` I thought you said you were hungry ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4693 len. 12]: `` I am ; but there 's enough in the pantry .
Parsing [sent. 4694 len. 4]: I looked . ''
Parsing [sent. 4695 len. 54]: `` Well , if you do n't want to see any of 'em , '' he suggested , `` and they know your father 's away and think the house is empty , they 're liable to notice the lights and come in , and then you 'd have to see 'em . ''
Parsing [sent. 4696 len. 29]: `` No , you ca n't see the lights of this room from the street , and I lit the lamp at the other end of the hall .
Parsing [sent. 4697 len. 17]: The light near the front door , '' Julia added , `` I put out . ''
Parsing [sent. 4698 len. 5]: `` You did ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4699 len. 15]: `` I ca n't see any of 'em to-night , '' she said resolutely .
Parsing [sent. 4700 len. 25]: `` Besides , I want to find out what you meant by what you said in the taxicab before I do anything else . ''
Parsing [sent. 4701 len. 9]: `` What I meant in the taxicab ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4702 len. 3]: he echoed .
Parsing [sent. 4703 len. 5]: `` Oh , Julia !
Parsing [sent. 4704 len. 3]: Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4705 len. 17]: She frowned , first at the fire , then , turning her head , at Noble .
Parsing [sent. 4706 len. 13]: `` You seem to feel reproachful about something , '' she observed .
Parsing [sent. 4707 len. 7]: `` No , I do n't .
Parsing [sent. 4708 len. 8]: I do n't feel reproachful , Julia .
Parsing [sent. 4709 len. 16]: I do n't know what I feel , but I do n't feel reproachful . ''
Parsing [sent. 4710 len. 4]: She smiled faintly .
Parsing [sent. 4711 len. 5]: `` Do n't you ?
Parsing [sent. 4712 len. 15]: Well , there 's something perhaps you do feel , and that 's hungry .
Parsing [sent. 4713 len. 16]: Will you stay to dinner with me -- if I go and get it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4714 len. 4]: `` What ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4715 len. 13]: `` You can have dinner with me -- if you want to ?
Parsing [sent. 4716 len. 12]: You can stay till ten o'clock -- if you want to ?
Parsing [sent. 4717 len. 3]: Wait ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4718 len. 13]: she said , and jumped up and ran out of the room .
Parsing [sent. 4719 len. 24]: Half an hour later she came back and called softly to him from the doorway ; and he followed her to the dining-room .
Parsing [sent. 4720 len. 58]: `` It is n't much of a dinner , Noble , '' she said , a little tremulously , being for once -LRB- though strictly as a cook -RRB- genuinely apologetic ; -- but the scrambled eggs , cold lamb , salad , and coffee were quite as `` much of a dinner '' as Noble wanted .
Parsing [sent. 4721 len. 12]: To him everything on that table was hallowed , yet excruciating .
Parsing [sent. 4722 len. 64]: `` Let 's eat first and talk afterward , '' Julia proposed ; but what she meant by `` talk '' evidently did not exclude interchange of information regarding weather and the health of acquaintances , for she spoke freely upon these subjects , while Noble murmured in response and swallowed a little of the sacred food , but more often swallowed nothing .
Parsing [sent. 4723 len. 45]: Bitterest of all was his thought of what this unexampled seclusion with Julia could have meant to him , were those poisonous violets not at her waist -- for she had put them on again -- and were there no Crum in the South .
Parsing [sent. 4724 len. 36]: Without these fatal obstructions , the present moment would have been to him a bit of what he often thought of as `` dream life '' ; but all its sweetness was a hurt . ''
Parsing [sent. 4725 len. 8]: _ Now _ we 'll talk ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4726 len. 22]: said Julia , when she had brought him back to the library fire again , and they were seated before it .
Parsing [sent. 4727 len. 9]: `` Do n't you want to smoke ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4728 len. 14]: He shook his head dismally , having no heart for what she proposed .
Parsing [sent. 4729 len. 25]: `` Well , then , '' she said briskly , but a little ruefully , `` let 's get to the bottom of things .
Parsing [sent. 4730 len. 18]: Just what did you mean you had ` in black and white ' in your pocket ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4731 len. 28]: Slowly Noble drew forth the historic copy of _ The North End Daily Oriole _ ; and with face averted , placed it in her extended hand .
Parsing [sent. 4732 len. 7]: `` What in the world ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4733 len. 24]: she exclaimed , unfolding it ; and then as its title and statement of ownership came into view , `` Oh , yes !
Parsing [sent. 4734 len. 3]: I see .
Parsing [sent. 4735 len. 13]: Aunt Carrie wrote me that Uncle Joseph had given Herbert a printing-press .
Parsing [sent. 4736 len. 8]: I suppose Herbert 's the editor ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4737 len. 11]: `` And that Rooter boy , '' Noble said sadly .
Parsing [sent. 4738 len. 19]: `` I think maybe your little niece Florence has something to do with it , too . '' ''
Parsing [sent. 4739 len. 8]: ` Something ' to do with it ?
Parsing [sent. 4740 len. 15]: She usually has _ all _ to do with anything she gets hold of !
Parsing [sent. 4741 len. 11]: But what 's it got to do with me ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4742 len. 6]: `` You 'll see ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4743 len. 4]: he prophesied accurately .
Parsing [sent. 4744 len. 33]: She began to read , laughing at some of the items as she went along ; then suddenly she became rigid , holding the small journal before her in a transfixed hand .
Parsing [sent. 4745 len. 4]: `` Oh ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4746 len. 4]: she cried . ''
Parsing [sent. 4747 len. 3]: _ Oh !
Parsing [sent. 4748 len. 17]: _ '' `` That 's -- that 's what -- I meant , '' Noble explained .
Parsing [sent. 4749 len. 6]: Julia 's eyes grew dangerous .
Parsing [sent. 4750 len. 6]: `` The little fiends ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4751 len. 3]: she cried .
Parsing [sent. 4752 len. 21]: `` Oh , really , this is a long-suffering family , but it 's time these outrages were stopped ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4753 len. 4]: She jumped up .
Parsing [sent. 4754 len. 7]: `` Is n't it frightful ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4755 len. 5]: she demanded of Noble .
Parsing [sent. 4756 len. 15]: `` Yes , it is , '' he said , with a dismal fervour .
Parsing [sent. 4757 len. 12]: `` Nobody knows that better than I do , Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4758 len. 8]: `` I mean _ this _ ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4759 len. 15]: she cried , extending the _ Oriole _ toward him with a vigorous gesture .
Parsing [sent. 4760 len. 12]: `` I mean this dreadful story about poor Mr. Crum ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4761 len. 10]: `` But it 's true , '' he said .
Parsing [sent. 4762 len. 5]: `` Noble Dill ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4763 len. 4]: `` Julia ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4764 len. 11]: `` Do you dare to say you believed it ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4765 len. 4]: He sprang up .
Parsing [sent. 4766 len. 7]: `` It is n't true ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4767 len. 7]: `` Not one word of it !
Parsing [sent. 4768 len. 9]: I told you Mr. Crum is only twenty-six .
Parsing [sent. 4769 len. 32]: He has n't been out of college more than three or four years , and it 's the most terrible slander to say he 's ever been married at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4770 len. 9]: Noble dropped back into his chair of misery .
Parsing [sent. 4771 len. 11]: `` I thought you meant it was n't true . ''
Parsing [sent. 4772 len. 28]: `` I 've just told you there is n't one _ word _ of tr -- '' `` But you 're -- engaged , '' Noble gulped .
Parsing [sent. 4773 len. 10]: `` You 're engaged to him , Julia ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4774 len. 7]: She appeared not to hear this .
Parsing [sent. 4775 len. 15]: `` I suppose it _ can _ be lived down , '' she said .
Parsing [sent. 4776 len. 19]: `` To think of Uncle Joseph putting such a thing into the hands of those awful children ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4777 len. 14]: `` But , Julia , you 're eng -- '' `` Noble ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4778 len. 4]: she said sharply .
Parsing [sent. 4779 len. 15]: `` Well , you _ are _ eng -- '' Julia drew herself up .
Parsing [sent. 4780 len. 21]: `` Different people mean different things by that word , '' she said with severity , like an annoyed school-teacher .
Parsing [sent. 4781 len. 45]: `` There are any number of shades of meaning to words ; and if I used the word you mention , in writing home to the family , I may have used a certain shade and they may have thought I intended another . ''
Parsing [sent. 4782 len. 23]: `` But , Julia -- '' `` Mr. Crum is a charming young man , '' she continued with the same primness .
Parsing [sent. 4783 len. 8]: `` I liked him very much indeed .
Parsing [sent. 4784 len. 8]: I liked him very , very much .
Parsing [sent. 4785 len. 18]: I liked him very , _ very _ -- '' `` I understand , '' he interrupted .
Parsing [sent. 4786 len. 11]: `` Do n't say it any more , Julia . ''
Parsing [sent. 4787 len. 8]: `` No ; you do n't understand !
Parsing [sent. 4788 len. 38]: At _ first _ I liked him very much -- in fact , I still do , of course -- I 'm sure he 's one of the best and most attractive young men in the world .
Parsing [sent. 4789 len. 24]: I think he 's a man any girl ought to be happy with , if he were only to be considered by himself .
Parsing [sent. 4790 len. 6]: I do n't deny that .
Parsing [sent. 4791 len. 40]: I liked him very much indeed , and I do n't deny that for several days after he -- after he proposed to me -- I do n't deny I thought something serious _ might _ come of it .
Parsing [sent. 4792 len. 43]: But at that time , Noble , I had n't -- had n't really thought of what it meant to give up living here at home , with all the family and everything -- and friends -- friends like you , Noble .
Parsing [sent. 4793 len. 16]: I had n't thought what it would mean to me to give all this up .
Parsing [sent. 4794 len. 9]: And besides , there was something very important .
Parsing [sent. 4795 len. 34]: At the time I wrote that letter mentioning poor Mr. Crum to the family , Noble , I had n't -- I had n't -- '' She paused , visibly in some distress .
Parsing [sent. 4796 len. 13]: `` I had n't -- '' `` You had n't what ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4797 len. 3]: he cried .
Parsing [sent. 4798 len. 9]: `` I had n't met his mother ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4799 len. 6]: Noble leaped to his feet .
Parsing [sent. 4800 len. 3]: `` Julia !
Parsing [sent. 4801 len. 10]: You are n't -- you are n't engaged ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4802 len. 10]: `` I am not , '' she answered decisively .
Parsing [sent. 4803 len. 17]: `` If I ever was -- in the slightest -- I certainly am not now . ''
Parsing [sent. 4804 len. 5]: Poor Noble was transfigured .
Parsing [sent. 4805 len. 11]: He struggled ; making half-formed gestures , speaking half-made words .
Parsing [sent. 4806 len. 6]: A rapture glowed upon him .
Parsing [sent. 4807 len. 9]: `` Julia -- Julia -- '' He choked .
Parsing [sent. 4808 len. 7]: `` Julia , promise me something .
Parsing [sent. 4809 len. 6]: Will you promise me something ?
Parsing [sent. 4810 len. 9]: Julia , promise to promise me something . ''
Parsing [sent. 4811 len. 9]: `` I will , '' she said quickly .
Parsing [sent. 4812 len. 10]: `` What do you want me to do ? ''
Parsing [sent. 4813 len. 32]: Then he saw that it was his time to speak ; that this was the moment for him to dare everything and ask for the utmost he could hope from her .
Parsing [sent. 4814 len. 7]: `` Give me your word ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4815 len. 7]: he said , still radiantly struggling .
Parsing [sent. 4816 len. 30]: `` Give me your word -- your word -- your word and your sacred promise , Julia -- that you 'll never be engaged to anybody at all ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4817 len. 40]: CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE At six minutes after four o'clock on the second afternoon following Julia 's return , Noble Dill closed his own gate behind him and set forth upon the four-minute walk that would bring him to Julia 's .
Parsing [sent. 4818 len. 26]: He wore a bit of scarlet geranium in the buttonhole of his new light overcoat ; he flourished a new walking-stick and new grey gloves .
Parsing [sent. 4819 len. 12]: As for his expression , he might have been a bridegroom .
Parsing [sent. 4820 len. 28]: Passing the mouth of an alley , as he swung along the street , he was aware of a commotion , of missiles hurled and voices clashed .
Parsing [sent. 4821 len. 16]: In this alley there was a discord : passion and mockery were here inimically intermingled .
Parsing [sent. 4822 len. 76]: Casting _ a _ glance that way , Noble could see but one person ; a boy of fourteen who looked through a crack in a board fence , steadfastly keeping an eye to this aperture and as continuously calling through it , holding his head to a level for this purpose , but at the same time dancing -- and dancing tauntingly , it was conveyed -- with the other parts of his body .
Parsing [sent. 4823 len. 42]: His voice was now sweet , now piercing , and again far too dulcet with the overkindness of burlesque ; and if , as it seemed , he was unburdening his spleen , his spleen was a powerful one and gorged .
Parsing [sent. 4824 len. 45]: He appeared to be in a torment of tormenting ; and his success was proved by the pounding of bricks , parts of bricks and rocks of size upon the other side of the fence , as close to the crack as might be .
Parsing [sent. 4825 len. 6]: `` Oh , dolling ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4826 len. 8]: he wailed , his tone poisonously amorous .
Parsing [sent. 4827 len. 6]: `` Oh , dolling Henery !
Parsing [sent. 4828 len. 15]: Oo 's dot de mos ' booful eyes in a dray bid nasty world .
Parsing [sent. 4829 len. 2]: Henery !
Parsing [sent. 4830 len. 13]: Oh , _ has _ I dot booful eyes , dolling Pattywatty ?
Parsing [sent. 4831 len. 7]: Yes , I _ has _ !
Parsing [sent. 4832 len. 9]: I _ has _ dot pretty eyes ! ''
Parsing [sent. 4833 len. 6]: His voice rose unbearably . ''
Parsing [sent. 4834 len. 10]: _ Oh _ , what prettiest eyes I dot !
Parsing [sent. 4835 len. 5]: Me and Herbie Atwater !
Parsing [sent. 4836 len. 8]: _ Oh _ , my booful eyes !
Parsing [sent. 4837 len. 39]: Oh , my _ booful _ -- '' But even as he reached this apex , the head , shoulders , and arms of Herbert Atwater rose momentarily above the fence across the alley , behind the tormentor .
Parsing [sent. 4838 len. 27]: Herbert 's expression was implacably resentful , and so was the gesture with which he hurled an object at the comedian preoccupied with the opposite fence .
Parsing [sent. 4839 len. 31]: This object , upon reaching its goal , as it did more with a splash than a thud , was revealed as a tomato , presumably in a useless state .
Parsing [sent. 4840 len. 21]: The taunter screamed in astonishment , and after looking vainly for an assailant , began necessarily to remove his coat .
Parsing [sent. 4841 len. 45]: Noble , passing on , thought he recognized the boy as one of the Torbin family , but he was not sure , and he had no idea that the episode was in any possible manner to be connected with his own recent history .
Parsing [sent. 4842 len. 7]: How blindly we walk our ways !
Parsing [sent. 4843 len. 27]: As Noble flourished down the street , there appeared a wan face at a prison window ; and the large eyes looked out upon him wistfully .
Parsing [sent. 4844 len. 27]: But Noble went on , as unwitting that he had to do with this prison as that he had to do with Master Torbin 's tomato .
Parsing [sent. 4845 len. 36]: The face at the window was not like Charlotte Corday 's , nor was the window barred , though the prisoner knew a little solace in wondering if she did not suggest that famous picture .
Parsing [sent. 4846 len. 27]: For all purposes , except during school hours , the room was certainly a cell ; and the term of imprisonment was set at three days .
Parsing [sent. 4847 len. 27]: Uncle Joseph had been unable to remain at the movies forever : people do have to go home eventually , especially when accompanied by thirteen-year-old great-nieces .
Parsing [sent. 4848 len. 27]: Florence had finally to face the question awaiting her ; and it would have been better for her had she used less imagination in her replies .
Parsing [sent. 4849 len. 17]: Yet she was not wholly despondent as her eyes followed the disappearing figure of Noble Dill .
Parsing [sent. 4850 len. 38]: His wholesome sprightliness was visible at any distance ; and who would not take a little pride in having been even the mistaken instrument of saving so gay a young man from the loss of his reason ?
Parsing [sent. 4851 len. 8]: No ; Florence was not cast down .
Parsing [sent. 4852 len. 24]: Day-after-to-morrow she would taste Freedom again , and her profoundest regret was that after all her Aunt Julia was not to be married .
Parsing [sent. 4853 len. 18]: Florence had made definite plans for the wedding , especially for the principal figure at the ceremony .
Parsing [sent. 4854 len. 39]: This figure , as Florence saw things , would have been that of the `` Flower Girl , '' naturally a niece of the bride ; but she was able to dismiss the bright dream with some philosophy .
Parsing [sent. 4855 len. 16]: And to console her for everything , had she not a star in her soul ?
Parsing [sent. 4856 len. 15]: Had she not discovered that she could write poetry whenever she felt like it ?
Parsing [sent. 4857 len. 17]: Noble passed from her sight , but nevertheless continued his radiant progress down Julia 's Street .
Parsing [sent. 4858 len. 12]: Life stretched before him , serene , ineffably fragrant , unending .
Parsing [sent. 4859 len. 24]: He saw it as a flower-strewn sequence of calls upon Julia , walks with Julia , talks with Julia by the library fire .
Parsing [sent. 4860 len. 24]: Old Mr. Atwater was to be away four days longer , and Julia , that great-hearted bride-not-to-be , had given him her promise .
Parsing [sent. 4861 len. 29]: Blushing , indeed divinely , she had promised him upon her sacred word , never so long as she lived , to be engaged to anybody at all .
